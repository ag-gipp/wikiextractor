Political history of medieval Karnataka

The political history of medieval Karnataka spans the 4th to the 16th centuries, when the empires that evolved in the <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> region of <a href="India">India</a> made a lasting impact on the subcontinent. Before this, alien empires held sway over the region, and the nucleus of power was outside modern Karnataka. The medieval era can be broadly divided into several periods: The earliest native kingdoms and imperialism; the successful domination of the Gangetic plains in northern India and rivalry with the empires of <a href="Ancient%20Tamil%20country">Tamilakam</a> over the <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a> region; and the domination of the southern Deccan and consolidation against Muslim invasion. The origins of the rise of the Karnataka region as an independent power date back to the fourth-century birth of the <a href="Kadamba%20Dynasty">Kadamba Dynasty</a> of <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a>, the earliest of the native rulers to conduct administration in the native language of <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> in addition to the official <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. This is the historical starting point in studying the development of the region as an enduring geopolitical entity and of Kannada as an important regional language.

In the southern regions of Karnataka, the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Western Gangas</a> of <a href="Talakad">Talakad</a> were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas were followed by the imperial dynasties of the <a href="Badami%20Chalukya%20Empire">Badami Chalukya Empire</a>, the <a href="Rashtrakuta%20Empire">Rashtrakuta Empire</a>, the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukya Empire</a>, the <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala Empire</a> and the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>, all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from the west of the subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the <a href="Bahamani%20Sultanate">Bahamani Sultanate</a> of <a href="Bidar">Bidar</a> and the <a href="Bijapur%20Sultanate">Bijapur Sultanate</a> from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy in an age dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.

Prior to and during the early centuries of the first millennium, large areas of the Karnataka region was ruled by such imperial powers as the <a href="Mauryas">Mauryas</a> of Maghada and later the <a href="Satavahanas">Satavahanas</a>, empires whose centres of power were in the Gangetic plains and Central India respectively. With the weakening of the Satavahanas, the Pallavas of Kanchi took control for a brief duration. In the 4th century, the rise to power of the <a href="Kadamba%20Dynasty">Kadamba Dynasty</a> of <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a> identified the Karnataka region as an independent political entity and Kannada as an administrative language from the middle of the 5th century. The Kadambas were natives of the <a href="Talagunda">Talagunda</a> region (in modern <a href="Shivamogga%20district">Shivamogga district</a>) as proven by inscriptions. <a href="Mayurasharma">Mayurasharma</a>, a Brahmin native of Talagunda who was humiliated by a <a href="Pallava">Pallava</a> guard, rose in rage against the Pallava control of the Banavasi region and declared his independence in 345. After many wars, the Pallava king had to accept the sovereignty of the Kadambas and Mayurasharma, the founding king, crowned himself at Banavasi (in the present day <a href="Uttara%20Kannada">Uttara Kannada</a> district).

The fact that the Kadambas cultivated marital ties with the imperial <a href="Vakatakas">Vakatakas</a> and <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Gupta</a> dynasties attests to their power. <a href="Kakusthavarma">Kakusthavarma</a>, the most powerful ruler of the dynasty whom inscriptions describe as "ornament of the Kadamba family" and "Sun among the kings of wide spread flame", gave one daughter in marriage to Vakataka Narendrasena and another to <a href="Skandagupta">Skandagupta</a>, grandson of <a href="Chandragupta%20II">Chandragupta II</a> of the Gupta dynasty. Historians trace their rise to political power through the examination of the contemporaneous Sanskrit writing, "Aichitya Vichara Charcha" by <a href="Kshemendra">Kshemendra</a>, which quotes portions of a writing "Kunthalesvara Dautya" by the famous poet <a href="Kalidasa">Kalidasa</a>. Here Kalidasa describes his visit to the Kadamba kingdom as an ambassador where he was not offered a seat in the court of the Kadamba king and had to sit on the ground. Historians view this act as one of assertion by the Kadambas who considered themselves equal to the imperial Gupta dynasty.

Family feuds and conflicts ended the Kadamba rule in the middle of the 6th century when the last Kadamba ruler Krishna Varma II was subdued by <a href="Pulakeshin%20I">Pulakeshin I</a> of the Chalukya feudatory, ending their sovereign rule. The Kadambas would continue to rule parts of Karnataka and Goa for many centuries to come but never again as an independent kingdom. Some historians view the Kadambas as the originators of the Karnataka architectural tradition although there were elements in common with the structures built by the contemporaneous Pallavas of Kanchi. The oldest surviving Kadamba structure is one dating to the late 5th century in <a href="Halsi">Halsi</a> in modern <a href="Belgaum%20district">Belgaum district</a>. The most prominent feature of their architectural style, one that remained popular centuries later and was used by the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar kings, is the "Kadamba Shikara" (Kadamba tower) with a "Kalasa" (pot) on top.

The <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Western Ganga Dynasty</a>, contemporaries of the Kadambas, came to power from <a href="Kolar">Kolar</a> but in the late 4th century - early 5th century moved their capital to <a href="Talakad">Talakad</a> in modern <a href="Mysore%20district">Mysore district</a>. They ruled the region historically known as Gangavadi comprising most of the modern southern districts of Karnataka. Acting as a buffer state between the <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> kingdoms of Karnataka region and the Tamil kingdoms of <a href="Ancient%20Tamil%20country">Tamilakam</a>, the Western Ganga architectural innovations show mixed influences. Their sovereign rule ended around the same time as the Kadambas when they came under the Badami Chalukya control. The Western Gangas continued to rule as a feudatory till the beginning of the eleventh century when they were defeated by the <a href="Cholas">Cholas</a> of <a href="Tanjavur">Tanjavur</a>. Important figures among the Gangas were King <a href="Durvinita">Durvinita</a> and <a href="Shivamara%20II">Shivamara II</a>, admired as able warriors and scholars, and minister <a href="Chavundaraya">Chavundaraya</a> who was a builder, a warrior and a writer in Kannada and Sanskrit. The most important architectural contributions of these Gangas are the monuments and <a href="basadi">basadi</a>s of <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a>, the <a href="monolith">monolith</a> of <a href="Gomateshwara">Gomateshwara</a> termed as the mightiest achievement in the field of sculpture in ancient Karnataka and the "Panchakuta" basadi ( five towers) at <a href="Kambadahalli">Kambadahalli</a>. Their free standing pillars (called "Mahasthambhas" and "Brahmasthambhas") and <a href="Hero%20stone">Hero stone</a>s ("virgal") with sculptural detail are also considered a unique contribution.

The <a href="Chalukya%20dynasty">Chalukya dynasty</a>, natives of the <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a> and <a href="Badami">Badami</a> region in Karnataka, were at first a feudatory of the Kadambas.

These victories earned him the title "Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy" (lord of the south). Pulakeshin II continued his conquests in the east where he conquered all kingdoms in his way and reached the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> in present-day Orissa. A Chalukya viceroyalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (coastal Andhra) and princes from the Badami family were dispatched to rule them. Having subdued the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, he accepted tributes from the <a href="Pandyas">Pandyas</a> of <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a>, <a href="Chola%20dynasty">Chola dynasty</a> and <a href="Chera%20dynasty">Chera</a>s of the Kerala region. Pulakeshin II thus became the master of India, south of the Narmada River. Pulakeshin II is widely regarded as one of the great kings in Indian history. <a href="Hiuen-Tsiang">Hiuen-Tsiang</a>, a <a href="China">Chinese</a> traveller visited the court of Pulakeshin II at this time and <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persian</a> emperor <a href="Khosrau%20II">Khosrau II</a> exchanged ambassadors. However, the continuous wars with <a href="Pallavas">Pallavas</a> took a turn for the worse in 642 when the Pallava king <a href="Narasimhavarman%20I">Narasimhavarman I</a> avenged his father's defeat, conquered and plundered the <a href="Vatapi">capital of Pulakeshin II</a> who may have died in battle. A century later, Chalukya <a href="Vikramaditya%20II">Vikramaditya II</a> marched victoriously into <a href="Kanchipuram">Kanchipuram</a>, the Pallava capital and occupied it on three occasions, the third time under the leadership of his son and crown prince Kirtivarman II. He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple. He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, Cholas and Keralas in addition to subduing a <a href="Kalabhra">Kalabhra</a> ruler.

The <a href="Kappe%20Arabhatta">Kappe Arabhatta</a> record from this period (700) in "tripadi" (three line) metre is considered the earliest available record in Kannada poetics. The most enduring legacy of the Chalukya dynasty is the architecture and art that they left behind. More than one hundred and fifty monuments attributed to them, built between 450 and 700, have survived in the <a href="Malaprabha">Malaprabha</a> basin in Karnataka. The constructions are centred in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland. The structural temples at <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a>, a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, the cave temples of <a href="Badami">Badami</a>, the temples at <a href="Mahakuta%20group%20of%20temples">Mahakuta</a> and early experiments in temple building at <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a> are their most celebrated monuments. Two of the famous paintings at <a href="Ajanta%20Caves">Ajanta</a> cave no. 1, "The Temptation of the Buddha" and "The Persian Embassy" are also credited to them.

In the middle of the 8th century the Chalukya rule was ended by their feudatory, the Rashtrakuta family rulers of <a href="Berar%20Sultanate">Berar</a> (in present-day <a href="Amravati%20district">Amravati district</a> of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>). Sensing an opportunity during a weak period in the Chalukya rule, <a href="Dantidurga">Dantidurga</a> trounced the great Chalukyan "Karnatabala" (power of Karnata). Having overthrown the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas made <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> their capital (modern Malkhed in <a href="Gulbarga%20district">Gulbarga district</a>). Although the origins of the early Rashtrakuta ruling families in central India and the Deccan in the 6th and 7th centuries is controversial, during the eighth through the tenth centuries they emphasised the importance of the Kannada language in conjunction with Sanskrit in their administration. Rashtrakuta inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit only. They encouraged literature in both languages and thus literature flowered under their rule.
The Rashtrakutas quickly became the most powerful Deccan empire, making their initial successful forays into the <a href="doab">doab</a> region of <a href="Ganges%20River">Ganges River</a> and <a href="Yamuna">Jamuna River</a> during the rule of <a href="Dhruva%20Dharavarsha">Dhruva Dharavarsha</a>. The rule of his son <a href="Govinda%20III">Govinda III</a> signaled a new era with Rashtrakuta victories against the <a href="Pala%20Dynasty">Pala Dynasty</a> of <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> and Gurjara <a href="Pratihara">Pratihara</a> of north western India resulting in the capture of <a href="Kannauj">Kannauj</a>. The Rashtrakutas held Kannauj intermittently during a period of a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich <a href="Gangetic%20plains">Gangetic plains</a>. Because of Govinda III's victories, historians have compared him to <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a> <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a> of the Hindu epic <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>.
The Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank the icy water of the Himalayan stream and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges River. <a href="Amoghavarsha%20I">Amoghavarsha I</a>, eulogised by contemporary Arab traveller Sulaiman as one among the four great emperors of the world, succeeded Govinda III to the throne and ruled during an important cultural period that produced landmark writings in Kannada and Sanskrit. The benevolent development of Jain religion was a hallmark of his rule. Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, he has been compared to emperor <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a>. The rule of <a href="Indra%20III">Indra III</a> in the tenth century enhanced the Rashtrakuta position as an imperial power as they conquered and held Kannauj again. <a href="Krishna%20III">Krishna III</a> followed Indra III to the throne in 939. A patron of Kannada literature and a powerful warrior, his reign marked the submission of the <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> of <a href="Ujjain">Ujjain</a> in the north and Cholas in the south.

An Arabic writing "Silsilatuttavarikh" (851) called the Rashtrakutas one among the four principle empires of the world. "Kitab-ul-Masalik-ul-Mumalik" (912) called them the "greatest kings of India" and there were many other contemporaneous books written in their praise. The Rashtrakuta empire at its peak spread from <a href="Cape%20Comorin">Cape Comorin</a> in the south to Kannauj in the north and from <a href="Banaras">Banaras</a> in the east to Broach (Bharuch) in the west.
While the Rashtrakutas built many fine monuments in the Deccan, the most extensive and sumptuous of their work is the monolithic Kailasanatha temple at <a href="Ellora">Ellora</a>, the temple being a splendid achievement. In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal. All of the monuments are designated <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Sites">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a>.

In the late 10th century, the <a href="Western%20Chalukya%20Empire">Western Chalukyas</a>, also known as the Kalyani Chalukyas or 'Later' Chalukyas rose to power by overthrowing the Rashtrakutas under whom they had been serving as feudatories. <a href="Manyakheta">Manyakheta</a> was their capital early on before they moved it to Kalyani (modern <a href="Basavakalyan">Basavakalyan</a>). Whether the kings of this empire belonged to the same family line as their namesakes, the <a href="Badami%20Chalukyas">Badami Chalukyas</a> is still debated. Whatever the Western Chalukya origins, Kannada remained their language of administration and the Kannada and Sanskrit literature of their time was prolific. <a href="Tailapa%20II">Tailapa II</a>, a feudatory ruler from Tardavadi (modern <a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur district</a>), re-established the Chalukya rule by defeating the Rashtrakutas during the reign of <a href="Karka%20II">Karka II</a>. He timed his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused by the invading <a href="Paramara">Paramara</a> of Central India to the Rashtrakutas capital in 973. This era produced prolonged warfare with the Chola dynasty of <a href="Tamilakam">Tamilakam</a> for control of the resources of the <a href="Godavari%20River">Godavari River</a>-<a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna River</a> doab region in <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a>. <a href="Someshvara%20I">Someshvara I</a>, a brave Chalukyan king, successfully curtailed the growth of the Chola Empire to the south of the <a href="Tungabhadra%20River">Tungabhadra River</a> region despite suffering some defeats while maintaining control over his feudatories in the Konkan, Gujarat, Malwa and <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20region%29">Kalinga</a> regions. For approximately 100 years, beginning in the early 11th century, the Cholas occupied large areas of South Karnataka region (Gangavadi).

In 1076, the ascent of the most famous king of this Chalukya family, <a href="Vikramaditya%20VI">Vikramaditya VI</a>, changed the balance of power in favour of the Chalukyas. His fifty-year reign was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to as the "Chalukya Vikrama era". His victories over the Cholas in the late 11th and early 12th centuries put an end to the Chola influence in the Vengi region permanently. Some of the well-known contemporaneous feudatory families of the Deccan under Chalukya control were the Hoysalas, the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri</a>, the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya dynasty</a> and the Southern Kalachuri. At their peak, the Western Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the <a href="Narmada%20River">Narmada River</a> in the north to the <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri River</a> in the south. Vikramaditya VI is considered one of the most influential kings of Indian history. Important architectural works were created by these Chalukyas, especially in the Tungabhadra river valley, that served as a conceptual link between the building idioms of the early Badami Chalukyas and the later Hoysalas. With the weakening of the Chalukyas in the decades following the death of Vikramaditya VI in 1126, the feudatories of the Chalukyas gained their independence.

The <a href="Kalachuris%20of%20Karnataka">Kalachuris of Karnataka</a>, whose ancestors were immigrants into the southern deccan from central India, had ruled as a feudatory from Mangalavada (modern Mangalavedhe in Maharashtra). <a href="Bijjala%20II">Bijjala II</a>, the most powerful ruler of this dynasty, was a commander ("mahamandaleswar") during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI. Seizing an opportune moment in the waning power of the Chalukyas, Bijjala II declared independence in 1157 and annexed their capital <a href="Basavakalyana">Kalyani</a>. His rule was cut short by his assassination in 1167 and the ensuing civil war caused by his sons fighting over the throne ended the dynasty as the last Chalukya scion regained control of Kalyani. This victory however, was short-lived as the Chalukyas were eventually driven out by the Seuna Yadavas.

The Hoysalas had become a powerful force even during their rule from <a href="Belur%2C%20Karnataka">Belur</a> in the 11th century as a feudatory of the Chalukyas (in the south Karnataka region). In the early 12th century they successfully fought the Cholas in the south, convincingly defeating them in the battle of <a href="Talakad">Talakad</a> and moved their capital to nearby <a href="Halebidu">Halebidu</a>. Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of <a href="Malnad">Malnad</a> Karnataka, based on the numerous inscriptions calling them "Maleparolganda" or "Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs" ("Malepas"). With the waning of the Western Chalukya power, the Hoysalas declared their independence in the late twelfth century.

During this period of Hoysala control, distinctive Kannada literary metres such as "Ragale" (blank verse), "Sangatya" (meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), "Shatpadi" (seven line) etc. became widely accepted. The Hoysalas expanded the <a href="Vesara">Vesara</a> architecture stemming from the Chalukyas, culminating in the Hoysala architectural articulation and style as exemplified in the construction of the <a href="Chennakesava%20Temple">Chennakeshava Temple</a> at Belur and the <a href="Hoysaleswara%20temple">Hoysaleshwara Temple</a> at Halebidu. Both these temples were built in commemoration of the victories of the Hoysala <a href="Vishnuvardhana">Vishnuvardhana</a> against the Cholas in 1116. <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20II">Veera Ballala II</a>, the most effective of the Hoysala rulers, defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom and assumed the titles "Establisher of the Chola Kingdom"
("Cholarajyapratishtacharya"), "Emperor of the south" ("Dakshina Chakravarthi") and "Hoysala emperor" ("Hoysala Chakravarthi"). The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near <a href="Srirangam">Srirangam</a> a provincial capital. This gave them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan.

In the early 13th century, with the Hoysala power remaining unchallenged, the first of the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> incursions into <a href="South%20India">South India</a> began. After over two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the Hoysala ruler at the time, <a href="Veera%20Ballala%20III">Veera Ballala III</a>, died in the battle of <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a> in 1343. This resulted in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by <a href="Harihara%20I">Harihara I</a>, founder of the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>, located in the <a href="Tungabhadra">Tungabhadra</a> region in present-day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> as its capital.

The Vijayanagara Empire quickly rose to imperial status as early as the late 14th century. During the reign of <a href="Bukka%20Raya%20I">Bukka Raya I</a>, the island of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Lanka</a> paid tributes and ambassadors were exchanged with the <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> of China. The empire's most famous rulers were <a href="Deva%20Raya%20II">Deva Raya II</a> and the <a href="Tuluva">Tuluva</a> king <a href="Krishnadevaraya">Krishnadevaraya</a>. Deva Raya II (known as "Gajabetekara" or hunter of elephants) ascended the throne in 1424 and was the most effective of the <a href="Sangama%20Dynasty">Sangama dynasty</a> rulers. He quelled rebelling feudal lords, the Zamorin of <a href="Kozhikode">Calicut</a> and the <a href="Kollam">Quilon</a> in the south, and invaded the island of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Lanka</a> while becoming overlord of the kings of <a href="Burma">Burma</a> at Pegu and Tanasserim. After a brief decline, the empire reached its peak in the early 16th century during the rule of <a href="Krishnadevaraya">Krishnadevaraya</a> when the Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south.

Many important monuments at <a href="Hampi">Hampi</a> were either completed or commissioned during the reign of Krishnadevaraya. The enduring legacy of this empire is the vast open-air theatre of monuments at the regal capital, <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a>, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. <a href="Vijayanagara%20Architecture">Vijayanagara architecture</a> is a vibrant blend of the preceding Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles. Literature in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Sanskrit languages found royal patronage. Telugu attained its height in popularity and reached its peak under Krishnadevaraya. The Kannada <a href="Haridasa">Haridasa</a> movement contributed greatly to <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a> and fostered a strong Hindu sentiment across South India. With the defeat of the Vijayanagara Empire in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talikota">Battle of Talikota</a> in 1565 by the Deccan sultanates, the Karnataka region and South India in general became fragmented and subsumed under the rule of various former feudatories of the empire. A diminished Vijayanagara Empire moved its capital to Penukonda in modern Andhra Pradesh and later to <a href="Chandragiri">Chandragiri</a> and <a href="Vellore">Vellore</a> before disintegrating. In the south and coastal Karnataka region, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Kingdom of Mysore</a> and the <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi Nayaka</a> of Shimoga held sway while the northern regions were under the control of the Bijapur Sultanate. The Nayaka kingdom lasted into the 18th century before merging with the Kingdom of Mysore which remained a princely state until Indian independence in 1947, though they came under the British Raj (rule) in 1799 following the defeat and death of the last independent Mysore king, Tipu Sultan.

The <a href="Bahmani%20Sultanate">Bahmani Sultanate</a>, a contemporary of the Vijayanagara Empire, was founded in 1347 by Alla-ud-din-Hasan, a breakaway commander of the armies of the northern invaders led by <a href="Muhammad%20bin%20Tughluq">Mohammed-bin-Tughlaq</a>. The capital was <a href="Gulbarga">Gulbarga</a> but was later moved further north to <a href="Bidar">Bidar</a> in 1430. The first of the Muslim invasions of the Deccan came in the early decades of the 14th century. At its peak, the Bahamani kingdom extended from the <a href="Krishna%20River">Krishna River</a> in the south to <a href="Penganga%20River">Penganga River</a> in the north, thus covering the regions of northern parts of modern Karnataka, parts of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> and <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. The most famous of the Bahamani Kings was Firuz Shah (also known as Taj Ud Din Firuz), who ruled from 1397 to 1422. Militarily, the rule of Firuz Shah had uneven success against the Vijayanagara kings while he was more convincingly successful against the Kherla rulers of <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> and the Vema Reddies of <a href="Rajamundry">Rajamundry</a>, areas that he annexed in 1417. His last encounter with the Vijayanagara armies in 1417 was disastrous and led to his defeat, ill health and ultimate death in 1422.

Contemporary writers such as Tabataba, in his writings have heaped praise on Firuz Shah. Tabataba wrote of the king as, "[a]n impetuous, mighty monarch who patronised learned men, Sheiks and hermits", while Shirazi described him as "a just, pious and generous king and one without equal". He has earned the honorific "Sultan-i-ghazian" for his bravery, tolerant nature and patronage of the fine arts. In the opinion of one historian, Firuz Shah was one of the most notable Sultans to rule in India. Another well-known figure from this kingdom was Kwaja Mahamud Gavan, the prime minister, who served under several kings and regents. He rose above the kings and princess of the dynasty by virtue of his ministerial, administrative, martial, literary and philanthropic abilities. A Persian by descent and a visitor to Bidar in 1445, he impressed the ruling Sultan Alla-ud-din II and was chosen to become a minister in his court. As a commander he was able to extend the kingdom from <a href="Hubli">Hubli</a> in the south to Goa in the west and Kondavidu and Rajamahendri in the east. He soon rose to the position of prime minister ("Vakil-Us-Sultanat").

The Bahamanis introduced the large-scale use of paper in administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style, designed and constructed by Persian architects and artisans, (also known as "Deccani" architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka. The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example). Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal are some of the palaces built by them that have retained their beauty. The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor, and the school of learning ("madrasa") built by Gavan in Bidar (1472), with its lecture halls, library, mosque and residential houses are also famous. In the later part of the 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the "Pardeshi" Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances in 1481, and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom eventually bringing about its end in 1527.

The <a href="Bijapur%20Sultanate">Bijapur Sultanate</a> (or Adilshahi Kingdom) emerged towards the end of the 15th century with the weakening of the Bahmani Sultanate . The main sources of information about this kingdom comes from contemporaneous inscriptions and writings in Persian and Kannada, travelogues of European visitors to the Deccan and inscriptions of neighbouring kingdoms. In 1489, Yusuf Adilkhan, a <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> general in the Bahmani army, broke away to found the kingdom from modern Bijapur . Throughout his rule, the Sultanate was at war with the Vijayanagara Empire over the strategic <a href="Raichur">Raichur</a> doab, with the Portuguese over <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, with the Barid Shahis of Bidar and later with the erstwhile feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire who had gained independence after 1565. The <a href="Italy">Italian</a> writer Varathema wrote about the founder Adilkhan and Bijapur, "A powerful and prosperous king", "the city was encircled by many fortifications and contained beautiful and majestic buildings".

Inter-Sultanate marriages normalised relations and Ali I (1557–1580) joined a confederacy of Sultanates who eventually inflicted a crushing defeat on the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565. The most notable ruler of the dynasty was Ibrahim II (1580–1626) who ascended the throne as a nine-year-old with Chandbibi, the king's aunt acting as the regent. Later when Ibrahim II was defeated by the first of the Moghul incursions into the Deccan, he gave his daughter in marriage to Daniyal, a son of Emperor <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a>, but managed to collect tributes from the former feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to a historian, the rule of Ibrahim II was the high point of the Bijapur Sultanate. A tolerant king inclined to the fine arts, the earliest book on music in Urdu language called "Kitab-e-Nauras" is ascribed to him. The opening song in the book is an invocation of the Hindu Goddess <a href="Saraswati">Saraswati</a>. During the rule of his son Muhammad, Shahji Bhosle from <a href="Ahmadnagar">Ahmadnagar</a> joined the Bijapur army and along with commander Ranadullah Khan conducted many successful campaigns in the southern Deccan collecting tribute from local rulers there. The final end of the diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from <a href="Vellore">Vellore</a> came during these campaigns.

However, the rise of <a href="Maratha%20empire">Maratha</a> <a href="Shivaji">Shivaji</a> and constant invasions by the <a href="Mughal%20%28tribe%29">Mughals</a> from the north took its toll on the kingdom, eventually bringing it to an end in the later part of the 17th century. The contributions of the Bijapur Sultanate in the Indo-Saracenic idiom to the architectural landscape of Karnataka is noteworthy. Their most famous monuments are the mausoleums called Ibrahim Rauza and the <a href="Gol%20Gumbaz">Gol Gumbaz</a> apart from many other palaces and mosques. The elegance, finish and beauty of Mehtar Mahal is claimed by a historian to be equal to anything in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. Their Kali Masjid at <a href="Lakshmeshwar">Lakshmeshwar</a> is a synthesis of Hindu and Muslim styles. The Ibrahim Rauza built by Ibrahim II is a combination of a mausoleum and a mosque and is called the "<a href="Taj%20Mahal">Taj Mahal</a> of the Deccan". The <a href="Gol%20Gumbaz">Gol Gumbaz</a> built by Muhammad is the largest dome in India and the second largest pre-modern dome in the world after the Byzantine <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> with an impressive "whispering gallery". Some historians consider this one of the architectural marvels of the world. Persian language was given state patronage while the use of the local languages, Kannada and Marathi was popularised in local affairs.

The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talikota">Battle of Talikota</a> started a slow disintegration of the Kannada speaking region into many short-lived "palegar" chiefdoms, and the better known <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">Kingdom of Mysore</a> and the kingdom of <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi Nayaka</a>s, which were to later become important centres of Kannada literary production. These kingdoms and the Nayakas ("chiefs") of Tamil country continued to owe nominal support to a diminished Vijayanagara Empire ruling from <a href="Penukonda">Penukonda</a> (1570) and later from <a href="Chandragiri">Chandragiri</a> (1586) in modern <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, followed by a brief period of independence. By the mid-17th century, large areas in north Karnataka came under the control of the <a href="Bijapur%20Sultanate">Bijapur Sultanate</a> who waged several wars in a bid to establish a hegemony over the southern Deccan. The defeat of the Bijapur Sultanate at the hands of the <a href="Mughals">Mughals</a> in late 17th century added a new dimension to the prevailing confusion. The constant wars of the local kingdoms with the two new rivals, the Mughals and the <a href="Marathas">Marathas</a>, and among themselves, caused further instability in the region. Major areas of Karnataka came under the rule of the Mughals and the Marathas. Under <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Hyder Ali</a> and his son <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>, the Mysore Kingdom reached its zenith of power but had to face the growing English might who by now had a firm foothold in the subcontinent. After the death of Tipu Sultan in 1799 in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war, the Mysore Kingdom came under the British umbrella. More than a century later, with the dawn of India as an independent nation in 1947, the <a href="Unification%20of%20Karnataka">unification of Kannada speaking regions</a> as modern Karnataka state brought four centuries of political uncertainty (and centuries of foreign rule) to an end.

Susi Kentikian

Susianna "Susi" Levonovna Kentikian (; born Syuzanna Kentikyan on 11 September 1987) is an <a href="Armenians%20in%20Germany">Armenian-German</a> <a href="professional%20boxer">professional boxer</a>. She was born in <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>, <a href="Armenian%20SSR">Armenian SSR</a>, but left the country with her family at the age of five because of the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a>. Kentikian has lived in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> since 1996 and began boxing at the age of twelve. Following a successful <a href="amateur%20boxing">amateur</a> career, she turned professional in 2005 upon signing with the Hamburg-based Spotlight Boxing promotion.

Kentikian is a two-time <a href="flyweight">flyweight</a> world champion, having held the <a href="World%20Boxing%20Association">World Boxing Association</a> (WBA) female title from 2007 to 2012, and from 2013 to 2017. Additionally, she was the <a href="World%20Boxing%20Organization">World Boxing Organization</a> (WBO) flyweight champion from 2009 to 2012, and held the <a href="Women%27s%20International%20Boxing%20Federation">Women's International Boxing Federation</a> (WIBF) title from 2007 to 2012 and 2015 to 2017.

Until 2012, Kentikian remained undefeated as a professional, winning 16 of her first 30 fights by <a href="knockout">knockout</a> or <a href="technical%20knockout">stoppage</a>. The German television station <a href="ZDF">ZDF</a> has broadcast her fights since July 2009. She had previously headlined fight cards for the television station <a href="ProSieben">ProSieben</a> from 2007 to 2009. Kentikian has gained minor celebrity status in Germany and she hopes to reach a popularity similar to that of the retired German female boxing star <a href="Regina%20Halmich">Regina Halmich</a>.

Susianna Kentikian was born in <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>, <a href="Armenian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Armenian SSR</a>, the daughter of veterinary doctor Levon Kentikian and his wife Makruhi. At the age of five, she left Armenia with her parents and her nine-year-old brother, Mikael, because her father was called up to serve in the military during the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Nagorno-Karabakh War</a>. In 1992, the family first moved to Berlin, Germany and stayed at <a href="asylum%20seeker">asylum seeker</a>s' homes. However, due to the violence at these facilities and their poor knowledge of the German language, they left Berlin and moved to <a href="Moldova">Moldova</a> and later to Russia, where Kentikian went to school for a short period of time. The family returned to Germany in 1996 and relocated in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, again living in government facilities for asylum seekers. Kentikian's residence status remained uncertain for almost a decade. Several times, she and her family were taken to the airport for deportation, but the intervention of local friends such as her amateur trainer, Frank Rieth, who called lawyers, the media and local politicians, prevented their final expulsion. Her family received a permanent residence permit in 2005 when she signed a three-year professional boxing contract that established a stable income.

At the age of 16, Kentikian began working as a cleaner in a local <a href="fitness%20center">fitness center</a> to help her family financially. She graduated from high school ("<a href="Realschule">Realschule</a>") in the summer of 2006 and she eventually became a <a href="German%20citizen">German citizen</a> in June 2008. She applied for dispensation to be allowed to retain her Armenian citizenship. Kentikian lived with her family in an apartment near her Hamburg boxing gym.

Kentikian discovered her enthusiasm for boxing when she was twelve years old after accompanying her brother to his <a href="boxing%20training">boxing training</a>. She started with regular training herself and stated that boxing had allowed her to forget the difficulties of her life for a short time: "I could let everything out, my whole energy. If you have so many problems like our family, you need something like that."

Kentikian won the Hamburg Championships for juniors from 2001 to 2004. She also won the Northern German Championships for juniors in 2003 and 2004, and in October 2004, she had her biggest amateur success by winning the International German Women's Amateur Championships in the <a href="featherweight">featherweight</a> division for juniors. Kentikian found it increasingly difficult to find opponents in the amateur ranks, as few boxers wanted to face her, and her status as an asylum seeker did not allow her to box outside Hamburg. Kentikian's final amateur record stood at 24 wins and one loss. She later blamed overeagerness for her single loss, having fought despite health problems at the time. Her aggressive style and fast <a href="Striking%20combination">combinations</a>, and her ambition to always attack until she knocked out the opponent earned her the nickname "Killer Queen"; she has often used the <a href="Killer%20Queen">identically-named song</a> by the English rock band <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> as her entrance music.

Kentikian was discovered as a professional boxer at an exhibition fight during qualifications for the <a href="World%20Amateur%20Boxing%20Championships">World Amateur Boxing Championships</a>. At the beginning of 2005, she signed a three-year contract with the Hamburg boxing promoter Spotlight Boxing, a joint venture of Universum Box-Promotion, focusing on young athletes. In future years, she was coached by Universum trainer Magomed Schaburow. Kentikian started her professional career on 15 January 2005, with a win by <a href="unanimous%20decision">unanimous decision</a> over Iliana Boneva of <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> on the <a href="undercard">undercard</a> of German female boxing star <a href="Regina%20Halmich">Regina Halmich</a>. Over the next 14 months, Kentikian won nine of her eleven fights by knockout. Her unusually high knockout percentage, rarely seen in lower female weight classes, began to draw attention. On 25 July 2006, she won her first belt, the International German flyweight title, against Daniela Graf by unanimous decision. In her first international title fight on 9 September 2006, Kentikian beat <a href="Maribel%20Zurita">Maribel Zurita</a> from the United States with a fourth round <a href="technical%20knockout">technical knockout</a> for the <a href="Women%27s%20International%20Boxing%20Federation">WIBF</a> InterContinental <a href="Flyweight">Flyweight</a> title; the fight was stopped when Zurita was cut over the left eyebrow.

In her 15th professional bout, Kentikian fought for her first world championship in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Germany, on 16 February 2007; it was also her first time headlining a <a href="fight%20card">fight card</a>. She won by a ninth-round technical knockout against Carolina Alvarez of <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, thereby winning the vacant <a href="World%20Boxing%20Association">WBA</a> Flyweight title. Alvarez took unanswered punches in most of the rounds and was bleeding heavily from her nose, and the referee eventually stopped the fight in round nine in concern for Alvarez's health. Six weeks later, on 30 March 2007, Kentikian made her first title defense. Before a crowd of 19,500 in the <a href="K%C3%B6lnarena">Kölnarena</a>, she fought on the undercard of an exhibition bout between German comedian <a href="Stefan%20Raab">Stefan Raab</a> and WIBF World Champion Halmich. Kentikian beat María José Núñez from <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> with a third-round technical knockout. Núñez was knocked down in round two and Kentikian finished the fight one round later with a right <a href="Cross%20%28boxing%29">cross</a> followed up by combinations that left Núñez defenseless on the ropes, causing the referee to step in.

Kentikian next faced Nadia Hokmi of France on 25 May 2007, in her second title defense. Hokmi, using her height and reach advantage, proved to be the first test of Kentikian's professional career and both boxers fought a competitive bout. While Hokmi started out slower, she managed to win several of the later rounds by landing repeated combinations. Kentikian won through a <a href="split%20decision">split decision</a> for the first time in her career. The fight was voted among the five "Top Fights of the Year" by WomenBoxing.com. On 7 September 2007, Kentikian defended her title against Shanee Martin from the United Kingdom, winning by a third-round technical knockout. Kentikian controlled her opponent from the opening bell and the referee stopped the fight after Martin was knocked down from a straight right hand in round three.

Following the retirement of long-standing WIBF belt holder Halmich, Kentikian unified the WBA and vacant WIBF Flyweight titles in her hometown of Hamburg on 7 December 2007. She met Hokmi in a rematch of their contest six months earlier. The French boxer again proved to be a tough opponent and the fight developed similarly to their first encounter. Once more, Kentikian had the better start, but Hokmi scored during the second half of the fight, again making the bout close. This time however, Kentikian was ahead on all three of the judges' scorecards, winning by unanimous decision. After the end of the year, Kentikian was chosen as Hamburg's sportswoman of the year.

Kentikian successfully defended her titles against Sarah Goodson of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> by a third-round technical knockout on 29 February 2008. Goodson, who had fought almost exclusively in lower weight classes before, was overpowered by Kentikian and the referee ended the fight after a series of body punches in round three. In her next title defense on 10 May 2008, Kentikian beat Mary Ortega from the United States with a first-round technical knockout. Ortega, who had previously fought against well-known opponents such as <a href="Elena%20Reid">Elena Reid</a> and <a href="Hollie%20Dunaway">Hollie Dunaway</a>, was knocked down twice by straight right hands during the first 90 seconds of the fight. When Kentikian had Ortega pinned against the ropes again, the referee stepped in shortly before the end of round one. The quick stoppage came as a surprise to many, including television commentator Halmich, who had expected a hard-fought bout.

In her next title defense on 29 August 2008, Kentikian met Hager Finer of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, Halmich's last opponent before retiring. Following a close opening round, the boxing match turned into a brawl and Finer scored during the first half of the fight. From round five onwards, Kentikian managed to take over the bout by landing the cleaner punches and she won by unanimous decision. On 5 December 2008, Kentikian faced Anastasia Toktaulova of Russia, the reigning GBU Flyweight Champion, although the GBU title was not on the line. During the uncharacteristic tactical fight, Kentikian managed to control her opponent from the middle of the ring in most of the rounds. The three judges all scored the bout in favor of Kentikian. In December 2008, she was named Germany's female boxer of the year for the first time. In addition, she won the WBA Best Female Boxer award for 2007–08.

Kentikian retained her WIBF and WBA belts with a unanimous decision win over <a href="Elena%20Reid">Elena Reid</a> from the United States on 20 March 2009. Reid, who was well known in Germany after two controversial bouts with Halmich in 2004 and 2005, remained largely passive from the opening bell and Kentikian controlled her through the majority of the fight. Reid did not win a single round on the official scorecards. On 4 July 2009, Kentikian fought the <a href="Interim%20championship">Interim</a> WBA <a href="Super%20Flyweight">Super Flyweight</a> Champion Carolina Gutierrez Gaite of <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. Kentikian used her speed and combinations to dominate her opponent through the ten rounds, winning every round on the judges' scores. Kentikian ended 2009 by fighting the undefeated Turkish-German <a href="Julia%20Sahin">Julia Sahin</a> (20–0) on 10 October for the vacant <a href="World%20Boxing%20Organization">WBO</a> Female Flyweight title. Kentikian overwhelmed Sahin with her higher work rate early on. Sahin spent most of the fight covering up from Kentikian's many flurries. Kentikian won a unanimous decision to become the new WBO Female Flyweight Champion.

Kentikian, now the WIBF, WBA and WBO Female Flyweight Champion, defended all of her titles against undefeated <a href="Women%27s%20International%20Boxing%20Association">Women's International Boxing Association</a> titleholder Nadia Raoui on 24 April 2010 in Hamburg. The bout was very close, as Kentikian was outlanded in most rounds by Raoui. After ten rounds, Kentikian held narrow advantages on two of the three judges' scorecards and won via split decision. On 17 July, Kentikian defended her championships once again against Arely Muciño. In the first few rounds, she used combinations and quick offensive attacks to score against Mucino, before suffering a cut due to an accidental clash of heads. Kentikian was unable to continue; the fight was declared a <a href="No%20contest%20%28combat%20sports%29">no contest</a> and she retained her titles.

Kentikian again defended her WIBF Flyweight title on 26 March 2011 against Ana Arrazola. She won at least seven rounds on each of the judges' scorecards on her way to a unanimous decision victory. Arrazola received a one-point deduction in the sixth round, as Kentikian remained the WIBF champion. Later in the year, Kentikian scored another unanimous decision win on 21 October, this time against Teeraporn Pannimit of Thailand, to retain her WIBF, WBA and WBO Female Flyweight titles. She maintained control of the fight throughout en route to a lopsided victory.

Undefeated with 29 wins (including 16 by knockout), Kentikian next attempted to defend her WIBF and WBO Female Flyweight titles on 16 May 2012 in <a href="Frankfurt%2C%20Germany">Frankfurt, Germany</a> against <a href="Melissa%20McMorrow">Melissa McMorrow</a>. Kentikian lost via majority decision with scores of 95–95, 94–96 and 94–96, the first time she was defeated as a professional. The WBA Female title was not defended in that fight, so Kentikian remained that organization's champion. On 1 December, American Carina Moreno challenged her for the WBA title in Düsseldorf. Kentikian sought to utilize a brawling style against Moreno, but was frequently hit by Moreno's punches while moving forward. The fight was decided by majority decision after 10 rounds: one judge gave Kentikian a four-point advantage, but the other two had Moreno ahead by identical 96–94 margins as she claimed the WBA Female Flyweight championship. Kentikian suffered her second consecutive loss.

On 1 February 2013, Kentikian fought Sanae Jah for the Interim WBA Female Flyweight championship, which was vacant at the time. She established command of the fight by regularly moving close to Jah and applying pressure. In the seventh round, Kentikian scored a knockdown with a right-hand punch. Despite suffering multiple cuts by her right eye, including one from a clash of heads during the 10th and final round, Kentikian was able to finish the fight and earn a unanimous decision victory. Kentikian followed that bout with a rematch against Moreno on 6 July. With a win by unanimous decision, she regained the WBA Female Flyweight title. Kentikian made a title defense against Simona Galassi on 7 December in Stuttgart, under a scoring system in which judges could use half-points in their tallies. Each judge scored the fight in Kentikian's favor by at least 2.5 points, as she successfully defended her WBA championship.

Kentikian's opponent in her next title defense was Dan-Bi Kim. In the bout, which was held on 31 May 2014, Kentikian scored a technical knockout in the ninth round. On 8 November 2014, Kentikian fought Naoko Fujioka and earned the judges' decision after 10 rounds. After founding her own boxing promotion company, Kentikian Promotions, she next fought in October 2015, following an 11-month absence. Against Mexican boxer Susana Cruz Perez, Kentikian was cut in the second round by a clash of heads, but won most rounds on the judges' scorecards. The fight went the scheduled 10 rounds, and Kentikian earned a unanimous decision, although Halmich said that she had not shown "her old form". The victory earned Kentikian the WIBF Flyweight championship. On 30 July 2016, Kentikian fought in a WIBF title defense against Nevenka Mikulic and won by unanimous decision. As of 2018, that was her most recent fight. By 2017, Kentikian's WBA Female Flyweight championship had been vacated.

At the beginning of her professional career, Kentikian was primarily featured in the local media in Hamburg and occasionally in national <a href="German%20newspapers">German newspapers</a>; in particular, her difficult childhood and her long-time uncertain asylum status sparked interest in the press and led to comparisons with the boxing film "<a href="Million%20Dollar%20Baby">Million Dollar Baby</a>". Her height of also drew attention, and she was dubbed "Germany's smallest professional boxer". Early on, Kentikian was considered one of the big talents in German boxing and the media mentioned her as the potential successor of record world champion Halmich, a goal she had also set out for herself.

In 2007, Kentikian was introduced to a much larger audience due to cooperation between German television station <a href="ProSieben">ProSieben</a> and her promoter Spotlight Boxing. In addition to live broadcasts of her fights during so-called "ProSieben Fight Nights," she appeared several times on the popular television show "<a href="TV%20total">TV total</a>". She took part in a four-round <a href="sparring">sparring</a> session with the show's host, <a href="Stefan%20Raab">Stefan Raab</a>, and participated in the competitive entertainment event <a href="Wok%20racing">World Wok Championships</a>, where she teamed with <a href="Sven%20Hannawald">Sven Hannawald</a>, <a href="Christina%20Surer">Christina Surer</a> and <a href="Markus%20Beyer">Markus Beyer</a> to win the four-person competition. Her first world title defense, fighting María José Núñez on the undercard of a Raab vs. Halmich exhibition bout, was seen by 4.69 million television viewers—her most watched fight to date. A camera crew visited her for one year prior to her first world championship fight against Carolina Alvarez; the documentary aired in June 2007 on the German public broadcaster <a href="Das%20Erste">Das Erste</a>. A shortened version with commentary in English was aired by the German international broadcaster <a href="Deutsche%20Welle">Deutsche Welle</a> in October 2007. By 2010, Kentikian became a spokesperson for the Armenian charitable organization "Lebensbaum Armenien" (Armenia's Tree of Life).

U2 3D

U2 3D is a 2008 American-produced <a href="3D%20film">3D</a> <a href="concert%20film">concert film</a> featuring <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="U2">U2</a> performing during the <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a> in 2006. The film contains performances of 14 songs, including tracks from "<a href="How%20to%20Dismantle%20an%20Atomic%20Bomb">How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</a>" (2004), the album supported by the tour. The concert footage includes political and social statements made during the shows. It is the band's second feature film, following their 1988 <a href="rockumentary">rockumentary</a> "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum">Rattle and Hum</a>". Among several cinematic firsts, "U2 3D" was the first live-action digital 3D film.

The project was created to experiment with a new type of 3D film technology pioneered by producer Steve Schklair. After considering shooting <a href="American%20football">American football</a> games in 3D, Schklair's company <a href="3ality%20Digital">3ality Digital</a> decided to create a concert film with U2. The band were hesitant to participate, but agreed to the project mainly as a technological experiment rather than a profit-making venture. Although set in Buenos Aires, "U2 3D" was shot at seven concerts across Latin America, and two in Australia. The film's complex setup involved shooting with up to 18 3D cameras simultaneously and capturing the footage digitally.

After a preview screening at the <a href="2007%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2007 Cannes Film Festival</a>, "U2 3D" premiered at the <a href="2008%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">2008 Sundance Film Festival</a> and had its <a href="limited%20release">limited theatrical release</a> in late January 2008, followed by its <a href="wide%20release">wide release</a> the following month. The film was distributed by <a href="National%20Geographic%20Entertainment">National Geographic Entertainment</a> and was only released in <a href="IMAX%203D">IMAX 3D</a> and <a href="digital%203D">digital 3D</a> theaters. It peaked at number 19 at the United States box office, and earned over $26 million worldwide, ranking as one of the highest-grossing concert films. It received widely positive reviews, with critics praising the 3D technology and innovation. "U2 3D" won several awards, and its reception convinced some of the creators that the project marked a <a href="paradigm%20shift">paradigm shift</a> in filmmaking.

"U2 3D" depicts a U2 concert in Buenos Aires during the band's <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a>. In the beginning of the film, a voice is heard chanting "everyone" in a crowd-filled stadium, followed by fans running through the venue. U2 begin the concert with "<a href="Vertigo%20%28U2%20song%29">Vertigo</a>", followed by ten more songs in the main set. Images are shown throughout the concert on the stage's <a href="LED%20display">LED display</a>. Political and social statements are made during some songs, including "<a href="Sunday%20Bloody%20Sunday">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a>"—during which the word "<a href="Coexist%20%28image%29">coexista</a>" is spelled out on-screen through various religious symbols—and "<a href="Miss%20Sarajevo">Miss Sarajevo</a>", during which an excerpt from the <a href="Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human%20Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> is read aloud by a narrator. The main set ends with "<a href="One%20%28U2%20song%29">One</a>", after which the group leave the stage. They return for an <a href="encore%20%28concert%29">encore</a> and perform "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>", during which a succession of words and phrases appear on the stage's LED display and are superimposed into the film. U2 end the show with "<a href="With%20or%20Without%20You">With or Without You</a>" and leave the stage for the final time. As the closing credits begin, a live performance of "Yahweh" is heard as animations from the stage's LED display are shown.

In 2001, <a href="film%20producer">producers</a> Jon and <a href="Peter%20Shapiro%20%28concert%20promoter%29">Peter Shapiro</a> created a 2D <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a> concert film titled "All Access", which featured live performances of several musicians. Due to the difficulty of using conventional IMAX <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a> that had to be replaced every three minutes of shooting, the Shapiros wanted to use <a href="digital%20cinematography">digital technology</a> for their next project, which could easily be <a href="video%20scaler">upscaled</a> to the IMAX format without loss of quality. Noting how <a href="3D%20film">3D film</a>s out-performed 2D films, they also wanted their next project to be in the <a href="IMAX%203D">IMAX 3D</a> format. While looking for a new <a href="digital%203D">digital 3D</a> technology medium, the Shapiros met producer Steve Schklair, founder of Cobalt Entertainment in 2000. Schklair had recently developed a digital 3D filming technique known as "active depth cut", which allowed for smooth cuts between shots that would normally not line up when filmed in 3D. This was done using <a href="motion%20control%20photography">motion control photography</a> and real-time <a href="image%20processing">image processing</a> to create a realistic 3D experience without subjecting the viewer to excessive <a href="motion%20sickness">motion sickness</a> or <a href="eye%20strain">eye strain</a>. It was intended to be an inexpensive and effective way to shoot live events such as concerts or sports. With the help of John and <a href="David%20Modell">David Modell</a>, former owners of the <a href="Baltimore%20Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> American football team, the digital 3D technology was tested at several <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) games in the <a href="2003%20NFL%20season">2003 season</a>, including <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XXXVIII">Super Bowl XXXVIII</a>. Cobalt showed the footage to the NFL, hoping to create an NFL-based 3D IMAX film. While waiting for a response, the Shapiros proposed the idea of creating a 3D concert film for IMAX theaters. Although "All Access" had showcased several artists, the Shapiros now wanted to focus on a single act, and being U2 fans, suggested the band as a potential subject. Schklair felt U2 would be a good choice for the film due to their large concert setups and their constant movement while performing, both of which would provide good <a href="depth%20of%20field">depth of field</a> for 3D effects.

The Modells' collaboration with U2 for the film was facilitated by their involvement with the band in researching LED display technology in 1997 for use at <a href="Ravens%20Stadium%20at%20Camden%20Yards">Ravens Stadium at Camden Yards</a>. At the time, the only giant LED display in existence was being used by U2 on their <a href="PopMart%20Tour">PopMart Tour</a>. To learn about the technology, John Modell toured with U2 on-and-off for a period of six months. During that time, he befriended Catherine Owens, who served as the group's art director since their 1992 <a href="Zoo%20TV%20Tour">Zoo TV Tour</a>.

Unable to contact U2 manager <a href="Paul%20McGuinness">Paul McGuinness</a>, Peter Shapiro instead proposed the idea to Owens. The latter was researching art content for the upcoming Vertigo Tour and thought the concept could be used to show 3D video as part of U2's concerts. Shapiro explained that the technology was not that developed and simply wanted to document the tour itself in 3D, but Owens was not interested in making a film of the band, fearing it would interfere with the tour, so she declined the offer. After Shapiro showed Owens the 3D footage of the NFL games, Owens expressed interest in <a href="film%20director">directing</a> the proposed film, despite having no previous experience. According to bassist <a href="Adam%20Clayton">Adam Clayton</a>, U2 were not interested in making another concert film, but Owens "pushed it down [their] throats". Once the band viewed the test shots, frontman <a href="Bono">Bono</a> expressed interest in the project and convinced his bandmates to commit. Since U2 had already experimented with video technology in the past, they were interested in the project as a technological experiment rather than a means to make profit, and as a means to share the live experience with fans who could not afford concert tickets.

<a href="Pre-production">Pre-production</a> for "U2 3D" officially started in early 2004, and the production was handled by <a href="3ality%20Digital">3ality Digital</a>, a company formed from Schklair's Colbalt Entertainment and his partnership with the Modells and the Shapiros. Midway through the year, Bono agreed to let the 3ality Digital crew record test footage, which was accomplished using a single 3D camera at one of U2's Vertigo Tour concerts in Anaheim, California in March 2005. U2 were dissatisfied with their 1988 <a href="rockumentary">rockumentary</a> feature film, "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum">Rattle and Hum</a>", which mixed backstage footage and interviews with concert performances. The filmmakers decided that "U2 3D" would only have concert footage. The producers originally wanted to shoot in Los Angeles where all the filming equipment was located, but Owens and the band decided they needed a more enthusiastic audience. U2 ultimately chose to film in five cities in Latin America from February to March 2006, believing their absence from the region for eight years would foster an energetic atmosphere. The only one of the eight Latin American shows that was not shot was the first in Monterrey, Mexico. The project enabled U2 to share the outdoor stadium concerts with audiences in the US, where the band only performed at indoor arenas on the Vertigo Tour.

"U2 3D" production featured the first 3D <a href="multiple-camera%20setup">multiple-camera setup</a> and was shot using every <a href="digital%20movie%20camera">digital</a> 3D camera and recording deck in existence. The crew had two days to set up the filming equipment before each concert, which required running <a href="optical%20fiber%20cable">optical fiber cable</a>s and hooking up an electrical generator to supply power at each venue. The filming equipment consisted of nine custom-built <a href="3D%20rig">3D rig</a>s. The project's large scale prompted 3ality Digital to work with director <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a>—their chief competitor at the time. 3ality used their own 3flex TS1 camera rigs for filming, in addition to five <a href="Fusion%20Camera%20System">Fusion</a> 3D rigs, designed by Cameron and <a href="camera%20operator">camera operator</a> Vincent Pace. A total of 18 <a href="Sony">Sony</a> <a href="CineAlta">CineAlta</a> HDC-F950 cameras were used for filming, with two cameras on each rig. The cameras were fitted with <a href="Carl%20Zeiss%20AG">Zeiss</a> digital <a href="zoom%20lens">zoom lens</a>es, making "U2 3D" the first 3D film shot using a zoom lens. One of the Fusion 3D camera rigs was used as a <a href="Spydercam">Spydercam</a> and became the first 3D aerial camera. The cameras on each rig were spaced eye-distance apart to create a 3D effect in post-production. Using a <a href="beam%20splitter">beam splitter</a> mounted to the camera rig, one camera shot through a 50/50 mirror, while the other shot the image reflected from that mirror. Each rig weighed an average of . All of the concert footage was shot with twin-camera setups, except for the two Melbourne shoots, where a single CineAlta camera with a <a href="Steadicam">Steadicam</a> was also used to capture close-ups. The cameras captured <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition video</a> onto <a href="HDCAM%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BSR">HDCAM SR</a> recording decks, which enabled the crew to capture an entire concert.

Five crew members were required to work on each rig simultaneously to ensure that the <a href="focus%20%28optics%29">focus</a> on both cameras were synchronized. After one camera was destroyed when a concert security guard tossed buckets of water onto the audience, the crew waterproofed the remaining cameras. Due to Owens' limited directing experience prior to production, some of the filming in South America was directed by <a href="Mark%20Pellington">Mark Pellington</a>, who previously worked with U2 on the "One" music video. Pellington was not involved in post-production, leaving Owens responsible for the remaining aspects of the project, including creative direction and editing.

The concerts were filmed in a style which Owens described as "very unorthodox"; no <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>s or <a href="shooting%20script">shooting script</a>s were used to ensure footage of U2's performances was improvised. Instead of being directed, U2 performed each of their concerts as usual, with the filming crew capturing footage in <a href="real%20time%20%28media%29">real time</a> for the full -hour concerts. The shoots were planned such that the band's performance and the audience's view was uninterrupted. To avoid capturing other camera rigs in the footage, the crew would either film from the back of the stage, or alternate each night between shooting left-to-right and right-to-left. Several shows were edited together to create one performance; therefore, U2 were required to wear the same clothes every night to maintain continuity. Additional spotlights were focused on the audience during filming, and the lighting was dimmed on the stage's LED display. 110 microphones were used to record the concert audio, which included microphones placed on the main stage and around the two B-stages to record the band, and microphones placed throughout the venue to record the audience.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began in February 2006, under the supervision of the 3D cinematographer <a href="Peter%20Anderson%20%28cinematographer%29">Peter Anderson</a>; two shows were filmed in Mexico City to capture <a href="medium%20shot">medium shot</a>s during a practice run for the crew to learn the choreography of U2's performances. The crew captured additional medium shots using two camera setups at the two São Paulo concerts, and captured overhead footage of drummer <a href="Larry%20Mullen%2C%20Jr.">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> using a single camera setup at the show in Santiago. During preparations for the Buenos Aires concerts, U2 performed a 10-song set without an audience, so that the crew could capture <a href="close-up">close-up</a> footage using a <a href="wide-angle%20lens">wide-angle lens</a>; doing so in-concert would have interfered with the show. Owens dubbed the session the "phantom shoot". During the Buenos Aires shows, all nine camera setups were used, capturing shots of U2 from the <a href="B-stage">B-stage</a>s. The Buenos Aires shoot was the largest of the project, requiring a crew of 140 people.

In March 2006, the remaining Vertigo Tour concerts were postponed when the daughter of guitarist <a href="The%20Edge">The Edge</a> fell ill. During the interim, footage from the seven filmed shows was edited together, prompting the crew to request additional wide shots from the back of the stadium and close-ups of the band members. When the tour was on its fifth leg in November 2006, an additional two shows were filmed in Melbourne to capture the extra footage. At the time, the songs appearing in the final cut of the film had already been selected and therefore only specific songs from the concerts were filmed.

<a href="Post-production">Post-production</a> began in February 2006 and occurred concurrently with ongoing principal photography. <a href="Film%20editing">Editor</a> Olivier Wicki led post-production, working closely with Owens; the two had previously collaborated on the "Original of the Species" music video. Over 100 hours of footage were filmed, featuring performances of 26 different songs. To appeal to a mainstream audience, 14 tracks were chosen for the final cut, including 12 of U2's singles and two non-singles from "<a href="How%20to%20Dismantle%20an%20Atomic%20Bomb">How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</a>", the album that the Vertigo Tour supported. When selecting songs for the project, the crew had to ensure that the performances of each track fit with one another. U2 wanted to include "<a href="Mysterious%20Ways%20%28song%29">Mysterious Ways</a>" and "<a href="Until%20the%20End%20of%20the%20World%20%28song%29">Until the End of the World</a>", but they were left out since Owens felt that those songs were out of place with the rest of the film. She stated that the main focus of the film was based upon U2's relationship with one another and with their audience, and the challenge of selecting the songs was to create a <a href="narrative">narrative</a> within the band's performance. Although "<a href="City%20of%20Blinding%20Lights">City of Blinding Lights</a>" opened most shows on the tour, "Vertigo" was selected as the opening song of "U2 3D". Other tracks that were performed at most of the filmed concerts that did not make the final cut include "<a href="Elevation%20%28song%29">Elevation</a>", "<a href="I%20Still%20Haven%27t%20Found%20What%20I%27m%20Looking%20For">I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</a>", "Original of the Species", and "<a href="Zoo%20Station%20%28song%29">Zoo Station</a>". "With or Without You" was chosen as the last song before the closing credits, although it closed only one concert on the tour.

After the songs were selected, the footage was edited in 2D for eight months in New York City. Video post-production continued in Burbank, California at 3ality Digital's 3D production facility, which opened prior to the completion of shooting. Wicki worked with 3ality Digital to create the 3D and computer-generated effects. Footage from the nine filmed concerts, mostly from the Buenos Aires shows, was edited together with the footage from the "phantom shoot". Although the Mexico City shows were practice runs, footage from those concerts was used, including a scene where Bono reaches out to the camera during "Sunday Bloody Sunday". Because the crew felt the Melbourne audience lacked the energy of the Latin America crowds, most of the footage from the Melbourne concerts was not used except for some close-ups of Mullen.

Creating the 3D effect involved taking the edited 2D footage for the right eye and matching it up with footage for the left eye. Editing the Melbourne footage that used only a single camera involved a separate process to create 3D effects, known as "virtual second eye perspective". Several software programs were used to convert footage from 2D to 3D. The primary editing software, 3action, was developed at 3ality Digital during principal photography. It allowed the post-production team to change <a href="convergence%20%28eye%29">convergence points</a> in each shot, and to create multiple convergence points. Left-eye and right-eye footage was assembled on separate layers, then edited together with <a href="color%20grading">color grading</a> added, and eventually output in a 3D <a href="stereoscopy">stereoscopic</a> format for review.

U2 developed a style of editing in their previous concert films that involved <a href="fast%20cutting">fast cutting</a> between shots, which Owens wanted to retain in "U2 3D". Because fast cutting in 3D would lead to motion sickness or eye strain, the film was edited to incorporate <a href="dissolve%20%28filmmaking%29">dissolves</a> of at least four frames between shots. Many of the transitions were created by layering several frames of footage on top of one another into <a href="compositing">composite images</a>. Each of the layered frames featured a different depth of field to enhance the 3D effects, and up to five images were layered together in a single shot. This made "U2 3D" the first 3D film to feature composite images with more than two layers, and the first to be edited specifically to prevent the viewer from experiencing motion sickness or eye strain. Software did not exist at the time to layer the 3D images, so new software had to be developed. Because the project was captured in high-definition video, each frame used nearly 20 <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a>s of data on 3ality Digital's servers, and the entire film used almost a <a href="petabyte">petabyte</a> (10 <a href="byte">byte</a>s). The 3D editing process took longer than Owens expected, and consequently, the project went over budget, costing $15 million to produce. Video editing took 17 months, and the final film was cut to a length of 85 minutes—seven shorter than originally announced.

Audio editor Carl Glanville worked on the soundtrack, <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28film%20and%20television%29">mixing the audio</a> into a <a href="5.1%20surround%20sound">5.1 surround sound</a> mix with <a href="audio%20engineering">audio engineer</a> Robbie Adams in New York City. Video footage was compiled into files by Wicki, which were given to Glanville for compiling the soundtrack. Glanville and Adams said the audio editing was difficult mainly because the selection of video footage was limited, as only one to two cameras angles were captured at most of the shows. Further, the lyrics and music from the song performances differed slightly each night. To avoid <a href="lip%20sync">lip sync</a> and instrumental sync issues, the editors had to use the exact audio that was recorded during each shot. Mixing the vocals required that Glanville layer the audio recorded from the stage microphones with that from the audience microphones and to add a short <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a> between the two to compensate for any echos or delay that occurred in the venue. The sound from the <a href="subwoofer">subwoofer</a> channel was mixed inside two IMAX theaters in Los Angeles to ensure the volume of low-end frequencies was consistent with the rest of the soundtrack. The edited video footage featured 10- to 20-second-long shots, in contrast to the shorter shots usually found in concert films. Extended gaps were added between songs to slightly slow down the pace of the film. All audio and video footage used was recorded live in concert, with no added <a href="overdubbing">overdubs</a>. Following post-production, "U2 3D" became the first live-action film to be shot, posted, and exhibited entirely in 3D, the first live-action digital 3D film, and the first 3D concert film.

The trailer for the film was released and first screened at the <a href="ShoWest">ShoWest</a> trade show in March 2007, along with footage of "Sunday Bloody Sunday". Clips from the "Vertigo" and "The Fly" performances were featured in the trailer, which was edited by <a href="creative%20director">creative director</a> John Leamy, who also designed the wordmark logo and title sequence for "U2 3D". The film poster, which featured a collage of images from the film, won Leamy an award for best poster art at the Giant Screen Cinema Association's annual international conference in 2008. The trailer was shown in 3D theaters before "<a href="Meet%20the%20Robinsons">Meet the Robinsons</a>", the only 3D film released in theaters in early 2007.

Originally scheduled for the third quarter of 2007, the film's release was delayed when a distributor could not be found. In October 2007, National Geographic Cinema Ventures (NGCV), the entertainment division of the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>, announced that "U2 3D" would be the division's first major international release. Two days after the announcement, NGCV was combined into the newly created National Geographic Entertainment, a new unit within the society featuring various entertainment divisions. National Geographic CEO <a href="John%20M.%20Fahey%2C%20Jr.">John M. Fahey, Jr.</a> stated that "U2 3D" was chosen as the new unit's first release because they felt that U2 is "a band of the world" and "world music is something the Geographic as an institution is really interested in". National Geographic chose <a href="Best%20Buy">Best Buy</a> as the film's American sponsor, and offered passes to select members of the retailer's loyalty program to view "U2 3D" before its wide release. "U2 3D" was promoted through the internet, print, radio, television, on a <a href="JumboTron">JumboTron</a> in <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>, and as a sponsor on <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a>'s #19 Best Buy Dodge <a href="Stock%20car%20racing">stock car</a> driven by <a href="Elliott%20Sadler">Elliott Sadler</a>.

U2 were committed to preserving the film's 3D format and decided to only release it in digital 3D. To help promote this film format, "U2 3D" was first screened at the <a href="2007%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2007 Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 19, 2007. It was one of nine films to be screened out-of-competition at the 2007 festival, and was the first live-action 3D film shown at Cannes. Following a brief song performance by U2 at the festival, the film was screened at midnight inside the <a href="Palais%20des%20Festivals%20et%20des%20Congr%C3%A8s">Palais des Festivals et des Congrès</a>. At the time, the 3D post-production process was incomplete; therefore, a shortened, 56-minute version of the title was screened, featuring nine of the completed version's 14 songs. The completed version premiered at the <a href="2008%20Sundance%20Film%20Festival">2008 Sundance Film Festival</a> on January 19, 2008 at the <a href="Ellen%20Eccles%20Theatre">Ellen Eccles Theatre</a>. The theater incorporated a customized sound system designed especially for the premiere with new <a href="Dolby%203D">Dolby 3D</a> technology, which John Modell referred to as "the most high tech film screening that's ever been done in history."

"U2 3D" was slated to be screened only in IMAX theaters, but the large increase in the number of digital 3D theaters following post-production prompted the filmmakers to expand the release to include those cinemas. Two different types of <a href="polarized%203D%20glasses">polarized 3D glasses</a> were used for the IMAX 3D and digital 3D showings. The IMAX 3D version of the film used glasses with one lens <a href="Polarization%20%28waves%29">polarized</a> horizontally and one polarized vertically, while the digital 3D version used glasses with two circularly polarized lenses. John Modell described the IMAX version as a "more immersive experience", and stated that the digital 3D version features more vivid colors.

On January 23, 2008, "U2 3D" was released into IMAX theaters in the United States and Canada for its initial <a href="limited%20release">limited release</a>. It grossed over $960,000 in the US during its opening weekend after playing in 61 theaters, and ranked at number 20 at the box office. The IMAX release took place much earlier than the film's <a href="wide%20release">wide release</a>, as many IMAX theaters had booked "<a href="The%20Spiderwick%20Chronicles%20%28film%29">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a>", which was released on February 15. "U2 3D" was U2's second feature film, following 1988's "Rattle and Hum", and the third concert film from the Vertigo Tour, following the <a href="direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> concert films "" and "".

The wide release was originally scheduled for February 15, 2008, but the date was pushed back one week when <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a> decided to extend its release of the 3D concert film "", which was initially scheduled to be in theaters for only one week. Instead, on February 15, "U2 3D" had a second limited release in select theaters in the US with <a href="RealD%203D">RealD 3D</a> technology. The film's European premiere took place on February 20 at the <a href="Jameson%20Dublin%20International%20Film%20Festival">Jameson Dublin International Film Festival</a>, followed by its international <a href="wide%20release">wide release</a> on February 22. The first week of the wide release was the highest-grossing week of its theatrical run, grossing over $1 million at 686 theaters in the US and ranking at number 19 at the box office. Comparing the box office performance of "Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus", "<a href="The%20Spokesman-Review">The Spokesman-Review</a>"s online magazine "Spokane7" said "U2 3D" was "failing miserably". Three weeks into its wide release, "U2 3D" was playing in less than 100 theaters throughout the US. At the time, it had grossed less than $6.6 million, while "Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus"—still playing in many theaters since its February 1 release—had brought in over $60 million.

Prior to its Japan premiere in February 2009, "U2 3D" grossed $20 million in box office revenue. A re-release in the US took place in 2009 to coincide with the release of U2's studio album, "<a href="No%20Line%20on%20the%20Horizon">No Line on the Horizon</a>", followed by re-releases in Brazil and Spain in 2011 and 2015, respectively, prior to U2's concert tours in those countries. In addition to re-releases, the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> celebrated the opening of its new theater in October 2009 by featuring screenings of "U2 3D" at its museum. The film's box office run in the US ended August 26, 2010, bringing its total domestic gross to $10,363,341, after showing for 947 days. The film's distributors stated there was no predetermined limit to the length of the title's run, and the overall length would be determined by box office sales. Due to an open-ended theatrical run, total worldwide box office gross sources vary; website <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a> reported a worldwide gross of $22.7 million in December 2010, while magazine "<a href="BoxOffice%20%28magazine%29">BoxOffice</a>" and website <a href="The%20Numbers%20%28website%29">The Numbers</a> list grosses of $23.4 million and $26.2 million, respectively.

For its genre, "U2 3D" was successful and set several box office records. The film became the highest grossing <a href="documentary%20film">documentary</a> to be eligible for an <a href="Academy%20Award">Oscar</a> nomination at the <a href="81st%20Academy%20Awards">81st Academy Awards</a>. "U2 3D" set a record in Ireland for the highest screen average of any film playing during its opening weekend, and it took in almost <a href="Euro">€</a>90,000 at eight theaters during its first three days. In February 2011, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" ranked "U2 3D" as the fifth highest-grossing concert film, earning $14 million more than "Rattle and Hum", which ranked at number seven.

U2 control the ancillary rights to "U2 3D" along with their record label <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a>, and they have stated that additional rights such as those for a <a href="home%20video">home video</a> release will not be optioned until home video technology can meet the same digital 3D standards as cinema. Owens said in a 2007 interview that there were plans to release the film to a 3D home video format, however, the press release for the 2015 Spain re-release stated that "U2 3D" has been licensed exclusively for theatrical release, and will not be distributed in television, internet, or other home video formats.

Based on 88 reviews by critics, <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave "U2 3D" a 92% approval rating, and ranked it the fourth-best reviewed film in wide release from 2008. The website assigned it an average score of 7.5 out of 10, with a consensus that "U2 3D" was "an exhilarating musical experience at the price of a movie ticket". At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>—which assigns a <a href="Standard%20score">normalized</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics—the film received an average score of 83, based on 19 reviews, which translates to "universal acclaim" on the website's rating scale. The film received positive reviews from "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" and "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" following its 56-minute premiere at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival when the final 85-minute cut was months away from completion. Critics from publications such as the "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>", "<a href="The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald">The New Zealand Herald</a>", "<a href="News%20%26amp%3B%20Review">Reno News & Review</a>", "Toronto Star", and "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" said that the film's 3D experience was "even better than the real thing"—a reference to U2's <a href="Even%20Better%20Than%20the%20Real%20Thing">song of the same name</a>. Reviews by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" and "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>" stated the film seemed to appeal to fans and non-fans of U2 alike, just as the filmmakers had intended.
"U2 3D" was praised by "Variety" for its straightforward concert footage, compared to the interviews and behind-the-scenes footage included in "Rattle and Hum". In an episode of the TV series "<a href="At%20the%20Movies%20%281986%20TV%20program%29">At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper</a>", <a href="Michael%20Phillips%20%28critic%29">Michael Phillips</a> called the film "a genuine eye-fill" and <a href="Richard%20Roeper">Richard Roeper</a> described it as "spectacular". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" designated "U2 3D" as a "Critics' Pick" and stated in the review that the film was "the first IMAX movie that deserves to be called a work of art". "U2 3D" appeared on many critics' lists of the top ten films released in 2008 including "<a href="The%20Austin%20Chronicle">The Austin Chronicle</a>", "<a href="OhmyNews%20International">OhmyNews International</a>", "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>", "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>", and "<a href="River%20Cities%27%20Reader">River Cities' Reader</a>". The film was also ranked by "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" and "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" as one of the best 3D films. As the film has only been released theatrically, "<a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a>" included "U2 3D" in a list of "15 movies that aren't on DVD but should be", stating that "no concert film [...] has ever come close to capturing the exact experience so accurately". Bono was satisfied with the outcome of the film and said his favorite sequence was the performance of "Miss Sarajevo". When interviewed about the PopMart Tour in 2009, Bono said that the "" video was the best project U2 had done from an audio and visual perspective, and was "eclipsed only by "U2 3D"". The Edge was pleased that the footage did not show any of the distress he felt from his daughter's illness during filming.

However, the film received more critical reviews. "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" graded it a B− and stated that U2's performance was less thrilling than the 3D effects. Online magazine "FilmSlash" criticized "The New York Times" statement about "U2 3D" being the first IMAX art film, stating that some of the first IMAX titles were "experimental works of art". Music critic <a href="Joel%20Selvin">Joel Selvin</a> wrote in the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" that seeing U2 on the big screen was "more distracting than illuminating", and "Time Out London" criticized Bono's political statements, stating he "should refrain from ramming his preachy political meanderings down our throats and let the music do the talking". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" favored "Rattle and Hum" over "U2 3D" and called U2's performance "unexciting", criticizing how "the cameras, not the band, are doing all the work". "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", which gave a rating of one out of five stars, claimed that U2 appeared to be "four conceited billionaires who are further up themselves than ever".

"U2 3D" was recognized favorably after its release, earning several awards. In 2008, it earned three awards, including "Best Film Produced Non-Exclusively for the Giant Screen" at the Giant Screen Cinema Association's 2008 Achievement Awards, "Best Musical Film" at <a href="Los%20Premios%20MTV%20Latinoam%C3%A9rica%202008">Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica 2008</a>, and the Pioneer Award for Film & Television at the 2008 3D Film and Interactive Film Festival. In February 2009, the film received the award for "Outstanding Visual Effects in a Special Venue Project" from the <a href="Visual%20Effects%20Society">Visual Effects Society</a> (VES) at the <a href="7th%20Visual%20Effects%20Society%20Awards">7th Annual VES Awards</a>.

The extensive use of technology during production was featured as the cover story in the December 2007 issue of the high-definition video magazine "HDVideoPro", a month before the premiere of "U2 3D". Its usage of evolutionary technology led to Catherine Owens being selected as a featured guest speaker at the <a href="SIGGRAPH">SIGGRAPH</a> 2008 conference, which took place several months after the film's release. After "U2 3D" received praise from fans, critics, and the film industry, several of the filmmakers stated that they felt it helped create a <a href="paradigm%20shift">paradigm shift</a> in cinema history, due to the technological advancements used in the production. Director <a href="Wim%20Wenders">Wim Wenders</a> was inspired to create the 2011 3D dance documentary "<a href="Pina%20%28film%29">Pina</a>" after the attending the "U2 3D" screening at Cannes. The film's use of new technology inspired English rock band <a href="Muse%20%28band%29">Muse</a> to increase the production values for their 2013 release "<a href="Live%20at%20Rome%20Olympic%20Stadium">Live at Rome Olympic Stadium</a>", which became the first concert film shot in <a href="4K%20resolution">4K resolution</a>.

Following the success of "U2 3D", 3ality Digital continued to pioneer 3D projects. After previously experimenting with filming American football games in 3D, 3ality Digital successfully broadcast the first live 3D NFL game in December 2008. In 2009, 3ality Digital aired the first live 3D sports broadcast available to consumers, the first 3D television advertisement, and the first 3D episode of a scripted television program. U2 show director <a href="Willie%20Williams%20%28set%20designer%29">Willie Williams</a> recruited "U2 3D" director of photography Tom Krueger to design the photography and video coverage for the band's 2009–2011 U2 360° Tour. Krueger directed their subsequent concert film, "<a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20at%20the%20Rose%20Bowl">U2 360° at the Rose Bowl</a>", which was released in 2010.

American Cream Draft

The American Cream Draft is a rare <a href="draft%20horse">draft horse</a> <a href="horse%20breed">breed</a>, the only such breed developed in the United States that is still in existence. It is recognized by its cream color, known as "gold champagne", produced by the action of the <a href="champagne%20gene">champagne gene</a> upon a <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> base color, and by its amber eyes, also characteristic of the gene; the only other color found in the breed is chestnut. Like several other breeds of draft horses, the American Cream is at risk for the <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">autosomal recessive</a> genetic disease <a href="Junctional%20epidermolysis%20bullosa%20%28veterinary%20medicine%29">junctional epidermolysis bullosa</a>.

The breed was developed in Iowa during the early 20th century, beginning with a cream-colored mare named Old Granny. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> threatened the breed's existence, but several breeders worked to improve the color and type of the breed, and in 1944 a <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a> was formed. The <a href="mechanised%20agriculture">mechanization of farming</a> in the mid-20th century led to a decrease in the breed's population and the registry became inactive for several decades. It was reactivated in 1982 and population numbers have slowly grown since then. However, population numbers are still considered critical by <a href="The%20Livestock%20Conservancy">The Livestock Conservancy</a> and the <a href="Equus%20Survival%20Trust">Equus Survival Trust</a>.

American Creams have refined heads, with flat facial profiles that are neither concave nor convex. They have wide chests, sloping shoulders and short, strong backs. Their ribs are well sprung, and they are <a href="Back%20%28horse%29">short-coupled</a> with well-muscled hindquarters and with strong well-proportioned legs set well apart. They are sure-footed with strong <a href="horse%20hoof">hooves</a>, and their <a href="horse%20gait">movement</a> is free and easy. According to enthusiasts, the breed has a calm, willing temperament, particularly suited for owners who are new to handling draft horses. <a href="Mare">Mare</a>s stand high and weigh , while <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s and <a href="gelding">gelding</a>s stand and weigh or more.

The ideal coat color for the breed is a medium cream with pink skin, amber eyes and a white mane and tail. The characteristic cream color of the breed is produced by the <a href="champagne%20gene">champagne gene</a>. Recognized colors include light, medium and dark cream, with amber or hazel eyes. A cream mare with dark skin and a light mane and tail may be accepted by the registry as <a href="foundation%20stock">foundation stock</a>, while stallions must have pink skin and white manes and tails to be registered. Purebred American Cream <a href="foal">foal</a>s that are too dark to be accepted into the main <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a> may be recorded into an <a href="appendix%20registry">appendix registry</a>. The appendix will also accept half-bred Cream Draft horses crossed with other draft bloodlines if they meet certain requirements, and the registry provides an upgrade system that uses appendix horses to strengthen genes, increase breed numbers, and allow more diversified bloodlines.

The champagne gene produces <a href="dilution%20gene">diluted color</a>, and the gold champagne body color, light skin, light eyes, and ivory mane and tail associated with the American Cream Draft are produced by the action of the champagne gene on a <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> base coat. In the adult horse, the skin is pink with abundant dark freckles or mottling, and the eyes are hazel or amber. The eyes of champagne foals are blue at birth, darkening as they age, and a foal's skin is bright pink. The breed registry describes foals' eyes as "almost white", which is consistent with the nature of the champagne blue foal eye, which is creamier than other types of blue eye.
Champagne is a <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">dominant</a> trait, based on a mutation in the <a href="SLC36A1">SLC36A1</a> gene. The mapping of the gene was announced in 2008, and the American Cream Draft cross was among the breeds studied. The authors of this study noted that it was difficult to distinguish between <a href="homozygous">homozygous</a> and <a href="heterozygous">heterozygous</a> animals, thus distinguishing champagne from <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">incomplete dominant</a> dilutions such as the <a href="cream%20gene">cream gene</a>. However they noted that homozygotes may have less mottling or a slightly lighter hair color than heterozygotes. Anecdotal reports also note mild differences, including lighter freckling, skin and hair coat, though eye color remains the same.

Dark-skinned American Cream Draft horses are actually <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnuts</a>, as the breed is not homozygous for the champagne gene; only one <a href="allele">allele</a> is needed to produce the proper color. Champagne dilutes any base coat color, and in the American Cream Draft, the underlying genetic base color is chestnut. As of 2003, scientists have not found the breed to carry the cream gene, even though breeders refer to the desired color as "cream". The American Cream Draft is never <a href="cremello">cremello</a> or <a href="white%20%28horse%29">white</a>, and though the gold coat color with a white mane and tail resembles <a href="palomino">palomino</a>, the breed's defining characteristics are the result of the champagne gene.
The <a href="Dominance%20%28genetics%29">autosomal recessive</a> genetic disease <a href="Junctional%20epidermolysis%20bullosa%20%28veterinary%20medicine%29">junctional epidermolysis bullosa</a> (JEB) has been found in some American Cream Drafts. This is a lethal genetic disorder that causes newborn foals to lose large areas of skin and have other abnormalities, normally leading to <a href="animal%20euthanasia">euthanasia</a> of the animal. It is most commonly associated with <a href="Belgian%20horse">Belgian horse</a>s, but is also found in other draft breeds. A <a href="DNA">DNA</a> test was developed in 2002, and JEB can be avoided as long as two carriers are not bred to one another. The American Cream registry states that it has "been pro-active in testing its registered animals since JEB was discovered".

The American Cream is the only breed of draft horse developed in the United States that is still in existence today. The breed descends from a <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation mare</a> named Old Granny. She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in <a href="Story%20County%2C%20Iowa">Story County, Iowa</a>, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer. She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in <a href="Jewell%2C%20Iowa">Jewell, Iowa</a>. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed, and the color is now known as gold champagne. In 1946, two years after the <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a> was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny.

In 1920, a <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> of Old Granny's named Nelson's Buck No. 2 impressed <a href="veterinarian">veterinarian</a> Eric Christian to the point that Christian asked the Nelsons not to <a href="gelding">geld</a> him. They agreed to let him remain a stallion, and he sired several cream-colored foals, though only one was registered: a colt named Yancy No. 3, whose <a href="dam">dam</a> was a <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a> mare of <a href="Percheron">Percheron</a> breeding. Yancy sired Knox 1st, born in 1926 to an unregistered <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> mare of mixed <a href="Shire%20horse">Shire</a> ancestry. From this sire line, in 1931, a great-great-grandson of Nelson's Buck was born, named Silver Lace No. 9. Silver Lace was to become one of the most influential stallions of the American Cream breed. His dam was a Belgian mare with light chestnut coloring, and she is credited with Silver Lace's size – at he weighed considerably more than most of his bloodline. Silver Lace quickly became a popular stallion in Iowa. However, stallions standing for public <a href="stud%20service">stud service</a> in Iowa were required to be registered with the <a href="Iowa%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">Iowa Department of Agriculture</a>, and this agency only allowed horses of recognized breeds. As Silver Lace was not registered with any <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a>, his owners created a breeding <a href="syndicate">syndicate</a>, and mare owners who bought shares in the "Silver Lace Horse Company" could breed their mares to him. However, his main breeding career coincided with the economic struggles of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and Silver Lace was at one point hidden in a neighbor's barn to prevent his sale at auction. Another significant foundation stallion was Ead's Captain, whose bloodlines appear in about one-third of all American Cream Drafts.

Around 1935, despite the Depression, a few breeders started to <a href="linebreeding">linebreed</a> and <a href="inbreeding">inbreed</a> cream-colored horses to fix their color and type. In particular, C.T. Rierson began buying cream-colored mares sired by Silver Lace and developing the American Cream breed in earnest. In 1944, a breed association, the American Cream Association, was formed by 20 owners and breeders and granted a corporate charter in the state of Iowa. In 1950, the breed was finally recognized by the Iowa Department of Agriculture, based on a 1948 recommendation by the <a href="National%20Stallion%20Enrollment%20Board">National Stallion Enrollment Board</a>.

The mechanization of farming in the mid-20th century led to a decrease in the overall draft horse population, and with Rierson's death in 1957, American Cream Draft numbers began to decline. By the late 1950s there were only 200 living American Creams registered, owned by only 41 breeders. The registry became inactive until 1982, when three families who had retained their herds reactivated and reorganized the registry. In 1994, the organization officially changed its name to the American Cream Draft Horse Association (ACDHA).

In 1982, owners began blood-typing their horses, and by 1990, genetic testing found that "compared with other draft breeds and based upon gene marker data, the Creams form a distinct group within the draft horses." The American Cream Draft was found to have a genetic relationship with the Belgian breed that was no closer than the ones it had with the Percheron, <a href="Suffolk%20Punch">Suffolk Punch</a> and <a href="Haflinger">Haflinger</a> breeds. Registry records dating to the early 20th century show no bloodlines other than draft breeding. As of 2000 there were 222 registered horses, a number that increased to 350 as of 2004. Of these, 40 were "tracking horses" – either purebred American Creams that did not meet color requirements or <a href="crossbred">crossbred</a> horses that mix American Cream and other draft blood, but still meet the physical requirements for the registry. These tracking horses are allowed by certain regulations to be used as breeding stock, with the resulting foals able to be registered as purebred American Creams. Around 30 new horses are registered each year. <a href="The%20Livestock%20Conservancy">The Livestock Conservancy</a> considers the breed to be at "critical" status, meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 2,000 and there are less than 200 registrations annually in the US. The <a href="Equus%20Survival%20Trust">Equus Survival Trust</a> also considers the population to be "critical", meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today. To help replenish numbers, the ACDHA has developed regulations to permit foals to be registered when produced via methods such as <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a> and <a href="embryo%20transfer">embryo transfer</a>. Careful use of the appendix registry also allows numbers to increase.

The American Creams that live in <a href="Colonial%20Williamsburg">Colonial Williamsburg</a> have been called "the most famous of all American Cream Draft horses". In the village they are used for wagon and carriage rides, and as of 2006 there is a breeding program run by Colonial Williamsburg that is working to increase breed numbers.

<doc id="10566622" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10566622" title="Coinage Act of 1965">
Coinage Act of 1965

The Coinage Act of 1965, , eliminated silver from the circulating United States <a href="Dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a> (ten-cent piece) and <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter dollar</a> coins. It also reduced the silver content of the <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> from 90 percent to 40 percent; silver in the half dollar was subsequently eliminated by a 1970 law.

There had been coin shortages beginning in 1959, and the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> expanded production to try to meet demand. The early 1960s was a time of increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the <a href="Kennedy%20half%20dollar">Kennedy half dollar</a> as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but government stocks of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a>, President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and <a href="debasement">debased</a> silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.

The new coins began to enter circulation in late 1965, and alleviated the shortages. They passed side by side with their silver counterparts for a time, but the precious metal coins were hoarded beginning in 1967 as the Treasury ended its efforts to keep silver prices low. The act also banned the production of silver dollars until at least 1970.

The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201792">Coinage Act of 1792</a> established the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a>, and made both gold and silver legal tender. This meant that anyone could present bullion at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> and receive it back, struck into coins. The 1792 act authorized six silver coins, in value from five cents to a dollar, and prescribed their weights and fineness. Making a dollar equal to given quantities of both gold and silver made the currency vulnerable to variations in the price of precious metals, and U.S. coins flowed overseas for melting until adjustments were made to their size and weight in 1834 and again with the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201853">Coinage Act of 1853</a>, when the amount of bullion in the silver coins worth less than a dollar was reduced. The fact that the <a href="dime%20%28U.S.%20coin%29">dime</a> (ten-cent piece), <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter dollar</a>, and other smaller silver coins contained less silver in proportion to the dollar helped keep them in circulation.

With the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>, the dollar was no longer equivalent to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that as the price of silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and <a href="half%20dollar%20%28U.S.%20coin%29">half dollar</a> in 90 percent silver—the <a href="dollar%20%28U.S.%20coin%29">dollar</a> had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.

Beginning in 1934, the price of silver in the United States was effectively set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy ounce. In 1958, with the return of <a href="lend-lease">lend-lease</a> bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per ounce to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.

Worldwide consumption of silver more than doubled between 1958 and 1965, but production increased by only about 15 percent. Industrial uses for silver included photographic film, batteries, and electronic components. At the same time, the Mint's production of silver coin increased as it attempted to meet demand; it used 111.5 million troy ounces of silver in coinage in 1963, up from just over 38 million in 1958. In spite of the increased demand, silver prices were checked by the fact that the Treasury would redeem <a href="silver%20certificate%20%28United%20States%29">silver certificates</a>: paper money exchangeable for silver dollars (or the bullion equivalent, .7734 troy ounces), thus placing a ceiling of $1.29 per ounce on the market. Without government as the supplier of last resort, silver would rise in price, likely making it profitable to melt not only silver dollars, but the subsidiary silver coins as well. In 1963, the gap between production and consumption by the non-communist world amounted to 209 million ounces. Just lower than world production (210 million ounces), this gap was filled by the sale of Treasury silver at $1.29 per ounce. Even a rise in the price of silver likely would not have led to a major jump in production, as silver was for the most part obtained as a by-product in the mining of other metals, such as copper and lead.

The Bureau of the Mint in 1955 ended coinage operations at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>, deeming it cheaper to supply the West Coast with coins from Denver. The <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a> (opened in 1906) had been modernized twice, in contrast to the aging Philadelphia Mint, constructed in 1901 and with much of its coinage equipment dating from then. Plans for a replacement facility had been scuttled multiple times by political infighting, as a new mint was sought not only by different cities, but by various neighborhoods of the city of Philadelphia.

In the postwar era, occasional coin shortages had been known, often local and seasonal, and generally brief in duration. The shortage might affect one of the five denominations (cent, nickel, dime, quarter and half dollar) being minted for circulation. The <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Banks">Federal Reserve Banks</a> ("the Fed"), responsible for obtaining coins from the Mint and distributing them on request to member banks, also performed the function of receiving from these banks coins they did not need, a process known as "flowback". Coins were returned from commercial banks to the Fed, were processed and cleaned, and were then sent to banks needing them. These recycled pieces represented the bulk of what the Fed shipped, and perhaps only a fifth were new coins.

The banks accustomed themselves to seasonal need for coins, as for quarters and half dollars in Michigan to pay <a href="cherry">cherry</a> pickers the traditional 75-cent rate, and to local preferences; for example, half dollars were not popular in New York, two quarters being preferred instead. Beginning in late 1959, the Mint failed to provide enough coins to satisfy demand, and the Fed, through its district banks and branches, imposed rationing. By 1963, there was often rationing of all denominations, commercial banks (and their retail customers) receiving less than they needed. There were widespread shortages of some denominations during the 1962 holiday shopping season. Traditionally, the heavy demand for coinage late in the year resulted in a large amount of flowback in the winter, but in early 1963, few coins returned to the banks, or to the Fed. Officials suggested responsibility might lie with coin collectors and investors, as well as uncollected coins remaining in the nation's millions of vending machines. The Mint increased production to around-the-clock shifts at Philadelphia and Denver. A new Philadelphia Mint was authorized in 1963, though the hoped-for opening date of 1966 was soon pushed back to 1967 (it eventually opened in 1969).

The coin shortage did not ease during 1963. In spite of heavy production by the two mints, early 1964 saw but a trickle of flowback, alarming the Fed. Investigation showed that banks and their business customers were retaining coins, fearing shortages. Many of the silver ones were being taken out of circulation by people believing the price of that metal would rise.

The Treasury began removing silver certificates from circulation, replacing them with <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Note">Federal Reserve Note</a>s. This helped free up silver that did not have to be held as backing for the certificates, which the Treasury redeemed with silver bullion instead of dollar coins after March 1964, when it stopped paying out silver dollars. It had almost depleted a stock that had been at just under 273 million in 1954. There had been a run on the Treasury for them; citizens could obtain up to 50,000 in a day, and payment in silver certificates was not required. In much-photographed scenes at the Treasury Building in Washington, citizens had shown up with wheelbarrows, armed guards, and even armored cars to haul away the silver. The remaining silver dollars held in the Treasury (2,970,928 as of May 20, 1965) had high <a href="numismatic">numismatic</a> value; Congress in 1970 authorized their sale at a premium to collectors.

<a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">President Kennedy's</a> <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination</a> in November 1963 led to calls to honor him with a place on one of the circulating coins, and the <a href="Kennedy%20half%20dollar">Kennedy half dollar</a> was authorized by Congress on December 30. When 26 million of the new coins were issued on March 24, 1964, they were immediately hoarded, both by investors and by those wanting a memento of Kennedy, and the situation did not ease as more coins were produced. One-third of the record-breaking 202.5 million ounces of silver used in coinage in 1964 thus became coins that did not circulate. Congress allowed the Mint to continue to strike 1964-dated pieces into 1965, hoping to make them not worth putting aside.

Congress in August 1964 passed an appropriation intended to be used for striking 45 million silver dollars. The <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a>, <a href="Mike%20Mansfield">Mike Mansfield</a>, was from hard-money Montana and insisted on the Mint proceeding. The Mint struck over 300,000 of them, bearing the <a href="Peace%20dollar">Peace dollar</a> design and the date 1964, in May 1965 but due to a public outcry that the coins would only be hoarded, they were melted. The minting had been at the direction of President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>; the subsequent <a href="flip-flop%20%28politics%29">flip-flop</a> on the question left Nevada Senator <a href="Alan%20Bible">Alan Bible</a>, a prominent supporter of the mining industry, unimpressed with the administration's leadership on coin matters, feeling officials were leaving the mess for Congress to straighten out. He introduced legislation to outlaw hoarding, export, and melting of U.S. coins, but the bill went nowhere.

In the interim, the coin shortage continued, putting supermarkets, drugstores, and other large retail establishments under great pressure. Two chains in the Midwest commissioned their own paper <a href="scrip">scrip</a>, but this was never issued as the Treasury warned it trespassed on the federal prerogative to coin money. Stores urged customers to break open <a href="piggy%20bank">piggy bank</a>s and bring in the contents. Coins obtained by newsboys, vending-machine operators, and churches on <a href="collection%20plate">collection plate</a>s were ardently sought after by stores and banks. They had competition in this regard, as investors also wanted the coins, and withdrew them from circulation.

In addition to the circulated coinage, investors wanted the new 1964 pieces (especially the half dollar) and a lively market in <a href="coin%20wrapper">rolls</a> and large canvas bags of coins developed in the pages of "<a href="Coin%20World">Coin World</a>", with the advertisements examined at congressional hearings. Some banks were offered ample quantities of coin at a premium, or the exchange of bags of old coinage for the new; most refused, and bank employees who cooperated with would-be accumulators were fired. Numismatic writer David Lange pointed out that the collecting of recent coins in rolls peaked in 1964, and believed the coin collecting hobby's blame for the shortage unfair.

The Mint arranged to outsource part of the coin-making process, and pledged to flood the nation with coins by 1965. Despite an increased need for coins in an improving economy, merchants made it past the 1964 holiday season without severe shortages, though the half dollar had stopped circulating. Most Fed facilities reported sufficient supplies of cents and nickels, with some still short on dimes and quarters, and shortages of half dollars everywhere—one Fed official wrote that his branch had not seen a half dollar deposited by a bank in eight months.

The Treasury conducted extensive research, and in May 1965 concluded that the nation could not go on using so much silver in its coinage. It decided on <a href="clad%20coinage">clad coinage</a>, with copper-nickel faces and a pure copper core, as the most desirable replacement material. Such a composition would work in place of silver in vending machines, which would not require wholesale adjustment. Copper and nickel were readily available, and the melt value of the new coins would be much under face value. The material was hard, allowing the designs to remain recognizable for long periods, and other nations, such as the United Kingdom, had transitioned from silver to copper-nickel coins. The Mint conducted lengthy test runs, and did not experience production problems.

On June 3, 1965, President Johnson sent a special message to Congress, asking it to pass legislation allowing the dime and quarter to be made from base metal, and to reduce the silver content of the half dollar to 40 percent. The silver dollar would be unaffected if any were struck, but there were no plans to do so. He noted that the metal for the silver coinage was being struck from dwindling Treasury stocks, rather than from newly mined silver, and that the government bullion would be entirely used up by 1968. Johnson argued that the metal necessary for industry must not be wasted as a means of exchange. He urged the passage of draft legislation, attached to the message, and said the bill would "ensure a stable and dignified coinage, fully adequate in quantity and in its specially designed technical characteristics to the needs of our Twentieth Century life. It can be maintained indefinitely, however much the demand for coin may grow."

Under Johnson's proposal, there would be no change in the cent or nickel, but the dime and quarter would be made with a clad composition, that is copper-nickel bonded to a core of pure copper; the half dollar would have 80 percent silver faces and the core would contain 21 percent silver. The clad alloy had similar electrical properties to silver, and so would work in existing vending machines. He also sent the Treasury Staff Report on which his recommendations were based. This report had been expected in February, but had been repeatedly delayed, in part because outgoing Treasury Secretary <a href="C.%20Douglas%20Dillon">C. Douglas Dillon</a> felt that his successor should approve the plan, as he would have to live with the consequences. The new secretary, <a href="Henry%20H.%20Fowler">Henry H. Fowler</a>, had needed time to study the problem, further delaying the report's issuance. If adopted, the bill would reduce the need for silver in U.S. coinage by 90 percent.

Hearings on the president's proposal, introduced as H.R. 8926, began before the House Banking and Currency Committee on June 4. Chairman <a href="Wright%20Patman">Wright Patman</a>, the bill's sponsor, deemed it to have something for everyone, including price supports for silver, though industrial users would benefit most, as the silver formerly used in coinage would be freed up for commercial use. Most business stakeholders, including the banks, the vending machine operators, and corporate leaders, wanted to see the bill pass, it being better than the current situation. On June 11, the committee issued a report recommending the bill pass, with amendments requiring the half dollar to be made of base metal, requiring the silver coins that would be struck during the transition period to be dated 1964, and banning the striking of silver dollars for five years.

One day of hearings on S. 2080, the version introduced into the Senate, was held before that body's <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Committee on Banking and Currency</a> on June 9, with Virginia Senator <a href="A.%20Willis%20Robertson">A. Willis Robertson</a>, the chairman, presiding. Senator Bible and others from mining states sought to retain silver in the currency or include provisions from Bible's earlier bill banning hoarding of coins, but they were not successful. On June 11, the Senate committee issued a report recommending the bill's passage, with several amendments, mostly technical in nature. The bill required the Treasury to buy newly mined U.S. silver at $1.25 per ounce when presented by mining companies; a five-year limit was placed on this.

The Senate considered the bill between June 22 and 24, 1965. An amendment by Rhode Island Senator <a href="John%20Pastore">John Pastore</a> to remove silver entirely from the half dollar failed, 32—60. A number of senators wished to retain silver in the dime and quarter, and called for them to be made from 40 percent silver, but an amendment to that effect was defeated. There were other failed amendments, including one by Bible to prohibit melting of silver coins by the public. Robertson was determined to prevent any changes to the bill, which had been unanimously approved by his committee, and each attempt failed. The bill passed the Senate, 74—9, the opponents being Bible and other Western senators.

The House of Representatives debated the bill on July 13 and 14, 1965. The discussion was wide-ranging. Idaho Congressman <a href="Compton%20I.%20White%20Jr.">Compton I. White</a> opposed the bill, having prepared a chart showing the debasement of the Roman <a href="denarius">denarius</a> between the years 1 and 300, though stating that he did not expect that coinage debasement would cause a government to fall. Nevada's <a href="Walter%20S.%20Baring">Walter S. Baring</a> noted that the Treasury was selling silver to the makers of cutlery and stated, "I would rather eat with chopsticks than take the silver out of our coinage". Massachusetts' <a href="Silvio%20Conte">Silvio Conte</a> denigrated <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Gresham">Sir Thomas Gresham</a> for illicit profits when the <a href="Royal%20Exchange%2C%20London">Royal Exchange</a> in London was established, but conceded that <a href="Gresham%27s%20Law">Gresham's Law</a> would nevertheless cause base metal coins to drive the silver ones from circulation. Iowa's <a href="H.%20R.%20Gross">Harold Gross</a> asked Conte that if the U.S. was going to debase its coinage, why not go back to <a href="wampum">wampum</a>. Minor amendments, including removing the <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> from coinage for up to five years, were agreed to. There was objection to the committee amendment removing silver entirely from the half dollar; it was defeated 48—94, leaving the half dollar at 40 percent silver. Congressman <a href="James%20F.%20Battin">James F. Battin</a> of Montana offered an amendment to make the dime and quarter out of 40 percent silver; although Patman objected that the committee had rejected the idea, it initially passed 122—112. However, this was at the <a href="Committee%20of%20the%20Whole">Committee of the Whole</a> stage, and Patman got the House to reject the Battin amendment, 197—218. After other attempts were made in vain to derail the bill, the <a href="House%20Minority%20Leader">House Minority Leader</a>, Michigan's <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford">Gerald R. Ford</a>, asked that there be a recorded vote on H.R. 8926, and the bill passed, 255—151, Ford voting in favor. Patman then had the House amend the Senate bill, S. 2080, to reflect the House-passed language, and pass it.

The House notified the Senate that it had passed S. 2080. The Senate, considering the bill on July 15, could either agree to the House amendments or go to a conference committee, and after disgruntlement at some of the House amendments—the House had greatly expanded the membership of the Joint Commission on the Coinage, which was to make recommendations on useful changes—the Senate passed the House's version without a recorded vote, though Washington's <a href="Warren%20Magnuson">Warren Magnuson</a> requested that the record show him as voting against the bill. President Johnson enacted S. 2080 as the Coinage Act of 1965 with his signature on July 23, 1965.

Section 101 authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue dimes, quarters, and half dollars of clad composition, with the half dollar to be made of 40 percent silver. So long as there was a shortage of coins, the Mint could strike dimes, quarters, and half dollars from .900 silver, but this authority was to end once the secretary certified there was an adequate supply of the new coins in circulation, and in any event five years after the law was enacted (thus, ending July 23, 1970). During that five-year period, no standard silver dollars could be minted.

Section 102 made all coins and currency of the United States legal tender without limit, reiterating language found in the Act of May 12, 1933. That part of the 1933 act was repealed in section 210 to avoid possible legal arguments that section 102 did other than restate existing law. Section 103 gave the secretary broad discretion to acquire equipment, supplies, and patent rights to expedite the production of coins during the emergency, with the provision again to expire after five years. Section 104 required the secretary to purchase at $1.25 per troy ounce silver bullion of U.S. origin within a year of the month in which it was mined. According to the Senate committee report on the bill, section 104 was intended "as a precautionary measure to protect our mining industry from any undue downward fluctuations in the market during the period of transition". This provision, which was limited to five years by the House committee, was deemed to be "continuing government interference in the market for silver" by the American Institute for Economic Research in its report on Johnson's message to Congress.

Section 105 authorized the secretary to prohibit the melting, export, or treating of any coin, if necessary to protect the nation's coinage, and prescribed a penalty of up to five years in prison for violation of such an order—section 106 declared that coins seized under section 105 would be forfeited to the United States, with the secretary given powers paralleling those under the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Code">Internal Revenue Code</a> to enforce such forfeitures. Section 107 allowed the secretary to issue regulations to put into force the Coinage Act of 1965, while section 108 contained definitions and similar technical matters.

Section 201 amended legislation regarding the San Francisco Assay Office to allow coins to be minted there (as they previously were when it was the San Francisco Mint) until such time as the secretary certified that the mints of the United States were able to strike sufficient coins to meet the needs of the nation. It also repealed a provision of law not allowing gold or silver to be refined at the San Francisco facility. Section 202 increased the amount appropriated to expand Mint facilities (including the construction of the new Philadelphia Mint) from $30 million to $45 million. Section 9 of the <a href="Gold%20Standard%20Act">Gold Standard Act</a> of 1900 had required the Treasury Secretary to melt silver coins that were worn or no longer current, and restrike them into new ones; this was repealed by section 203 and the secretary was given authority to withdraw and melt all worn or uncurrent coins without needing to reuse the metal in coinage.

Section 204 amended the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. During the 1965 or subsequent coinage emergency, the secretary could continue to strike coins dated with a year that has passed, with the silver ones in the present crisis to be dated 1964, and the clad ones 1965 or after. The House Banking Committee added language to Johnson's proposal, eliminating mint marks on coins for up to five years, excepting the mint mark "D" for Denver on 1964-dated coins struck there.

A bullion fund was authorized under previous law within the Mint; section 205 allowed purchases of silver made under section 104 to be paid for from this fund. Another Mint account, the minor coinage metal fund, used to purchase copper and other metals for cents and nickels, was redesignated the coinage metal fund by section 206, usable for all denominations, and that section eliminated statutory limits on how much money can be in that fund.

Section 207 repealed obsolete limitations on wastage in the Mint's operations, but directed that administrative regulations be developed on the subject, which could be more easily changed. Section 208 repealed a provision of the 1873 act requiring coinage dies for the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>, which are dated, to be destroyed at the end of each year. Section 209 rephrased statutory provisions allowing the Treasury to sell silver at a price not less than $1.292929 per ounce, and allowed it to sell silver to other government departments for less. Section 210 repealed the 1933 provision regarding the legal tender status of coins. The law prior to 1965 made it a felony to forge silver coins; this was amended by section 211 to forbid the counterfeiting of coins with denomination greater than five cents. Section 212 made using coins as security for loans a misdemeanor if the secretary has made a proclamation in the <a href="Federal%20Register">Federal Register</a> proscribing their use as collateral.

Sections 301 to 303 establish a Joint Commission on the Coinage in the Executive Branch, chaired by the Treasury Secretary. Its membership was to include the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Commerce Secretary</a>, <a href="Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget">Budget Director</a>, Mint Director, six members of the House, six of the Senate, and eight members of the public, appointed by the president. If a member of the commission left the position that qualified him for membership, he would leave the commission as well. The members of the public were not to have any financial conflicts of interest.

The Joint Commission was tasked to report on the implementation of the Coinage Act of 1965, and make recommendations from time to time to the president, the Treasury Secretary, and Congress. The matters within its remit were to include technological advances, the need of the economy for coins, whether the U.S. should continue to maintain the price of silver, and whether the silver dollar should again be minted. Section 304 appropriated such money as may be needed to carry out the Coinage Act.

The Mint began to strike the first of the 1965-dated clad coins, quarters, on August 23 of that year, making them the first U.S. coins to bear that date. By November 1965, with the Christmas shopping season beginning, the Fed had only 15 million of the old silver quarters in reserve. That month, though, the Mint released over 230 million of the new clad quarters, and stated that an equal number would be issued every month. This figure quadrupled the previous record monthly production. The new dime and half dollar were released in early 1966, a time when flowback to the Fed increased for all denominations being struck except the half dollar. That denomination failed to return to circulation, as they continued to be withdrawn. The Mint continued to strike 1964-dated silver pieces under the authority of the Coinage Act until 1966, when Secretary Fowler announced, "the coin shortage is over". In July 1966, the Treasury announced that coins struck after August 1, 1966, would bear the date of minting.

Silver inventories at the Treasury continued to drop through 1966 as the government attempted to maintain the $1.2929 price of silver. The Joint Commission on the Coinage, authorized by the Coinage Act, held its first meeting in May 1967 to recommend how to deal with the situation. At its recommendation, the Treasury discontinued sales it deemed speculative, and to foreign buyers, attempting to supply only U.S. industry at that price, and resulting in a two-tier price system for silver. It also invoked its authority under the Coinage Act to prohibit the melting or export of silver coins. In June 1967, it obtained legislation making silver certificates no longer exchangeable for bullion effective after a year. After the Joint Commission's second meeting, in July 1967, the Treasury announced that it would no longer attempt to maintain the $1.2929 price as it could keep the nation supplied even if all the remaining silver coins vanished from circulation, as they soon did. By the time silver certificate redemptions ended on June 24, 1968, the price of silver had risen to $2.56 per ounce. Although the Joint Commission in December 1968 voted to recommend making the prohibitions on melting or exporting silver coin permanent, it reconsidered and in March 1969, the bans were lifted. In November 1969, the government left the silver market, making its final sales of bullion to the <a href="Franklin%20Mint">Franklin Mint</a>. Mint marks returned to the coinage in 1968.

With the end of the Coinage Act's five-year prohibition on the striking of silver dollars approaching in 1969 and 1970, many in Congress wanted a new silver dollar, bearing the image of the recently deceased president, <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. The melt value of the new part-silver half dollars had approached their face value, and in 1969, the Joint Commission recommended the elimination of that metal from the halves. The battle over whether to have silver in the proposed dollar proved contentious, and it was not until December 31, 1970, that President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> signed legislation for a circulating half dollar and <a href="Eisenhower%20dollar">Eisenhower dollar</a>, both silverless, with part-silver collector's versions of the dollar also authorized. The same bill authorized the sale of the remaining old silver dollars in government inventories, many from the <a href="Carson%20City%20Mint">Carson City Mint</a>. The base metal dollar and half dollar were struck beginning in 1971. Both failed to circulate: the "Ike dollar" because of its size, and the half dollar because its place in commerce had been lost during its long absence.

SMS "Braunschweig" was the first of five <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the built for the German "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy). She was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> in October 1901, <a href="ship%20launching">launched</a> in December 1902, and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> in October 1904. She was named after the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brunswick">Duchy of Brunswick</a> (). The ship was armed with a battery of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">guns</a> and had a top speed of . Like all other pre-dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century, "Braunschweig" was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, her career as a front-line battleship was cut short.

The ship served in the <a href="II%20Battle%20Squadron">II Squadron</a> of the German fleet after entering service. During this period, she was occupied with extensive annual training, as well as making good-will visits to foreign countries. She also served as a <a href="flagship">flagship</a> for most of her pre-war career. Surpassed by new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s, "Braunschweig" was decommissioned in 1913, but reactivated a year later following the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. She was assigned to the <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Battle Squadron</a>, which operated in both the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, protecting the German coast, and the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, where it opposed the Russian <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>. "Braunschweig" saw action during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">Battle of the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915, when she engaged the Russian battleship .

By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the "Kaiserliche Marine" to withdraw older battleships like "Braunschweig", and she spent the rest of the war first as a <a href="command%20ship">headquarters ship</a>, then as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>, and finally as a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a>. Under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, she was retained after the end of the war and modernized in 1921–22. "Braunschweig" served in the reformed "<a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>", operating as the flagship of naval forces assigned to the North Sea. She made several cruises abroad, including a voyage into the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> in 1924. The ship was decommissioned again in January 1926 and was stricken from the <a href="naval%20register">naval register</a> in March 1931, <a href="hulk%20%28ship%29">hulked</a>, and subsequently <a href="Ship%20breaking">broken up for scrap</a>.

With the passage of the <a href="German%20Naval%20Laws">Second Naval Law</a> under the direction of "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" ("VAdm"—Vice Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a> in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships, to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a>, the supplier of naval artillery to the "<a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy) had developed <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing</a>, guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the "Wittelsbach"s. The Design Department of the "<a href="Reichsmarineamt">Reichsmarineamt</a>" (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s as torpedoes became more effective. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906. "Dreadnought"s revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including "Braunschweig".

"Braunschweig" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. At full load, she <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> . Her crew consisted of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical <a href="triple-expansion%20engine">triple-expansion engine</a>s that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six <a href="Scotch%20marine%20boiler">cylindrical boilers</a>, all of which burned coal. "Braunschweig"s powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of .

"Braunschweig"s armament consisted of a <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> of four <a href="28%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">28 cm (11 in) SK L/40 guns</a> in twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, one fore and one aft of the central <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. Her <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> consisted of fourteen <a href="17%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20gun">17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns</a> and eighteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/35%20naval%20gun">8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/35 quick-firing guns</a>. The armament suite was rounded out with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all mounted submerged in the hull. One tube was in the bow, two were on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, and the final tube was in the stern. "Braunschweig" was protected with <a href="Krupp%20armor">Krupp armor</a>. Her <a href="armored%20belt">armored belt</a> was thick, with the heavier armor in the central portion that protected her <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and propulsion machinery spaces, and the thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.

"Braunschweig" was laid down on 24 October 1901 at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> shipyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> under construction number 97. The first of her class, she was ordered under the contract name "H" as a new unit for the fleet. The "Braunschweig" class, which took its name from the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a>, included four other vessels: , , , and . The ship was launched on 20 December 1902 and was named for the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brunswick">Duchy of Braunschweig</a>, and was <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the fleet on 15 October 1904. She then began <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a>, which lasted to the end of December. She had already been assigned to the <a href="II%20Squadron">II Squadron</a> of the main fleet on 25 September, taking the place of the old <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> , though she did not formally join the unit until after trials concluded in late December. Upon joining the squadron, she replaced the battleship as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" ("KAdm"—Rear Admiral) <a href="Alfred%20Breusing">Alfred Breusing</a>, the squadron's deputy commander.

For the next several years, "Braunschweig" and the rest of the fleet were occupied with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise in June and July, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. During torpedo training on 16 February 1905, "Wörth" ran aground off <a href="Stollergrund">Stollergrund</a>; "Braunschweig" unsuccessfully attempted to pull her free and other ships were called to come to "Wörth"s aid. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British <a href="Channel%20Fleet">Channel Fleet</a> visited the German fleet in <a href="Swinem%C3%BCnde">Swinemünde</a>. On 22 November, <a href="Prince%20Heinrich">Prince Heinrich</a> boarded the ship in Kiel, which then steamed to Denmark to take Prince Carl of Denmark to Norway, where he was crowned <a href="Haakon%20VII%20of%20Norway">Haakon VII of Norway</a>. "Braunschweig" was back in Kiel by 30 November. On 14 December, "Braunschweig" was replaced as the deputy commander's flagship by the battleship , which had larger facilities for a command staff.

The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. "Braunschweig" resumed deputy flagship duties on 25 September 1907, when "KAdm" <a href="Adolf%20Paschen">Adolf Paschen</a> transferred his flag from "Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm", which was to be decommissioned. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. In 1908 and 1909, the fleet, which had been renamed the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, undertook major cruises into the Atlantic Ocean. During the first, which began on 13 July 1908, "Braunschweig" stopped in <a href="Las%20Palmas">Las Palmas</a> from 23 July to 7 August before returning to Germany on 13 August for the autumn maneuvers. The 1909 cruise began on 7 July and lasted until 1 August, and included a visit to <a href="A%20Coru%C3%B1a">A Coruña</a>, Spain, from 18 to 27 July. In September 1909, after the conclusion of the autumn fleet maneuvers, the crew from "Braunschweig" was sent to form the core of the new <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a> , while the crew from was sent to "Braunschweig".

The fleet held training exercises in the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> in May 1910. For the summer cruises of 1910 and 1911, the German fleet went to Norwegian waters; both years also saw winter cruises in the western Baltic. On 26 April 1912, "Braunschweig" was relieved as the deputy flagship by the battleship . That year, "Braunschweig" did not take part in the summer training cruise, instead having her crew temporarily reduced. More sailors arrived on 8 December, allowing her to return to active service with the V Division of the III Squadron, under the command of "KAdm" <a href="Ehrhard%20Schmidt">Ehrhard Schmidt</a>. She took part in a winter training cruise in February and March 1913, along with exercises in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> in May. The ship's return to service proved to be short-lived; on 30 July her crew was reduced a second time in Kiel, now to man the new battleship . "Braunschweig" was assigned to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea as an inactive vessel.

On 28 July 1914, Germany's ally, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, declared war on <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, beginning <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. That day, "Braunschweig" and the rest of the Reserve Division were reactivated for wartime service. The ship was recommissioned on 1 August and joined the <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Battle Squadron</a>, which also included her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> "Elsass" and the five "Wittelsbach"-class battleships, and was commanded by Schmidt, who had by now been promoted to "Vizeadmiral". The next day "KAdm" <a href="Hermann%20Alberts">Hermann Alberts</a>, the deputy commander of the squadron, came aboard the ship, making her his flagship. The installation of necessary equipment was completed by 7 August, and the IV Squadron ships were ready for operations four days later. "Braunschweig" began individual and then squadron training, which lasted until early September. The training exercises were interrupted on 26 August, when the ships were sent to rescue the stranded <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which had run aground off the island of <a href="Odensholm">Odensholm</a> in the eastern Baltic. By 28 August, the ship's crew had been forced to detonate explosives to destroy "Magdeburg" before the relief force had arrived. As a result, "Braunschweig" and the rest of the squadron returned to <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> that day for further training exercises.

Starting on 3 September, the IV Squadron, assisted by the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. Following the operation, "Braunschweig" was tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea around the mouth of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. On 12 September, an accidental explosion aboard the ship killed six men and wounded sixteen more, but only lightly damaged the ship. Later that month, the IV Squadron ships were transferred back to the Baltic. The army had requested that the navy make a <a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">demonstration</a> to keep Russian reserves along the Baltic coast, instead of allowing the Russians to re-deploy them to <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>. On 21 September, Alberts transferred his flag to the battleship . The following day, Prince Heinrich, the commander-in-chief of naval forces in the Baltic, came aboard "Braunschweig", making her his flagship for the operation, which was also to include the older <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of the <a href="V%20Battle%20Squadron">V Battle Squadron</a>. These ships were sent to <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> to embark ground forces, while "Braunschweig" and the IV Squadron steamed in advance. The operation was called off early, after British <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s were reportedly sighted in the Baltic. The two squadrons rendezvoused off Bornholm before proceeded on to Kiel, arriving on 26 September.
From 5 December 1914 to 2 March 1915, "Braunschweig" was occupied with <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a> duties in the mouth of the Elbe. On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Libau</a> (in modern <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>). "Braunschweig" and the other ships were stationed off <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> to intercept any Russian cruisers that might attempt to intervene in the landings; the Russians, however, did not do so. On 10 May, the British submarines and spotted the IV Squadron, but were too far away to attack them. Another stint in the Elbe followed from 28 May to 3 July. The next day, following the loss of the <a href="Minelayer">minelaying</a> cruiser in the Baltic, the IV Squadron ships were transferred to reinforce the German naval forces in the area. The army had again requested naval assistance, this time to support operations around Libau. On 7 July, "Braunschweig" left Kiel, bound for the eastern Baltic. On 11 and 19 July, German cruisers, with the IV Squadron ships in support, conducted sweeps in the Baltic, though without engaging Russian forces.

In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> of Russian naval forces, to aid the German Army advancing on the city. The IV Squadron was joined by the <a href="I%20Battle%20Squadron">I Battle Squadron</a>, which consisted of the eight and s, from the High Seas Fleet, along with three <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s and a host of smaller craft. The task force was placed under command of "VAdm" <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>, though operational command remained with Schmidt. On the morning of 8 August, the Germans made their initial push into the Gulf; "Braunschweig" and "Elsass" were tasked with engaging the Russian pre-dreadnought and preventing her from disrupting the German minesweepers. When it became clear that the minesweepers could not clear the minefield before nightfall, Schmidt called off the attempt. A second attempt was made on 16 August; this time, "Braunschweig" remained outside the Gulf while the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s and took over the task of dealing with "Slava". By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. Reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day.

"Braunschweig" remained in Libau until late September, when she was recalled to Kiel, arriving on the 23rd. Two days later, she resumed guard ship duty in the mouth of the Elbe, which lasted until 4 October. She returned to Kiel the next day, and on 12 October was deployed back to Libau to guard the port, along with "Elsass" and . On 12 October, the British submarine fired a single torpedo at "Braunschweig", though it failed to hit its target. On 14 December, <a href="German%20Emperor">Kaiser</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> visited the ship. By this point in the war, the Navy was encountering difficulties in manning more important vessels, and the insufficient underwater protection of the older German battleships rendered them unusable in the Baltic, owing to the threat from submarines. As a result, the IV Squadron was dissolved and most of the ships were placed in reserve. "Braunschweig", however, became the flagship of "VAdm" <a href="Friedrich%20Schultz">Friedrich Schultz</a>, the Commander of Reconnaissance Forces in the Eastern Baltic Sea. On 5 January 1916, "Braunschweig", "Mecklenburg", the light cruiser , and the X Torpedo-boat Flotilla left Libau for Kiel before continuing on to <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>. There, "Braunschweig" underwent repairs at the <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss">Blohm & Voss</a> shipyard, which lasted from 10 January to 26 February.

On 4 March, the ship arrived back in Libau, where she began her duties as Schultz's command ship. During this period, her crew was reduced to the point that she was only capable of providing harbor defense. In June, the naval command further reduced the number of ships operating in the Baltic, and Schultz, whose role had been taken over by the commander of the <a href="VI%20Scouting%20Group">VI Scouting Group</a>, left "Braunschweig" on 3 June. The ship left Libau for Kiel on 1 August, arriving there two days later. On 24 August, her crew was reduced further. She was thereafter used as a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> for naval recruits, until 20 August 1917, when she was decommissioned and used as a <a href="barracks%20ship">barracks ship</a> until the end of the war in November 1918. In this role, the ship supported the III Submarine Flotilla.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which ended the war, specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the ""Deutschland" or "Lothringen" types." "Braunschweig" was chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed <a href="Reichsmarine">Reichsmarine</a>. The ship was modernized at the <a href="Kriegsmarinewerft%20Wilhelmshaven">"Reichsmarinewerft"</a> in Wilhelmshaven from 1921–1922. She was recommissioned on 1 December 1921, initially with a reduced crew, though work on the ship continued on into the following year. Work was finished and her crew was completed on 1 March 1922, at which point she replaced the light cruiser as the flagship of the "<a href="Marinestation%20der%20Nordsee">Marinestation der Nordsee</a>" (Naval Station of the North Sea), then commanded by "KAdm" <a href="Konrad%20Mommsen">Konrad Mommsen</a>. At the time, the unit consisted of "Braunschweig", "Hamburg", the cruiser , and several torpedo boats. On 11 April, Mommsen was replaced by "KAdm" <a href="Theodor%20P%C3%BCllen">Theodor Püllen</a>. In July, "Braunschweig" visited Norway, including stops in <a href="Fretheim">Fretheim</a> from 8 to 13 July and <a href="Mundal">Mundal</a> from 13 to 17 July. From late August to 15 September, the ships of the "Marinestation der Nordsee" held joint maneuvers with those from the "<a href="Marinestation%20der%20Ostsee">Marinestation der Ostsee</a>" (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea), and during these "<a href="Reichspr%C3%A4sident">Reichspräsident</a>" (President of Germany) <a href="Friedrich%20Ebert">Friedrich Ebert</a> came aboard the ship to observe the exercises on 5 and 6 September.

In 1923, "Braunschweig"s bridge was rebuilt and enlarged. The ship's program followed the same pattern as the previous year, with visits to foreign ports in July; "Braunschweig" stopped in <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, Finland, and <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, Sweden, during her trip. Joint maneuvers were held again in August and September, after which Püllen left the ship. On 15 October, "VAdm" <a href="Hans%20Zenker">Hans Zenker</a>, then the "Oberbefehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte" ("O.d.S"—Commander of Naval Forces), reorganized the fleet structure, disbanding the North Sea and Baltic commands and replacing them with organizations based on ship type. "Braunschweig" was now assigned to the "Linienschiffsdivision" (Battleship Division), where she served as Zenker's flagship. The division also included the battleship "Hannover". In February and March 1924, the ship served as an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a> in the Baltic. The usual cruise abroad in July 1924 ventured further than in previous years, with a trip into the Atlantic. "Braunschweig" stopped in A Coruña from 6 to 13 July. Fleet maneuvers followed at the end of August, and at their conclusion, the fleet anchored off <a href="Sassnitz">Sassnitz</a> for a <a href="naval%20review">naval review</a> for "<a href="Admiral">Admiral</a>" <a href="Paul%20Behncke">Paul Behncke</a>, the retiring "Chef der Admiralität" (Chief of the Admiralty). Zenker was promoted to replace Behncke, who was in turn replaced by now-"VAdm" Mommsen, who again made "Braunschweig" his flagship. Further exercises were held from 29 September to 5 October.

On 1 April 1925, the command structure of the fleet was again reorganized, the "O.d.S" becoming the "Flottenchef". The fleet was also expanded with the addition of the battleships "Hessen" and "Elsass", though "Braunschweig" remained the flagship. Later that month, the battleships and cruisers of the fleet went on a cruise in the Baltic, and the summer cruise in June went to Norway. "Braunschweig" made stops in several cities, including <a href="Stavanger">Stavanger</a> and <a href="Balholmen">Balholmen</a>. "Braunschweig" was present during the <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a>, which also saw the visit of the Swedish fleet. On 31 January 1926, "Brauschweig" was decommissioned, her role as fleet flagship being taken by . On 31 March 1931, "Braunschweig" was stricken from the naval register and temporarily used as a <a href="Hulk%20%28ship%29">hulk</a> in Wilhelmshaven before being broken up for scrap.

Battle of Verrières Ridge

The Battle of Verrières Ridge was a series of engagements fought as part of the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Normandy">Battle of Normandy</a>, in <a href="Calvados%20%28department%29">Calvados</a>, during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. The main combatants were two <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> infantry divisions—with additional support from the <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Armoured%20Brigade">Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade</a>—against elements of three <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> <a href="Panzer">Panzer</a> divisions. The battle was part of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> and Canadian attempts to break out of <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, and took place from 19 to 25 July 1944, being part of both <a href="Operation%20Atlantic">Operation Atlantic</a> (18–21 July) and <a href="Operation%20Spring">Operation Spring</a> (25–27 July).

The immediate <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> objective was Verrières Ridge, a belt of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a>. The ridge was occupied by battle-hardened German veterans, who had fallen back from Caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position. Over the course of six days, substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture the ridge. Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine, as well as strong and effective counterattacks by "Panzer" formations, resulted in heavy Allied casualties for little strategic gain.

From the perspective of the <a href="First%20Canadian%20Army">Canadian 1st Army</a>, the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations—the most notable being a highly controversial attack by <a href="Black%20Watch%20of%20Canada">The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada</a> on 25 July, in which 315 of its 325 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. This attack—the costliest single day for a Canadian battalion since the 1942 <a href="Dieppe%20Raid">Dieppe Raid</a>—has become one of the most contentious and critically analysed events in Canadian military history.

While failing to achieve its original objective, an important strategic result of the Battle of Verrières Ridge was to aid the overwhelmingly successful <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a>, by tying down powerful German Panzer formations that might otherwise have been moved to counter-attack Cobra.

Verrières Ridge lies south of the city of Caen, overlooking broad plains and dominating the countryside between Caen and Falaise. Although a major <a href="D-Day">D-Day</a> objective for <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> forces, the Allied push inland was halted short of Caen and positional warfare ensued until the first week of July.

On 9 July, <a href="Operation%20Charnwood">Operation Charnwood</a> succeeded in taking the northern half of the city, but the <a href="I%20SS%20Panzer%20Corps">I SS Panzer Corps</a> maintained defensive positions in the remainder of Caen.

A week later, <a href="Operation%20Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a> renewed the British offensive, and Caen finally fell on 19 July, although by this time the city had been largely devastated. The next Anglo-Canadian goal was the town of <a href="Falaise%2C%20Calvados">Falaise</a>, but Verrières Ridge—now strongly defended by the I SS Panzer Corps—stood in their path. Elements of the British 2nd Army secured part of the adjacent <a href="Bourgu%C3%A9bus">Bourguébus</a> Ridge and managed to gain a foothold on Verrières Ridge but were unable to dislodge its German defenders.

The Canadian II Corps—commanded by <a href="Lieutenant-General%20%28Canada%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Guy%20Simonds">Guy Simonds</a>—initially assigned two infantry divisions and one armoured brigade to the assault on the German positions around Verrières. The <a href="3rd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">Canadian 3rd Infantry Division</a>—having taken heavy casualties during the first six weeks of the Normandy campaign—was given a supporting role.

The onus of the task therefore fell on the fresh, though relatively inexperienced, <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">Canadian 2nd Infantry Division</a>, along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade. Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British I Corps</a>: the <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%20%28World%20War%20II%29">51st (Highland) Division</a>, the <a href="Guards%20Armoured%20Division">Guards Armoured Division</a>, and the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 7th Armoured Division</a>. Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts, the British units played a minor part in the battle.

While British forces had been battling for Caen, elements of Dietrich's I SS Panzer Corps—part of "<a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Generalfeldmarschall</a>" <a href="G%C3%BCnther%20von%20Kluge">Günther von Kluge</a>'s <a href="Army%20Group%20B">Army Group B</a>—had turned Verrières Ridge into their main defensive position along the Anglo-Canadian front.

Although not particularly high, the ridge's topography meant that advancing forces would be exposed to fire from German positions across the River Orne, from the ridge and from the nearby German-held industrial hamlet of <a href="Saint-Martin-de-Fontenay">St. Martin</a>.

Two powerful formations—the <a href="12th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division">12th SS</a> and <a href="1st%20SS%20Division%20Leibstandarte%20SS%20Adolf%20Hitler">1st SS Panzer Divisions</a>—held the ridge supported by artillery, dug-in <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger tanks</a> and mortar emplacements. A third—the <a href="9th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hohenstaufen">9th SS Panzer Division</a>—was held in reserve.

Further support was available from the <a href="272nd%20Grenadier%20Infantry%20Division">272nd Grenadier Infantry Division</a> (a force composed mainly of Russian and Polish combatants that had been raised in 1943), the <a href="116th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">116th Panzer Division</a> and a battalion of Tiger tanks.

In a follow-up to Operation Goodwood on 19 July, the Calgary Highlanders attempted to take the northern spur of Verrières Ridge but German <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> fire limited their progress. Tanks from the <a href="Sherbrooke%20Hussars">Sherbrooke Fusiliers</a> were sent to support the battalion and eliminated several machine-gun positions on either side of Point 67. The Highlanders eventually managed to dig in, despite accurate return fire.

Over the next few hours, they strengthened their position and the 5th and 6th Canadian Infantry Brigades made repeated attempts to exploit the gains.

Against a tenacious German defence and minor infantry and tank counter-attacks, the Canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties. Simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for the following day, with the goals of capturing both the eastern side of the Orne river and the main slopes of Verrières Ridge.

The next attack took place on 20 July as part of <a href="Operation%20Atlantic">Operation Atlantic</a>. It was led by the <a href="The%20South%20Saskatchewan%20Regiment">South Saskatchewan Regiment</a>, with supporting units from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada. In the early hours of 20 July, the Camerons secured a position in <a href="Saint-Andr%C3%A9-sur-Orne">St André-sur-Orne</a> but were quickly pinned down by German infantry and tanks.

At the same time, the South Saskatchewan Regiment moved directly up the slopes of Verrières Ridge, supported by tanks and <a href="Hawker%20Typhoon">Hawker Typhoon</a> ground attack aircraft. The Canadian attack faltered in torrential rain, which rendered air support useless and turned the ground into mud. Counter-attacks by two "Panzer" divisions threw the South Saskatchewans back past their support lines and their supporting battalion—the <a href="The%20Essex%20Scottish%20Regiment">Essex Scottish</a>—came under attack.

The Essex Scottish lost over 300 men as it tried to hold back the advance of the 12th SS Panzer Division, while to the east the remainder of I SS Panzer Corps engaged British forces in <a href="Operation%20Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a>, the largest armoured battle of the campaign. By the end of the day, the South Saskatchewans had taken 282 casualties and the ridge was still in enemy hands.

Despite these setbacks, Simonds was adamant that Verrières Ridge should be taken and sent in the <a href="Black%20Watch%20of%20Canada">Black Watch</a> and the Calgary Highlanders to stabilise the precarious Allied position. Minor counter-attacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations and by the time the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge, including a now secure position on Point 67. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.

With the capture of Caen on 19 July, an Anglo-Canadian breakout had become strategically feasible.

In the American sector, <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Omar%20Bradley">Omar Bradley</a>—commander of the U.S. 1st Army—had been planning his own breakout (codenamed <a href="Operation%20Cobra">Operation Cobra</a>) and Simonds too began preparing a new offensive, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Spring">Operation Spring</a>. Spring was originally conceived by Field Marshal <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a> as a "holding attack", designed to tie down German forces while Cobra was under way.

On 22 July, however, with Operation Atlantic having failed to achieve its aims, Simonds changed the objective of Operation Spring to a breakout offensive. With Verrières Ridge taken, Simonds could launch armour and artillery attacks from its southern flank to push the Germans further back. This would clear the Caen-Falaise road, and his two British armoured divisions could then advance south to Falaise.

Operation Spring was scheduled in four tightly timed phases. The Calgary Highlanders would attack Bourguébus Ridge and <a href="May-sur-Orne">May-sur-Orne</a> to secure the flanks of the main thrust, which was to be a move on Verrières Ridge by the Black Watch, along with armoured support from the British 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. The plan called for the offensive to start on 23 July but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours.

Taking advantage of this respite, the I SS Panzer Corps reinforced the ridge with an additional four battalions, 480 tanks and 500 guns. Allied Intelligence learned of this reinforcement through <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> signals intercepts and advised Simonds's headquarters.

On 25 July, two days later than originally planned owing to the weather, Operation Spring was launched. The Black Watch were scheduled to begin their attack at about 05:30 from an assembly area at St Martin, south of Caen. The Canadians ran into heavy German resistance on the St Martin road and did not arrive at their assembly area until close to 08:00. By that time, the Black Watch's two highest-ranking officers had been killed and command fell to Major Phil Griffin. At 08:30, he met with 5th Brigade commander, Brigadier General W. J. Megill and despite the non-arrival of most of their promised armoured support, the decision was taken for the attack to proceed.

At 09:30, as the Canadian infantry regiments advanced up the ridge, they were easy targets for the well-entrenched German machine gun nests and mortar pits, supported by tanks, <a href="8.8%20cm%20Flak%2018/36/37/41">anti-tank gun</a>s, and "<a href="Nebelwerfer">Nebelwerfer</a>" rocket artillery. To make matters worse, the Black Watch communications were knocked out within minutes of the start of their assault.

Very few members of the Black Watch Regiment managed to make it to the crest of the ridge and those who did were subjected to an even heavier bombardment as they ran into the counter-attacking forces of the 272nd Infantry Division and the 9th SS .

Of the 325 men that left the assembly area, 315 were killed, wounded or captured. The Black Watch lost all its senior commanders, including Major Phil Griffin, with two companies virtually annihilated.

All of the gains made by the Black Watch and Calgary Highlanders were lost to German counterattacks, which inflicted heavy losses on the Highlanders and the previously unscathed Black Watch support company. The Black Watch had to be reformed after Verrières Ridge, having sustained more casualties than any Canadian infantry battalion since the disastrous 1942 <a href="Dieppe%20Raid">raid on Dieppe</a>.

The central area of the ridge near Verrières Village was eventually taken and held by the <a href="Royal%20Hamilton%20Light%20Infantry">Royal Hamilton Light Infantry</a>. The east side was also taken, but subsequently lost, although two British armoured brigades were able to secure significant footholds near the positions of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry.

The failure to capture the ridge had little effect on the overall Allied position, as the success of Operation Cobra was so overwhelming that the Germans diverted significant resources, including two "Panzer" divisions, from the ridge in their attempt to keep Bradley's forces boxed in. With German defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks on the ridge were successful; <a href="Operation%20Totalize">Operation Totalize</a> finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.

Allied casualty figures for the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian dead are buried in <a href="Bretteville-sur-Laize%20Canadian%20War%20Cemetery">Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery</a>, between Caen and Falaise.

The Canadian Official Historian <a href="Charles%20Perry%20Stacey">Charles Stacey</a>, and military historian Michael Reynolds, wrote that German casualty figures for individual operations are difficult to determine. Stacey attributes this to the gradual degradation of the German logistics chain, leaving incomplete records, and Reynolds wrote that units sometimes over-reported their losses, in the hope of receiving more reinforcements.

German losses for the battle were significantly fewer than those suffered by the Canadians. According to Reynolds, between 16 July and 1 August, the 1st SS Panzer Division lost 1,092 men killed, wounded or captured—along with 11 <a href="Panzer%20IV">"Panzer" IV</a> tanks and 10 <a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">"Sturmgeschütz" III</a> self-propelled guns—in fighting across all its fronts including at Verrières. Over a similar period, he estimates the 12th SS Panzer Division—in all sectors—suffered only 134 casualties. Many of the German fallen are buried at <a href="La%20Cambe%20German%20war%20cemetery">La Cambe German war cemetery</a>.

The Battle of Verrières Ridge —although given no particular prominence in <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Germany">German military history</a> — is one of the First Canadian Army's most scrutinised actions.

The matter was first brought to public attention by Stacey, who wrestled with the question of how to present the battle in the Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War, and was required to make minor changes to the narrative of the battle by Simonds. At the time Stacey was writing the history, as senior historian of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Simonds was the <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Canadian%20Army">Chief of the General Staff</a> of the Canadian Army, effectively his boss.

The report on Operation Spring by Simonds was released after the war and blamed its failure on "11th hour reinforcement" of German lines and "strategically unsound execution on the part of Major Phillip Griffin and the Black Watch". Declassified wartime documents show that Simonds, along with several others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on 23 July of a massive German build-up on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and <a href="David%20Bercuson">David Bercuson</a>, accused Simonds of being careless with the lives of his men. Terry Copp and John A. English wrote that, given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.

Operation Spring succeeded in its later-defined objective of a "holding attack" and aided the overwhelming success of Operation Cobra, by tying down powerful German formations that might otherwise have been in the American sector, thus precluding any immediate inquiry into its failure.

The German commander of the Normandy Sector—Günther von Kluge—was at the Canadian front on 25 July, instead of the American front where the eventual breakout occurred. The Battle of Verrières Ridge had little overall effect on British attempts to break out of Caen, as significant resources were transferred to the American front in the aftermath of Cobra, to exploit Bradley's success; the ridge eventually fell to the general Allied advance.

1877 Wimbledon Championship

The 1877 Wimbledon Championship was a men's <a href="tennis">tennis</a> tournament held at the <a href="All%20England%20Lawn%20Tennis%20and%20Croquet%20Club">All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club</a> (AEC & LTC) in <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon, London</a>. It was the world's first official lawn tennis tournament, and was later recognised as the first <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29">Grand Slam</a> tournament or "Major". The AEC & LTC had been founded in July 1868, as the All England Croquet Club; lawn tennis was introduced in February 1875 to compensate for the waning interest in <a href="croquet">croquet</a>. In June 1877 the club decided to organise a tennis tournament to pay for the repair of its pony <a href="Roller%20%28agricultural%20tool%29">roller</a>, needed to maintain the lawns. A set of rules was drawn up for the tournament, derived from the first standardised rules of tennis issued by the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> in May 1875.

The Gentlemen's Singles competition, the only event of the championship, was contested on <a href="grass%20court">grass court</a>s by 22 players who each paid one <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guinea</a> to participate. The tournament started on 9 July 1877, and the final – delayed for three days by rain – was played on 19 July in front of a crowd of about 200 people who each paid an entry fee of one <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a>. The winner received 12 guineas in prize money and a silver challenge cup, valued at 25 guineas, donated by the sports magazine "<a href="The%20Field%20%28magazine%29">The Field</a>". <a href="Spencer%20Gore%20%28sportsman%29">Spencer Gore</a>, a 27-year-old <a href="Rackets%20%28sport%29">rackets</a> player from <a href="Wandsworth">Wandsworth</a>, became the first Wimbledon champion by defeating <a href="William%20Marshall%20%28tennis%29">William Marshall</a>, a 28-year-old <a href="real%20tennis">real tennis</a> player, in three straight sets in a final that lasted 48 minutes. The tournament made a profit of £10 and the pony roller remained in use. An analysis made after the tournament led to some modifications of the rules regarding the court dimensions.

The <a href="History%20of%20tennis">origin of tennis</a> lies in the monastic <a href="cloister">cloister</a>s in 12th-century France, where the ball was struck with the palm of the hand in a game called "<a href="jeu%20de%20paume">jeu de paume</a>". <a href="Racket%20%28sports%20equipment%29">Rackets</a> were introduced to the game in the early 16th century. This original version of tennis, now called "<a href="real%20tennis">real tennis</a>", was mostly played indoors and popular among the royalty and gentry, while a crude outdoor version called "<a href="longue%20paume">longue paume</a>" was played by the populace. The prominence of the game declined in the 17th and 18th centuries, although there are sporadic mentions of a "long tennis" or "field tennis" version in the second half of the 18th century.

Between 1858 and 1873 several people in <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> England experimented with a lawn version of tennis. Major <a href="Harry%20Gem">Harry Gem</a> and <a href="Augurio%20Perera">Augurio Perera</a> demonstrated their game of "Pelota" (Spanish for "ball") and in 1872 created the world's first lawn tennis club at <a href="Leamington%20Spa">Leamington Spa</a>. In February 1874 <a href="Walter%20Clopton%20Wingfield">Major Clopton Wingfield</a> introduced his version of lawn tennis, called "Sphairistikè"; on his patent application, he described it as a "New and Improved Court for Playing the Ancient Game of Tennis", and its rules were published in an eight-page booklet. Wingfield is widely credited with popularising the new game through his energetic promotional efforts. The "Sphairistikè" court was hourglass-shaped, wider at the baseline than at the net. The service was made from a single side in a <a href="lozenge">lozenge</a> shaped box situated in the middle of the court and it had to bounce beyond the service line. In November 1874 Wingfield published a second, expanded edition of "The Book of the Game", which had 12 rules and featured a larger court and a slightly lower net.

The <a href="All%20England%20Lawn%20Tennis%20and%20Croquet%20Club">All England Croquet Club</a> was founded on 23 July 1868 by six gentlemen at the offices of "<a href="The%20Field%20%28magazine%29">The Field</a>", a weekly country and sports magazine. After a yearlong search a suitable ground of four acres of meadowland was located between the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> and Worple Road in <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon</a>, then an outer suburb of London. The club's committee decided on 24 September 1869 to lease the ground and paid £50 rental for the first year, a fee which increased to £75 and £100, respectively, over the following two years. The increasing rent, coupled with a waning interest in the sedate sport of <a href="croquet">croquet</a>, was causing the club financial difficulties. In February 1875 it decided to introduce lawn tennis at its grounds to capitalise on the growing interest in this new sport and generate additional revenue. The proposal was made by <a href="Henry%20Jones%20%28writer%29">Henry Jones</a>, a sports writer who published extensively in "The Field" under his <a href="nom%20de%20plume">nom de plume</a> "Cavendish" and who had joined the club in 1869. The introduction of lawn tennis was approved at the annual meeting and the club's membership fee was set at two guineas to cover both sports. At a cost of £25, one croquet lawn was converted to a tennis court; soon after its completion on 25 February 1875, a dozen new club members joined. In 1876 four more lawns, a third of the ground, were handed over to lawn tennis to address the increase in new members. A committee member, George Nicol, was appointed to deal exclusively with lawn tennis affairs. Lawn tennis had become so popular that on 14 April 1877 the name of the club was formally changed, at the suggestion of founding member John H. Hale, to the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club (AEC&LTC).

On 3 March 1875 the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC), in its capacity as the governing body for rackets and real tennis, convened a meeting at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a> to test the various versions of lawn tennis with the aim to standardise the game's rules. Wingfield was present to demonstrate "Sphairistikè", as was John H. Hale, who presented his version called Germains Lawn Tennis; there is no record of either Gem or Perera being present to showcase "Pelota". After the meeting, the MCC Tennis Committee was tasked with framing the rules. On 29 May 1875 the MCC issued the "Laws of Lawn Tennis", the first unified rules for lawn tennis, which were adopted by the club on 24 June. These were significantly based on the rules introduced by Wingfield in February 1874 and published in his rule-booklet titled "Sphairistikè or Lawn Tennis". The MCC adopted Wingfield's hourglass-shaped court as well as the rackets method of scoring, in which the player who first scores 15 points wins the game and only the server ("hand-in") was able to score. The height of the net was set at 5 ft (1.52 m) at the posts and 4 ft (1.22 m) in the centre. Various aspects of these rules, including the characteristic court shape and the method of scoring, were the subject of prolonged debate in the press. The MCC rules were not universally adhered to following its publication and, among others, the "<a href="Prince%27s%20Club">Prince's Club</a>" in London stuck to playing on rectangular courts.

On 2 June 1877, at the suggestion of the All England Club secretary and founding member <a href="John%20Henry%20Walsh">John H. Walsh</a>, the club committee decided to organise a lawn tennis championship for amateurs, a Gentlemen's Singles event, which they hoped would generate enough funds to repair the broken pony <a href="Roller%20%28agricultural%20tool%29">roller</a> that was needed for the maintenance of the lawns. This championship became the world's first official lawn tennis tournament, and the first edition of what would later be called a <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29">Grand Slam</a> tournament (or "Major"). The committee agreed to hold the tournament on the condition that it would not endanger the club's limited funds; to ensure this, Henry Jones persuaded 20 members and friends of the club to guarantee a part of the tournament's financial requirement and made himself responsible for the remaining amount. Jones investigated all potential tournament locations in and around London but came to the conclusion that no other ground was more suitable than the Wimbledon premises at Worple Road. As a consequence, the remaining croquet lawns were converted to tennis courts.

The first public announcement of the tournament was published on 9 June 1877 in "The Field" magazine under the header "Lawn Tennis Championship":
The All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club, Wimbledon, propose to hold a lawn tennis meeting, open to all amateurs, on Monday, July 9th and following days. Entrance fee, <a href="%C2%A3sd">£1 1"s" 0"d"</a>. Names and addresses of competitors to be forwarded to the Hon. Sec. A.E.C. and L.T.C. before Saturday, July 7, or on that day before 2.15 p.m. at the club ground, Wimbledon. Two prizes will be given – one gold champion prize to the winner, one silver to the second player. The value of the prizes will depend on the number of entries, and will be declared before the draw; but in no case will they be less than the amount of the entrance money, and if there are ten and less than sixteen entries, they will be made up to £10 10"s" and £5 5"s" respectively.– Henry Jones – Hon Sec of the Lawn Tennis sub-committee

Players were instructed to provide their own racquets and wear shoes without heels. The announcement also stated that a programme would be available shortly with further details, including the rules to be adopted for the meeting. Invitations were sent to prospective participants. Potential visitors were informed that those arriving by horse and carriage should use the entrance at Worple Road while those who planned to come by foot were advised to use the railway path. Upon payment of the entrance fee, the participants were allowed to practise before the Championship on the twelve available courts with the provision that on Saturdays and during the croquet championship week, held the week before the tennis tournament, the croquet players had the first choice of courts. Practice balls, similar to the ones used for the tournament, were available from the club's gardener at a price of 12s per dozen balls. John H. Walsh, in his capacity as editor of "The Field", persuaded his employer to donate a cup worth 25 guineas for the winner; the "Field Cup". The cup was made of <a href="sterling%20silver">sterling silver</a> and had the inscription: "The All England Lawn Challenge Cup – Presented by the Proprietors of The Field – For competition by Amateurs – Wimbledon July 1877". On 6 July 1877, three days prior to the start of the tournament, a notice was published in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>":
Next week at the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club Ground a Lawn Tennis Championship Meeting will be held. The ground is situated close to the Wimbledon Station on the South Western Railway, and is sufficiently large for the erection of thirty "courts". On each day the competition will begin at 3.30, the first ties, of course, beginning on Monday. The Hon. Sec. of the meeting is Mr. J.H. Walsh, while Mr. H. Jones will officiate as referee. The entries are numerous.

The committee of the club was not satisfied with certain aspects of the 1875 MCC unified rules. To address these perceived shortcomings, a sub-committee consisting of <a href="Charles%20Gilbert%20Heathcote">Charles Gilbert Heathcote</a>, <a href="Julian%20Marshall">Julian Marshall</a> and <a href="Henry%20Jones%20%28writer%29">Henry Jones</a> was set up on 2 June 1877, to establish the rules applicable for the upcoming tournament. They reported back on 7 June with a new set of rules, derived but significantly different from those published by the MCC; in order not to offend the MCC, these rules were declared "provisional" and valid only for the championship:


These rules, drawn up by the club for this initial tournament, were eventually adopted for the entire sport and, with only slight modifications, have retained their validity. All matches during the tournament were played as best-of-five sets.

In accordance with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings, the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday, 7 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. in the club's pavilion. H.T. Gillson had the distinction of being the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament. The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis, with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a better view of the court.
The tournament began on Monday, 9 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. and daily programmes were available for <a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">sixpence</a>. On the first day, in sunny weather, ten matches were played, which completed the first round. Full match scores were published on the notice board inside the pavilion. F.N. Langham, a Cambridge tennis <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">blue</a>, was given a walkover in the first round when C.F. Buller, an <a href="Eton%20College">Etonian</a> and well-known rackets player, did not appear. Julian Marshall became the first player to win a five-set match when he fought back from being two sets down against Captain Grimston. <a href="Spencer%20Gore%20%28sportsman%29">Spencer Gore</a>, a 27-year-old rackets player from <a href="Wandsworth">Wandsworth</a> and at the time a <a href="land%20agent">land agent</a> and <a href="Surveying">surveyor</a> by profession, won his first round match against Henry Thomas Gillson in straight sets. The five second-round matches were played on Tuesday, 10 July, again in fine weather. Charles Gilbert Heathcote had a bye in the second round. J. Lambert became the first player in Wimbledon Championships' history to retire a match, conceding to <a href="Lestocq%20Robert%20Erskine">L.R. Erskine</a> after losing the first two sets. Julian Marshall again won a five-set match, this time against F.W. Oliver, while Gore defeated Montague Hankey in four sets.

The quarter-finals were played on Wednesday, 11 July, before a larger number of spectators than had attended the previous matches. Start of play was delayed from the scheduled 3:30p.m. due to strong winds. Gore defeated Langham in four sets, <a href="William%20Marshall%20%28tennis%29">William Marshall</a> beat Erskine, also in four sets, and Julian Marshall, who injured his knee during the match after a fall, lost to Heathcote in straight sets. The quarter-final matches left three players, instead of four, in the draw for the semi-finals scheduled for Thursday. To solve the situation lots were drawn and Marshall, a 28-year-old architect and Cambridge real tennis blue, was given a bye to the final. His opponent would be Gore, who defeated Heathcote in straight sets in the only semi-final played. When the semi-final stage had concluded on Thursday, 12 July, play was suspended until next Monday, 16 July, to avoid a clash with the popular annual <a href="Eton%20v%20Harrow">Eton v Harrow</a> cricket match that was played at Lord's on Friday and Saturday.

The final was postponed from its scheduled start on Monday at 4p.m. until Thursday, 19 July, at 3:30p.m. because of rain. On Thursday it was still showery, causing the final to be further delayed by an hour. It began on a dead and slippery court in front of about 200 spectators. There was a temporary three-plank stand on one side of the court offering seating to about thirty people. Marshall won the toss, elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore. After the first set was won by Gore, it started to rain for a quarter of an hour; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play. The final lasted 48 minutes, and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15, 13, and 20 minutes respectively. En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46. Gore, the <a href="Volley%20%28tennis%29">volley</a> specialist, had beaten the baseline player, at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting. Some tried to outlaw the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in "The Field" for weeks after the tournament.

The final was followed by a play-off match for 2nd place between Marshall and Heathcote. The players could not fix another date for the match and decided to play it straight away. By agreement, the match was limited to best-of-three sets. Marshall, playing his second match of the day, defeated Heathcote in straight sets, in front of a diminished crowd, and won the silver prize of seven guineas.

On 20 July 1877, the day following the final, a report was published in "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>" newspaper:

Lawn Tennis Championship – A fair number of spectators assembled yesterday, notwithstanding the rain, on the beautifully kept ground of the All England Club, Wimbledon, to witness the final contest between Messrs. Spencer Gore and W. Marshall for the championship. The play on both sides was of the highest order and its exhibition afforded a great treat to lovers of the game. All three sets were won buy Mr. Gore, who, therefore, becomes lawn tennis champion for 1877, and wins the £12 12s. gold prize and holds the silver challenge cup, value £25 5s. The second and third prizes were then played for by Messrs. W. Marshall and G.C. Heathcote (best of three sets by agreement). Mr. Marshall won two sets to love, and therefore takes the silver prize (value £12 12s.). Mr. Heathcote takes the third prize, value £3 3s.

A report in "The Field" stated: "The result was a more easy victory for Mr Spencer Gore than had been expected.". Third-placed Heathcote said that Gore was the best player of the year and had a varied service with a lot of twist on it. Gore, according to Heathcote, was a player with an aptitude for many games and had a long reach and a strong and flexible wrist. His volleying style was novel at the time, a forceful shot instead of merely a pat back over the net. All the opponents who were defeated by Gore on his way to the title were real tennis players. His victory was therefore regarded as a win of the rackets style of play over the real tennis style, and of the offensive style of the volley player – who comes to the net to force the point, over the baseline player – who plays <a href="groundstroke">groundstroke</a>s from the back of the court, intent on keeping the ball in play. His volleying game was also successful because the height of the net at the post – 5 ft (1.52 m) in contrast to the modern height of 3 ft 6 in (1.07 m) – made it difficult for his opponents to pass him by driving the ball down the line. Gore indicated that the real tennis players had the tendency to play shots from corner to corner over the middle of the net and did so at such a height that made volleying easy.

Despite his historic championship title, Gore was not enthusiastic about the new sport of lawn tennis. In 1890, thirteen years after winning his championship title, he wrote: "... it is want of variety that will prevent lawn tennis in its present form from taking rank among our great games ... That anyone who has really played well at cricket, tennis, or even rackets, will ever seriously give his attention to lawn tennis, beyond showing himself to be a promising player, is extremely doubtful; for in all probability the monotony of the game as compared with others would choke him off before he had time to excel in it." He did return for the <a href="1878%20Wimbledon%20Championship">1878 Championship</a> to defend his title in the Challenge Round but lost in straight sets to <a href="Frank%20Hadow">Frank Hadow</a>, a coffee planter from <a href="British%20Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, who effectively used the lob to counter Gore's net play. It was Gore's last appearance at the Wimbledon Championships.

The tournament generated a profit of £10 and the pony roller stayed in use. When the tournament was finished, Henry Jones gathered all the score cards to analyse the results and found that, of the 601 games played during the tournament, 376 were won by the server ("striker-in") and 225 by the receiver ("striker-out"). At a time when the service was either made underarm or, usually, at shoulder height, this was seen as a serving dominance and resulted in a modification of the rules for the 1878 Championship. To decrease the target area for the server, the length of the service court was reduced from 26 to 22 ft (7.92 to 6.71 m) and to make passing shots easier against volleyers the height of the net was reduced to 4 ft 9 in (1.45 m) at the posts and 3 feet (0.91 m) at the centre. These rules were published jointly by the AEC & LTC and the MCC, giving the AEC & LTC an official rule-making authority and in effect retroactively sanctioning its 1877 rules. It marked the moment when the AEC & LTC effectively usurped the rule-making initiative from the MCC although the latter would still ratify rule changes until 1882. In recognition of the importance and popularity of lawn tennis, the club was renamed in 1882 to All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC).

On 18 June 2012 a <a href="commemorative%20plaque">commemorative plaque</a> was unveiled at the former home of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, in Worple Road, Wimbledon celebrating both the first Wimbledon Championships and the <a href="Tennis%20at%20the%201908%20Summer%20Olympics">1908 Olympic tennis event</a>. The ceremony was performed by Heather Hanbury, Headmistress of Wimbledon High School; Philip Brook, Chairman of the All England Club, and Cr David T Williams JP, Mayor of <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Merton">Merton</a>.

Mark XIV bomb sight

The Mark XIV Computing Bomb Sight was a <a href="bombsight">bombsight</a> developed by <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. The bombsight was also known as the Blackett sight after its primary inventor, <a href="Patrick%20Blackett%2C%20Baron%20Blackett">P. M. S. Blackett</a>. Production of a slightly modified version was also undertaken in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> as the Sperry T-1, which was interchangeable with UK-built version. It was the RAF's standard bombsight for the second half of the War.

Developed starting in 1939, the Mk. XIV began replacing the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>-era <a href="Course%20Setting%20Bomb%20Sight">Course Setting Bomb Sight</a> in 1942. The Mk. XIV was essentially an automated version of the Course Setting sight, using a <a href="mechanical%20computer">mechanical computer</a> to update the sights in real-time as conditions changed. The Mk. XIV required only 10 seconds of straight flight before the drop and automatically accounted for shallow climbs and dives. More importantly, the Mk. XIV sighting unit was much smaller than the Course Setting sight, which allowed it to contain a <a href="Inertial%20platform">gyro stabilization platform</a>. This kept the sight pointed at the target even as the bomber manoeuvred, dramatically increasing its accuracy and ease of sighting.

The Mk. XIV was theoretically less accurate than the contemporary <a href="Norden%20bombsight">Norden bombsight</a> but was smaller, easier to use, faster-acting and better suited to night bombing. In practice, it demonstrated accuracy roughly equal to the Norden's. It equipped the majority of the RAF bomber fleet during the second half of the war; small numbers of the <a href="Stabilized%20Automatic%20Bomb%20Sight">Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight</a> and <a href="Low%20Level%20Bombsight%2C%20Mark%20III">Low Level Bombsight, Mark III</a> were used in specialist roles. The Low Level Bombsight was built using parts of the Mark XIV, stabilized in pitch rather than roll.

A post-war upgrade, the T-4, also known by its <a href="rainbow%20code">rainbow code</a> Blue Devil, connected directly to the <a href="Navigation%20and%20Bombing%20System">Navigation and Bombing System</a> computers to automate the setting of <a href="wind%20speed">wind speed</a> and direction. This eliminated the one potential inaccuracy in the system, further increased accuracy, and simplified operation. These equipped the <a href="V%20Bomber">V Bomber</a> force as well as other aircraft until their retirement from service in the 1960s.

A problem with early bombsights was that they could only correct for the effects of the wind in a simple way and required the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed <a href="anti-aircraft%20artillery">anti-aircraft artillery</a> to sight their weapons along the wind line.

In 1917 <a href="Harry%20Wimperis">Harry Wimperis</a> introduced the <a href="Course%20Setting%20Bomb%20Sight">Course Setting Bomb Sight</a> (CSBS), which replaced the tables and timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed to the left or right, indicating the required angle to fly to take the aircraft over the target. The CSBS was the first bombsight that allowed the bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.

The downside to the CSBS was that the settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one operational setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered with the ability to measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.

Although the need for an improved CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of "tachometric" bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF was working on such a design, the Automatic Bomb Sight, but development was slow and it had not been accepted for use when the war started. Learning of a similar design developed by the <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a>, the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a production licence for this <a href="Norden%20bombsight">Norden bombsight</a>. The US Navy constantly refused these requests, deeming it too sensitive to risk losing over Germany, and their refusals ultimately led to significant political friction between the two nations.

As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX, remained universal, and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.

On 28 March 1939, the head of <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a> Air Chief Marshal Sir <a href="Edgar%20Ludlow-Hewitt">Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt</a> hosted a conference on the state of Bomber Command. Among the many problems with operational readiness, he noted that RAF bombs were much too small and that bombsight technology was obsolete. Given the problems of obtaining a modern bombsight, he pressed for the creation of a high-speed bomber design that could safely attack at low levels.

On 18 December 1939, <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> bombers carried out a raid on German shipping in what became known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Heligoland%20Bight%20%281939%29">Air Battle of the Heligoland Bight</a>. Detected on <a href="radar">radar</a> and engaged en route to their targets, over half the attacking force was destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Ludlow-Hewitt presented a report on the attack on 22 December 1939, noting that flying straight and level for the CSBS made the bombers easy targets for fighters and anti-aircraft gunners. He again pressed for a new bombsight that featured stabilization to allow the aircraft to manoeuvre while it approached the target.

The CSBS and the improved version, the Mk. X, were insufficient, as both were too large to easily stabilize. Because of the way it was built, the Automatic Bomb Sight could be equipped with a stabilizer but it was estimated that it would be some time before it could be modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times and was still not available for purchase.

Another solution to the vulnerability of the RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved to be very difficult to read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.

What was needed was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful illumination of the crosshairs for night use, and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS on the front of a gyro unit taken from a <a href="Sperry%20Gyroscope">Sperry Gyroscope</a> <a href="artificial%20horizon">artificial horizon</a>, to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. But it was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on the separate Course and Speed Calculator. It was introduced in 1941, but only a small number were produced.

The request for a new bombsight was quickly passed on to the <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Establishment">Royal Aircraft Establishment</a>, where <a href="Patrick%20Blackett%2C%20Baron%20Blackett">Patrick Blackett</a> of the <a href="Aeronautical%20Research%20Committee">Aeronautical Research Committee</a> volunteered to lead the effort. His solution to the problem was a thorough revision of the CSBS concept.

The advance in the Blackett design was the way the sighting head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as "laying needle on needle". This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.

The inputs operated by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a <a href="mechanical%20calculator">mechanical calculator</a> inside the console, or "computor". The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern <a href="reflector%20sight">reflector sight</a> that was easy to see at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.

With the CSBS, the sighting system and calculator were the same device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated the need for the bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.

The new Mk. XII bombsight was first tested in September and October 1940 and by the end of October, 20 examples had been built. A slightly improved version, the Mk. XIII was designed but not put into production.

The need for the second crewman was an obvious problem with the Mk. XII, especially as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with <a href="Henry%20John%20James%20Braddick">Henry Braddick</a>, Blackett developed a new version of the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the need for the needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">RAF Coastal Command</a>, where he continued development of his theories of <a href="operational%20research">operational research</a>.

The new design reduced the bomb aimer's setup workload to dialling in four settings. Two of these could be set before the mission: the altitude of the target above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> and the <a href="terminal%20velocity">terminal velocity</a> of the bomb, a function of the particular bomb being used on that mission. The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows on the side of the computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting "bombing angle" in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.

The resulting Mk. XIV was first tested in June 1941. It was the first modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a settling time as little as 10 seconds. The fast settling time was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber to fly a corkscrew (a helical path), climbing and turning, and then level out immediately before the drop. Even slow turns made it difficult for <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was an effective way to avoid anti-aircraft fire.

Although the Mk. XIV was not as accurate as the Norden at altitudes over , for typical night bombing altitudes from , any differences in accuracy were minor. When the need for more accuracy for use with the <a href="Tallboy%20bomb">Tallboy bomb</a>s arose in 1943, the <a href="Stabilized%20Automatic%20Bomb%20Sight">Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight</a> (SABS), a development of the earlier Automatic Bomb Sight, was introduced in limited numbers.

Although existing sources do not record when the Mk. XIV went into production in the UK, they do record that operational testing started in January 1942 and production examples started reaching squadrons in March. It was manufactured by small machine shops and instrument makers like the Aron Meter Company. Production was too slow to meet the demand; between July and October, fewer than a hundred a month were being delivered. As the design was finalized, automated production was undertaken and by mid-1943, 900 a month were available. This was enough to equip the heavy bombers as they arrived from the production lines and by late 1942 the <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Handley Page Halifax</a> was being delivered with the sight head already installed.

To fill the demand for other aircraft, especially smaller ones like the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a>, the Air Ministry began looking at US manufacturers to supply the bombsight. Frederic Blin Vose of Sperry Gyroscope expressed an interest in the design and felt he could adapt the Mk. XIV to US production methods and have it in mass production rapidly. Sperry arranged for <a href="AC%20Spark%20Plug">AC Spark Plug</a> to take over manufacture, initially on a sub-contract basis and later for direct sales to the UK.

The two companies made some basic changes to the design to make it easier to produce and a final design was ready in May 1942. The Sperry T-1 was fully compatible with UK-built versions and a T-1 computer could be used with a Mk. XIV sight head or vice versa. Full production commenced at the AC plant in <a href="Flint%2C%20MI">Flint, Michigan,</a> in November and T-1s arrived in the UK from March 1943. The sights were sent to medium bombers like the Wellington, while UK-built versions were sent to the heavy bombers. In August 1943, George Mann of AC Spark Plug visited the UK for a period of about a year, liaising with RAE Farnborough, <a href="MoD%20Boscombe%20Down">Boscombe Down</a> and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Aircraft%20Production">Ministry of Aircraft Production</a>.

In May 1943, the Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Harris%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Arthur Harris</a>, requested that the maximum bombing altitude be increased from , as the <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> units were now carrying out missions as high as . The Air Ministry responded with a compromise improvement of and a more accurate angle mechanism. These changes produced the Mk. XIVA, which arrived in December 1944. The A model also introduced the ability for the minor differences in instrument readings for indicated and true air speed between aircraft to be corrected simply by replacing a <a href="cam">cam</a>.

The original design powered its gyros by blowing air across their outer rim, using ambient air from the cabin that was being sucked out of the aircraft by a hose connected to a vacuum source, provided by a <a href="Venturi%20tube%23Venturi%20tubes">venturi</a> or a pump on the engine. These were (and remain) widely used for <a href="attitude%20indicator">attitude indicator</a>s and <a href="gyrocompass">gyrocompass</a>es. Running these hoses to the stabilizer gyro in the sight head was problematic, so the new Mk. XIVB and T-1B replaced the suction-powered gyros with electrical ones, eliminating the need for a separate connection. This was introduced with the 18,000th T-1 on the AC production line.

The Mk. XV was a version designed for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and Coastal Command for attacking <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. As these operations took place at low altitudes, even small changes of altitude <a href="air%20pressure">air pressure</a> could lead to large errors in calculations. The Mk. XV allowed the altitude input to be taken directly from a <a href="radar%20altimeter">radar altimeter</a>, eliminating these inaccuracies and any instrument lag. The Mk. XVII was a Mk. XV modified for the very high attack speeds of the Naval Mosquito at more than . As the Naval Mosquito did not have a bomb aimer's position, an unstabilized version of the sight head was mounted in front of the pilot.

In the post-war era, the UK produced derivatives of the design based on the T-1, as opposed to the original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the <a href="jet%20stream">jet stream</a>. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, <a href="H2S%20radar">H2S</a> and <a href="Green%20Satin%20radar">Green Satin radar</a>s, <a href="astronavigation">star fixes</a> and <a href="radio%20navigation">radio navigation</a> systems. These measurements were fed into a mechanical computer that directly output the latitude and longitude of the aircraft, based on automatic <a href="dead%20reckoning">dead reckoning</a>. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing those values with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1 mph and ±0.1 degrees).

Most wartime optical sights like the Mk. XIV were useless for operations in jet aircraft. Flying at roughly twice the altitude and three times the speed of their wartime antecedents, the "range", the distance the bombs travelled after being dropped, increased from perhaps to as much as . This long range, plus the additional altitude, made the distance between the target and aircraft so great that it was often impossible to see the target before the aircraft had already passed the drop point. Optical bombing quickly gave way to radar bombing, although the Mk. XIV remained in RAF service until 1965.

The Mk. XIV consisted of two independent parts, the "sighting head" and the "computor". The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window at the front of the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.

The computor cabinet included only four main controls. On the left side of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on the left side of the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or "range angle"). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the <a href="pitot%20tube">pitot tube</a> and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the "distant reading" compass, using a <a href="selsyn">selsyn</a>.

The CSBS had introduced a mounting system on the left side of the bombsight that allowed it to be easily removed and then replaced without affecting its levelling. The Mk. XIV was designed to mount to this same system, which it did by mounting all of the moving parts on a square platform that then connected to the mount. A small thumbscrew on the mount allowed it to be levelled if needed, checked against a <a href="spirit%20level">spirit level</a> mounted just above it. A release lever beside the thumbscrew allowed the entire assembly to be lifted off the mounts.

Above the mounting platform was the stabilization gyro. This was connected to a pie-wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a mounting point at the top of the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite, forward, end was supported by a rotating <a href="pintle">pintle</a> inserted into a <a href="gudgeon">gudgeon</a> mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the centre, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.

The reflector sight mechanism was mounted in front of the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when the sight was stowed. The flap was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The <a href="collimator">collimator</a> was mounted on a prominent arm that projected above and in front of the sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the collimator as well as the "drift scale", which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.

The main design feature of the Mk. XIV was that it gave the bomb aimer more time to work on the problem of bringing the aircraft to the proper location to drop the bombs. As the calculations of this location were being carried out automatically, he could concentrate solely on the sight throughout the bomb run. The sight projected crosshairs into space at infinity so the user could focus their eyes on the target and see sharp lines superimposed on it.

The vertical line on the sight was relatively short, and could not be used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the "collimator handle" could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and released, the shaft to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.

Many of the figures used in the calculation of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity was based on the type of bomb being dropped and did not change during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.

The only major measurement that could not be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the wind speed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>. This demanded an accurate determination of the wind in the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.

Prior to the bomb run the pilot was directed to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the <a href="reticle">reticle</a> to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could be seen to be moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern <a href="E6B">E6B</a>, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.

As the Mk. XIV could calculate the effects of a shallow climb or dive (or "glide" as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed to the front of the computor.

As the computor held the level line and was sending angle commands to the sight, it eliminated the need for a two-axis gyro in the sighting head itself. The gyro on the sight head only adjusted for rotation of the aircraft around its roll axis.

The bomb sight was also supplied with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular <a href="slide%20rule">slide rule</a> for use when the main computor stopped working. In this case the bomb aimer would dial in the same basic parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.

A separate switchbox was used to control the brightness of the lamps driving the drift scale and reticle.

In testing on the bomb range, the Mk. XIV demonstrated an average accuracy of from altitude. In service, however, the average systematic error was , while the random error was . In comparison, units using the much more complex Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight (SABS) improved the systematic error to under the same operational conditions and altitude.

A series of reports in the summer of 1944 produced by Bomber Command's operational research division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the <a href="target%20indicator">target indicator</a> flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a single test bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.

The difference between bombing results on the test range and in operational conditions was by no means unique to the Mk. XIV. At the same time the US was introducing the Norden, which had consistently demonstrated a <a href="circular%20error%20probable">circular error probable</a> (CEP) of in testing, but produced an average CEP of during missions in 1943. As was the case with the Mk. XIV, most of the difference was traced to operational factors like crew training and visibility over the target. Through various changes in operational technique, CEP had improved to by 1945.

A later report covering the use the <a href="Tallboy%20%28bomb%29">Tallboy bomb</a> was able to directly compare the performance of the Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.

Through the Looking Glass (Lost)

"Through the Looking Glass" is the third-season finale of the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> <a href="Television%20program">television series</a> "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>", consisting of the 22nd and 23rd episodes of the <a href="Lost%20%28season%203%29">third season</a>. It is also the 71st and 72nd episodes overall. It was written by co-creator/executive producer <a href="Damon%20Lindelof">Damon Lindelof</a> and executive producer <a href="Carlton%20Cuse">Carlton Cuse</a>, and directed by executive producer <a href="Jack%20Bender">Jack Bender</a>. When first aired on May 23, 2007, in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, it was watched by an average of 14 million American viewers. Like the previous two <a href="season%20finale">season finale</a>s, it was two hours long with advertisements, twice the length of a normal episode. It was edited into two individual episodes when released on DVD. The season finale is considered by some to be one of the best episodes of television ever broadcast. The episode garnered a number of awards and nominations, including three <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a>s nominations and a <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Directors Guild of America Award</a> nomination.

The episode begins its narrative in late December 2004, over ninety days after the crash of <a href="Oceanic%20Airlines">Oceanic Airlines</a> Flight 815. The battle between the crash survivors and the dangerous and mysterious island inhabitants referred to as the "<a href="Others%20%28Lost%29">Others</a>" comes to a head as ten of the Others attack and are then ambushed at the survivors' camp and are subsequently killed. Meanwhile, <a href="Jack%20Shephard">Jack Shephard</a> (played by <a href="Matthew%20Fox%20%28actor%29">Matthew Fox</a>) leads most of the survivors to the island's radio tower to communicate with a nearby ship. Intercut with this story are off-island scenes spotlighting Jack, who has become suicidally depressed and addicted to painkillers. In a <a href="twist%20ending">twist ending</a>, it is revealed that these scenes are <a href="flashforward">flashforward</a>s to sometime in the future, after Jack has left the island, rather than <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> as in previous episodes of "Lost".

Unlike all previous episodes of the show, which interspersed the main plot with flashbacks that showed events that happened prior to the group's arrival on the island, this episode shows "flashforwards" – events that happen "after" the group's successful rescue from the island.

In the flash sequences, Jack is shown to be depressed, bearded, heavily drinking and addicted to <a href="Oxycodone">Oxycodone</a>. After reading about the death of someone he knew, Jack appears to be ready to commit suicide by jumping off the <a href="Sixth%20Street%20Viaduct">Sixth Street Viaduct</a> bridge. However, a fiery car crash occurs on the bridge before he jumps and he goes to the victims; it is eventually revealed that the driver crashed after being distracted by Jack. Later, Jack visits the memorial service for the person he read about and finds himself to be the only attendee. In the last of the flashes, Kate appears and Jack discusses the island with her. In a twist ending, it becomes clear that the sequences are actually <a href="flashforward">flashforward</a>s rather than flashbacks. Jack tells Kate about the memorial service but Kate, acting distant toward him, coldly retorts that she would not have gone had she known. Jack also talks about using the "golden pass" they had received from <a href="Oceanic%20Airlines">Oceanic Airlines</a> to fly back and forth across the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a> every Friday, hoping that he will crash in the island. Jack laments about having to lie and that they should have never left. However, Kate disagrees and leaves while Jack cries out that they have to go back.

The Others intend to attack the camp and kidnap pregnant women for scientific research. The survivors are tipped off by the "Other" <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Karl">Karl</a> (<a href="Blake%20Bashoff">Blake Bashoff</a>) and plan to kill the Others with dynamite-rigged tents. <a href="Sayid%20Jarrah">Sayid Jarrah</a> (<a href="Naveen%20Andrews">Naveen Andrews</a>), <a href="Jin-Soo%20Kwon">Jin Kwon</a> (<a href="Daniel%20Dae%20Kim">Daniel Dae Kim</a>), and <a href="Bernard%20Nadler">Bernard Nadler</a> (<a href="Sam%20Anderson">Sam Anderson</a>) remain at the beach, tasked with shooting the tents while the rest of the survivors journey with <a href="Danielle%20Rousseau">Danielle Rousseau</a> (<a href="Mira%20Furlan">Mira Furlan</a>) to the radio tower to communicate with <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Naomi%20Dorrit">Naomi Dorrit's</a> (<a href="Marsha%20Thomason">Marsha Thomason</a>) nearby ship.

The Others arrive, and while Sayid and Bernard detonate their tents, Jin misses his target, which results in their capture. After hearing only two explosions, <a href="James%20%26quot%3BSawyer%26quot%3B%20Ford">James "Sawyer" Ford</a> (<a href="Josh%20Holloway">Josh Holloway</a>) and <a href="Juliet%20Burke">Juliet Burke</a> (<a href="Elizabeth%20Mitchell">Elizabeth Mitchell</a>) turn back to see if they can help. <a href="Hugo%20%26quot%3BHurley%26quot%3B%20Reyes">Hugo "Hurley" Reyes</a> (<a href="Jorge%20Garcia">Jorge Garcia</a>), who was not allowed to accompany Sawyer and Juliet because of his weight, drives the van he found onto the beach, and the captives gain the upper hand, killing the remaining Others with the help of Sawyer and Juliet. <a href="Tom%20%28Lost%29">Tom</a> (<a href="M.%20C.%20Gainey">M.C. Gainey</a>) surrenders but Sawyer shoots him anyway.

In , a research station of the <a href="Dharma%20Initiative">Dharma Initiative</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Pace">Charlie Pace</a> (<a href="Dominic%20Monaghan">Dominic Monaghan</a>) is captured by the resident Others <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23The%20Others">Greta</a> (<a href="Lana%20Parrilla">Lana Parrilla</a>) and <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23The%20Others">Bonnie</a> (<a href="Tracy%20Middendorf">Tracy Middendorf</a>). <a href="Ben%20Linus">Ben Linus</a> (<a href="Michael%20Emerson">Michael Emerson</a>) learns of Charlie's infiltration and sends <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Mikhail%20Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> (<a href="Andrew%20Divoff">Andrew Divoff</a>) to the station to kill the three to preserve the signal jamming. Mikhail arrives and kills Greta and Bonnie, only to be shot through the chest with a spear gun by <a href="Desmond%20Hume">Desmond Hume</a> (<a href="Henry%20Ian%20Cusick">Henry Ian Cusick</a>) who emerges from a closet where he had hidden after diving down a short time after Charlie. Getting the code from Bonnie before she dies (the notes to the middle eight of "<a href="Good%20Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a>" by <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a>), Charlie disables the jammer, and is contacted by <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Penny%20Widmore">Penny Widmore</a> (<a href="Sonya%20Walger">Sonya Walger</a>) via video transmission. Penny informs Charlie that she does not know Naomi, and did not send the boat that Naomi claims to be from. Despite his injury, Mikhail manages to swim out of the station and blasts the window of the jamming room with a grenade, killing himself and flooding the communications room. Charlie locks the door to save Desmond from drowning with him, but before he drowns, Charlie writes on his hand so Desmond can read: "NOT PENNY'S BOAT".

<a href="John%20Locke%20%28Lost%29">John Locke</a> (<a href="Terry%20O%27Quinn">Terry O'Quinn</a>), one of the survivors, has been shot by Ben. Finding his legs paralyzed again, Locke is about to commit suicide, when he is stopped by what appears to be <a href="Walt%20Lloyd">Walt Lloyd</a> (<a href="Malcolm%20David%20Kelley">Malcolm David Kelley</a>). Walt tells John that he has the use of his legs and that he has "work to do". Meanwhile, Ben tells <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Richard">Richard Alpert</a> (<a href="Nestor%20Carbonell">Nestor Carbonell</a>) to lead the rest of the Others to the "Temple" and then leaves the Others, with his adopted daughter <a href="Alex%20%28Lost%29">Alex</a> (<a href="Tania%20Raymonde">Tania Raymonde</a>) – Rousseau's daughter and Karl's girlfriend – to meet up with the survivors to persuade Jack not to call Naomi's ship for rescue.

Kate is upset about Sawyer not wanting her to come back to the beach with him to rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack is defending Sawyer, Jack informs <a href="Kate%20Austen">Kate Austen</a> (<a href="Evangeline%20Lilly">Evangeline Lilly</a>) that it is because he loves her. Kate also witnessed a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches him in the face repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth, and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski (<a href="Fisher%20Stevens">Fisher Stevens</a>) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.

The episode's title is an allusion to <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s novel "<a href="Through%20the%20Looking-Glass">Through the Looking-Glass</a>" and a reference to the fictitious <a href="Dharma%20Initiative">Dharma Initiative</a> station featured in the <a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28Lost%29">previous episode</a>. Shooting began on April 13, 2007 and ended on May 7, 2007. The writers were so far behind schedule that parts of the episode were shot while later parts were still being written. Filming mostly took place on <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, with additional scenes shot in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. The hospital scenes were filmed on the same sets used for the ABC show "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>".

Despite not being mentioned in the official press release, then-15-year-old <a href="Malcolm%20David%20Kelley">Malcolm David Kelley</a> returned to reprise his role as 10-year-old <a href="Walt%20Lloyd">Walt Lloyd</a>, and received credit as a "special guest star". Kelley’s character had left the island in the second-season finale, only 26 days prior to the events of "Through the Looking Glass"; however, Kelley had not filmed an episode in over a year. In his single scene, Walt has visibly aged, appears taller and has a deeper voice. The producers had hoped that <a href="Harold%20Perrineau">Harold Perrineau</a>, who plays Walt's father <a href="Michael%20Dawson%20%28Lost%29">Michael Dawson</a>, would return in this episode, but he was busy filming the <a href="pilot%20episode">pilot</a> for <a href="CBS">CBS</a>' "Demons". Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse lent their voices for the unseen roles of the flight captain and newscaster, respectively.

This episode concluded the story arc about Charlie's death, which began earlier in the season when Desmond prophesied Charlie's death. Throughout the season, Charlie escaped death; however, Desmond told Charlie that he had to die in order for his girlfriend, <a href="Claire%20Littleton">Claire Littleton</a>, to get rescued from the island. The storyline of Charlie's death was conceived while producing the latter part of the <a href="Lost%20%28season%202%29">second season</a>, after the storyline of Charlie's <a href="heroin">drug addiction</a> finished. The news of his character's death was broken to Monaghan <a href="The%20Man%20Behind%20the%20Curtain">two episodes</a> in advance, to which Monaghan felt "relief" for knowing the future of his job on the show. On the night of Monaghan's second-to-last day on set, he was presented with a canoe paddle that had been made by the cast and crew. Monaghan hoped to return to "Lost" as a guest star in flashbacks or dreams.

Jack Bender stated that Matthew Fox "really commits body and soul into the story he's telling" and Fox questioned whether he had ever been more tired than while shooting the double episode. Like the other "Lost" season finales, the final cliffhanger scene was given a codename—"The Rattlesnake in the Mailbox"—and kept top secret. After Lindelof and Cuse wrote the scene, only Fox, Lilly, Bender, and co-executive producer Jean Higgins were given copies of the script. The scene was shot with a <a href="green%20screen">green screen</a> in an abandoned <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> parking lot with the airport edited in. Despite the security measures, a complete and detailed episode synopsis was uploaded online over a week before the episode aired. <a href="Disney">Disney</a> investigated the leak. The leak prompted Lindelof and Cuse to enter "<a href="radio%20silence">radio silence</a>", which was temporarily broken at <a href="Comic-Con%20International">Comic-Con International</a> 2007. The funeral parlor that Jack visits is called "Hoffs/Drawlar", which is an anagram of "flashforward". The idea of flashforwards was conceived by creators Lindelof and Abrams during the show's conception. However, Cuse and Lindelof only started fleshing out the idea at the end of the first season, after they realized that flashbacks would eventually stop being revelatory and knew that they would eventually have to switch to flashforwards. With the announcement that the series would conclude 48 episodes after "Through the Looking Glass", they felt comfortable playing flashforwards as early as the third-season finale.

Post-production wrapped on May 21, 2007, only two days before it aired on television. The score was composed by series musician <a href="Michael%20Giacchino">Michael Giacchino</a>, while popular music was also featured throughout the episode. Charlie also sings a song in the episode that was written by Dominic Monaghan, who plays him. A "Lost" season finale is approximately twice as long the average "Lost" episode. Due to the episode's length, it was split into two parts in <a href="Canada">some</a> <a href="Brazil">countries</a> and when released on DVD. Unlike most episodes, this episode did not feature a "previously on "Lost"…" recap at the start of the episode when it first aired; however, it was originally preceded by a <a href="clip-show">clip-show</a> titled "", which recapped the third season. Cuse said that he and Lindelof think the finale is "very cool [and] we're very proud of it." Stephen McPherson, the president of ABC Entertainment, called "Through the Looking Glass" "one of the best episodes" of the series. <a href="Buena%20Vista%20Home%20Entertainment">Buena Vista Home Entertainment</a> released "Through the Looking Glass" on the season's DVD and <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> sets on December 11, 2007 in <a href="DVD%20region%20code%231">Region 1</a>. A <a href="featurette">featurette</a> called ""Lost": On Location" features cast and crew discussing production of select episodes, including "Through the Looking Glass". The episode was rerun for the first time on January 30, 2008 with on-screen text in the lower third of the screen, similar to <a href="VH1">VH1</a>'s "<a href="Pop-up%20Video">Pop-up Video</a>". These pop-ups were not written by "Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s writers due to the <a href="2007%E2%80%932008%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike</a>; they were written by the marketing company Met/Hodder. This enhanced edition was viewed by almost 9 million Americans.

In the U.S., the episode brought in the best ratings for "Lost" in fifteen episodes. The two-hour Wednesday broadcast on ABC made "Lost" the fourth most watched series of the week with an average of 13.86 million American viewers, below the third season average of 14.6 million. The first hour was viewed by 12.67 million, and the audience increased to 15.04 million in the second hour. The episode received a 5.9/15 in the key adults 18–49 demographic. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, the episode attracted 1.21 million viewers, and was the second most watched program of the week on the <a href="Digital%20television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">non-terrestrial channels</a>, beaten only by "". In <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, "Lost" was the thirty-seventh most viewed show of the week, bringing in 1.17 million viewers. In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, the episode placed sixteenth for the first half, with 911,000 viewers and fifteenth for the second half, with 938,000 viewers. The episodes were broadcast before and after "<a href="American%20Idol">American Idol</a>".

The episode garnered universal critical acclaim. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote that the episode was "an unusually action-packed and sanguinary spring cleaning that… left a host of… characters… dead", "<a href="Access%20Atlanta">Access Atlanta</a>" said "it was deeply satisfying. The first hour started a bit slow but the second hour had great twists, wonderfully emotional moments, both happy and sad", and the "<a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>" said that "the powerful season-ending episode redeemed the series with the shrewdness and intrigue that made it so addictive in the first place." The "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" wrote that "not only was the pace fast, the teases taut, and the answers plenty, the writers took a compelling gamble… [by telling] viewers that in the future… maybe all… of the people on the "Lost" island get off. They get their wish. But in Jack, our guide through this series, the writers definitively say, 'Be careful what you wish for.'" The "<a href="San%20Jose%20Mercury%20News">San Jose Mercury News</a>" called the finale a "jaw-dropping exercise in good storytelling." The "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>" commented that the flashforward "twist gave the saga renewed momentum as it begins its march toward a 2010 finish." The season finale was summed up as "a mind-blower, for sure, a radical two hours that gave us major fake-outs, an army of dead bodies, the possibility of rescue [and] diverse portraits of heroism" by "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", who added that the death of Charlie was "the most touching loss of the series so far." "<a href="The%20Palm%20Beach%20Post">The Palm Beach Post</a>" and "<a href="Wizard%20%28magazine%29">Wizard</a>" named it the "Best Cliffhanger" of 2007. The "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" called it "a qualified success" with excellent pacing and action, however, the flashforward scenes were thought to be uninteresting and "clumsy". "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" ranked the episode as the best of 2007 and the "Rattlesnake in the Mailbox" as one of the ten best scenes of 2007 television.

"The Futon Critic" placed the episode first in the site's annual "50 Best Episodes" list. "<a href="E%21">E!</a>" said that "Through the Looking Glass" was possibly "the best episode ever of the entire series." "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" described "Through the Looking Glass" as "a dizzying exercise in adventure, sustained tension and time-shifting rug pulling [that was] spectacularly produced, amazingly directed and gloriously acted." <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave the double episode a perfect 10/10 – the best review of the season – saying it was "nothing short of a masterpiece of storytelling with a brilliantly paced narrative." "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" would conclude that the flashforward was the "Biggest Shock" in 2007 television. Both IGN and "The Los Angeles Times" would later declare "Through the Looking Glass" as the second best "Lost" episode, behind "<a href="The%20Constant">The Constant</a>". "<a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a>" praised the unpredictability, saying that "no other show can even attempt to do what "Lost" does." "BuddyTV" would later call "Through the Looking Glass" the best finale of 2007 and Charlie's death the saddest TV death of 2007. "Through the Looking Glass" was "<a href="TV.com">TV.com</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Editor's Choice" for "Best Episode" of 2007. "<a href="AOL">AOL</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "<a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>" gave the episode a 7/7, noting that "the writers followed through on Desmond's premonitions and successfully delivered the highly anticipated game-changer." "<a href="Television%20Without%20Pity">Television Without Pity</a>" gave the third-season finale an "A". "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" wrote that "Lost" "may have unjumped <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Jumping%20the%20shark">the shark</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> with [the] flashforward." "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" ranked it as one of the top ten episodes of 2007, saying that the cliffhanger "[revealed] new dimensions to ["Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s] creative world." "Zap2It" questioned "whether to be deeply frustrated (again), really, really confused (a distinct possibility) or just in awe of the incredible mind-(ahem) show runners… have pulled off." The writing for Locke was criticized, and one "IGN" writer said that "it seems irrational that he would go and [stab Naomi] in the back without explaining himself." Lindelof stated "that we might be willing to give [Locke] the benefit of the doubt for any action he took in response to [lying, gutshot, in a pit of Dharma corpses for two days and on the verge of taking his own life], even if considered slightly 'out of character'." Film and television director and writer <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a> said that "to do [3] seasons and then suddenly throw a massive curveball is just so dramatically satisfying, you just take your hats off to the writers in a big, bad way."

Bruno Maddox

Bruno P. Maddox (born 1969) is a British <a href="literary%20fiction">literary novelist</a> and journalist who is best known for his novel "My Little Blue Dress" (2001) and for his satirical magazine essays.

After graduating from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in 1992, Maddox began his career reviewing books for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">The New York Times Book Review</a>" and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a> Book World". In early 1996, he was appointed to an editorship at "<a href="Spy%20%28magazine%29">Spy</a>" magazine and within a few months he was promoted to editor-in-chief, a position he held until the magazine shut down in 1998. Maddox wrote "My Little Blue Dress" between 1999 and 2001. Since its publication, he has focused on writing satirical essays for magazines such as "<a href="Gear%20%28magazine%29">GEAR</a>" and "<a href="Travel%20%2B%20Leisure">Travel + Leisure</a>"; he also contributes a monthly humor column to "<a href="Discover%20%28magazine%29">Discover</a>" magazine called "Blinded by Science", drawing on his early exposure to science and technology. Maddox is likewise a <a href="contributing%20editor">contributing editor</a> to the American edition of "<a href="The%20Week">The Week</a>" magazine.

Maddox was born in London in 1969 to former "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" editor, the late Sir <a href="John%20Maddox">John Maddox</a>, a writer on science and nature, and <a href="Brenda%20Maddox">Brenda Maddox</a>, a biographer of <a href="Rosalind%20Franklin">Rosalind Franklin</a>, <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>, <a href="Nora%20Barnacle">Nora Barnacle</a> and several others. He has one sister, <a href="Bronwen%20Maddox">Bronwen Maddox</a>, who became a journalist, was Chief Foreign Commentator of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and Editor of Prospect magazine and is now Director of the Institute for Government. Maddox enjoyed a privileged life during his childhood and youth, because of his father's position as editor of "Nature", encountering some of the leading scientific thinkers of the day and enjoying dinners with figures such as <a href="James%20D.%20Watson">James Watson</a> and <a href="Sir%20Fred%20Hoyle">Sir Fred Hoyle</a>.

Despite his family's background in science, Maddox was interested in the <a href="humanities">humanities</a> while he attended <a href="Westminster%20School">Westminster School</a>, an independent boys' school in London. Maddox went on to study <a href="English%20literature">English literature</a> at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> and graduated in 1992. He published his only article in the <a href="student%20newspaper">student newspaper</a> "<a href="The%20Harvard%20Crimson">The Harvard Crimson</a>" during his <a href="Upperclassman">senior</a> year. He won the undergraduate <a href="Thomas%20T.%20Hoopes%2C%20Class%20of%201919%2C%20Prize">Thomas Temple Hoopes Prize</a> for his senior thesis "on the use of adjectives in restaurant menus" titled "Maltese: A Gastrosophic Theory of Reading". After graduation Maddox moved from <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, to Moscow—where he worked for three weeks as the English-language editor of a Russian magazine—and then to New York City, where he spent two years working odd jobs, including hand-delivering celebrity invitations to local parties.

Maddox's freelance writing career began in 1994, when he became a book reviewer for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">The New York Times Book Review</a>" and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", where he developed a reputation for writing scathing reviews that would later help him land a job as an editor at "<a href="Spy%20%28magazine%29">Spy</a>" magazine. Maddox described his book reviewing style as "pretty vicious", and quipped that he "was a frustrated, twenty-something guy, sitting in his bedroom venting existential rage on these nasty academics". His last book review for "The Washington Post" was in late 1996; however, he continued reviewing for "The New York Times" up until 1998, contributing only a couple of reviews thereafter.

At the beginning of the <a href="dot-com%20boom">dot-com boom</a>, Maddox found full-time work at an information technology company, where he worked for a year and a half.

In mid-1996, Maddox was hired as a <a href="senior%20editor">senior editor</a> at "<a href="Spy%20%28magazine%29">Spy</a>" magazine, a <a href="satirical">satirical</a> monthly, in New York City. "Spy" had ceased publication in 1994 but was quickly resuscitated under new ownership by Sussex Publishers Inc., which reduced the magazine's frequency from ten to six issues a year. At "Spy", Maddox was assisted by deputy editor Adam Lehner, a satirist. In December 1996, Maddox was promoted to editor-in-chief; his editorial team included <a href="Jared%20Paul%20Stern">Jared Paul Stern</a> and, beginning in late 1997, future screenwriter <a href="William%20Monahan">William Monahan</a>.

Maddox wanted to turn "Spy" into a national magazine rather than build on its legacy of covering stories that centered on New York. According to Maddox, two factors motivated the shift of <a href="target%20market">target market</a>. The magazine's past objects of satire, the "cheesy villains who anointed themselves as targets" in the 1980s, were no longer on the national stage. Meanwhile, the "sins of the '90s [were] those of a private, quiet cultivation of a sense of purity", and were harder to expose or ridicule.

In early 1998, Sussex Publishers increased "Spy"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s frequency from six to nine issues a year in an effort to boost readership and ad pages. "Spy"'s paid circulation continued to drop during Maddox's tenure, and in March 1998, the magazine once again ceased publication. Sussex's President and CEO John Colman concluded that "[despite the] great work by Bruno and his team, there just wasn't the [advertiser and consumer] acceptance that we need to make it financially viable". Maddox conceded that "a satirical magazine in New York in the late Nineties really had no function", because "everyone was being very modest and coy".

In 1999, Maddox sold the advance rights to his <a href="debut%20novel">first novel</a>, "My Little Blue Dress", to a German publisher based on a five-page fax proposal he sent on the advice of his <a href="literary%20agent">literary agent</a> <a href="John%20Brockman%20%28literary%20agent%29">John Brockman</a>. Within a week Brockman managed to sell the rights to the novel to publishers in an additional eight countries on the strength of the proposal alone. (Maddox had not yet written even an initial <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>.)

"My Little Blue Dress" was published in 2001 by <a href="Viking%20Press">Viking Press</a>, a <a href="Penguin%20Group">Penguin Group</a> <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a>. The novel begins as a <a href="memoir">memoir</a> of a hundred-year-old woman, but several chapters later reveals itself to be a spoof of the genre. The protagonist is a fictional Bruno Maddox who is desperately attempting to create a forgery of an old woman's memoir in a single night. Several book reviewers avoided spoiling the novel's satire but others gave away its premise, reasoning that the publisher "reveal[s] all on the book jacket anyway". The novel's intrigue lies in the mysterious reason compelling the fictional Maddox to forge a memoir.

Critics applauded "My Little Blue Dress" but also expressed some reservations. For example, <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>'s Maria Russo cautioned that the novel "is one of those 'don't try this at home' literary experiments that could easily have turned into an unreadable, pretentious disaster", but concluded that Maddox "pulls it off with a kind of fearless pizzazz". "The New York Times"' <a href="Emily%20Barton">Emily Barton</a> conceded that "for all its blunders", Maddox delivers "a winsome and vastly entertaining novel".

In an interview, Maddox praised <a href="Bret%20Easton%20Ellis">Bret Easton Ellis</a>'s 1991 novel "<a href="American%20Psycho">American Psycho</a>", stating that he drew inspiration from protagonist <a href="Patrick%20Bateman">Patrick Bateman</a>'s long-winded monologues about <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a>, restaurants, clothes, and how to remove blood from his carpets.

In 2001, Maddox promoted his first novel on a joint book tour billed as the "Minor Novelists Tour" with his friend <a href="William%20Monahan">William Monahan</a>, another former "Spy" editor, but it was interrupted by the 9/11 attacks. Monahan's "" was also published by a Penguin imprint. Several years later, Maddox gave some indication that he was working on a <a href="film%20adaptation">film adaptation</a> of "My Little Blue Dress", but it is unknown whether Maddox completed the script.

After the publication of "My Little Blue Dress" in 2001, Maddox was reportedly working on a second novel set in California, where "everyone's aspirational and deluded" and the "people are quite happy being waiters and dreaming of stardom". As of 2009, however, no manuscript has been forthcoming.

Since 2001, Maddox has written numerous articles for popular magazines, such as the now-defunct "<a href="Gear%20%28magazine%29">GEAR</a>". Published one year after the <a href="11%20September%202001%20attacks">11 September 2001 attacks</a>, his essay "Before It Was Real" describes the callousness of the terrorists who flew into the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a> through the experience of playing a <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a> game. Another example of Maddox's work is his 2003 profile of <a href="Karl%20Wenclas">Karl Wenclas</a>, leader of the <a href="Underground%20Literary%20Alliance">Underground Literary Alliance</a>, titled "The Angriest Book Club in America" and published in the fashion magazine "<a href="BlackBook%20Magazine">BlackBook</a>". Wenclas later derided Maddox for distorting the Underground Literary Alliance in his "BlackBook" essay and summed up the article as "riddled with falsehoods".

In late 2003, Maddox began to contribute articles regularly to "<a href="Travel%20%2B%20Leisure">Travel + Leisure</a>". His first article in the magazine was called "The Concorde, R.I.P.", which chronicled his flight aboard the supersonic <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a> airplane before it was decommissioned; it was later included in "The Best Travel Writing 2005", the second volume of the annual Travelers' Tales series. In 2004 Maddox began working as a <a href="contributing%20editor">contributing editor</a> for the American edition of "<a href="The%20Week">The Week</a>" magazine and as of 2007 continues to contribute weekly to the print issue, handling sections including "Main Stories", "Talking Points", and "Only in America". He also reviewed several books for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Post">The New York Post</a>" in 2004 and 2005.

In 2006, Maddox began contributing a regular humor column called "Blinded by Science" to "<a href="Discover%20Magazine">Discover</a>" magazine. His writing draws upon his childhood exposure to science; due to his father's career, his family was immersed in science and he was regularly exposed to scientists at social events. Maddox's first year's columns earned him a nod as a finalist in the 2007 <a href="National%20Magazine%20Award">National Magazine Award</a>s' "Columns and Commentary" category.

Maddox's "Discover" columns are occasionally criticized; his essay "Fictional Reality", in particular, has been controversial. Maddox declared science fiction obsolete in his essay "Fictional Reality" and was roundly criticized in the <a href="blogosphere">blogosphere</a>, most notably by "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s J.R. Minkel. Maddox wrote that "fiction—all fiction—finally became obsolete as a delivery system for big ideas" as a result of the "scarcity of foreseeable future", citing the decline of author <a href="Michael%20Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>'s work as evidence. Minkel lambasted Maddox and pointed to author <a href="Neal%20Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>'s cutting-edge work as proof to the contrary, venturing that "science fiction writers can "dictate" the future if they have the vim and vision".
One of Maddox's most recent "Discover" essays, "The James Watson Affair", examines comments made by <a href="James%20D.%20Watson">James Watson</a> in an article in London's "<a href="The%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" which led to Watson's suspension at the laboratory where he worked and his eventual retirement, and is skeptical of critics who found Watson's comment about black employees "not that big a deal" yet charged him with racism for his proposition on black African intelligence; in conclusion, Maddox derides the views held by several critics, stating that in comparison to Watson's statements, "the most ignorant and hurtful idea of all, of course, is that the entire topic of race and genes and intelligence is off-limits to all right-thinking, compassionate people, just on principle", which pejoratively assumes "that some races "are" innately and immutably much less intelligent than others". Maddox's essay, although published in the March 2008 printed edition of "Discover", has not been published online.

Satire is evident in much of Maddox's work, from his years as editor-in-chief for "<a href="Spy%20%28magazine%29">Spy</a>" magazine to his numerous articles in "<a href="Travel%20%2B%20Leisure">Travel + Leisure</a>", and his novel "My Little Blue Dress". Maddox's satirical tendencies extend to his interviews and publicity materials. In one interview he made the preposterous claim that he once "spent 2 days being a personal assistant to a mafia boss in New York". Maddox's <a href="Penguin%20Group">Penguin</a> biography skewers his own career, claiming he "elevated ["Spy"] to within spitting distance of its former glory, then accidentally bankrupted it after two short years", which led "<a href="The%20Harvard%20Crimson">The Harvard Crimson</a>", his alma mater's student newspaper, to speculate that "Maddox himself had a hand in writing" it. Maddox's <a href="popular%20science">popular science</a> columns for "<a href="Discover%20%28magazine%29">Discover</a>" magazine impart his own personal views on science with a markedly humorous and <a href="skeptical">skeptical</a> bent.

History of Gillingham F.C.

<a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham F.C.</a> is an English <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Gillingham%2C%20Kent">Gillingham, Kent</a>. The club was formed in 1893, and played in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> until 1920, when that league's top division was absorbed into the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> as its new Division Three. The club was voted out of the league in favour of <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> at the end of the <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20in%20English%20football">1937–38</a> season, but returned 12 years later, when that league was expanded from 88 to 92 clubs. Twice in the late 1980s Gillingham came close to winning promotion to the second tier of English football, but a decline then set in and in 1993 the club narrowly avoided relegation to the <a href="National%20League%20%28English%20football%29">Football Conference</a>. In 2000, the "Gills" reached the second tier of the English league for the first time in the club's history and went on to spend five seasons at this level, achieving a club record highest league finish of eleventh place in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a>. The club has twice won the division comprising the fourth level in the football league: the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Football League Fourth Division</a> championship in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1963–64</a> and the <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">Football League Two</a> championship in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">2012–13</a>.

The local success of a junior football side, Chatham Excelsior F.C., encouraged a group of businessmen to meet at the Napier Arms pub on 18 May 1893, with a view to creating a football club that could compete in larger competitions. To do this, the club required an enclosed playing area where an admission fee could be charged, which Excelsior lacked. New Brompton F.C. was formed at the meeting, incorporating a number of Excelsior players. The group also purchased the plot of land which would later become <a href="Priestfield%20Stadium">Priestfield Stadium</a>, where a pitch was quickly laid and a pavilion constructed. New Brompton's <a href="first%20team">first team</a> played their first match on 2 September 1893, with the new team, sporting Excelsior's black and white stripes, being defeated 5–1 by <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Woolwich Arsenal</a>'s <a href="reserve%20team">reserve team</a> in front of a crowd of 2,000. As a "curtain-raiser" immediately prior to this match, New Brompton's own reserves played a match against <a href="Grays%20Athletic%20F.C.">Grays</a>, which was therefore technically the first match played by a team representing the club.

New Brompton joined the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> upon its creation in 1894, being placed in Division Two because it was one of the last clubs to be invited to join the league. Upon joining the league, New Brompton turned professional, with the players agreeing to be paid 12 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s per match, and promptly won the Division Two championship in the <a href="1894%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1894–95</a> season. With a record of one defeat and eleven victories from twelve matches, the team concluded the season with a "test match" against <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a>, who had finished bottom of Division One. As 5–1 winners, New Brompton gained promotion to Division One the following season. In 1896 the club appointed its first manager when <a href="William%20Ironside%20Groombridge">William Ironside Groombridge</a>, who had previously served as the club's financial secretary, took charge of team affairs. Groombridge served the club, as secretary and sometimes manager, until well after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.
New Brompton struggled in Division One, generally finishing close to the foot of the table, but did reach the first round proper of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time in <a href="1899-1900%20in%20English%20football">1899–1900</a>, losing 1–0 to <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. In the same season the club was forced to play a league fixture at the home ground of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Woolwich Arsenal</a> when Priestfield was closed due to crowd trouble in a match against <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>.

In the <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907–08</a> season, under the management of the former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> international <a href="Stephen%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201874%29">Stephen Smith</a>, New Brompton finished bottom of the table,

In 1912 the directors passed a resolution to change the club's name to Gillingham F.C., and the team played under this name throughout the <a href="1912%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">1912–13</a> season, although the change was not officially ratified by the shareholders until the following year. To coincide with the change, the team began sporting a new kit of red shirts with blue sleeves. The side again finished bottom of the division in the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">1914–15</a> season, but avoided relegation for a second time when the league was suspended due to the escalation of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

Once the competition resumed after the war Gillingham, once again wearing black and white, continued to fare poorly, again finishing bottom of Division One in the <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20in%20English%20football">1919–20</a> season. For a third time, however, the club avoided relegation, due to the subsequent elevation of all Southern League Division One clubs to form the new <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Football League Third Division</a>.

In the club's first match in the newly created Football League Division Three, Gillingham held <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> to a 1–1 draw in front of a new record Priestfield crowd of 11,500, with <a href="Tom%20Gilbey">Tom Gilbey</a> scoring the club's first goal in league competition. Under new manager <a href="John%20McMillan%20%28footballer%20born%201871%29">John McMillan</a> the team struggled and finished the <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21</a> season bottom of the table, and in the years to follow there was little improvement, with the club regularly finishing in the lower reaches of the bottom division. Gillingham did not manage to finish in the top half of the table until <a href="1925%E2%80%9326%20in%20English%20football">1925–26</a>, when the team finished in 10th place, due mainly to the goals of <a href="Dick%20Edmed">Dick Edmed</a>, who was promptly signed by <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> for a fee of £1,750, a new Gillingham record. Manager <a href="Harry%20Curtis%20%28football%20manager%29">Harry Curtis</a> departed soon afterwards to take over at <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a>, and former <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> manager <a href="Albert%20Hoskins">Albert Hoskins</a> stepped down a division to manage the club, but he could do little to change the team's fortunes and left in 1929 after Gillingham finished bottom of the table once again.

<a href="Striker%20%28association%20football%29">Striker</a> <a href="Fred%20Cheesmur">Fred Cheesmur</a> set a new club record in the <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20in%20English%20football">1929–30</a> season when he scored six goals in a match against <a href="Merthyr%20Town%20F.C.">Merthyr Town</a>. This remains the highest number of goals scored by a Gillingham player in a professional match, but was a rare high point in a season which saw Gillingham forced to apply for re-election to the league. The following year the club abandoned its traditional black and white striped shirts in favour of blue shirts and white shorts, colours which have remained associated with Gillingham ever since, although the black and white stripes are still visible in the current version of the club's badge. In <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">1932–33</a> former <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> manager <a href="Fred%20Maven">Fred Maven</a> led the club to its highest league finish to date, finishing the season in 7th place, but it was a feat which could not be repeated and the team returned to struggling at the foot of the table the following season.
In the <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a> season centre-forward <a href="Sim%20Raleigh">Sim Raleigh</a>, the club's top scorer the previous season and a player seen as a future star, suffered a <a href="brain%20haemorrhage">brain haemorrhage</a> following a blow to the head in a match against <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> on 1 December. Although he played on he collapsed during the second half and died in hospital later the same day. The club launched a fund which raised over £250 for his widow and child.

In 1938 the Gills finished bottom of the now-regionalised <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a> once more, and were required to apply for re-election to the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> for the fifth time since joining it in 1920. This time the club's bid for re-election failed, with <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> registering 36 votes to Gillingham's 28 and being promoted into the League. At the time it was considered a distinct possibility that Gillingham, saddled with heavy debts incurred during the preceding unsuccessful seasons, might not survive, but the club carried on, and returned to the Southern League the following season, albeit without manager <a href="Alan%20Ure">Alan Ure</a>, who was replaced by <a href="Bill%20Harvey%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201896%29">Bill Harvey</a>.

The club's second stint in the Southern League was interrupted by the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> in 1939, which saw newly appointed manager <a href="Archie%20Clark%20%28footballer%29">Archie Clark</a> and most of the players assigned to work at the local dockyards. When competitive football resumed, Gillingham played in the first incarnation of the <a href="Kent%20Football%20League%20%281894%E2%80%931959%29">Kent League</a>, winning the title in both <a href="1944%E2%80%9345%20in%20English%20football">1944–45</a> and <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20in%20English%20football">1945–46</a>. In the second of these seasons the team also won the <a href="Kent%20Senior%20Cup">Kent Senior Cup</a>, Kent County Challenge Cup and Kent League Cup, to complete a clean sweep of every senior trophy in the county. Following their Kent League triumphs, the Gills returned to the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> for the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a> season, in which the team again won two trophies, claiming both the Southern League Cup and the Southern League title itself, and registered a club record 12–1 victory over <a href="Gloucester%20City%20F.C.">Gloucester City</a>. Striker <a href="Hughie%20Russell">Hughie Russell</a> scored nine goals in the match, and missed out on double figures when he hit the bar late in the game.

Although Gillingham missed out on the Southern League title the following season, finishing as runners-up, the team again captured the Kent Senior Cup, as well as setting a club record attendance of 23,002 for a cup match against <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. Gillingham applied for re-election to the Football League in the summer of 1948 but, despite producing a glossy brochure detailing the team's achievements, the club saw its application rejected, with only one vote cast in its favour. Despite this disappointment, the team continued to perform strongly in the Southern League and successfully regained the league title in <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20in%20English%20football">1948–49</a>. In 1950 plans were announced to expand the Third Division South from 22 to 24 teams and, based on the team's local success in the interim, Gillingham gained re-election to the Football League, receiving the highest number of votes amongst the candidate clubs.

Gillingham's first game back in the Football League saw the Kent club hold fellow new entrants <a href="Colchester%20United%20F.C.">Colchester United</a> to a 0–0 draw at Priestfield in front of 19,542 fans. The <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20in%20English%20football">1950–51</a> season saw the Gills both concede and score nine goals in individual matches, and finished with them bottom of the table, a performance which was repeated the following season. In 1952 striker <a href="Jimmy%20Scarth">Jimmy Scarth</a> set a <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> record when he scored a hat-trick in approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds against <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a>, which was officially recognised as the fastest hat-trick in the history of the Football League until February 2004.

Gillingham's fortunes on the field gradually improved and the team finished in the top half of the Third Division South on three occasions, helped by the goals of <a href="Ernie%20Morgan">Ernie Morgan</a>, who in <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20in%20English%20football">1954–55</a> set a new club record by scoring 31 league goals. In <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a> and <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20in%20English%20football">1957–58</a>, however, the Gills found themselves once again rooted to the bottom of the table, and this meant that with the restructuring of the league system for the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> season, the team was placed in the newly created <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a> – a top-half finish would have led to placement in the new national Third Division. 1958 also saw the departure of long-serving manager Archie Clark, who had held the post since before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, with <a href="Harry%20Barratt">Harry Barratt</a> taking over.
The Gills were still in the Fourth Division in 1962 when Barratt was replaced as manager by <a href="Freddie%20Cox">Freddie Cox</a>, who inherited a team which had just finished 20th in the table. Cox set about fashioning a new team noted for its formidable defensive capabilities. After finishing in 5th place in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63</a> Gillingham went on to gain promotion the following year, winning the only championship in the club's history. With goalkeeper <a href="John%20Simpson%20%28footballer%20born%201933%29">John Simpson</a> setting a new club record by conceding only 30 goals all season, the team finished level on 60 points with <a href="Carlisle%20United%20F.C.">Carlisle United</a>, but with a fractionally better <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a>, and so claimed the championship in the tightest finish in Football League history.

Gillingham initially performed well at the higher level, twice coming close to promotion, but performances then declined and the club was relegated back to the Fourth Division in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71</a>. The Gills quickly bounced back, however, and were promoted back to the Third Division in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1973–74</a> under the management of <a href="Andy%20Nelson%20%28footballer%29">Andy Nelson</a>. With the help of players such as <a href="Brian%20Yeo">Brian Yeo</a>, who equalled Ernie Morgan's record for most league goals in a season with 31, Gillingham scored a club record total of 90 league goals and finished as runners-up to <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a>.

After guiding the club to promotion Andy Nelson left to take over as manager of <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> and was replaced by <a href="Len%20Ashurst">Len Ashurst</a>, but his managerial reign lasted only 16 months. <a href="Gerry%20Summers">Gerry Summers</a> took over and was to take the club the closest it had ever come to promotion to <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Division Two</a> when, in <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20in%20English%20football">1978–79</a>, Gillingham finished just one point off a promotion place, but two years later Summers was replaced by <a href="Keith%20Peacock">Keith Peacock</a>. Peacock put together a team which developed a reputation for exciting, attacking play, and also brought through the ranks a number of young players who went on to achieve success at a higher level, including <a href="Micky%20Adams">Micky Adams</a>, <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a>, and <a href="Tony%20Cascarino">Tony Cascarino</a>, who was famously bought from non-league <a href="Crockenhill%20F.C.">Crockenhill</a> in exchange for a set of tracksuits. Gillingham came close to promotion several times during Peacock's reign, with four top-six finishes in six years, and in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87</a> reached the play-offs (in their first year of existence) only to lose in the final to <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a>. Deadlocked at 2–2 after the home and away legs of the final, the two teams had to play a third match at a neutral venue, which Swindon won 2–0.

The club's failure to gain promotion meant that it was unable to hang on to the ambitious Cascarino, who was sold to <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> for £225,000, but despite the loss of the team's star striker the Gills' <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20in%20English%20football">1987–88</a> season began with a flurry of goals. On consecutive Saturdays Gillingham beat <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a> 8–1 and <a href="Chesterfield%20F.C.">Chesterfield</a> 10–0 (the latter a new club record for a professional match), but the early-season promise faded and in December Peacock was controversially sacked after a 6–0 defeat to <a href="Aldershot%20F.C.">Aldershot</a>. His assistant, <a href="Paul%20Taylor%20%28footballer%20born%201949%29">Paul Taylor</a>, was promoted to manager, but after an unsuccessful spell in charge Taylor was himself replaced in October 1988 by former <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager <a href="Keith%20Burkinshaw">Keith Burkinshaw</a>. Burkinshaw was unable to turn the team's fortunes around, however, and departed shortly before the club's relegation to Division Four was confirmed at the end of the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89</a> season.

Former Gillingham player <a href="Damien%20Richardson%20%28footballer%29">Damien Richardson</a> became the club's next manager, with veteran goalkeeper <a href="Ron%20Hillyard">Ron Hillyard</a> as his assistant, but the club's financial situation was poor and the pair struggled to produce results with a squad composed of ageing journeymen and untried youngsters, and both men were sacked in September 1992, with <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a> taking over as manager. Gillingham's league status was in jeopardy for most of the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a> Division Three campaign, with relegation to the <a href="National%20League%20%28English%20football%29">Football Conference</a> a distinct possibility until the last home match of the season, when a 2–0 win over <a href="Halifax%20Town%20F.C.">Halifax Town</a> ensured the club's survival. Nonetheless, the financial crisis continued at Priestfield, and steadily improving league form over the next two seasons did little to disguise the fact that the club was in real danger of going out of existence.

The club eventually went into <a href="Administrative%20receivership">receivership</a> in January 1995, and by the end of the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20in%20English%20football">1994–95</a> season, with Gillingham facing the threat of being expelled from the Football League and closed down, fans were wondering whether they had seen the last ever Gills match. However, help was on its way in the form of a last-ditch purchase of the club.

In June 1995 a London-based former office supplies salesman, <a href="Paul%20Scally">Paul Scally</a>, stepped in and bought the club for a nominal fee. Scally brought in new manager <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a>, who signed almost a complete new team and led Gillingham to promotion in his first season, finishing second in Division Three (now <a href="EFL%20League%20Two">Football League Two</a>). This season was also notable for the fact that the team only conceded 20 league goals – a league record for a 46-game season. In 1999 Gillingham reached the playoffs, but lost in the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> play-off final against <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. Following goals by the prolific partnership of <a href="Robert%20Taylor%20%28footballer%29">Robert Taylor</a> and <a href="Carl%20Asaba">Carl Asaba</a>, the Gills led 2–0 with less than two minutes left, only to see Manchester City score twice, the equaliser in injury time, and then win a penalty shoot-out 3–1.

Soon after the play-off loss, Pulis was sacked for gross misconduct, with <a href="Peter%20John%20Taylor">Peter Taylor</a> replacing him as manager. In the <a href="1999%E2%80%9300%20in%20English%20football">1999–00</a> season Gillingham went on a club record breaking <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> run, beating then-<a href="FA%20Premier%20League">Premiership</a> teams <a href="Bradford%20City%20A.F.C.">Bradford City</a> and <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> before losing 5–0 to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in the quarter-finals. The team also finished in third place in the league and thus qualified for the <a href="English%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-offs</a> again, facing <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in the final. The game finished 1–1 after 90 minutes but thanks to goals in extra time from Gillingham substitutes <a href="Steve%20Butler%20%28footballer%29">Steve Butler</a> and <a href="Andy%20Thomson%20%28footballer%20born%201971%29">Andy Thomson</a> the club was promoted to the second tier of the English league (<a href="EFL%20Championship">Division One</a>) for the first time. As Taylor had only signed a one-year deal, <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, then in the <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">Premiership</a>, approached him to be their new manager.

Former team captain <a href="Andy%20Hessenthaler">Andy Hessenthaler</a> was appointed player-manager, having previously served as player-coach, and led the club to league finishes of 13th, 12th and 11th in his first three seasons in charge. In contrast, the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> season saw the club escape relegation by the narrowest of margins, with a last day goalless draw keeping Gillingham above <a href="Walsall%20F.C.">Walsall</a> on goal difference, with just one goal separating the two teams. <a href="John%20Gorman%20%28footballer%29">John Gorman</a> was appointed to help Hessenthaler as the side started the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05</a> season poorly, but as the team continued to struggle at the wrong end of the table Hessenthaler resigned as manager in late November. Somewhat unusually he continued to be employed as a player. Gorman succeeded Hessenthaler in a caretaker capacity but left the club to take the manager's job at <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a>. Gillingham then appointed former <a href="Burnley%20F.C.">Burnley</a> boss <a href="Stan%20Ternent">Stan Ternent</a> as manager, but despite a late run of positive results, he could not prevent the Gills' relegation to <a href="EFL%20League%20One">League One</a> on the last day of the season. In a reversal of the previous season's fortunes, <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe Alexandra</a>, the team immediately above Gillingham in the table, survived by just one goal.

The <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> season started with <a href="Neale%20Cooper">Neale Cooper</a> being appointed as the new manager, but despite achieving a 3–2 victory over <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">Premiership</a> side <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> in the <a href="EFL%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>, the team struggled in the league, and shortly after defeat in the first round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> by <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> side <a href="Burscough%20F.C.">Burscough</a>, Cooper resigned. He was replaced by <a href="Ronnie%20Jepson">Ronnie Jepson</a>, who led the team to a mid-table finish, which he repeated in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20in%20English%20football">2006–07</a>. After a poor start to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> season Jepson resigned, and <a href="Mick%20Docherty">Mick Docherty</a> and <a href="Iffy%20Onuora">Iffy Onuora</a> were appointed joint caretaker managers. Docherty left the club a month later, but Onuora remained in charge until the appointment of <a href="Mark%20Stimson">Mark Stimson</a> on 1 November 2007. At the end of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> season the club was relegated from League One. The following season the Gills earned promotion through the play-offs after finishing fifth in the league, <a href="Simeon%20Jackson">Simeon Jackson</a> scoring the only goal in the <a href="2009%20Football%20League%20Two%20play-off%20Final">final</a> against <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10</a> season, however, the Gills were relegated back to League Two,
with Stimson leaving the club by mutual consent two days after the end of the season. Within two weeks, <a href="Andy%20Hessenthaler">Andy Hessenthaler</a> returned for a second spell as manager.

For two consecutive seasons the Gills finished just outside the play-off places in League Two, following which Hessenthaler was moved to the position of Director of Football and <a href="Martin%20Allen%20%28footballer%29">Martin Allen</a> appointed as manager. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">2012–13</a> season, helped by a new club record of eleven away wins in a season, the club once again gained promotion back to League One, winning the League Two championship, only the second title the club had ever won at a professional level. The following October, however, Allen was sacked after a poor start to the season and <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%20born%201953%29">Peter Taylor</a> was appointed manager for a second time. Taylor was sacked after fourteen months in the job, and his successor <a href="Justin%20Edinburgh">Justin Edinburgh</a> lasted until January 2017. Former Gillingham player <a href="Adrian%20Pennock">Adrian Pennock</a> returned as manager, but the team came close to relegation at the end of the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20in%20English%20football">2016–17</a> season. Pennock left the club by mutual consent in September 2017, and <a href="Steve%20Lovell%20%28Welsh%20footballer%29">Steve Lovell</a>, another former Gills player, took charge.

1960 South Vietnamese coup attempt

On November 11, 1960, a failed <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> attempt against President <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a> of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> was led by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="V%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4ng">Vương Văn Đông</a> and Colonel <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ch%C3%A1nh%20Thi">Nguyễn Chánh Thi</a> of the <a href="Vietnamese%20Airborne%20Division">Airborne Division</a> of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN).

The rebels launched the coup in response to Diệm's autocratic rule and the negative political influence of his brother <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a> and his sister-in-law <a href="Madame%20Nhu">Madame Nhu</a>. They also bemoaned the politicisation of the military, whereby regime loyalists who were members of the Ngô family's covert <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Lao%20Party">Cần Lao Party</a> were readily promoted ahead of more competent officers who were not insiders. Đông was supported in the conspiracy by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Nguyen%20Trieu%20Hong">Nguyen Trieu Hong</a>, whose uncle was a prominent official in a minor opposition party. The main link in the coup was Đông's commanding officer Thi, whom he persuaded to join the plot.

The coup caught the Ngô family completely off-guard, but was also chaotically executed. The plotters neglected to seal the roads leading into the capital <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> to seal off loyalist reinforcements, and they hesitated after gaining the initiative. After initially being trapped inside the <a href="Independence%20Palace">Independence Palace</a>, Diệm stalled the coup by holding negotiations and promising reforms, such as the inclusion of military officers in the administration. In the meantime, opposition politicians joined the fray, trying to exploit Diệm's position. However, the president's real aim was to buy time for loyalist forces to enter the capital and relieve him. The coup failed when the <a href="5th%20Division%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">5th</a> and <a href="7th%20Division%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">7th Divisions</a> of the ARVN entered Saigon and defeated the rebels. More than four hundred people—many of whom were civilian spectators—were killed in the ensuing battle. These included a group of anti-Diệm civilians who charged across the palace walls at Thi's urging and were cut down by loyalist gunfire.

Đông and Thi fled to <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, while Diệm berated the United States for a perceived lack of support during the crisis. Afterwards, Diệm ordered a crackdown, imprisoning numerous anti-government critics and former cabinet ministers. Those that assisted Diệm were duly promoted, while those that did not were demoted. A trial for those implicated in the plot was held in 1963. Seven officers and two civilians were sentenced to death "<a href="trial%20in%20absentia">in absentia</a>", while 14 officers and 34 civilians were jailed. Diệm's regime also accused the Americans of sending <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> members to assist the failed plot. When Diệm was <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassinated</a> after a <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">1963 coup</a>, those jailed after the 1960 revolt were released by the new military junta.

The revolt was led by 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel <a href="V%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4ng">Vương Văn Đông</a>, a northerner, who had fought with the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> forces against the <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> during the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a>. Later trained at <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a> in the United States, Đông was regarded by American military advisers as a brilliant tactician and the brightest military prospect of his generation and he served in the <a href="Vietnamese%20Airborne%20Division">Airborne Division</a>. Back in Vietnam, Đông became discontented with Diệm's arbitrary rule and constant meddling in the internal affairs of the army. Diệm promoted officers on loyalty rather than skill, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from challenging his rule. Years after the coup, Đông asserted that his sole objective was to force Diệm to improve the governance of the country. Đông was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, the director of training at the Joint General Staff School, and Hong's uncle <a href="Hoang%20Co%20Thuy">Hoang Co Thuy</a>. Thuy was a wealthy Saigon-based lawyer, and had been a political activist since World War II. He was the secretary-general of a minority opposition party called the Movement of Struggle for Freedom, which had a small presence in the rubber-stamp National Assembly.

Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) officers were members of other anti-communist nationalist groups that were opposed to Diệm, such as the <a href="%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i%20Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Qu%E1%BB%91c%20d%C3%A2n%20%C4%91%E1%BA%A3ng">Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng</a> ("Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam") and the <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20Nam%20Qu%E1%BB%91c%20D%C3%A2n%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A3ng">Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng</a> (VNQDĐ, "Vietnamese Nationalist Party"), which were both established before World War II. The VNQDĐ had run a military academy in <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> near the Chinese border with the assistance of their nationalist Chinese counterparts, the <a href="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a>. Diệm and his family had crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDĐ and Đại Việt trained officers were denied such promotions. They felt that politically minded officers, who joined Diệm's secret Catholic-dominated <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Lao%20Party">Cần Lao Party</a>, which was used to control South Vietnamese society, were rewarded with promotion rather than those most capable.

Planning for the coup had gone on for over a year, with Đông recruiting disgruntled officers. This included his commander, Colonel <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ch%C3%A1nh%20Thi">Nguyễn Chánh Thi</a>. In 1955, Thi had fought for Diệm against the <a href="B%C3%ACnh%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Bình Xuyên</a> <a href="organized%20crime">organised crime syndicate</a> in the <a href="Battle%20for%20Saigon">Battle for Saigon</a>. This performance so impressed Diệm—a lifelong bachelor—that he thereafter referred to Thi as "my son". However, the Americans who worked with Thi were less impressed. The <a href="CIA">CIA</a> described Thi as "an opportunist and a man lacking strong convictions". An American military advisor described Thi as "tough, unscrupulous, and fearless, but dumb". There is some dispute as to whether Thi participated in the coup of his free choice. According to some sources, Thi was still an admirer of Diệm and was forced at gunpoint by Đông and his supporters to join the coup at the last minute, having been kept unaware of the plotting. According to this story, Thi's airborne units were initially moved into position for the coup without his knowledge.

Many months before the coup, Đông had met Diệm's brother and adviser <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>, widely regarded as the brains of the regime, to ask for reform and de-politicisation of the army. Đông said that the meeting went well and was hopeful that Nhu would enact change. However, a few weeks later, Dong and his collaborators were transferred to different commands and physically separated. Fearing that Diệm and Nhu were trying to throw their plans off balance, they accelerated their planning work, and decided to move on October 6. However, they were then scheduled to go into battle against the communists near <a href="Kon%20Tum">Kon Tum</a> in the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">II Corps</a> in the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Vietnam%29">Central Highlands</a>, forcing a postponement. According to the historian <a href="George%20McTurnan%20Kahin">George McTurnan Kahin</a>, Đông was without a command by the time the coup was held.

The Americans started to notice and become alarmed at increasing reports of political disillusionment in the military officer corps in August. An intelligence report prepared by the US State Department in late August claimed the "worsening of internal security, the promotion of incompetent officers and Diệm's direct interference in army operations ... his political favoritism, inadequate delegation of authority, and the influence of the Can Lao". It also claimed that discontent with Diệm among high-ranking civil servants was at their highest point since the president had established in power, and that the bureaucrats wanted a change of leadership, through a coup if needed. It was said that Nhu and <a href="Madame%20Nhu">his wife</a> were the most despised among the civil service. The report predicted that if a coup was to occur, the objective would probably be to force Nhu and his wife out of positions of power and allow Diệm to continue to lead the country with reduced power, should he be willing to do so. The intelligence analysis turned out to be correct.

The US Ambassador <a href="Elbridge%20Durbrow">Elbridge Durbrow</a>, who had been in the post since 1957, had a long record of trying to pressure Diệm into political reforms. He felt that South Vietnam's political problems were due to Diệm's illiberalism and thought the communist insurgency would be more easily defeated if Diệm reached out to a broader cross-section of society, cracked down on corruption, cronyism, abusive public servants, and implemented land reform. However, the South Vietnamese president saw authoritarianism as the solution to political problems and opposition, and the US military hierarchy in Vietnam agreed, leading to frequent disputes between Durbrow and the <a href="Military%20Assistance%20Advisory%20Group">Military Assistance Advisory Group</a>. Durbrow frequently reported to Washington that Diệm's strong-arm tactics against opposition only created more dissent and opportunities for the communists.

Around this time, Durbrow began to advise Diệm to remove Nhu and his wife from the government, basing his arguments on a need to cultivate broad popular support to make South Vietnam more viable in the long term. His key suggestions included Nhu being sent abroad as an ambassador and "altering the nature of the Cần Lao Party". As Nhu and the Can Lao were a core means of his keeping power, Diệm did not follow Durbrow's advice.

On September 16, after another fruitless meeting with Diệm, Durbrow reported to Washington: "If Diệm's position in [the] country continues to deteriorate ... it may become necessary for [the] US government to begin consideration [of] alternative courses of action and leaders in order [to] achieve our objective." In another State Department Report, it was concluded that a coup would become more likely "if Diệm continued to remain uncompromising and if the opposition felt that the United States would not be unsympathetic to a coup or that U.S.-Vietnamese relations would not be seriously damaged." As it turned out those in Vietnam discontented with Diệm reached the same conclusion, that the US would not mind them toppling the president.

The coup was organised with the help of some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The marine battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Pham%20Van%20Lieu">Pham Van Lieu</a>. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00. However, the airborne soldiers were not aware of what their officers had in store. They were told that they were heading into the countryside to attack the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a>. Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the <a href="Presidential%20Guard%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">Presidential Guard</a>, who were meant to guard the presidential palace, had mutinied against Diệm.

According to <a href="Stanley%20Karnow">Stanley Karnow</a>, the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning author of "Vietnam: A History", the coup was ineffectively executed; although the rebels captured the headquarters of the Joint General Staff at <a href="Tan%20Son%20Nhut%20Air%20Base">Tan Son Nhut Air Base</a>, they failed to follow the textbook tactics of blocking the roads leading into <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>. They also failed to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diệm to call for aid from loyal units.

The paratroopers headed down the main thoroughfare of Saigon towards Independence Palace. At first, the forces encircled the compound without attacking, believing that Diệm would comply with their demands. Đông attempted to call on US ambassador <a href="Elbridge%20Durbrow">Elbridge Durbrow</a> to put pressure on Diệm. Durbrow, although a persistent critic of Diệm, maintained his government's position of supporting Diệm, stating "We support this government until it fails". Durbrow later recalled receiving a telephone call from an aide to Diệm who insisted that he call Diệm and tell him to surrender or face a <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> attack on the palace. Durbrow refused and no attack took place. He consequently learned that the aide was forced to make the call.

Most of the rebel soldiers had been told that they were attacking in order to save Diệm from a mutiny by the Presidential Guard. Only one or two officers in any given rebel unit knew the true situation. A high wall, a fence and a few guard posts, surrounded the palace grounds. The mutinous paratroopers disembarked from their transport vehicles and moved into position for an attack on the main gate. Some ran forward and others raked automatic gunfire at the front of the palace, shattering most of the windows and puncturing the walls. Diệm was nearly killed in the opening salvoes. A rebel machine gun fired into Diệm's bedroom window from the adjacent Palais de Justice and penetrated his bed, but the president had arisen just a few minutes earlier.

The paratroopers' first assault on the palace met with surprising resistance. The Presidential Guardsmen who stood between the rebels and Diệm were estimated at between 30 and 60, but they managed to repel the initial thrust and kill seven rebels who attempted to scale the palace walls and run across the grass. The rebels cordoned off the palace and held fire. They trucked in reinforcements and the attack restarted at 7:30, but the Presidential Guard continued to resist. Half an hour later, the rebels brought in five armored vehicles and circumnavigated the palace. They fired at the perimeter posts, and mortared the palace grounds. However, the exchange had petered out by 10:30. In the meantime, the rebels had captured the national police offices, Radio Saigon and the barracks of the Presidential Guard. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest, meaning that Diệm's saviours would have to come from outside Saigon. However, the rebels also suffered a setback when Hong was killed during the battle for the police headquarters. He had been sitting in his jeep behind the frontline when he was hit by stray gunfire.

Diệm headed for the cellar, joining his younger brother and confidant <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>, and his wife <a href="Madame%20Nhu">Madame Nhu</a>. Brigadier General <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Kh%C3%A1nh">Nguyễn Khánh</a>, at the time the Chief of Staff of the ARVN, climbed over the palace wall to reach Diệm during the siege. Khanh lived in the city center, close to the palace, and awoken by the gunfire, he drove towards the action. The plotters had tried to put him under house arrest at the start of the coup, but were unaware that he had moved house. Khanh proceeded to coordinate the loyalist defenders, along with Ky Quan Liem, the deputy director of the Civil Guard.

At dawn, civilians began massing outside the palace gates, verbally encouraging the rebels and waving banners advocating regime change. Saigon Radio announced that a "Revolutionary Council" was in charge of South Vietnam's government. Diệm appeared lost, while many Saigon-based ARVN troops rallied to the insurgents. According to Nguyễn Thái Bình, an exiled political rival, "Diệm was lost. Any other than he would have capitulated." However, the rebels hesitated as they decided their next move. There was debate on what Diệm's role would be in future. Đông felt that the rebels should take the opportunity of storming the palace and capturing Diệm. Thi on the other hand, was worried that Diệm could be killed in an attack. Thi felt that despite Diệm's shortcomings, the president was South Vietnam's best available leader, believing that enforced reform would yield the best outcome. The rebels wanted Nhu and his wife out of the government, although they disagreed over whether to kill or deport the couple.
Thi demanded that Diệm appoint an officer as prime minister and that Diệm remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorised by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed because he was corrupt and suppressed liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent his private secretary <a href="Vo%20Van%20Hai">Vo Van Hai</a> to negotiate with the coup leaders. In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep abreast of their demands, which they reiterated. The rebels' negotiators were Đông and Major <a href="Nguyen%20Huy%20Loi">Nguyen Huy Loi</a>. They wanted officers and opposition figures to be appointed to a new government to keep Diệm in check.

The plotters unilaterally named Brigadier General <a href="L%C3%AA%20V%C4%83n%20Kim">Lê Văn Kim</a>, the head of the <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Military%20Academy">Vietnamese National Military Academy</a>, the nation's premier officer training school in <a href="Da%20Lat">Da Lat</a>, would be their new prime minister. Kim was not a Can Lao member and was later put under house arrest after Diệm regained control. According to Kim's brother-in-law, Major General <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4n">Trần Văn Đôn</a>, Kim was willing to accept the post but was not going to say anything unless the coup succeeded. The rebels also suggested that Diệm appoint General <a href="L%C3%AA%20V%C4%83n%20T%E1%BB%B5">Lê Văn Tỵ</a>, the chief of the armed forces, be made defence minister. Diệm asked Ty, who had been put under house arrest by the plotters, if he was willing, but the officer was not. During the afternoon of November 11, the rebels used Ty as an intermediary to pass on their demands to the president. A broadcast was made over Saigon Radio, during which Ty said he had consulted with Diệm and obtained his agreement for the "dissolution of the present government" and that "with agreement of the Revolutionary Council" had given the officers the task of constituting "a provisional military government".

<a href="Phan%20Quang%20%C4%90%C3%A1n">Phan Quang Đán</a> joined the rebellion and acted as the rebels' spokesman. The most prominent political critic of Diệm, Đán had been disqualified from the <a href="1959%20South%20Vietnamese%20legislative%20election">1959 legislative election</a> after winning his seat by a ratio of 6:1 despite Diệm having organised votestacking against him. He cited political mismanagement of the war against the Viet Cong and the government's refusal to broaden its political base as the reason for the revolt. Đán spoke on Radio Vietnam and staged a media conference during which a rebel paratrooper pulled a portrait of the president from the wall, ripped it and stamped on it. In the meantime, Thuy went about organising a coalition of political parties to take over post-Diệm. He had already lined up the VNQDĐ, Đại Việt, and the <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> and <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a> religious movements, and was seeking more collaborators.

Khanh returned to the palace and reported the result of his conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due to the demands of the rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, asserting that it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.

During the standoff, Durbrow ambivalently noted "We consider it overriding importance to Vietnam and Free World that agreement be reached soonest in order avoid continued division, further bloodshed with resultant fatal weakening Vietnam's ability [to] resist communists." American representatives privately recommended to both sides to reach a peaceful agreement to share power.

In the meantime, the negotiations allowed time for loyalists to enter Saigon and rescue the president. Khanh used the remaining communication lines to message senior officers outside Saigon. The <a href="5th%20Division%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">Fifth Division</a> of Colonel <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Thi%E1%BB%87u">Nguyễn Văn Thiệu</a>, a future president, brought infantry forces from <a href="Bi%C3%AAn%20H%C3%B2a">Biên Hòa</a>, a town north of Saigon. The <a href="7th%20Division%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">Seventh Division</a> of Colonel <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20Thi%E1%BB%87n%20Khi%C3%AAm">Trần Thiện Khiêm</a> brought in seven infantry battalions and tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from <a href="M%E1%BB%B9%20Tho">Mỹ Tho</a>, a town in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> south of Saigon. Khiêm was a Catholic with ties to Diệm's older brother, Archbishop <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Ngô Đình Thục</a>. Khanh also convinced <a href="L%C3%AA%20Nguy%C3%AAn%20Khang">Lê Nguyên Khang</a>, the acting head of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Marine%20Corps">Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps</a> to send the 1st and 2nd Marine Battalions. <a href="Vietnamese%20Rangers">Rangers</a> were called into Saigon from the western town of <a href="T%C3%A2y%20Ninh">Tây Ninh</a>. Assistant Secretary of Defense <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Thu%E1%BA%ADn">Nguyễn Đình Thuận</a> phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said "I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diệm can get together and agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists. If one side or the other has to make some concessions in order [to] reach an agreement, I believe that would be desirable to ensure unity against the communists." Durbrow was worried that if he sided with one faction over the other, and that group was defeated, the United States would be saddled with a hostile regime.

Diệm advised Khanh to continue to negotiate with the paratroopers and seek a rapprochement. After consenting to formal negotiations, the parties agreed to a ceasefire. In the meantime, loyalist forces continued to head towards the capital, while the rebels publicly claimed on radio that Diệm had surrendered in an apparent attempt to attract more troops to their cause. Diệm promised to end press censorship, liberalise the economy, and hold free and fair elections. Diệm refused to sack Nhu, but he agreed to dissolve his cabinet and form a government that would accommodate the Revolutionary Council. In the early hours of November 12, Diệm taped a speech detailing the concessions, which the rebels broadcast on Saigon Radio. In it he expressed his intention to "coordinate with the Revolutionary Council to establish a coalition government".

As the speech was being aired, two infantry divisions and supporting loyal armour approached the palace grounds. Some of these had broken through the rebel encirclement by falsely claiming to be anti-Diệm reinforcements, before setting up their positions next to the palace. The loyalists opened fire with mortars and machine guns, and both sides exchanged fire for a few hours. During the morning, Durbrow tried to stop the fighting, phoning Diệm to say that if the violence was not stopped, "the entire population will rise up against both loyalists and rebels, and the communists will take over the city. If a bloodbath is not avoided, all of Vietnam will go communist in a very short time." Durbrow deplored the attempt to resolve the situation with force. Diệm blamed the rebels for causing the outbreak of fighting and the collapse of the power-sharing deal. Some of the Saigon-based units that had joined the rebellion sensed that Diệm had regained the upper hand and switched sides for the second time in two days. The paratroopers became outnumbered and were forced to retreat to defensive positions around their barracks, which was an ad hoc camp that had been set up in a public park approximately away. After a brief but violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. This included a large number of civilians, who had been engaging in anti-Diệm protests outside the palace grounds. Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngos by charging the palace, and 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers from the 2nd Armored Battalion as they invaded the grounds. The others dispersed quickly.

After the failed coup, Đông, Thi, Lieu and several other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a <a href="C-47">C-47</a>. They fled to <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, where they were happily given asylum by Prince <a href="Norodom%20Sihanouk">Norodom Sihanouk</a>. Cambodia and South Vietnam had been on bad terms; Cambodia turned a blind eye to Vietnamese communists using their territory as a staging ground, while Diệm and Nhu had tried to foment opposition and had supported attempts to overthrow the Cambodian leader. Nhu had failed in a 1959 attempt to assassinate Sihanouk with a parcel bomb, and both nations' leaders despised one another.

Diệm promptly reneged on his promises, and began rounding up scores of critics, including several former cabinet ministers and some of the <a href="Caravelle%20Group">Caravelle Group</a> of 18 who had released a petition calling for reform. One of Diệm's first orders after re-establishing command was to order the arrest of Dan, who was imprisoned and tortured.

For Diệm and his family, the failed coup was a turning point in relations with the US support, which had generally been unconditional and strong since 1955. He felt the US had let him down and that some Americans had been encouraging his overthrow and undermining his rule. He had previously though the Americans had full support for him, but afterwards, he told his confidants that he felt like <a href="Syngman%20Rhee">Syngman Rhee</a>, the President of the anti-communist <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> who had been strongly backed by Washington until being deposed in a coup earlier in 1960, a regime change Diệm saw as US-backed. Diệm's opponents felt the same way about the similarities to Korea. Lieu later told Kahin "We had no worry about getting continued American assistance if we were successful; we felt we could count on it, just like <a href="Park%20Chung-hee">Park</a> did when he overthrew Rhee." Kahin also wrote that several senior officers including a senior figure in the coup, whom he did not name, were "explicit in charging American encouragement of the rebels".

In the wake of the failed coup, Diệm blamed Durbrow for a perceived lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this in later years, saying that he had been "100% in support of Diệm". In January 1961, Diệm told Kahin of his belief the US had been involved, while Nhu told Karnow "the principal culprits in the revolt were the 'western embassies' and individual Americans in particular ... American military advisers were helping the paratroopers during the revolt." In May 1961, Nhu said "[t]he least you can say ... is that the State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down ... and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was not at all the attitude the President would have expected". For Diệm, that Durbrow had called for restraint was an indication he saw Diệm and the rebels as equals, something Diệm saw as anathema. Durbrow called for Diệm to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diệm to "unify all elements of the country", but Diệm was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador, saying "You apparently do not understand that the rebels caused much blood-letting", accusing them having "duped" innocent people. Diệm also sent Gene Gregory, an American supporter who edited the "<a href="Times%20of%20Vietnam">Times of Vietnam</a>"—an English-language newspaper operated as a mouthpiece for the Nhus and known for stridently attacking Ngô family opponents—to meet Durbrow with concrete evidence of "American support of and complicity in the coup". From the coup onwards, Diệm became increasingly suspicious of Washington's policies. He was also angry with US media coverage of the coup, which depicted Diệm as authoritarian and the revolt as a manifestation of widespread discontent. Diệm instead viewed opposition simply as troublemakers.

The American military establishment strongly backed Diệm. Colonel <a href="Edward%20Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a>, a <a href="CIA">CIA</a> agent who helped entrench Diệm in power in 1955, ridiculed Durbrow's comments and called on the <a href="Eisenhower%20administration">Eisenhower administration</a> to recall the ambassador. Lansdale said that "It is most doubtful that Ambassador Durbrow has any personal stature remaining. Diệm must feel that Durbrow sided with the rebels emotionally. Perhaps he feels that Durbrow's remarks over the months helped incite the revolt." Lansdale criticised Durbrow: "At the most critical moment of the coup, the U.S. Ambassador urged Diệm to give in to rebel demands to avoid bloodshed." Lieutenant General <a href="Lionel%20C.%20McGarr">Lionel McGarr</a>, the new commander of the <a href="Military%20Assistance%20Advisory%20Group">Military Assistance Advisory Group</a>, agreed with Lansdale. McGarr had been in contact with both the rebel and loyalist units during the standoff and credited the failure of the coup to the "courageous action of Diệm coupled with loyalty and versatility of commanders bringing troops into Saigon". McGarr asserted that "Diệm has emerged from this severe test in position of greater strength with visible proof of sincere support behind him both in armed forces and civilian population." General <a href="Lyman%20Lemnitzer">Lyman Lemnitzer</a>, the chairman of the <a href="US%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">US Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> said that "When you have rebellious forces against you, you have to act forcibly and not restrain your friends. The main point is that sometimes bloodshed can't be avoided and that those in power must act decisively." The State Department advised President <a href="Dwight%20David%20Eisenhower">Dwight David Eisenhower</a> to send Diệm a congratulatory message, but Durbrow objected, arguing that Diệm would interpret the message as an unqualified endorsement of his rule and prevent him from "grasping and heeding lessons of [the] coup".

Diệm later implicated two Americans, <a href="George%20Carver%20%28CIA%20officer%29">George Carver</a> and <a href="Russ%20Miller%20%28official%29">Russ Miller</a> for involvement in the plot. Both had spent the coup attempt with the rebel officers. Durbrow had sent them there to keep track of the situation, but Diệm felt that they were there to encourage the uprising; the coup group's desired changes were very similar to those advocated by Durbrow in previous months. It was later revealed that Carver had friendly relations with the coup leaders and then arranged for Thuy to be evacuated from South Vietnam when the loyalists overwhelmed the paratroopers. Carver had also spent some of the coup period in a meeting with civilian rebel leaders at Thuy's house, although it is not known if he pro-actively encouraged Diệm opponents. The Ngô brothers indicated to the Americans that Carver should be deported, and soon after, Carver received a death warrant. The threat was supposedly signed by the coup leaders, who were ostensibly angry because Carver had abandoned them and withdrawn American support for them. The Americans thought that Nhu was the real culprit, but told the Ngô family that they were removing Carver from the country for his own safety, thereby allowing all parties to avoid embarrassment. Years later, Carver said he agreed with the rebels' thinking that Diệm was doing poorly and needed to be replaced, saying he was "absolutely convinced" that a regime change was needed to "achieve American objective in Vietnam". In his memoir, Don claimed Miller had cryptically encouraged him to overthrow Diệm a few months before the coup attempt.

The rift between American diplomatic and military representatives in South Vietnam began to grow. In the meantime, Durbrow continued his policy of pressuring Diệm to liberalize his regime. Durbrow saw the coup as a sign that Diệm was unpopular and with the South Vietnamese president making only token changes, the ambassador informed Washington that Diệm might have to be removed. However, in December, the Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs J. Graham Parsons told Durbrow to stop, cabling "Believe for present Embassy has gone as far as feasible in pushing for liberalization and future exhortation likely to be counterproductive." This was mirrored in the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> and Diệm. The paratroopers had been regarded as the most loyal of the ARVN's units, so Diệm intensified his policy of promoting officers based on loyalty rather than competence. Khiêm was made a general and appointed Army Chief of Staff. The Ngô brothers were so paranoid that they felt that Khanh was suspect as he had broken through the rebel lines too easily. Khanh's action gained him a reputation of having helped the president, but he was later criticised for having a foot in both camps. Critics claimed that Khanh had been on good terms with the rebels and decided against rebelling when it was clear that Diệm would win. Khanh was later dispatched to the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Vietnam%29">Central Highlands</a> as the commander of the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">II Corps</a>. General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a>, who did not come to Diệm's defense during the siege and instead stayed at home, was demoted. During the revolt, the plotters had nominated Minh to become their Defence Minister, but he refused when Diệm contacted him, claiming that he would willingly fight for Diệm on the battlefield, but was neither interested in nor suited for politics. However, Minh did not come to assist Diệm, and the president responded by appointing him to the post of Presidential Military Advisor, where he had no influence or troops to command in case the thought of coup ever crossed his mind.

Lansdale continued to be critical of Durbrow, and wanted to replace him as ambassador. Two months later, the incoming US President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> started a review of Washington's stance with regards to Saigon. Lansdale's report predicted South Vietnam's demise, <a href="domino%20theory">and along with it</a>, the rest of South East Asia and US preeminence in global affairs, unless a new direction was found. He blamed what he saw as Durbrow's poor judgement for the problems in the alliance, and that the current ambassador could not work effectively anymore because he had "sympathized strongly" with the coup. Without explicitly suggesting himself, Lansdale said that Durbrow had to be replaced with someone "with marked leadership talents" and the ability to "influence Asians through understanding them sympathetically". Lansdale called Diệm "the only Vietnamese with executive ability and the required determination to be an effective President" and said the new ambassador needed thus needed to have a rapport with him. Lansdale said Diệm was comfortable with MAAG and the CIA, but felt that diplomats were "very close to those who tried to kill him on November 11". During the meeting at which these matters were discussed, there was strong agreement that Durbrow's position in Saigon had become untenable. Lansdale's submissions were seen as being important in Kennedy's decision to replace Durbrow with <a href="Frederick%20Nolting">Frederick Nolting</a> in May 1961. Nolting was a mild man who was seen as unlikely to pressure Diệm to reform and therefore upset him. Kennedy was thought to have seriously contemplated the appointment of Lansdale, before encountering complaints from sections of the State and Defense Departments, among them Defense Secretary <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>. Kennedy also increased funding for Diệm immediately and made a show of support for the Vietnamese leader at the advice of Lansdale.

The trial of those charged with involvement in the coup occurred more than two years later in mid-1963. Diệm scheduled the hearing in the middle of the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a>, a move that was interpreted as an attempt to deter the populace from further dissent. Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the coup and called before the Special Military Court.

Diệm's officials gave the Americans an unsubtle warning not to interfere. The official prosecutor claimed to have documents proving that a foreign power was behind the failed coup but said that he could not publicly name the nation in question. It was later revealed in secret proceedings that he pinpointed two Americans: <a href="George%20Carver%20%28CIA%20officer%29">George Carver</a>, an employee of the United States Operations Mission (an economic mission) who was later revealed to be a <a href="CIA">CIA</a> agent, and <a href="Howard%20C.%20Elting">Howard C. Elting</a>, described as the deputy chief of the American mission in Saigon.

One of the prominent civilians summoned to appear before the military tribunal was a well-known novelist who wrote under the pen name of Nhat Linh. He was the VNQDĐ leader <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20T%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng%20Tam">Nguyễn Tường Tam</a>, who had been <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>'s foreign affairs minister in 1946. Tam had abandoned his post rather than lead the delegation to the <a href="Fontainebleau%20Conference">Fontainebleau Conference</a> and make concessions to the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a>. In the 30 months since the failed putsch, the police had not taken the conspiracy claims seriously enough to arrest Tam, but when Tam learned of the trial, he committed suicide by ingesting <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a>. He left a death note stating "I also will kill myself as a warning to those people who are trampling on all freedom", referring to <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Thích Quảng Đức</a>, the <a href="bhikkhu">monk</a> who self-immolated in protest against Diệm's persecution of Buddhism. Tam's suicide was greeted with a mixed reception. Although some felt that it upheld the Vietnamese tradition of choosing death over humiliation, some VNQDĐ members considered Tam's actions to be romantic and sentimental.

The brief trial opened on July 8, 1963. The seven officers and two civilians who had fled the country after the failed coup were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia. Five officers were acquitted, while the remainder were imprisoned for terms ranging from five to ten years. Another VNQDĐ leader <a href="V%C5%A9%20H%E1%BB%93ng%20Khanh">Vũ Hồng Khanh</a> was given six years in prison. Former Diệm cabinet minister <a href="Phan%20Kh%E1%BA%AFc%20S%E1%BB%ADu">Phan Khắc Sửu</a> was sentenced to eight years, mainly for being a signatory of the <a href="Caravelle%20Group">Caravelle Group</a> which called on Diệm to reform. Dan, the spokesman was sentenced to seven years. Fourteen of the civilians were acquitted, including Tam.

However, the prisoners' time in prison was brief, as Diệm was <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">deposed</a> and <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">killed in a coup</a> in November 1963. On November 8, political opponents who had been imprisoned on the island of <a href="Poulo%20Condore">Poulo Condore</a> were released by the military junta. Đán was garlanded and taken to military headquarters, and on November 10, Suu was released and welcomed by a large crowd at the town hall. Suu later served as president for a brief period and Dan as a deputy prime minister. Thi, Đông and Lieu returned to South Vietnam and resumed their service in the ARVN.

1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing

The 1962 South Vietnamese Independence Palace bombing in <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> was an <a href="Airstrike">aerial attack</a> on 27 February 1962 by two dissident <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Air%20Force">Republic of Vietnam Air Force</a> pilots, Second Lieutenant <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20C%E1%BB%AD%20%28pilot%29">Nguyễn Văn Cử</a> and First Lieutenant <a href="Pham%20Phu%20Quoc">Phạm Phú Quốc</a>. The pilots targeted the <a href="Saigon%20Governor%27s%20Palace">Independence Palace</a>, the official residence of the President of South Vietnam, with the aim of assassinating President <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Ngô Đình Diệm</a> and his immediate family, who acted as his political advisors.

The pilots later said they attempted the assassination in response to Diệm's autocratic rule, in which he focused more on remaining in power than on confronting the <a href="Vietcong">Vietcong</a>, a <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxist–Leninist</a> guerilla army who were threatening to overthrow the South Vietnamese government. Cử and Quốc hoped that the airstrike would expose Diệm's vulnerability and trigger a general uprising, but this failed to materialise.

One bomb penetrated a room in the western wing where Diệm was reading but failed to detonate, leading the president to claim that he had "divine" protection. With the exception of Diệm's sister-in-law <a href="Madame%20Nhu">Madame Nhu</a>, who suffered minor injuries, the Ngô family were unscathed. Three palace staff died and 30 were injured. Afterwards, Cử escaped to <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, but Quốc was arrested and imprisoned.

In the wake of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American presence in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the <a href="Media%20of%20the%20United%20States">American media</a> was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media speculated that the United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam; in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.

Cử was the second son of <a href="Nguyen%20Van%20Luc">Nguyễn Văn Lực</a>, a leader of the <a href="Viet%20Nam%20Quoc%20Dan%20Dang">VNQDD</a> (), which opposed the Diệm regime. In 1960, Diệm had jailed Lực for one month for engaging in "anti-government activities". The VNQDD planned that Cử and Quốc, another pilot from the same squadron, would attack the <a href="Saigon%20Governor%27s%20Palace">Independence Palace</a> on 27 February. Quốc had recently been personally commended by Diệm for his achievements in combat, having been honoured as one of the best pilots in the <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Air%20Force">Republic of Vietnam Air Force</a> (VNAF). Quốc had relatives who were involved with the VNQDD. Cử recruited Quốc by claiming the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Vietnamese armed services</a> and the United States were aware of the plot, showing him a "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" article critical of Diệm as evidence.

Quốc had more subordinates but was not sure of their loyalty, so he did not try to recruit them for the attack on the palace. Years later, Cử blamed Diệm's treatment of opposition parties as the motivation for his attack. He believed that Diệm had prioritised remaining in power over fighting the <a href="Vietcong">VC</a> and that, for six years, Cử had been denied promotion because of Diệm's obsession with hindering political opponents. Cử criticised the Americans for having supported Diệm, saying: "the Americans had slammed the door on those of us who really wanted the fight against the communists".

Quốc and Cử, who were trained in France and the United States, respectively, were given orders to fly from Saigon to the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> in an early morning mission against the <a href="Vietcong">Vietcong</a> (VC), an armed <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> guerilla army who wished to overthrow the government and who had backing from the Marxist government of <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>. The communists had been involved in attacks on <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> units south of the capital and had inflicted heavy damage. Instead of proceeding south from <a href="Bien%20Hoa%20Air%20Base">Bien Hoa Air Base</a> as ordered, they changed course to attack the Independence Palace, the official presidential residence. This meant that two companies of communist guerrillas were able to retreat after their attack without counter-attack.

At around 07:00, the deer on the expansive lawns of the <a href="French%20Indochina">French colonial-era</a> palace were frightened off as Quốc and Cử — flying American-built <a href="A-1%20Skyraider">A-1 Skyraider</a>s (A1H/AD-6 variant) single-seater ground attack planes—flew low over their target to inspect the ruling family's residence. On their second run, they attacked with bombs and <a href="napalm">napalm</a> before strafing the presidential compound with rocket and machine-gun fire. The duo continued their runs for 30 minutes before units loyal to the president arrived and launched a counter-attack. Taking advantage of poor weather and low cloud cover, the two pilots circled the palace at altitudes of around , periodically diving out of the clouds to re-attack before darting back into them. The airstrike caught the Saigon garrison off guard and, in the confusion, they were unable to determine whether the aircraft were acting alone or with ground forces. Loyalist tanks and armoured personnel carriers rushed to their battle stations and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, nearly hitting the loyalist aircraft from <a href="Bien%20Hoa%20Air%20Base">Bien Hoa Air Base</a> in pursuit of the two rebel planes. Two tanks and a number of jeeps armed with 50-calibre machine guns patrolled the smoke-filled streets as a precaution.

The first bomb penetrated a room in the western wing where Diệm was reading a biography of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. The bomb failed to detonate, which gave Diệm enough time to seek shelter in a cellar in the eastern wing. He was joined there by his elder brother Archbishop <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Thuc">Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục</a>, younger brother <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>, <a href="Madame%20Nhu">Madame Nhu</a>—who sustained an arm fracture while running toward the cellar—and their children. Elsewhere within the palace, three servants and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop where he had been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and although they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions. Quốc's aircraft was damaged by fire from a <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweeper</a>, forcing him to eject over the <a href="Saigon%20River">Saigon River</a> and land in <a href="Nha%20Be">Nhà Bè</a>, suffering minor facial injuries in the landing. He was arrested by a nearby naval patrol, and before being taken away for interrogation reportedly asked, "did I kill that filthy character?" Cử believed the attack had been successful and managed to safely flee to <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>. Commenting on the attack, a <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> officer opined: "with that weather, they did a hell of a job".

In a brief radio address after order had been restored, Diệm dismissed the attack as an "isolated act" and attributed his escape to "divine protection". He visited the soldiers wounded in the attacks, and also promised the rebel pilots' colleagues that they would not bear any responsibility for the bombing. American President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> promptly sent a message denouncing the attack as a "destructive and vicious act", and expressed relief that Diệm was "safe and unharmed". US ambassador <a href="Frederick%20Nolting">Frederick Nolting</a> determined that the attack had been the result of "two isolated cases" and opined that the incident did not represent widespread dissatisfaction with the regime. The absence of a Vietcong reaction led Nolting to label the bombing as a "limited scope, anti-Communist assassination attempt". Diệm was praised for outwardly projecting a calm demeanour following the attack, and he moved to temporary government accommodation usually used for foreign dignitaries and visited the VNAF base from where the pilots departed for their attack.

The National Assembly, Diệm's <a href="rubber%20stamp%20%28politics%29">rubber stamp</a> legislative body, urged the president to "take drastic measures against irresponsible elements". The day after the attack, the National Assembly's Steering Committee passed a resolution calling on Diệm to end "the policy of clemency" against dissidents and to "continue the struggle to protect the nation's destiny". They also called for punishments to be handed out to people who took advantage of the disorder by hoarding goods or speculating on food.

General <a href="Duong%20Van%20Minh">Duong Van Minh</a>, the presidential military advisor, attributed the assault to "disgruntled pilots", and noted that no hostile troop movements had occurred. The Civil Guard had remained loyal and its commander ordered his airborne forces to take over <a href="Tan%20Son%20Nhut%20Air%20Base">Tan Son Nhut Air Base</a>. A spokesperson for Diệm also denied that napalm had been used against the palace. This was widely believed to be due to the fact that the government was sensitive to the ramifications of the air force being revealed to have such weapons in their stocks. He claimed the situation was under "complete control".

The VNAF reacted to the two pilots' actions by sending a resolution to Diệm, saying that the attack was an "absolutely isolated and foolish" event that "impaired the prestige of the air force" and was "detrimental to the national effort in the present struggle and is profitable to the Communists in their work of subversion". The VNAF was regarded as being a highly loyal branch of the armed forces and its commander, Colonel <a href="Nguyen%20Quang%20Vinh">Nguyen Quang Vinh</a> had claimed the year before, that all of the VNAF's officer corps had voted for Diem in the 1961 presidential election. Upon hearing of the attack, Vinh boarded a specially chartered airplane provided by President <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> of Taiwan, to return to Saigon to make a statement on the situation and the political reliability of the VNAF. Vinh had been in Taiwan at a conference.

The <a href="National%20Revolutionary%20Movement%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">National Revolutionary Movement</a>, an organization used by the Ngô family to stage orchestrated mass demonstrations in support of themselves, called for the death penalty against the two pilots and further asked Diệm to enact the "strictest measures to insure discipline in the military". The Director General of Information released a statement calling for the "complete crushing" of "reactionaries" as well as communists. It referred to the attack as an "odious attempt against the lives of the President of the Republic and his family" and went on to disseminate an official version of the events of February 27, noting that "rumours have been running pertaining to the fate of Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu, who, with her family, as everyone knows, is a favorite target of the propaganda of reactionaries and Communists". The press release went on to describe the two rebel pilots as "ignominious people in the pay of the enemies of the Vietnamese people" and also assailed the foreign media, saying that "certain sections of the press of the world have given their support" to "reactionary and Communist propaganda". It concluded by saying "These developments clearly show that the leaders in their palace are sharing the fighting life of the people at the front. They confirm that in this battle to the end instigated by reactionaries and Communists against free Vietnam, there is no other duty for the people than to fight until the complete crushing of all their enemies is achieved.

As a result of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF aircraft be grounded and all aerial combat missions were suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, it was deemed too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists. On 2 March, three days after the attack, Diệm allowed the air force to resume combat operations, having concluded that Cử and Quốc's sentiments were not representative of the air force. For a few days after the attack, the areas around the palace were cordoned off and tanks were stationed at prominent streets in the capital.

Quốc was imprisoned for his actions, while Cử remained in exile in Cambodia where he worked as a language teacher. Cử told reporters in Cambodia that he was a nationalist, not a communist and predicted that attacks against the ruling family would continue. Cử cited the policies of the regime, rather than the president as a person, as the motivation for his attack. He said that "It is less Ngo Dinh Diem—sometimes well intentioned toward the population—than his family and supporters, who are hated by the army and the population". Diệm asked Cambodia to extradite Cử, but this request was refused. Cambodia's Prince <a href="Norodom%20Sihanouk">Norodom Sihanouk</a> and Diệm had extremely hostile relations, and the Ngô family had tried to depose him in the past by funding coup attempts. In 1959, Nhu tried to assassinate Sihanouk by sending him a parcel bomb. As a result, Sihanouk routinely gave asylum to political refugees who had tried to depose or kill Diệm. In November 1960, he had given asylum to a group of <a href="Vietnamese%20Airborne%20Division">paratroopers</a> who tried to <a href="1960%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup%20attempt">depose Diệm</a>.

In the meantime, Diệm's police sought to track down Cử's father, who had gone into hiding following the assassination attempt. After <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Diệm's assassination in November 1963</a>, Quốc was released from prison and Cử returned from exile on 16 November, and they resumed their service in the air force. Quốc advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 18 months before being killed in an air raid over North Vietnam on 20 April 1965.

On 4 March, Diệm held a review of the VNAF in central Saigon. Large crowds flocked to the banks of the Saigon River to watch formations of VNAF aircraft on aerial parade, although everyday civilians were not allowed within a block of the presidential box, where Diệm was accompanied by Nolting and General <a href="Paul%20D.%20Harkins">Paul D. Harkins</a>, head of the US military mission to Vietnam. The display included 29 of the aircraft used to attack Independence Palace. Diệm spoke about the events of 27 February and noted that he was "not unaware" of the supportive reaction of the various segments of society to "the foolish act perpetrated by some treacherous elements" that had "tried to rouse bloody troubles which would have profited only enemies of the fatherland". He said that the bombing was "merely an isolated action off a few insane traitors to the fatherland and to the people, while the entire air force, like the rest of the armed forces, demonstrated unfaltering loyalty and an unwavering spirit of national unity by rapidly and effectively countering the aggression of two criminals". He described that attack as "the odious act of renegades" and called upon the VNAF "to remain always vigilant, to turn away from all temptations, to scorn all perfidious schemes and to place the higher interest of the fatherland above personal interest". In response, the VNAF chief Vinh, asked Diệm for "forgiveness and clemency" and presented a plaque inscribed with a resolution from the VNAF condemning attack.

During Nolting's first meeting with Diệm after the assassination attempt, the president adamantly asserted that the media was responsible for the bombing. He pointed to the "Newsweek" article and other "derogatory articles in the press", using them to justify his claim that "the Americans were supporting the revolution". Diệm declared that while some journalists were portraying the bombing as a wake-up call he saw it as "a warning to them—an indicator of the danger of their irresponsibility in fomenting disorder".

In a later meeting with General <a href="Paul%20D.%20Harkins">Paul D. Harkins</a>, head of the US military mission to Vietnam, Diệm joked: "I shouldn't have put him in the air force, because I had put his father in jail years ago". Diệm went on to predict that "sometime I'm going to get shot right in the back of the neck. Sometime they'll get me that way". (He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">November 1963 coup</a>.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that "We don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more ... Diệm had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that "There's always going to be an opposition. If we take these people in, there will be another opposition springing up, because they are controversial men." Madame Nhu added, "You open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it."

The attack generated speculation that the US would respond by deploying combat troops in South Vietnam. At that time, US military personnel officially held only advisory capacities. In the response to media concerns about the stability of the Diệm government, <a href="US%20Secretary%20of%20State">US Secretary of State</a> <a href="Dean%20Rusk">Dean Rusk</a> denied that the US had plans to deploy combat forces. He also ruled out negotiations with the Vietcong, saying "the root of the trouble" was communist violations of the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Accords</a>.

<a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20India">United States Ambassador to India</a> <a href="John%20Kenneth%20Galbraith">John Kenneth Galbraith</a> lobbied Kennedy against the deployment of combat troops, believing that it would lead to endless South Vietnamese requests for more troops. Galbraith further believed that wasting US resources in the jungles of Vietnam would be playing into the hands of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. According to one US observer, the palace bombing provoked "full scale plotting against Diệm". Galbraith noted that "When the man in power is on the way down, anything is better" and considered that any change in South Vietnamese leadership would bring an improvement.

Phan Đình Phùng

Phan Đình Phùng (; 1847January 21, 1896) was a <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a> revolutionary who led rebel armies against <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French colonial</a> forces in Vietnam. He was the most prominent of the <a href="Confucian">Confucian</a> court scholars involved in anti-French military campaigns in the 19th century and was cited after his death by 20th-century nationalists as a <a href="Folk%20hero">national hero</a>. He was renowned for his uncompromising will and principles—on one occasion, he refused to surrender even after the French had desecrated his ancestral <a href="tomb">tomb</a>s and had arrested and threatened to kill his family.

Born into a family of <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarins</a> from <a href="H%C3%A0%20T%C4%A9nh%20Province">Hà Tĩnh Province</a>, Phan continued his ancestors' traditions by placing first in the metropolitan imperial examinations in 1877. Phan quickly rose through the ranks under Emperor <a href="T%E1%BB%B1%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Tự Đức</a> of the <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Dynasty">Nguyễn Dynasty</a>, gaining a reputation for his integrity and uncompromising stance against corruption. Phan was appointed as the Imperial Censor, a position that allowed him to criticise his fellow mandarins and even the emperor. As the head of the censorate, Phan's investigations led to the removal of many incompetent or corrupt mandarins.

Upon Tự Đức's death, Phan almost lost his life during a power struggle in the imperial court. The regent <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20Thuy%E1%BA%BFt">Tôn Thất Thuyết</a> disregarded Tự Đức's will of succession, and three emperors were deposed and killed in just over a year. Phan protested against Thuyet's activities, was stripped of his honours and briefly jailed, before being exiled to his home province. At the time, France had just conquered Vietnam and made it a part of <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>. Along with Thuyet, Phan organised rebel armies as part of the <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20movement">Cần Vương movement</a>, which sought to expel the French and install the boy Emperor <a href="H%C3%A0m%20Nghi">Hàm Nghi</a> at the head of an independent Vietnam. This campaign continued for three years until 1888, when the French captured Hàm Nghi and exiled him to <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>.

Phan and his military assistant <a href="Cao%20Th%E1%BA%AFng">Cao Thắng</a> continued their guerrilla campaign, building a network of spies, bases and small weapons factories. However, Cao Thắng was killed in the process in late 1893. The decade-long campaign eventually wore Phan down, and he died from dysentery as the French surrounded his forces.

Phan was born in the village of <a href="%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20Th%C3%A1i">Đông Thái</a> in the northern central coast province of <a href="H%C3%A0%20T%C4%A9nh%20Province">Hà Tĩnh</a>. Đông Thái was famous for producing high-ranking <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarins</a> and had been the home of senior imperial officials since the time of the <a href="L%C3%AA%20Dynasty">Lê Dynasty</a>. Twelve consecutive generations of the Phan family had been successful mandarinate graduates. All three of Phan's brothers who lived to adulthood passed the imperial examinations and became mandarins. Early on, Phan indicated his distaste for the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year. In his exam response, Phan cited Japan as an example of how an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.

Phan was never known for his scholarly abilities; it was his reputation for principled integrity that led to his quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor <a href="T%E1%BB%B1%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Tự Đức</a>. He was first appointed as a district mandarin in <a href="Ninh%20B%C3%ACnh%20Province">Ninh Bình Province</a>, where he punished a Vietnamese <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership had arisen out of the military and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government. Despite this, the <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a> court eventually removed Phan from this post.

Phan was transferred to the Huế court as a member of the censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing that the vast majority of the court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a> of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20Thuy%E1%BA%BFt">Tôn Thất Thuyết</a>, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.

Despite his prominent position in the <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Dynasty">Nguyễn Dynasty</a>, little is known about Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which was in the process of colonising Vietnam. France had first invaded in 1858, beginning the <a href="colonization%20of%20Cochinchina">colonisation of southern Vietnam</a>. Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saigon">Treaty of Saigon</a>, and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of <a href="Cochinchina">Cochinchina</a>. During the period, there was debate in the Huế court on the best strategy to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions. By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with <a href="Laos">Laos</a> and <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> into <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>.

Upon his death in 1883, the childless Tự Đức had named his nephew, <a href="Ki%E1%BA%BFn%20Ph%C3%BAc">Kiến Phúc</a>, as his successor, rather than <a href="D%E1%BB%A5c%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Dục Đức</a>, his most senior heir. Tự Đức had written in his will that Dục Đức was depraved and unworthy of ruling the country. However, led by Thuyet, the regents enthroned Dục Đức under the pressure of the ladies of the court. Phan protested against the violation of Tự Đức's will of succession and refused to sanction anyone other than Kien Phuc. Lucky to escape the death penalty, Phan was stripped of his positions. Later, Dục Đức was deposed and executed by Thuyet on the grounds of ignoring court etiquette, ignoring the mourning rites for Tự Đức and having affairs with the late emperor's consorts. Phan again protested the regents' actions and was briefly imprisoned by Thuyet, before being exiled to his home province.

Phan rallied to the cause of the boy Emperor <a href="H%C3%A0m%20Nghi">Hàm Nghi</a>—the fourth monarch in little over a year—after an abortive royal uprising at Huế in 1885. Thuyet and fellow regent <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20T%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng">Nguyễn Văn Tường</a> had enthroned <a href="Hi%E1%BB%87p%20H%C3%B2a">Hiệp Hòa</a> after disposing of Dục Đức. However, the new emperor was wary of the regents' behaviour and attempted to avoid their influence, leading Thuyet to organise his execution. The teenage <a href="Ki%E1%BA%BFn%20Ph%C3%BAc">Kiến Phúc</a> ascended the throne, but was poisoned by his adoptive mother <a href="H%E1%BB%8Dc%20phi%20Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Th%E1%BB%8B%20H%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">Học Phi</a>—one of Tự Đức's wives—whom he caught having intercourse with Tuong. Kien Phuc was thus replaced by his 14-year-old brother Hàm Nghi. In the meantime, the French concluded that the regents were causing too much trouble and had to be disposed of.

Thuyet had already decided to place Hàm Nghi at the head of the "<a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20movement">Phong Trào Cần Vuơng</a>" ("Loyalty to the Emperor Movement"), which sought to end French rule with a royalist rebellion. Phan helped the cause by setting up bases in <a href="H%C3%A0%20T%C4%A9nh">Hà Tĩnh</a> and creating his own guerrilla army. Thuyet had hoped to secure support from the <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> of China, but Phan thought that Vietnam's best chance of effective support came from <a href="Siam">Siam</a>. <a href="Gia%20Long">Gia Long</a>, the founder of the Nguyễn Dynasty and great-grandfather of Tự Đức, had married his sister off to the King of Siam. He had also used Siam as a base-in-exile during his quest for the throne in the 1780s. However, direct appeals to the Siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition. In preparation for the revolt, Thuyet had been building up an armed base at <a href="Tan%20So">Tan So</a> for over a year.

In any case, the Cần Vương revolt started on July 5, 1885 when Thuyet launched a surprise attack against the colonial forces after a diplomatic confrontation with the French. Thuyet took Hàm Nghi northwards to the Tan So mountain base near the border with Laos after the attack failed. The campaign was launched when the emperor issued the Can Vuong edict that had been prepared by the regent.

Phan initially rallied support from his native village and set up his headquarters on Mount <a href="V%C5%A9%20Quang">Vũ Quang</a>, which overlooked the coastal French fortress at Hà Tĩnh. Phan's organisation became a model for future insurgents. For flexibility, he divided his operational zone into twelve districts. His forces upheld military discipline and wore uniforms. Phan initially used the local <a href="Scholar-bureaucrats">scholar-gentry</a> as his military commanders. Their first notable attack targeted two nearby Catholic villages that had collaborated with French forces. Colonial troops arrived a few hours later, quickly overwhelming the rebels and forcing them to retreat to their home village, where the retribution was heavy. Phan managed to escape but his elder brother was captured by the same former viceroy of northern Vietnam who had been removed from office as a result of Phan's critical report. The disgraced official was now a French collaborator, serving as the governor of <a href="Ngh%E1%BB%87%20An%20Province">Nghệ An Province</a>.

The strategy of attempting to pressure Phan into capitulating was a classical strategy of coercion. The French used an old friend and fellow villager to make an emotional and deeply Confucian appeal for Phan to surrender in order to save his brother, his ancestral tombs and his entire village. Phan was reported to have replied:

Phan was later reported to have simply retorted, "If anyone carves up my brother, remember to send me some of the soup". However, he held no illusions about the prospect of successfully driving out the French, stating "It is our destiny. We accept it."

This incident and Phan's response are often cited as one of the reasons why he was so admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism. He identified with a countrywide cause, far removed from the questions of family and region.

Phan's men were well-trained and disciplined, and the military inspiration behind his rebellion was derived from <a href="Cao%20Thang">Cao Thang</a>, a bandit leader who had been protected from royal forces by Phan's brother a decade earlier. They operated in the provinces of <a href="Thanh%20H%C3%B3a%20Province">Thanh Hóa</a> in the north, <a href="H%C3%A0%20T%C4%A9nh%20Province">Hà Tĩnh</a>, <a href="Ngh%E1%BB%87%20An%20Province">Nghệ An</a> in the centre and <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20B%C3%ACnh%20Province">Quảng Bình</a> in the south, with their strongest areas being the two central provinces. In 1887, Phan concluded that his tactics were misguided, ordering his subordinates to cease open combat and resort to guerrilla tactics. His men built up a network of <a href="base%20camp">base camp</a>s, food caches, intelligence agents and peasant supply contacts. Phan traveled to the north in the hope of coordinating strategic and tactical plans with other leaders. In the meantime, Cao Thang led a force of around 1,000 men with some 500 firearms between them. Cao Thang produced around 300 rifles by disassembling and copying 1874-model French weapons that had been captured. For the purpose of creating such replica guns, they captured Vietnamese artisans. According to French officers who later captured some of the Vietnamese copies, the weapons were proficiently reproduced. The only details in which they were regarded as being defective were in the tempering of the springs, which were improvised with <a href="umbrella">umbrella</a> spokes, and the lack of <a href="rifling">rifling</a> in the barrels, which curtailed range and accuracy.

Nevertheless, the weaponry used by Phan's rebels was far inferior to that of their adversaries, and their inland positions were within firing range of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a>. The Vietnamese could not rely on China to give them material support, and other European powers such as Portugal, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were unwilling to sell them weapons for various reasons. Thus, Phan had to explore overland routes to procure weapons from Siamese sources—using seafaring transport was impossible due to the presence of the French Navy. He instructed his followers to create a secret route from Hà Tĩnh through Laos into northeastern Siam; one such route from Mount Vu Quang was believed to have been created around 1888. It is unclear if Phan himself went to Thailand, but a young female supporter named Co Tam was his designated arms buyer in <a href="Tha%20Uthen">Tha Uthen</a>, which boasted a substantial expatriate Vietnamese community. In 1890, the Siamese Army transported around 1,000 Austrian repeating-rifles from Bangkok to <a href="Luang%20Prabang">Luang Prabang</a> in Laos. However, it is unclear whether the weapons found their way into Vietnamese hands or whether they were related to Co Tam's activities.

In 1888, Hàm Nghi's <a href="Muong%20people">Muong</a> bodyguard <a href="Truong%20Quang%20Ngoc">Truong Quang Ngoc</a> betrayed him, leading to the emperor's capture and deportation to <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>. Phan and Cao Thang fought on in the mountainous areas of Hà Tĩnh, Nghệ An and Thanh Hóa. Another 15 bases were built along the mountain to complement the headquarters at Vu Quang. Each base had a subordinate commander leading units numbering between 100 and 500 men. The operations were funded by local villagers, who were levied with a land tax in silver and rice. Local bases were supported by nearby villages and excess funds were sent to Vu Quang. Phan's men foraged and sold <a href="cinnamon">cinnamon</a> bark to raise funds, while lowland peasants donated spare metals for the production of weapons.

When Phan returned from the north in 1889, his first order was to track down Hàm Nghi's betrayer Ngoc. When he was found, Phan personally executed Ngoc in <a href="Tuy%C3%AAn%20H%C3%B3a">Tuyên Hóa</a>. He then began a series of small-unit attacks on French installations through the summer of 1890, but these proved indecisive. The French relied mostly on district and provincial colonial units to man their perpetually increasing line of forts, which were usually commanded by a French lieutenant. In late 1890, a French effort to move into the low-lying villages and isolate the populace from the mountainous rebel bases failed. In the spring of 1892, a major French sweep of Hà Tĩnh failed, and in August, Cao Thang seized the initiative with a bold counterattack on the provincial capital. The rebels broke into the prison and freed their compatriots, killing a large number of the Vietnamese soldiers who defended the penitentiary as members of the French colonial forces. This caused the French to intensify their efforts against Phan, and a counteroffensive was conducted throughout the remainder of 1892, forcing the rebels to retreat back into the mountains. Two of their bases fell and steady French pressure began to break their covert resistance links with lowland villages. This compounded the problems of securing food, supplies, intelligence data and recruits. A ring of French forts continued to be erected, increasingly pinning down Phan's men. The only notable gain for Phan's forces during this period was the acquisition of gunpowder supplies from Siam. This enabled them to mix foreign and local powder in a 50:50 ratio, rather than their previous weaker mixture of 20:80.

Late in the year, the burden on Phan increased after the loss of two Can Vuong allies. In September, <a href="Tong%20Duy%20T%C3%A2n">Tong Duy Tân</a>—who led the royalists in Thanh Hóa— was captured and publicly executed. Nguyen Thien Thuat, who had been active in the northern provinces of <a href="H%C6%B0ng%20Y%C3%AAn">Hưng Yên</a> and <a href="H%E1%BA%A3i%20D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">Hải Dương</a>, fled to <a href="Guangxi">Guangxi</a> in China. The supporters of Tan and Tuat moved south and integrated into Phan's force.

In mid-1893, Cao Thang proposed a full-scale attack on the provincial seat of <a href="Ngh%E1%BB%87%20An">Nghệ An</a> and the surrounding posts. The plan proposed to Phan included diversions to the south and the training of almost 2,000 men in conventional military tactics. Unconvinced of its viability, Phan reluctantly approved the plan. The troops were eager, but after overpowering several small posts "en route", the main force was pinned down while attacking the French fort of No on September 9, 1893. Along with his brother, Cao Thang was mortally wounded while leading a risky frontal attack with 150 men, and the forces retreated in disarray. Phan regarded the loss of Cao Thang as a significant one, admitting as much in delivering the eulogy and funeral oration. According to the historian David Marr, there was evidence that Phan clearly realised the advantages and limitations of prolonged resistance. Although Phan had previously stated that he was not expecting ultimate success, the guerrilla leader thought that it was important to keep pressuring the French in order to demonstrate to the populace that there was an alternative to what he felt was a defeatist attitude from the Huế court.

<a href="Ho%C3%A0ng%20Cao%20Kh%E1%BA%A3i">Hoàng Cao Khải</a>, the French-installed viceroy of <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a>, perceived Phan's intent to a degree that his French masters did not. Khai was from a scholar-gentry family from the same village as Phan. He became the main backer of a determined effort to crush Phan's forces, using every means available: political, psychological and economic. By late 1894, relatives and suspected sympathisers of the insurgents were intimidated and more resistance commanders had been killed. Communications were disrupted, and the rebel hideouts became increasingly insecure. In an attempt to force Phan to surrender, the French arrested his family and desecrated the tombs of his ancestors, publicly displaying the remains in Hà Tĩnh.

Khai delivered a message to Phan via a relative. Phan sent a written reply, allowing their exchange to be studied. Khai recalled the common origins of the pair and promised Phan that he would lobby Governor-General <a href="Jean%20Marie%20Antoine%20de%20Lanessan">Jean Marie Antoine de Lanessan</a> and other French officials for an amnesty in return for Phan's surrender. Khai credited Phan with righteousness, loyalty and dedication towards the monarchy.

According to Marr, "Phan Dinh Phung's reply was a classic in savage understatement, utilizing standard formalism in the interest of propaganda, with deft denigration of his opponent". Phan appealed to Vietnamese nationalist sentiment, recalling his country's stubborn resistance to Chinese aggression. He cited defensive wars against the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han</a>, <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang</a>, <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song</a>, <a href="Yuan%20Dynasty">Yuan</a> and <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming dynasties</a>, asking why a country "a thousand times more powerful" could not annex Vietnam. Phan concluded that it was "because the destiny of our country has been willed by Heaven itself".

Phan placed the responsibility for the suffering of the people at the feet of the French, who "acted like a storm". After analysing his own actions, Phan concluded with a thinly veiled attack on Khai and his collaborators.

Khai's appeal was rebutted with an appeal to history, nationalist sentiment and a demand that the blame for death and destruction lay with the colonial forces and their Vietnamese assistants. Phan raised the stakes above family and village to the entire nation and its populace.

With Phan's rebuke in his hands, Khai translated both documents into French and presented them to de Lanessan, proposing that it was time for the final "destruction of this scholar gentry rebellion". In July 1895, French area commanders called in 3,000 troops to tighten the cordon around the three remaining rebel bases. The insurgents were able to execute ambushes at night, but Phan contracted dysentery and had to be carried on a stretcher whenever his unit moved. A collaborator mandarin named <a href="Nguyen%20Than">Nguyen Than</a>, who had previous experience in pacification in <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Ng%C3%A3i">Quảng Ngãi</a> and <a href="Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20Nam">Quảng Nam</a>, was drafted in to isolate the insurgents from their supporters in the villages. Cut off from their supplies, the insurgents were left to survive by eating roots and occasional handfuls of dried corn. Their shoes were worn through and most were without blankets. Phan died of dysentery on January 21, 1896, and his captured followers were executed. A report submitted by the de Lanessan to the Minister of Colonies in Paris stated that "the soul of resistance to the protectorate was gone".

Phan's remains were disturbed after his death. <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Kh%E1%BA%A3">Ngô Đình Khả</a>, a Catholic mandarin and father of <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Ngo Dinh Diem</a>—the first President of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>—was a member of the French colonial administration. Kha had Phan's tomb exhumed and used the remains in gunpowder used for executing revolutionaries.

Phan is widely regarded by Vietnamese people as a revolutionary hero. <a href="Phan%20B%E1%BB%99i%20Ch%C3%A2u">Phan Bội Châu</a>, regarded as the leading Vietnamese anti-colonial figure of the early 20th century, strongly praised Phan in his writing, with particular emphasis on his defiance of Khai. During Phan Boi Chau's career as a teacher, he strongly emphasised Phan's deeds to his students. In 1941, after returning to Vietnam after decades in exile, the <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> revolutionary <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a>, then using the name <a href="Nguyen%20Ai%20Quoc">Nguyen Ai Quoc</a> ("Nguyen the Patriot"), invoked the memory of Phan in appealing to the public for support for his independence movement. Like Phan, Ho was a native of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh. In the 1940s, Ho's <a href="Vietminh">Vietminh</a> named their self-produced style of grenades in honour of Phan. Since then, Ho's communists have portrayed themselves as the modern day incarnations of revered nationalist leaders such as Phan, <a href="Tr%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh">Trương Định</a> and Emperors <a href="L%C3%AA%20L%E1%BB%A3i">Lê Lợi</a> and <a href="Quang%20Trung">Quang Trung</a>, who expelled Chinese forces from Vietnam. Both North and South Vietnam had prominent thoroughfares in their capital cities (<a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> and <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, respectively) named in Phan's honour.

1964 Brinks Hotel bombing

The Brinks Hotel in <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, also known as the Brink Bachelor Officers Quarters (BOQ), was bombed by the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> on the evening of December 24, 1964, during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Two Viet Cong operatives detonated a <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a> underneath the hotel, which housed <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> officers. The explosion killed two Americans, an officer and an NCO, and injured approximately 60, including military personnel and Vietnamese civilians.

The Viet Cong commanders had planned the venture with two objectives in mind. First, by attacking an American installation in the center of the heavily guarded capital, the Viet Cong intended to demonstrate their ability to strike in <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> should the United States decide to launch air raids against <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>. Second, the bombing would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection.

The bombing prompted debate within the administration of United States President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>. Most of his advisers favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam and the introduction of American combat troops, while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> to protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong. In the end, Johnson decided not to take retaliatory action.

Following World War II, the communist-dominated <a href="Vietminh">Vietminh</a> fought the French colonial forces in an attempt to gain Vietnamese independence. After the French defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a> in 1954, <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">Vietnam was partitioned</a> at the <a href="Vietnamese%20Demilitarized%20Zone">17th parallel</a>, pending national reunification elections in 1956. The elections were canceled, resulting in the long-term existence of communist <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> and anti-communist <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> as separate states. In the late-1950s, South Vietnamese guerrillas known as the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a>—covertly supported by North Vietnam—began an insurgency with the aim of forcefully reunifying the country under communist rule. With the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> at its height, the United States—the main backer of South Vietnam—sent military advisers into the country to help train and guide the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) in their fight against the Vietcong. By 1964, there were 23,000 American military personnel in the country. The communists viewed the Americans as colonizers and the South Vietnamese as their puppets, and attacked both with force. Urban attacks on American personnel began in February 1963, with a bombing at a dining venue that killed one and wounded three. During that month, there were three more attacks on Americans in dining or entertainment venues, killing a total of 6 and injuring 68, leading to systematic security measures being put in place in Saigon to protect off-duty Americans.

The bombing was planned and performed by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. <a href="Nguyen%20Thanh%20Xuan">Nguyen Thanh Xuan</a> recollected his involvement to historian <a href="Stanley%20Karnow">Stanley Karnow</a> after the war had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a>s and <a href="major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a>s, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It also hosted a few officers who were members of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Training%20Team%20Vietnam">Australian Army Training Team Vietnam</a>. The building was named after Brigadier General F. G. Brink, who had served as an adviser to the <a href="French%20Expeditionary%20Corps">French Expeditionary Corps</a> during the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> and had been used by American personnel for about four years. A rooftop dinner had been planned for Christmas Eve.

According to the historian <a href="Mark%20Moyar">Mark Moyar</a>, it was a six-story building and had 193 bedrooms, although "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that the building had eight stories and had 60 bedrooms that housed two people each. The building was L-shaped. The building was surrounded by a 4.5 m concrete wall, which provided a buffer zone of 15 m from the wall of the actual hotel. The buffer zone was used as a carpark and the streets adjoining the hotel were heavily-lit and guarded by Vietnamese personnel at all times. However, the sentries had a reputation for being lax patrollers, as US journalists often entered the compound late in the evenings without being checked.

The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, mixing with the crowds in the busy street outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers so that they could copy their mannerisms, speaking style and even their way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.

The Vietcong commanders had planned the venture with two aims in mind. Firstly, by attacking an American institution in the heart of the heavily guarded capital, the bombing would demonstrate the Vietcong's ability to strike against the Americans in Vietnam, should the United States decide to launch air raids against North Vietnam. Secondly, the attack would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese public that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection. Xuan added that "all the crimes committed by the Americans were directed from this nerve center". In the month leading up to the attack, South Vietnamese military intelligence had seized communist documents indicating a strategy of attacking US military targets in urban areas during the Christmas period in order to lower the morale of the US public and therefore turn opinion against intervention in Vietnam. He recalled that the number of American officers at the Brinks Hotel had swelled on Christmas Eve because they were using the building to coordinate their celebrations, and that the attack would therefore cause more casualties than on a normal day.

The bombers stashed explosives weighing approximately in the trunk of one of the cars, and set a timing device to trigger the bomb at 17:45, during the <a href="happy%20hour">happy hour</a> in the officers' bar at the hotel. The pair drove their vehicles into the hotel's grounds. Knowing from their intelligence that a certain American colonel had returned to the US, the "major" lied and told the hotel clerk that he had an appointment with the American officer, claiming that the colonel would be coming from <a href="Da%20Lat">Da Lat</a>. The clerk correctly replied that the colonel had left the country, but the "major" insisted that the clerk was mistaken. The "major" then parked his vehicle in the car park beneath the hotel, before ordering his chauffeur to leave and fetch the American with the other vehicle. He then left the hotel grounds, asking the guard to tell the American colonel to wait for him. The "major" claimed that he had not eaten all day and was going to a nearby café.

While the "major" was at the eatery, the bomb detonated, killing two American officers. The first and highest-ranking officer killed was Lieutenant Colonel James Robert Hagen, who had served in the army for 20 years and was working for the <a href="MACV">MACV</a>. Hagen was found dead amid the rubble two hours after the blast. The second victim was David M. Agnew, a civilian employee of the Navy Department who attended to real estate matters.

The injury reports are conflicting. Karnow reported that 58 people (military and civilian) were injured, <a href="Mark%20Moyar">Mark Moyar</a> reported that 38 American officers were wounded along with 25 Vietnamese civilians, who worked inside the building, while journalist A. J. Langguth reported that 10 Americans and 43 Vietnamese were injured. A report in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" the day after the attack reported 98 injuries, including 61 US military personnel, 2 US civilians, 34 Vietnamese and an Australian serviceman. Many of the US officers were still on their way back to the Brinks and arrived a few minutes after the blast occurred; there would have been more casualties if the explosion had occurred later. Most of the injured suffered from lacerations or concussions and were not badly hurt, as all but 20 were released from hospital within five hours and those who remained did not suffer life-threatening injuries. However, many mid-level officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, were injured, but after one day in hospital, only seven lieutenant colonels, one major and three captains were yet to be discharged.

Apart from the steel girders, which supported the building, the explosion completely destroyed the ground floor. The bottom four floors were all punctured by the blast and sustained significant damage. The damage was accentuated because several trucks were in the underground car park, with gas canisters ready for delivery. As a result, the explosion detonated the gas, creating a fireball, which took 40 minutes to extinguish. Multiple vehicles were crushed or destroyed by fire, and one vehicle's engine was blown away by the explosion before crashing into a wall. Overall, the damage was sufficient that to render the building uninhabitable pending a major repair, and all those who were billeted there had to be moved to private dwellings or other mass accommodation. The debris caused by the bombing damaged nearby buildings, including the living quarters for enlisted men, located across the street, as well as Saigon's two leading hotels, the Caravelle and the Intercontinental. The force of the explosion also shattered windows at the <a href="United%20States%20Information%20Service">United States Information Service</a> two blocks away and in shopfronts on the main shopping promenade <a href="Rue%20Catinat">Rue Catinat</a>.

The blast destroyed the studios of the Armed Forces Radio Service, which were located on the ground floor of the hotel, but the station returned to the airwaves two hours later, using an emergency transmitter. The explosion forced the US to fly in more bomb-detection equipment, as most of the devices already in Vietnam were stored inside the hotel and were destroyed in the attack.

At the time, American entertainers, including <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>, were in Saigon to perform for US personnel. It is unclear whether Hope was a target; Moyar reported that Hope was targeted, but was delayed at the airport due to a luggage mishap, while Lawrence J. Quirk reported that the comedian and his troupe were staying in a hotel across the street and were not in range of the blast.

The attack surprised American officials and policymakers on Vietnam, who were confident that the South Vietnamese government was in control in Saigon and that the Vietcong were only a threat in rural areas. The South Vietnamese government was unstable, as it was the latest in a series of military juntas that had ruled for brief periods before being deposed. The infighting exasperated <a href="Maxwell%20Taylor">Maxwell Taylor</a>, the US ambassador to South Vietnam and former Chairman of the <a href="US%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">US Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, who felt that the disputes between the junta's senior officers were derailing the war effort. Less than two weeks before the bombing, the generals had dissolved the High National Council, a civilian advisory body, prompting Taylor to summon the generals to his office. The ambassador then angrily denounced the generals, and the next day advised General <a href="Nguyen%20Khanh">Nguyen Khanh</a>, the president, to resign and go into exile, as he had lost Taylor's confidence. Khanh threatened to expel Taylor, who said that his forced departure would mean the end of US support for South Vietnam. On December 22, Khanh announced on Radio Vietnam that "We make sacrifices for the country's independence and the Vietnamese people's liberty, but not to carry out the policy of any foreign country". Khanh explicitly denounced Taylor in an interview published in the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" on December 23, and on the day of the bombing, he issued a declaration of independence from "foreign manipulation". At the time, Khanh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping to put together a peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam. As a result, there was a suspicion among a minority that Khanh and his officers had been behind the attack, even though the Vietcong had claimed responsibility through a radio broadcast.

The Americans responded to the ground-level situation by organizing urgent security meetings with Saigon officials with a view to increasing safety standards. This led to an increase in military patrols around all US military accommodation in Saigon, which were also exhaustively searched for explosives. An additional 65 US Navy personnel were deployed for this purpose and, passers-by in the streets were stopped and checked for weapons.

General <a href="William%20Westmoreland">William Westmoreland</a>, who was the U.S. Army commander in South Vietnam, Taylor, and other senior U.S. officers in Saigon and Washington, D.C. urged President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam. Taylor messaged Washington on Christmas Day, saying, "Hanoi will get the word that, despite our present tribulations, there is still bite in the tiger they call paper, and the U.S. stock in this part of the world will take sharp rise. Some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate." Taylor recommended that the US take unilateral action, citing the animosity between himself and Khanh's junta.

Johnson called his U.S.-based advisers to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day. <a href="US%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Dean%20Rusk">Dean Rusk</a> and <a href="US%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> advised Johnson to reject Taylor's proposal. Johnson declined to act, stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate, as it would damage public morale. He also noted that because of the political instability in Saigon, the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack, feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing. This was despite the fact that the Vietcong had already claimed responsibility. Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible. Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression. The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy, saying that "In view of the overall confusion in Saigon", public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was "trying to shoot its way out of an internal [South Vietnamese] political crisis". Johnson said to Taylor that "Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large-scale bombing. I have never felt that this war will be won from the air." At the time, Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials' calls for large-scale bombing of North Vietnam, a strategy that eventually became policy.

In January 1965, the Vietcong secretly held their 3rd Conference in South Vietnam and concluded that in failing to retaliate, "the Americans lacked the will to strike North Vietnam or shield South Vietnam from the mortal blow". At the time, North Vietnam vigorously denied ever sending troops or equipment into South Vietnam. In reality, both sides violated the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">1954 Geneva Accords</a> by covertly infiltrating the other's borders to carry out hostile military activity. Meanwhile, South Vietnam's government had imposed media censorship in November 1964 and closed ten newspapers for sympathizing with the communists.

The attack fomented feelings of insecurity among American policymakers about communist attacks. Johnson hoped that the continuing presence of American military advisers would be sufficient to strengthen the ARVN so that it could stabilize the Saigon government, but many of his defense department advisers felt that American combat troops were needed on the ground. This increased the tension between the president's civilian and military officials, before the Americans became directly involved in fighting in 1965. David Tucker of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20War%20College">United States Army War College</a> said that the bombing was "insignificant for the conventional military balance but important for the political struggle that was the primary focus of the enemy [Vietcong]". The facility was repaired and American officers continued to stay there until the <a href="fall%20of%20Saigon">fall of Saigon</a> on April 30, 1975, when the communists overran South Vietnam and reunified the country under their rule.

Today, the site is a Park Hyatt hotel built along <a href="French%20Colonial">French Colonial</a> architectural lines, and there is a memorial to the bombing on site.

Greatest Hits (Lost)

"Greatest Hits" is the 21st episode of the <a href="Lost%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> of "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>" and 70th episode of the series. It was written by co-executive producers <a href="Edward%20Kitsis">Edward Kitsis</a> and <a href="Adam%20Horowitz%20%28screenwriter%29">Adam Horowitz</a> and directed by supervising producer <a href="Stephen%20Williams%20%28director%29">Stephen Williams</a>. The episode first aired on May 16, 2007, on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> in the United States and on <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV</a> in Canada. "Greatest Hits" was viewed by 12 million Americans and was well received by critics. "Lost"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s editors received a <a href="Golden%20Reel%20Award">Golden Reel Award</a> nomination.

The episode takes place on December 22, 2004, 92 days after the crash of <a href="Oceanic%20Airlines">Oceanic Airlines</a> Flight 815. A group of survivors prepare for an upcoming raid on their camp by the "<a href="Others%20%28Lost%29">Others</a>", while the rest prepare to contact a nearby freighter. <a href="Charlie%20Pace">Charlie Pace</a> (played by <a href="Dominic%20Monaghan">Dominic Monaghan</a>) recounts the five greatest moments of his life, which are depicted in flashbacks, as he prepares to fulfill <a href="Desmond%20Hume">Desmond Hume</a>'s (<a href="Henry%20Ian%20Cusick">Henry Ian Cusick</a>) premonitions of his death.

The Others' leader <a href="Benjamin%20Linus">Ben Linus</a> (<a href="Michael%20Emerson">Michael Emerson</a>) orders ten of the Others to go to the survivors' camp to kidnap any pregnant women that night—a night earlier than was scheduled. Ben's adopted daughter <a href="Alex%20%28Lost%29">Alex</a> (<a href="Tania%20Raymonde">Tania Raymonde</a>) persuades her boyfriend <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Karl">Karl</a> (<a href="Blake%20Bashoff">Blake Bashoff</a>) to canoe to the survivors' beach to warn them. The survivors' leader <a href="Jack%20Shephard">Jack Shephard</a> (<a href="Matthew%20Fox%20%28actor%29">Matthew Fox</a>) plans to kill the ambushing Others with dynamite retrieved by island resident <a href="Danielle%20Rousseau">Danielle Rousseau</a> (<a href="Mira%20Furlan">Mira Furlan</a>). <a href="Sayid%20Jarrah">Sayid Jarrah</a> (<a href="Naveen%20Andrews">Naveen Andrews</a>), <a href="Jin-Soo%20Kwon">Jin Kwon</a> (<a href="Daniel%20Dae%20Kim">Daniel Dae Kim</a>) and <a href="Bernard%20Nadler">Bernard Nadler</a> (<a href="Sam%20Anderson">Sam Anderson</a>) are selected to stay behind to shoot the dynamite-rigged tents when the Others arrive.

Desmond tells Charlie about his latest premonition: Charlie's girlfriend <a href="Claire%20Littleton">Claire Littleton</a> (<a href="Emilie%20de%20Ravin">Emilie de Ravin</a>) and her baby <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Minor%20crash%20survivors">Aaron</a> will escape the island via helicopter if Charlie flips a switch in a <a href="Dharma%20Initiative">Dharma Initiative</a> station and drowns. Sayid tells Jack that he may be able to communicate with the <a href="Cargo%20ship">freighter</a> roughly 130 kilometres offshore. He can use the satellite phone of <a href="Characters%20of%20Lost%23Naomi%20Dorrit">Naomi Dorrit</a> (<a href="Marsha%20Thomason">Marsha Thomason</a>), the helicopter parachutist who landed on the Island. Once he goes to the radio tower to disable Rousseau's distress signal. <a href="Juliet%20Burke">Juliet Burke</a> (<a href="Elizabeth%20Mitchell">Elizabeth Mitchell</a>) informs Sayid that this will not work because the underwater "Looking Glass" is blocking outgoing transmissions. Sayid realizes that a cable he found seventy days before connects to this station and that they will need someone to go on a probable <a href="suicide%20mission">suicide mission</a> there, and Charlie volunteers.

Naomi tells Charlie that his band Drive Shaft released a successful <a href="greatest%20hits">greatest hits</a> album after the crash of Flight 815. Flashbacks show Charlie's "greatest hits" of his life, referring to his life's five best moments, in descending order. Charlie writes them down on a note.
Before paddling out to the Looking Glass with Desmond, Charlie assures Claire that he will be fine, kisses her goodbye and leaves his ring in Aaron's crib. Once Desmond and Charlie arrive over the station, Charlie gives Desmond his note and asks that he give it to Claire. Desmond offers to do the job instead, suspecting that his flashes are recommending him to take Charlie's place. To keep him from doing so, Charlie knocks Desmond out with an oar and dives into the water. Upon entering the station, two Others named Greta (<a href="Lana%20Parrilla">Lana Parrilla</a>) and Bonnie (<a href="Tracy%20Middendorf">Tracy Middendorf</a>) appear with guns aimed at Charlie.

Most of the island scenes were filmed from April 9, 2007 to April 12. A detailed episode synopsis was uploaded online before the episode aired and <a href="Disney">Disney</a> investigated the leak. The name of the Dharma station in the episode is an allusion to <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s novel "<a href="Through%20the%20Looking-Glass">Through the Looking-Glass</a>". Dominic Monaghan was inspired by <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>'s underwater performance in "<a href="Titanic%20%281997%20film%29">Titanic</a>" and opened his mouth briefly underwater to appear under greater duress.

This episode began the resolution of the story arc about Desmond's prophecy regarding Charlie's inevitable death, which began earlier in the season and would ultimately end in the <a href="Through%20the%20Looking%20Glass%20%28Lost%29">finale</a>. The storyline was conceived while producing the <a href="Three%20Minutes">latter part</a> of the <a href="Lost%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> when the writers were brainstorming ideas for a new storyline for Charlie. While Desmond could have had flashes of the future about anyone, Charlie was chosen over a less significant character so that the story would have higher stakes. Additionally, the writers decided that it would be a great way to bring out the heroic side of Charlie, with Charlie being the only character to die willingly. Despite the problems in Charlie's life, the writers believed that Charlie always was a good person and wanted to show that with the happiest moments of the character's life. Monaghan thought that "Greatest Hits" was made "to allow the audience to sit with [his character's fate] long enough to prepare themselves for what was going to happen [in the finale]".

"Greatest Hits" marked the first appearance for married couple Rose and Bernard since the <a href="S.O.S.%20%28Lost%29">late</a> <a href="Lost%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> and fans welcomed the <a href="recurring%20character">recurring character</a>s' return. The writers cited the actors' other projects as a reason for their absence. Additionally, it was feared that fans would complain if they appeared, when many actors with star <a href="Billing%20%28film%29">billing</a> had received limited screentime in the early third season. The writers also commented that they do not want to have the couple on the show if they are just going to be standing in the background; they want to have Rose and Bernard in the show with interesting storylines.

"Greatest Hits" brought in an average of 12.32 million American viewers, making "Lost" the fifteenth most watched series of the week; this was consistent with previous "Lost" episodes in the same timeslot. The first half was viewed by 11.9 million, and the audience increased to 12.8 million in the second half. The episode received a 5.2/14 in the key adults 18–49 demographic, placing it as the top-rated scripted program for the night. In Canada, "Greatest Hits" was seen by 875,000 people, ranking twenty-seventh for the week. In the United Kingdom, the episode attracted 1.21 million viewers, and was the second most watched program of the week on the <a href="Digital%20television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">non-terrestrial channels</a>, beaten only by "". In Australia, "Lost" was the fifty-first most viewed show of the week, bringing in 1.001 million viewers.

Patrick Day of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" thought that "as far as penultimate set-up-to-the-big-finale episodes go, 'Greatest Hits' was above par in more than one way." Day celebrated the return of Jack "from Mt. Boring", the use of drums in <a href="Michael%20Giacchino">Michael Giacchino</a>'s musical score and the return of Rose and Bernard. Jeff Jensen of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" wrote that Monaghan "turned in his best performance yet on "Lost"" and described the final scene as "breathtaking" with "a stunningly realized, <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a>-worthy triumph of <a href="Special%20effect">F/X</a>." <a href="Kristin%20Dos%20Santos">Kristin Veitch</a> of "<a href="E%21">E!</a>" also enjoyed Monaghan's acting and called the episode a "perfect example" of the series' high quality. Charlie McCollum of the "<a href="San%20Jose%20Mercury%20News">San Jose Mercury News</a>" described the latter episodes of the third season as "an absolute thrill ride". Chris Carabott of "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" rated the episode as an 8.5/10, commending the character development of Jack and Charlie, and the acting skills of Emerson, who portrays Ben. Lulu Bates of "<a href="Television%20Without%20Pity">Television Without Pity</a>" graded the episode as an "A–". Erin Martell of <a href="AOL">AOL</a>'s "<a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>" rated "Greatest Hits" as a 6/7, saying that it succeeded in building momentum for the season finale, but pointed out the plot inconsistency regarding Charlie's (in)ability to swim. Scott Juba of "<a href="Web.com%23Company%20history%20and%20acquisitions">The Trades</a>" decided that "Greatest Hits" was the best episode of the third season, saying that the flashbacks "evok[e] the type of identifiable human emotions that drives the success of "Lost".

Changeling (film)

Changeling is a 2008 American <a href="mystery%20film">mystery</a> <a href="crime%20drama%20film">crime drama film</a> directed, produced, and scored by <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> and written by <a href="J.%20Michael%20Straczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>, that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence. The script was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 <a href="Wineville%20Chicken%20Coop%20Murders">Wineville Chicken Coop Murders</a> in <a href="Mira%20Loma%2C%20California">Mira Loma, California</a>. The film stars <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> as a woman reunited with a boy whom she immediately realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this to the police and city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother, and then confined to a psychiatric ward.

Straczynski spent a year researching the story after hearing about the Wineville Chicken Coop case from a contact at Los Angeles City Hall. Almost all of the film's script was drawn from thousands of pages of documentation. His first draft became the <a href="shooting%20script">shooting script</a>; it was his first film <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a> to be produced. <a href="Ron%20Howard">Ron Howard</a> had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his <a href="Imagine%20Entertainment">Imagine Entertainment</a> partner <a href="Brian%20Grazer">Brian Grazer</a> produced "Changeling" alongside <a href="Malpaso%20Productions">Malpaso Productions</a>' <a href="Robert%20Lorenz">Robert Lorenz</a> and Eastwood. <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a> financed and distributed the film.

Several actors campaigned for the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars <a href="Jeffrey%20Donovan">Jeffrey Donovan</a>, <a href="Jason%20Butler%20Harner">Jason Butler Harner</a>, <a href="John%20Malkovich">John Malkovich</a>, <a href="Michael%20Kelly%20%28American%20actor%29">Michael Kelly</a>, and <a href="Amy%20Ryan">Amy Ryan</a>. While some characters are <a href="Composite%20character">composites</a>, most are based on actual people. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a>, which began on October 15, 2007, and concluded a few weeks later in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in <a href="southern%20California">southern California</a>. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted in a calm set and short working days. In <a href="post-production">post-production</a>, scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.

"Changeling" premiered to critical acclaim at the <a href="2008%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">61st Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 20, 2008. Additional festival screenings preceded a limited release in the United States on October 24, 2008, followed by a general release in North America on October 31, 2008; in the United Kingdom on November 26, 2008; and in Australia on February 5, 2009. Critical reaction was more mixed than at Cannes. While the acting and story were generally praised, the film's "conventional staging" and "lack of nuance" were criticized. "Changeling" earned $113 million in box-office revenue worldwideof which $35.7 million came from the United States and Canadaand received nominations in three <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> and eight <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTA Award</a> categories.

In <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in 1928, single mother <a href="Christine%20Collins">Christine Collins</a> returns home to discover her nine-year-old son, Walter, is missing. Reverend Gustav Briegleb publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a> (LAPD) for its incompetence, corruption and the <a href="extrajudicial%20punishment">extrajudicial punishment</a> meted out by its "Gun Squad" led by <a href="James%20E.%20Davis%20%28police%29">Chief James E. Davis</a>. Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that the boy has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although "Walter" claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J. J. Jones, the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home "on a trial basis".

After Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between "Walter" and her son, Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. He tells Christine that "Walter" is three inches shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine, and that the man who took Walter had him <a href="Circumcision">circumcised</a>. A newspaper prints a story that implies Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Walter's teacher and dentist each give Christine signed letters confirming "Walter" is an impostor. Christine tells her story to the press; as a result, Jones sends her to <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County-USC%20Medical%20Center">Los Angeles County Hospital</a>'s "<a href="Psychiatric%20ward">psychopathic ward</a>". She befriends inmate Carol Dexter, who tells Christine she is one of several women who were sent there for challenging police authority. Dr. Steele (O'Hare) diagnoses Christine as delusional and forces her to take mood-regulating pills. Steele says he will release Christine if she admits she was mistaken about "Walter"; she refuses.

Detective Ybarra travels to a ranch in <a href="Mira%20Loma%2C%20California">Wineville</a>, <a href="Riverside%20County%2C%20California">Riverside County</a>, to arrange the deportation of 15-year-old Sanford Clark to <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. The boy's uncle, Gordon Northcott, has fled after a chance encounter with Ybarra, who mentions his business there being a juvenile matter. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children, and identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where the bodies are buried. Clark hesitates, but soon uncovers body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, <a href="Tom%20Mix">Tom Mix</a>, and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The police capture Northcott in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver, British Columbia</a>, Canada. Meanwhile, Briegleb introduces Christine and her case to famed attorney "S.S." Hahn who takes the case "pro bono" and quickly secures a court order for the release of other unjustly imprisoned women whom the police wanted to silence.

On the day of the city council's hearing into the case, Christine, Hahn, and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall, where they encounter thousands of protesters who are demanding answers from the city and decrying the LAPD. The hearing is intercut with scenes from Northcott's trial. The council concludes that Jones and Davis should be removed from duty, and that extrajudicial internments by police must be stopped. Northcott's jury finds him guilty of murder and the judge sentences him to death by hanging.

Two years later, Christine has still not given up her search for Walter. Northcott sends her a message saying he is willing to admit to killing Walter on condition that Christine meets him before his execution. She visits Northcott, but he refuses to tell her if he killed her son. Northcott is executed the next day.

In 1935, David Clay, one of the boys assumed to have been killed, is found alive in <a href="Hesperia%2C%20California">Hesperia, California</a>. He reveals that one of the boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter. David, Walter, and another boy escaped, but were separated. David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, but he says Walter helped him escape, giving Christine hope he is alive.

In the epilogue, it states that after the hearing, Captain Jones was suspended, Chief Davis was demoted, and Los Angeles Mayor <a href="George%20E.%20Cryer">George Cryer</a> chose not to run for reelection. California's <a href="state%20legislature">state legislature</a> made it illegal to forcibly commit people to psychiatric facilities by mere words alone of authorities, and Rev. Briegleb continued to use his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption. Wineville is said to have changed its name to Mira Loma to escape the stigma of the murders, and Christine Collins reportedly never stopped searching for her son.

In 1926, 13-year-old Sanford Clark was taken from his home in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> (with the permission of his mother and reluctant father) by his uncle, 19-year-old Gordon Stewart Northcott. Northcott took Clark to a ranch in Wineville, California, where he regularly beat and sexually abused the boy — until , when the police took Clark into custody after his sister, 19-year-old Jessie Clark, informed them of the situation. Clark revealed that he was forced to help Northcott and his mother, Sarah Louise Northcott, in killing three young boys after Northcott had kidnapped and molested them. The police found no bodies at the ranch — Clark said they were dumped in the desert — but discovered body parts, blood-stained axes, and personal effects belonging to missing children. The Northcotts fled to Canada, but were arrested and extradited to the United States. Sarah Louise initially confessed to murdering Walter Collins, she later retracted her statement; Gordon, who had confessed to killing five boys, did likewise.

Christine Collins was placed in Los Angeles County Hospital by Captain Jones. After her release, she sued the police department twice, winning the second lawsuit. Although Captain Jones was ordered to pay Collins $10,800, he never did. A city council welfare hearing recommended that Jones and Chief of Police <a href="James%20E.%20Davis%20%28police%29">James E. Davis</a> leave their posts, but both were later reinstated. The <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a> later made it illegal for the police to commit someone to a psychiatric facility without a warrant. Northcott was convicted of the murders of Lewis Winslow (12), Nelson Winslow (10) and an unidentified Mexican boy; after his conviction, Northcott was reported to have admitted to up to 20 murders, though he later denied the claim. Northcott was executed by hanging in 1930 at the age of 23. Sarah Louise was convicted of Walter Collins' murder and served almost 12 years in prison. In 1930, the residents of Wineville changed the town's name to <a href="Mira%20Loma">Mira Loma</a> to escape the notoriety brought by the case.

Several years before writing "Changeling", television screenwriter and former journalist <a href="J.%20Michael%20Straczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> was contacted by a source at <a href="Los%20Angeles%20City%20Hall">Los Angeles City Hall</a>. The source told him that officials were planning to burn numerous archive documents, among them "something [Straczynski] should see". The source had discovered a transcript of the city council welfare hearings concerning Collins and the aftermath of her son's disappearance. Straczynski became fascinated with the case; he carried out some research, and wrote a <a href="spec%20script">spec script</a> titled "The Strange Case of Christine Collins". Several studios and independent producers <a href="option%20%28filmmaking%29">optioned</a> the script, but it never found a buyer. Straczynski felt he lacked the time to devote to making the story work and only returned to the project following the cancellation of his television series "<a href="Jeremiah%20%28TV%20series%29">Jeremiah</a>" in 2004. After 20 years as a screenwriter and producer for television, Straczynski felt he needed a break from the medium, so he spent a year researching the Collins case through archived criminal, county courthouse, city hall and city morgue records. He said he collected around 6,000 pages of documentation on Collins and the Wineville murders, before learning enough to "figure out how to tell it". He wrote the first draft of the new script in 11 days. Straczynski's agent passed the script to producer Jim Whitaker. He forwarded it to <a href="Ron%20Howard">Ron Howard</a>, who optioned it immediately.

In June 2006, Universal Studios and Howard's Imagine Entertainment bought the script for Howard to direct. The film was on a shortlist of projects for Howard after coming off the commercial success of "<a href="The%20Da%20Vinci%20Code%20%28film%29">The Da Vinci Code</a>". In , Universal fast-tracked the production. When Howard chose "<a href="Frost/Nixon%20%28film%29">Frost/Nixon</a>" and "<a href="Angels%20%26amp%3B%20Demons%20%28film%29">Angels & Demons</a>" as his next two directing projects, it became clear he could not direct "Changeling" until 2009. After Howard stepped down, it looked as if the film would not be made, despite admiration for the script in the industry. Howard and Imagine partner <a href="Brian%20Grazer">Brian Grazer</a> began looking for a new director to helm the project; they pitched the film to Eastwood in , and he agreed to direct immediately after reading the script. Eastwood said his memories of growing up during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> meant that whenever a project dealing with the era landed in his hands, he "redoubled his attention" upon it. Eastwood also cited the script's focus on Collins—rather than the "<a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>" story of Northcott's crimes—as a factor in deciding to make the film.

Straczynski viewed "sitting down and ferreting out [the] story" as a return to his journalistic roots. He also drew on his experience writing crime drama for the <a href="Police%20procedural">procedural</a> elements of the plot. Straczynski said he had gathered so much information about the case that it was difficult to work out how to tell it. To let the story develop at its own pace, he put the project aside to allow himself to forget the less essential elements and bring into focus the parts he wanted to tell. He described what he saw as two overlaid triangles: "the first triangle, with the point up, is Collins' story. You start with her, and her story gets broader and broader and begins having impact from all kinds of places. The overlay on that was an upside down triangle with the base on top, which is the panorama of Los Angeles at that time—1928. And it begins getting narrower and narrower toward the bottom, bearing down on her." Once Straczynski saw this structure, he felt he could write the story. He chose to avoid focusing on the atrocities of the Wineville murders in favor of telling the story from Collins' perspective; Straczynski said she was the only person in the story without a hidden agenda, and it was her tenacity—as well as the legacy the case left throughout California's legal system—that had attracted him to the project. He said, "My intention was very simple: to honor what Christine Collins did."
With Collins as the inspiration, Straczynski said he was left with a strong desire "to get it right"; he approached it more like "an article for cinema" than a regular film. He stuck close to the historical record because he felt the story was bizarre enough that adding too many fictional elements would call into question its integrity. Straczynski claimed that 95% of the script's content came from the historical record; he said there were only two moments at which he had to "figure out what happened", due to the lack of information in the records. One was the sequence set in the psychopathic ward, for which there was only limited after-the-fact testimony. Straczynski originally wrote a shorter account of Collins' incarceration. His agent suggested the sequence needed development, so Straczynski extrapolated events based on standard practice in such institutions at the time. It was at this stage he created composite character Carol Dexter, who was intended to symbolize the women of the era who had been unjustly committed. Straczynski cited his academic background, including <a href="Academic%20major">majors</a> in psychology and sociology, as beneficial to writing the scenes, specifically one in which Steele distorts Collins' words to make her appear delusional. Straczynski worked at making the dialogue authentic, while avoiding an archaic tone. He cited his experience imagining alien psyches when writing "<a href="Babylon%205">Babylon 5</a>" as good practice for putting himself in the cultural mindset of the 1920s.

Straczynski described specific visual cues in the screenplay, such as in Sanford Clark's confession scene. Clark's flashback to a falling axe is juxtaposed with the crumbling ash from Detective Ybarra's cigarette. The image served two purposes: it was an aesthetic correlation between the axe and the cigarette, and it suggested that Ybarra was so shocked by Clark's confession that he had not moved or even smoked in the 10 minutes Clark took to tell his story. As with most of the cues, Eastwood shot the scene as written. To ensure the veracity of the story, Straczynski incorporated quotes from the historical record, including court testimony, into the dialogue. He also included photocopies of news clippings every 15–20 pages in the script to remind people the story was a true one. So the credits could present the film as "a true story" rather than as "based on" one, Straczynski went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene. Straczynski believed the only research error he made was in a scene that referenced "<a href="Scrabble">Scrabble</a>", pre-dating its appearance on the market by two years. He changed the reference to a crossword puzzle. He did not alter the <a href="shooting%20script">shooting script</a> any further from his first draft; though Straczynski had written two more drafts for Howard, Eastwood insisted the first draft be filmed as he felt it had the clearest voice of the three. Straczynski said, "Clint's funny—if he likes it, he'll do it, that's the end of the discussion. When I met with him to ask, 'Do you want any changes, do you want any things cut, added to, subtracted from, whatever', he said, 'No. The draft is fine. Let's shoot the draft.

Among the changes Straczynski made from the historical record was to omit Northcott's mother—who participated in the murders—from the story. He also depicted Northcott's trial as taking place in Los Angeles, though it was held in <a href="Riverside%2C%20California">Riverside</a>. The title is derived from Western European <a href="folklore">folklore</a> and refers to a creature—a "<a href="changeling">changeling</a>"—left by <a href="fairie">fairie</a>s in place of a human child. Due to the word's association with the supernatural, Straczynski intended it only as a temporary title, believing he would be able to change it later on.

The filmmakers retained the names of the real-life protagonists, though several supporting characters were <a href="composite%20character">composites</a> of people and types of people from the era. <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a> plays Christine Collins; five actresses campaigned for the role, including <a href="Reese%20Witherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a> and <a href="Hilary%20Swank">Hilary Swank</a>. Howard and Grazer suggested Jolie; Eastwood agreed, believing that her face fit the period setting. Jolie joined the production in . She was initially reluctant because, as a mother, she found the subject matter distressing. She said she was persuaded by Eastwood's involvement, and the screenplay's depiction of Collins as someone who recovered from adversity and had the strength to fight the odds. Jolie found playing Collins very emotional. She said the most difficult part was relating to the character, because Collins was relatively passive. Jolie ultimately based her performance on her own mother, who died in 2007. For scenes at the telephone exchange, Jolie learned to roller skate in high heels, a documented practice of the period.

<a href="Jeffrey%20Donovan">Jeffrey Donovan</a> portrays Captain J. J. Jones, a character Donovan became fascinated with because of the power Jones wielded in the city. The character quotes the real Jones' public statements throughout the film, including the scene in which he has Collins committed. Donovan's decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent was his own. <a href="John%20Malkovich">John Malkovich</a> joined the production in as Reverend Gustav Briegleb. Eastwood cast Malkovich against <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">type</a> as he felt this would bring "a different shading" to the character. <a href="Jason%20Butler%20Harner">Jason Butler Harner</a> plays Gordon Stewart Northcott, whom Harner described as "a horrible, horrible, wonderful person". He said Northcott believes he shares a connection with Collins due to their both being in the headlines: "In his eyes, they're kindred spirits." Harner landed the role after one taped audition. Casting director <a href="Ellen%20Chenoweth">Ellen Chenoweth</a> explained that Eastwood chose Harner over more well-known actors who wanted the part because Harner displayed "more depth and variety" and was able to project "a slight craziness" without evoking <a href="Charles%20Manson">Charles Manson</a>. Eastwood was surprised by the resemblance between Northcott and Harner, saying they looked "very much" alike when Harner was in makeup.

As Harner did for the Northcott role, <a href="Amy%20Ryan">Amy Ryan</a> auditioned via tape for the role of Carol Dexter. She cited the filming of a fight scene during which Eastwood showed her "how to throw a movie punch" as her favorite moment of the production. <a href="Michael%20Kelly%20%28American%20actor%29">Michael Kelly</a> portrays Detective Lester Ybarra, who is a composite of several people from the historical record. Kelly was chosen based on a taped audition; he worked around scheduling conflicts with the television series "<a href="Generation%20Kill%20%28TV%20series%29">Generation Kill</a>", which he was filming in Africa at the same time. <a href="Geoff%20Pierson">Geoff Pierson</a> plays Sammy Hahn, a <a href="Attorney%20at%20law%20%28United%20States%29">defense attorney</a> known for taking high-profile cases. He represents Collins and in doing so plants the seeds for overturning "Code 12" internments, used by police to jail or commit those deemed difficult or an inconvenience. Code 12 was often used to commit women without <a href="due%20process">due process</a>. <a href="Colm%20Feore">Colm Feore</a> portrays <a href="chief%20of%20police%23United%20States">Chief of Police</a> James E. Davis, whose backstory was changed from that of his historical counterpart. Reed Birney plays Mayor <a href="George%20Edward%20Cryer">George E. Cryer</a>; <a href="Denis%20O%27Hare">Denis O'Hare</a> plays composite character Doctor Jonathan Steele; <a href="Gattlin%20Griffith">Gattlin Griffith</a> plays Walter Collins; and Devon Conti plays his supplanter, Arthur Hutchins. <a href="Eddie%20Alderson">Eddie Alderson</a> plays Northcott's nephew and accomplice, Sanford Clark.

<a href="James%20J.%20Murakami">James J. Murakami</a> supervised the production design. <a href="Location%20scouting">Location scouting</a> revealed that many of the older buildings in Los Angeles had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in <a href="San%20Dimas%2C%20California">San Dimas</a>, <a href="San%20Bernardino%2C%20California">San Bernardino</a> and <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a> doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of comfort. For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged the third floor of the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s <a href="Los%20Angeles%20City%20Council">Los Angeles City Council</a> chambers.

The 1918 Santa Fe Depot in San Bernardino doubled for the site of Collins' reunion with "Walter". The production filmed scenes set at <a href="San%20Quentin%2C%20California">San Quentin</a> in the community. A small farm on the outskirts of <a href="Lancaster%2C%20California">Lancaster, California</a>, stood in for the Wineville chicken ranch. The crew recreated the entire ranch, referencing archive newspaper photographs and visits to the original ranch to get a feel for the topography and layout. Steve Lech, president of the Riverside Historical Society, was employed as a consultant and accompanied the crew on its visits.

The production sourced around 150 vintage motor cars, dating from 1918 to 1928, from collectors throughout Southern California. In some cases the cars were in too good a condition, so the crew modified them to make the cars appear like they were in everyday use; they sprayed dust and water onto the bodywork, and to "age" some of the cars they applied a coating that simulated rust and scratches. The visual effects team retouched shots of Los Angeles City Hall—on which construction was completed in 1928—to remove weathering and newer surrounding architecture. Costume designer <a href="Deborah%20Hopper">Deborah Hopper</a> researched old <a href="Sears%2C%20Roebuck%20and%20Company">Sears department store</a> catalogs, back issues of <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life" magazine</a>, and high-school yearbooks to ensure the costumes were historically accurate. Hopper sourced 1920s clothing for up to 1,000 people; this was difficult because the fabrics of the period were not resilient. She found sharp wool suits for the police officers. The style for women of all classes was to dress to create a boyish silhouette, using <a href="waistline%20%28clothing%29">dropped waist</a> dresses, <a href="cloche%20hat">cloche hat</a>s that complemented <a href="bob%20cut">bob cut</a> hairstyles, fur-trimmed coats and knitted gloves. Jolie said the costumes her Collins character wore formed an integral part of her approach to the character. Hopper consulted historians and researched archive footage of Collins to replicate her look. Hopper dressed Jolie in austere grays and browns with knitted gloves, wool <a href="serge%20%28fabric%29">serge</a> skirts accompanying cotton blouses, <a href="Mary%20Jane%20%28shoe%29">Mary Jane shoes</a>, crocheted <a href="corsage%20%28bodice%29">corsages</a> and <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> jewelry. In the 1930s sequences at the end of the film, Jolie's costumes become more shapely and feminine, with a decorative stitching around the waistline that was popular to the era.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began on October 15, 2007, finishing two days ahead of its 45-day schedule on December 14, 2007. Universal Pictures provided a budget of $55 million. The film was Eastwood's first for a studio other than <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> since "<a href="Absolute%20Power%20%28film%29">Absolute Power</a>" (1997). Filming mainly took place on the Universal Studios <a href="backlot">backlot</a> in Los Angeles. The backlot's New York Street and Tenement Street depicted <a href="downtown">downtown</a> Los Angeles. Tenement Street also stood in for the exterior of Northcott's sister's Vancouver apartment; visual effects added the city to the background. The production also used the Warner Bros. backlot in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>, California. Eastwood had clear childhood memories of 1930s Los Angeles and attempted to recreate several details in the film: the town hall, at the time one of the tallest buildings in the city; the city center, which was one of the busiest in the world; and the "perfectly functioning" <a href="Pacific%20Electric%20Railway">Pacific Electric Railway</a>, the distinctive red <a href="streetcars">streetcars</a> of which feature closely in two scenes. The production used two functioning replica streetcars for these shots, with visual effects employed for streetcars in the background.
Eastwood is known for his economical film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during "Changeling"s shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and <a href="takes">takes</a> to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger ... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide <a href="verisimilitude">verisimilitude</a> to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases "action" and "cut". He said, "Some [directors]—like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it ... And that's fine by me." Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a> on "<a href="100%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCentre%20Street">100 Centre Street</a>" and "<a href="Before%20the%20Devil%20Knows%20You%27re%20Dead">Before the Devil Knows You're Dead</a>" were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better ... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." <a href="Gaffer%20%28filmmaking%29">Gaffer</a> Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it."

The original edit was almost three hours long; to hone it to 141 minutes, Eastwood cut material from the first part of the film to get to Collins' story sooner. To improve the pacing he also cut scenes that focused on Reverend Briegleb. Eastwood deliberately left the ending of the film ambiguous to reflect the uncertain fates of several characters in the history. He said that while some stories aimed to finish at the end of a film, he preferred to leave it open-ended.

"Changeling" was director of photography <a href="Tom%20Stern%20%28cinematographer%29">Tom Stern</a>'s sixth film with Eastwood. Despite the muted palette, the film is more colorful than some previous Stern–Eastwood collaborations. Stern referenced a large book of period images. He attempted to evoke <a href="Conrad%20Hall">Conrad Hall</a>'s work on <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>-set film "<a href="The%20Day%20of%20the%20Locust%20%28film%29">The Day of the Locust</a>", as well as match what he called the "leanness" of "<a href="Mystic%20River%20%28film%29">Mystic River</a>"s look. Stern said the challenge was to make "Changeling" as simple as possible to shoot. To focus more on Jolie's performance, he tended to avoid the use of <a href="fill%20light">fill light</a>ing. Eastwood did not want the flashbacks to Northcott's ranch to be too much like a horror film—he said the focus of the scene was the effect of the crimes on Sanford Clark—so he avoided graphic imagery in favor of casting the murders in shadow.

Stern shot "Changeling" in <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic format</a> on <a href="35%20mm%20film">35mm film</a> using <a href="List%20of%20motion%20picture%20film%20stocks%23VISION%20color%20negative%20%28ECN-2%20process%201996%E2%80%932002%29">Kodak Vision 500T 5279</a> film stock. The film was shot on <a href="Panavision">Panavision</a> cameras and C-Series lenses. Due to the large number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached <a href="muslin">muslin</a> tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and <a href="Sepia%20%28color%29">sepia</a>. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The <a href="key%20light">key light</a> was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger <a href="skypan">skypan</a>s—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.

Stern lit scenes filmed at the Park Plaza Hotel using dimmable <a href="hydrargyrum%20medium-arc%20iodide%20lamp">HMI</a> and tungsten lights rigged within <a href="balloon%20light">balloon light</a>s. This setup allowed him to "dial in" the color he wanted, as the blend of tones from the tungsten fixtures, wooden walls and natural daylight made it difficult to illuminate the scenes using HMIs or daylight exclusively. Stern said the period setting had little effect overall on his lighting choices because the look was mostly applied in the production design and during <a href="digital%20intermediate">digital intermediate</a> (DI), the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting. <a href="Thomson%20SA">Technicolor Digital Intermediates</a> carried out the DI. Stern supervised most of the work via e-mailed reference images as he was in Russia shooting another film at the time. He was present at the laboratory for the application of the finishing touches.

<a href="Rainmaker%20Digital%20Effects">CIS Vancouver</a> and Pac Title created most of the visual effects, under the overall supervision of Michael Owens. CIS' work was headed by Geoff Hancock and Pac Title's by Mark Freund. Each studio created around 90 shots. Pac Title focused primarily on 2D imagery; VICON House of Moves handled the <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a>. The effects work consisted mainly of peripheral additions: architecture, vehicles, crowds and furniture. CIS used 3D modeling package <a href="Maya%20%28software%29">Maya</a> to animate city scenes before <a href="Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">rendering</a> them in <a href="mental%20ray">mental ray</a>; they generated <a href="matte%20painting">matte painting</a>s in <a href="Softimage%20XSI">Softimage XSI</a> and Maya, and used <a href="Eyeon%20Fusion">Digital Fusion</a> for some 2D shots. The team's work began with research into 1928 Los Angeles; they referenced historical photographs and data on the urban core's population density. CIS had to generate mostly new computer models, textures and motion capture because the company's existing effects catalog consisted primarily of modern era elements. CIS supplemented exteriors with skylines and detailed backdrops. They created set extensions digitally and with matte paintings. CIS created city blocks by using shared elements of period architecture that could be combined, rearranged and restacked to make buildings of different widths and heights; that way, the city could look diverse with a minimum of textural variation. CIS referenced vintage aerial photographs of downtown Los Angeles so shots would better reflect the geography of the city, as Hancock felt it important to have a consistency that would allow audiences to understand and become immersed in the environment.

To maintain the rapid shooting pace Eastwood demanded, Owens chose to mostly avoid using <a href="Chroma%20key">bluescreen</a> technology, as the process can be time-consuming and difficult to light. He instead used <a href="rotoscoping">rotoscoping</a>, the process whereby effects are drawn directly onto live action shots. Rotoscoping is more expensive than bluescreen, but the technique had proved reliable for Eastwood when he made extensive use of it on "<a href="Flags%20of%20Our%20Fathers%20%28film%29">Flags of Our Fathers</a>" (2006) to avoid shooting against bluescreen on a mountaintop. For Owens, the lighting was better, and he considered rotoscoping to be "faster, easier and more natural". Owens used bluescreen in only a few locations, such as at the ends of backlot streets where it would not impact the lighting. The Universal Studios backlot had been used for so many films that Owens thought it important to disguise familiar architecture as much as possible, so some foreground and middle distance buildings were swapped. One of his favorite effects shots was a scene in which Collins exits a taxi in front of the police station. The scene was filmed almost entirely against bluescreen; only Jolie, the <a href="sidewalk">sidewalk</a>, the taxi cab and an extra were real. The completed shot features the full range of effects techniques used in the film: digital extras in the foreground, set extensions, and computer-generated vehicles.

For crowd scenes, CIS supplemented the live-action extras with digital pedestrians created using motion capture. House of Moves captured the movements of five men and four women during a two-day shoot supervised by Hancock. The motion capture performers were coached to make the "small, formal and refined" movements that Owens said reflected the general public's conduct at the time. CIS combined the motion data with the <a href="Massive%20%28software%29">Massive</a> software package to generate the interactions of the digital pedestrians. The use of Massive presented a challenge when it came to blending digital pedestrians with live-action extras who had to move from the foreground into the digital crowd. Massive worked well until this stage, when the effects team had to move the digital pedestrians to avoid taking the live-action extras out of the shot. To allow close-ups of individual Massive extras, the effects team focused on their faces and walking characteristics. Hancock explained, "We wanted to be able to push Massive right up to the camera and see how well it held up. In a couple of shots the characters might be 40 feet away from the camera, about 1/5 screen height. The bigger the screen is, the bigger the character. He could be 10 feet tall, so everything, even his hair, better look good!" Typically, a limited number of motion performances are captured and Massive is used to create further variety, such as in height and walking speed. Because the digital extras were required to be close to the foreground, and to integrate them properly with the live action extras, House of Moves captured twice as much motion data than CIS had used on any other project. CIS created nine distinct digital characters. To eliminate inaccuracies that develop when creating a digital extra of different proportions to the motion capture performer, CIS sent nine skeleton rigs to House of Moves before work began. This gave House of Moves time to properly adapt the rigs to its performers, resulting in motion capture data that required very little editing in Massive. CIS wrote <a href="shader">shader</a>s for their clothing; <a href="displacement%20mapping">displacement maps</a> in the air shader were linked with the motion capture to animate wrinkles in trousers and jackets.

Forgoing the <a href="Closure%20%28psychology%29">closure</a> favored by its contemporaries, "Changeling"s final sequence reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a two and a half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The "hustle and bustle" of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes</a> did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." Owens told Eastwood the film should end like "<a href="Chinatown%20%281974%20film%29">Chinatown</a>" (1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time."

Owens did not have time to complete the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used <a href="cineSync">cineSync</a> to conduct most of the work from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute of the shot before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add <a href="Massive%20%28software%29">Massive</a> extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.

Eastwood composed "Changeling"s <a href="jazz">jazz</a>-influenced score. Featuring lilting guitars and strings, it remains largely low-key throughout. The introduction of <a href="brass%20instrument">brass instrument</a>s evokes film noir, playing to the film's setting in a city controlled by corrupt police. The theme shifts from piano to a full orchestra, and as the story develops, the strings become more imposing, with an increasing number of <a href="sustain">sustain</a>s and <a href="Melodic%20motion">rises</a>. Eastwood introduces voices reminiscent of those in a horror film score during the child murder flashbacks. The score was orchestrated and conducted by <a href="Lennie%20Niehaus">Lennie Niehaus</a>. It was released on CD in North America on , 2008, through record label <a href="Var%C3%A8se%20Sarabande">Varèse Sarabande</a>.

"Changeling" begins with an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to concentrate on a portrait of a woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society. The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled "hysterical and unreliable" if they dare to question it. Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in "Changeling" and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it. Rather than "an expression of feminist awareness", <a href="David%20Denby%20%28film%20critic%29">David Denby</a> argues, the film—like Eastwood's "<a href="Million%20Dollar%20Baby">Million Dollar Baby</a>"—is "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring". The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a>'s character in "<a href="Gaslight%20%281944%20film%29">Gaslight</a>" (1944), who also wondered if she might be insane; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers. Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after <a href="History%20of%20women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage in the United States</a> was guaranteed by the ratification of the <a href="Nineteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a>. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the <a href="electroconvulsive%20therapy">electroconvulsive therapy</a> depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: Something is wrong with you. You're an independent woman. Clint Eastwood said, "The period could not accept [it]".

Romantic notions of the 1920s as a more innocent period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure, steeped in sadistic, systematic corruption throughout the city government, police force and medical establishment. In addition to being a <a href="Kafkaesque">Kafkaesque</a> drama about the search for a missing child, the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era. Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era, manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong and the way in which powerful organizations justify the use of corruption. "[The] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption," he said, "It's happened even in recent years ... so it was nice to comment [on that] by going back to real events in 1928." Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as "glamorous", but he believed there had never been a "golden age" in the city. In "Changeling", this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins, who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor. Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers, Hutchins' naïvete seemed "bizarre". As a lesson in democratic activism, the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority, no matter the consequences. <a href="Richard%20Brody">Richard Brody</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for <a href="Gda%C5%84sk%20Agreement">Poland in 1980</a> or <a href="Pakistani%20general%20election%2C%202008">Pakistan in 2008</a>. The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis: "We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles. I want them brought in dead, not alive, and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal." It compares police excess to the <a href="vigilante">vigilantism</a> of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> of the 1920s, as the department's "Gun Squad" carries out illegal executions of criminals—"not to stamp out crime ... but 'competition. The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins' disappearance, and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child.

"Changeling" sits with other late-period Eastwood films in which parenting—and the search for family—is a theme. It makes literal the parental struggle to communicate with children. It can also be seen as a variation of the Eastwood "revenge movie" ethic; in this case, the "avenging grunt" transforms into a courteous woman who only once makes a foul-mouthed outburst. Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in "<a href="A%20Perfect%20World">A Perfect World</a>" (1993) and "<a href="Mystic%20River%20%28film%29">Mystic River</a>" (2003). "Changeling" is a thematic companion piece to "Mystic River", which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated, violent act against a child—a comparison with which Eastwood agreed. He said that showing a child in danger was "about the highest form of drama you can have", as crimes against them were to him the most horrible. Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence. He said, "When [a crime] comes along quite as big as this one, you question humanity. It never ceases to surprise me how cruel humanity can be." Samuel Blumenfeld of "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>" said the scene featuring Northcott's execution by hanging was "unbearable" due to its attention to detail; he believed it one of the most convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable. Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment, Northcott was an ideal candidate, and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime. He said that crimes against children would be at the top of his list for justifications of capital punishment, but that whether one were pro- or anti-capital punishment, the barbarism of public executions must be recognized. Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings, and his feet shake. It was Eastwood's intention to make it unbearable to watch.

"Changeling" premiered in competition at the <a href="2008%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">61st Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 20, 2008. The film was Eastwood's fifth to enter competition at the festival. Its appearance was not part of the original release plan. Universal executives had been looking forward to the festival without the worry associated with screening a film, until Eastwood made arrangements for "Changeling"s appearance. He was pleased with the critical and commercial success that followed "<a href="Mystic%20River%20%28film%29">Mystic River</a>"s appearance at the festival in 2003 and wanted to generate the same "positive buzz" for "Changeling". The film was still in <a href="post-production">post-production</a> one week before the start of the festival. It appeared at the 34th <a href="Deauville%20American%20Film%20Festival">Deauville American Film Festival</a>, held September 5–14, 2008, and had its North American premiere on October 4, 2008 as the centerpiece of the 46th <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Festival">New York Film Festival</a>, screening at the <a href="Ziegfeld%20Theatre%20%281969%29">Ziegfeld Theatre</a>.

The producers and Universal considered opening "Changeling" wide in its first weekend to capitalize on Jolie's perceived <a href="box%20office">box office</a> appeal, but they ultimately modeled the release plan after those of other Eastwood-directed films, "Mystic River" in particular. While the usual strategy is to open films by notable directors in every major city in the United States to ensure a large opening gross, in what the industry calls a "platform release", Eastwood's films generally open in a small number of theaters before opening wide a week later. "Changeling" was released in 15 theaters in nine markets in the United States on October 24, 2008. The marketing strategy involved trailers that promoted Eastwood's involvement and the more commercial mystery thriller elements of the story. Universal hoped the limited release would capitalize on good word-of-mouth support from "serious movie fans" rather than those in the 18–25-year-old <a href="demographic%20profile">demographic</a>. The film was released across North America on October 31, 2008, playing at 1,850 theaters, expanding to 1,896 theaters by its fourth week. "Changeling" was released in the United Kingdom on November 26, 2008, in Ireland on November 28, 2008, and in Australia on February 5, 2009.

"Changeling" performed modestly at the box office, grossing more internationally than in North America. The worldwide gross revenue was $113 million. The film's limited American release saw it take $502,000—$33,441 per theater—in its first two days. Exit polling showed strong commercial potential across a range of audiences. <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinemagoers gave "Changeling" was A− on an A+ to F scale. Audiences were mostly older; 68% were over 30 and 61% were women. Audience evaluations of "excellent" and "definitely recommended" were above average. The main reasons given for seeing the film were its story (65%), Jolie (53%), Eastwood (43%), and that it was based on fact (42%). The film made $2.3M in its first day of wide release, going on to take fourth place in the weekend box office chart with $9.4M—a per-theater average of $5,085. This return surpassed Universal's expectations for the weekend. "Changeling"s link to the <a href="Inland%20Empire%20%28California%29">Inland Empire</a>—the locale of the Wineville killings—generated additional local interest, causing it to outperform the national box office by 45% in its opening weekend. The film surpassed expectations in its second weekend of wide release, declining 22% to take $7.3M. By the fourth week, "Changeling" had dropped to fifth place at the box office, having taken $27.6M overall. In its sixth week the number of theaters narrowed to 1,010, and "Changeling" dropped out of the national top ten, though it remained in ninth place on the Inland chart. "Changeling" completed its theatrical run in North America on January 8, 2009, having earned $35.7M overall.

"Changeling" made its international debut in four European markets on November 12–14, 2008, opening in 727 theaters to strong results. Aided by a positive critical reaction, the film took $1.6M in Italy from 299 theaters (a per-location average of $5,402), and $209,000 from 33 screens in Belgium. "Changeling" had a slower start in France, but improved to post $2.8M from 417 theaters in its first five days, and finished the weekend in second place at the box office. The second week in France saw the box office drop by just 27%, for a total gross of $5.4M. By November 23, 2008, the film had taken $8.6M outside North America. The weekend of November 28–30 saw "Changeling" take $4.4M from 1,040 theaters internationally; this included its expansion into the United Kingdom, where it opened in third place at the box office, taking $1.9M from 349 theaters. It took $1.5M from the three-day weekend, but the total was boosted by the film's opening two days earlier to avoid competition from previews of "". The return marked the best opening of any Eastwood-directed film in the United Kingdom to that point. Its second week of release in the United Kingdom saw a drop of 27% to $1.1M. "Changeling" earned $7.6M in Ireland and the United Kingdom.

"Changeling"s release in other European markets continued throughout . By December 8, the film had opened in 1,167 theaters in nine markets for an international gross of $19.1M. "Changeling"s next significant international release came in Spain on December 19, 2008, where it opened in first place at the box office with $2.0M from 326 theaters. This figure marked the best opening for an Eastwood-directed film in the country to that point; after six weeks it had earned $11.0M. In , major markets in which the film opened included Germany, South Korea and Russia. In Germany, it opened in ninth place at the box office with $675,000 from 194 theaters. South Korea saw a "solid" opening of $450,000 from 155 theaters. In Russia, it opened in eighth place with $292,000 from 95 theaters. By January 26, 2009, the film had taken $47.2M from 1,352 international theaters. Aided by strong word-of-mouth support, "Changeling"s Australian release yielded $3.8M from 74 screens after eight weeks. The film opened in Japan on February 20, 2009, where it topped the chart in its first week with $2.4M from 301 screens. After six weeks, it had earned $12.8M in the country. The film's last major market release was in Mexico on February 27, 2009, where it earned $1.4M. The international gross was $77.3M.

"Changeling" was released on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a>, <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, and <a href="Video%20on%20demand">Video on Demand</a> in North America on February 17, 2009, and in the United Kingdom on March 30, 2009. After its first week of release, "Changeling" placed fourth in the DVD sales chart with 281,000 units sold for $4.6 million; by its fourth week of release, the film had dropped out of the top 10, having earned $10.1 million. As of the latest figures, 762,000 units have been sold, translating to $12,638,223 in revenue. The DVD release included two <a href="featurette">featurette</a>s: "Partners in Crime: Clint Eastwood and Angelina Jolie" and "The Common Thread: Angelina Jolie Becomes Christine Collins". The Blu-ray Disc release included two additional features: "Archives" and "Los Angeles: Then and Now".

The film's screening at Cannes met with critical acclaim, prompting speculation it could be awarded the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a>. The award eventually went to "<a href="Entre%20les%20murs">Entre les murs</a>" ("The Class"). Straczynski claimed that "Changeling"s loss by two votes was due to the judges' not believing the story was based on fact. He said they did not believe the police would treat someone as they had Collins. The loss led to Universal's request that Straczynski annotate the script with sources. Although the positive critical notices from Cannes generated speculation that the film would be a serious contender at the 2009 Academy Awards, the North American theatrical release met with a more mixed response. , 62% of 201 critics listed by <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> had given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website's critical consensus states, "Beautifully shot and well-acted, "Changeling" is a compelling story that unfortunately gives in to convention too often." <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="standard%20score">weighted average</a> rating to reviews from mainstream critics, reported a score of 63 out of 100 based on 38 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". The film's reception in several European countries was more favorable, and in the United Kingdom 83% of critics listed by Rotten Tomatoes gave "Changeling" a positive review.
Todd McCarthy of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" said Jolie was more affecting than in "<a href="A%20Mighty%20Heart%20%28film%29">A Mighty Heart</a>" (2007) because she relied less on artifice. He also noted a surfeit of good supporting performances, Michael Kelly's in particular. Oliver Séguret of "<a href="Lib%C3%A9ration">Libération</a>" said the cast was the film's best feature. He praised the supporting actors and said Jolie's performance was forceful yet understated. Kirk Honeycutt of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" said Jolie shunned her "movie star" persona to appear vulnerable and resolute. He perceived the supporting characters—Amy Ryan's excepted—as having few shades of gray. David Ansen, writing in "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", echoed the sentiment, but said that "some stories really are about the good guys and the bad". He said that with the distractions of Jolie's celebrity and beauty put aside, she carried the role with restraint and intensity. <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" felt that Jolie's celebrity was distracting enough to render her unconvincing, and <a href="David%20Denby%20%28film%20critic%29">David Denby</a> of "The New Yorker" said that while Jolie showed skill and selflessness, the performance and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking desires or temperament. He cited similar problems with Malkovich's Briegleb, concluding, "The two of them make a very proper and dull pair of collaborators."

McCarthy admired the "outstanding" script, calling it ambitious and deceptively simple. He said Eastwood respected the script by not playing to the melodramatic aspects and not telegraphing the story's scope from the start. Honeycutt wrote that due to its close adherence to the history the drama sagged at one point, but that the film did not feel as long as its 141 minutes because the filmmakers were "good at cutting to the chase". Ansen said Straczynski's dialogue tended to the obvious, but that while the film lacked the moral nuance of Eastwood's others, the well-researched screenplay was "a model of sturdy architecture", each layer of which built audience disgust into a "fine fury". He said, "when the tale is this gripping, why resist the moral outrage?"
Séguret said the film presented a solid recreation of the era, but that Eastwood did not seem inspired by the challenge. Séguret noted that Eastwood kept the embers of the story alight, but that it seldom burst into flames. He likened the experience to being in a luxury car: comfortable yet boring. Denby and Ansen commented that Eastwood left the worst atrocities to audiences' imaginations. Ansen said this was because Eastwood was less interested in the lurid aspects of the case. McCarthy praised the thoughtful, unsensationalized treatment, while Denby cited problems with the austere approach, saying it left the film "both impressive and monotonous". He said Eastwood was presented with the problem of not wanting to exploit the "gruesome" material because this would contrast poorly with the delicate emotions of a woman's longing for her missing son. Denby said Eastwood and Straczynski should have explored more deeply the story's perverse aspects. Instead, he said, the narrative methodically settled the emotional and dramatic issues—"reverently chronicling Christine's apotheosis"—before "[ambling] on for another forty minutes". Ansen said the classical approach lifted the story to another level, and that it embraced horror film conventions only in the process of transcending them. McCarthy said "Changeling" was one of Eastwood's most vividly realized films, noting Stern's cinematography, the set and costume design, and CGI landscapes that merged seamlessly with location shots. Dargis was not impressed by the production design; she cited the loss of Eastwood's regular collaborator <a href="Henry%20Bumstead">Henry Bumstead</a>—who died in 2006—as a factor in "Changeling"s "overly pristine" look.

Damon Wise of "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" called "Changeling" "flawless", and McCarthy said it was "emotionally powerful and stylistically sure-handed". He stated that "Changeling" was a more complex and wide-ranging work than Eastwood's "Mystic River", saying the characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an "almost breathtaking deliberation". He said that as "a sorrowful critique of the city's political culture", "Changeling" sat in the company of films such as "Chinatown" and "<a href="L.A.%20Confidential%20%28film%29">L.A. Confidential</a>". Honeycutt said the film added a "forgotten chapter to the L.A. noir" of those films, and that Eastwood's melodic score contributed to an evocation of a city and a period "undergoing galvanic changes". Honeycutt said, "[the] small-town feel to the street and sets ... captures a society resistant to seeing what is really going on". Séguret said that while "Changeling" had few defects, it was mystifying that other critics had such effusive praise for it. Denby said it was beautifully made, but that it shared the chief fault of other "righteously indignant" films in congratulating the audience for feeling contempt for the "long-discredited" attitudes depicted. Ansen concluded that the story was told in such a sure manner that only a hardened cynic would be left unmoved by the "haunting, sorrowful saga".

In addition to the following list of awards and nominations, the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20of%20Motion%20Pictures">National Board of Review of Motion Pictures</a> named "Changeling" one of the 10 best films of 2008, as did the <a href="International%20Press%20Academy">International Press Academy</a>, which presents the annual <a href="Satellite%20Award">Satellite Award</a>s. Several critics included the film on their lists of the top 10 best films of 2008. <a href="Anthony%20Lane">Anthony Lane</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" named it second best, "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine named it fourth best, and Rene Rodriguez of "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>" named it joint fourth best with Eastwood's "<a href="Gran%20Torino%20%28film%29">Gran Torino</a>". Japanese film critic <a href="Shigehiko%20Hasumi">Shigehiko Hasumi</a> listed the film as one of the best films of 2000-2009.

Joe Warbrick

Joseph Astbury Warbrick (1 January 1862 – 30 August 1903) was a <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> player who represented <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a> on their 1884 tour to Australia, and later captained the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team">1888–89 New Zealand Native football team</a> that embarked on a 107-match tour of New Zealand, Australia and the British Isles.

Born in <a href="Rotorua">Rotorua</a>, Warbrick played club rugby for <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> side <a href="Ponsonby%20RFC">Ponsonby</a> while boarding at St Stephen's Native School. In 1877 he was selected to play <a href="rugby%20union%20positions%23Fullback">fullback</a> for <a href="Auckland%20rugby%20union%20team">Auckland Provincial Clubs</a> as a 15-year-old, making him the youngest person to play first-class rugby in New Zealand. He played for Auckland against the visiting <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">New South Wales team</a>the first overseas side to tour the countryin 1882. Two years later he was selected for the first New Zealand representative team, and playing mainly as a <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Three-quarters">three-quarter</a>, appeared in seven of the side's eight matches on their tour of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>.

In 1888 Warbrick conceived of, selected, and led the privately funded New Zealand Native team. The squad, which included four of Warbrick's brothers, was originally envisaged to contain only Māori players, but eventually included several New Zealand-born and foreign-born Europeans. Although the team played 107 matches, including 74 in the British Isles, Warbrick took part in only 21 matches due to injury. The tour, the first from the Southern Hemisphere to visit Britain, remains the longest in rugby's history. In 2008 Warbrick and the Natives were inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a>.

Warbrick effectively retired from rugby after returning from the tour, with the exception of an appearance for Auckland in 1894, and went on to work as a farmer and tourist guide in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Plenty">Bay of Plenty</a>. In 1903 he was killed along with several others by an eruption of the <a href="Waimangu%20Geyser">Waimangu Geyser</a>.

Joseph Warbrick was born in <a href="Rotorua">Rotorua</a>, New Zealand, on 1 January 1862, the third of five children. His father, Abraham Warbrick, was originally from England, while his mother, Nga Karauna Paerau, was <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> and the daughter of a <a href="Ng%C4%81ti%20Rangitihi">Ngāti Rangitihi</a> chief. After Joe Warbrick's mother died, his father remarried and had seven more children. Four of his brothers<a href="Alfred%20Warbrick">Alfred</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Warbrick">Arthur</a>, <a href="Fred%20Warbrick">Fred</a>, and <a href="Billy%20Warbrick">Billy</a>went on to tour with Joe as part of the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team">1888–89 New Zealand Native football team</a>.

With his family still based in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Plenty">Bay of Plenty</a>, Joe Warbrick was sent to board at St Stephen's Native School in the <a href="Bombay%20Hills">Bombay Hills</a>, where he started playing <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a>. While living in Bombay in 1877, he started playing club rugby with <a href="Ponsonby%20RFC">Ponsonby</a> in Auckland, even though the club was based well north of Bombay. Warbrick played well enough for Ponsonby to earn selection for <a href="Auckland%20rugby%20union%20team">Auckland Provincial Clubs</a> (now Auckland) that year despite being only 15 years old. Playing at <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Fullback">fullback</a> for them against <a href="Otago%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Otago</a>, he became the youngest person to play first-class rugby in New Zealanda record he still holds .

By 1878 Warbrick had left both St Stephen's and Ponsonby and was employed as a public servant. The work required him to relocate regularly, and he moved throughout the <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a> for the remainder of his rugby career. By 1879 he was living in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, and represented <a href="Wellington%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">the provincial team</a> three times that season. He played three further matches for Wellington in 1880, including one against his old province of Auckland. The 1880 match, the first in Auckland for Wellington, was won by the visitors 4–0. Warbrick was renowned for his <a href="drop%20goal">drop-kicking</a>, and his goal in the match was the only score; many Aucklanders claimed that his performance was the difference between the two sides.

The Australian <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">New South Wales colonial team</a> became the first overseas rugby side to tour New Zealand in 1882 and played seven matches throughout the country. By this point Warbrick was back in Auckland, but this time playing for the <a href="North%20Shore%20Rugby%20Football%20Club">North Shore</a> club, and he again won selection for the provincial side. He appeared in both of Auckland's matches against the New South Welshmen: 7–0 and 18–4 victories over the tourists. Warwick remained in Auckland the following year when he toured with the province again, playing in away matches against Wellington, <a href="Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Canterbury</a> and Otago.

In 1884 a team of New Zealanders, organised by the Canterbury player and administrator <a href="William%20Millton">William Millton</a>, and <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a> businessman Samuel Sleigh, was selected to tour New South Wales. This is now officially regarded as the first <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a> representative rugby side. Warbrick was included in a squad that was selected from throughout the country; the entire endeavour was performed without the oversight of a national body – several provincial rugby unions existed, but the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rugby">New Zealand Rugby Football Union</a> was not formed until 1892. 

The squad's 19 players were expected to assemble in Wellington before disembarking for Sydney on 21 May, however Warbrick missed his ship from Auckland and so travelled to Sydney alone. Millton was elected captain, and Sleigh managed the team. The side won all eight of their matches on tour, including the three games against New South Wales. Warbrick appeared in seven matches and scored three drop goals; one of the goals was reportedly kicked from well inside his own half. He played at both fullback and <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Three-quarters">three-quarter</a>, and was noted for his good ball handling and speed, as well as his ability to drop kick.

After returning from tour, Warbrick moved to <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier</a>, and in 1885 represented <a href="Hawke%27s%20Bay%20Rugby%20Union">Hawke's Bay</a> provincially, including captaining them against <a href="Poverty%20Bay%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Poverty Bay</a>. By 1886 he was back playing for Auckland, and that year captained them in their wins over both Wellington, and also New South Wales – who were again touring the country. He returned to Hawke's Bay for the 1887 season, and played for them against Wellington, Poverty Bay, and Canterbury. Warbrick had returned to Wellington by the 1888 season when he again played for the province.

The first British Isles side (now known as the <a href="British%20and%20Irish%20Lions">British and Irish Lions</a>) toured <a href="1888%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand%20and%20Australia">New Zealand and Australia</a> in 1888. The side was privately organised, without the sanction or prohibition of England's <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a>, and toured New Zealand in April and May that year where they played against a number of provincial sides. Although the team was not representative of the best British and Irish players, it did include three internationals with the rest predominantly county representatives. Warbrick was in the Wellington team that faced the tourists on 13 May. The match was ill-tempered, with each side accusing the other of rough play, and eventually finished as a 3–3 draw.

In early 1888 Warbrick announced plans to assemble a Māori side to face the visiting British during their tour, but he later revealed he wanted to take a team of Māori or part-Māori to tour the British Isles. His ambition was for "Māori football" to be as famous as <a href="Cricket%20in%20Australia">Australian cricket</a>, whose national side had already developed a strong rivalry with the English. It is not known exactly when Warbrick had conceived of the idea for this tour, but it was well before the arrival of the British Isles team in April 1888. 

The touring British did help demonstrate the feasibility of Warbrick's proposal, which was dauntingno New Zealand side had ever toured the Northern Hemisphere. Hearing of Warbrick's plans, civil servant <a href="Thomas%20Eyton">Thomas Eyton</a> contacted him to offer help managing the tour, which Warbrick accepted. By May 1888, <a href="James%20Scott%20%28rugby%20manager%29">James Scott</a>, a <a href="pub">pub</a>lican, had joined the partnership. The three men decided that Warbrick would be the team's captain, coach and selector, Scott its manager, and Eyton its promoter. Although Warbrick had chiefly sporting reasons for conducting the tour, for Eyton and Scott profit was the major motivation.

A <a href="M%C4%81ori%20All%20Blacks">New Zealand Māori</a> side had never been selected – the first official side did not play until 1910 – but Warbrick's experience in provincial rugby ensured that he was well qualified to select the team. He travelled the country trying to find players who were talented and willing to spend a year on tour. The make-up of the team changed significantly between March 1888 and when the team departed New Zealand in August. Warbrick encountered challenges assembling the side; there was opposition from some players to including part-Māori in the squad, which prompted several early recruits to withdraw. 

Initially, 20 players were selected for the side, named the "New Zealand Māori team". Some of these players had strong family and playing links to Warbrick (such as his four brothers). Warbrick was eventually compelled to add five <a href="European%20New%20Zealanders">Pākehā</a> (European non-Māori) players to the squad, which resulted in the side being renamed the "New Zealand Native football team". Warbrick may have wanted a team of exclusively Māori or part-Māori players, but according to historian Greg Ryan, including the Pākehā players was "necessary to strengthen the Native team and create a more effective combination". A further player, <a href="Henry%20Wynyard%20%28rugby%20union%29">Pie Wynyard</a>, was added to the side after they arrived in Britain in November 1888.

The side's first match was against Hawke's Bay on 23 June 1888, with Warbrick playing in the <a href="rugby%20union%20positions%23Backs">backs</a>. The match was won 5–0, and was followed by a second match a week later in which Warbrick contributed 10 points in an 11–0 victory. 

The next match was against a strong Auckland side, who defeated the Natives 9–0. The heavy defeat was costly for the Native team, with Warbrick breaking several bones in his foot. It was his last game until November that year, and the loss prompted the addition of <a href="Patrick%20Keogh">Patrick Keogh</a> – one of the five Pākehā in the side – to the squad before its departure from New Zealand.

The team departed New Zealand on 1 August 1888, and sailed to England via <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. After their six-week voyage from Australia, the Native team arrived in England on 27 September 1888. Their first match was against <a href="Surrey%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Surrey</a>, on 3 October, but Joe Warbrick was still injured and did not play. The side played regularly – they averaged just over three games per week while in Britain – but Warbrick did not appear until 7 November when the team faced Tynemouth. The match was won 7–1, but Warbrick – who played at fullback – exacerbated his foot injury. He managed to play six matches between mid-December and early January before he was again injured. He appeared against Stockport, a match drawn 3–3, on 12 January, but despite being fit enough to play his form was poor.

Warbrick only played twice more in the following month, and was not fit enough to be selected for the team that faced <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> on 16 February. The match resulted in a controversial 7–0 loss for the Natives, and included the awarding of two dubious English <a href="try">tries</a> by the referee <a href="George%20Rowland%20Hill">George Rowland Hill</a> – who was also Secretary of the English <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> (RFU). The loss and aftermath soured the relationship between Warbrick's team and the RFU – who accused the Natives of poor sportsmanship after they had protested at the awarding of the controversial tries.

By the time the team departed for Australia in late March they had played 74 matches in Britain, winning 49, losing 20, and drawing 5. However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast <a href="David%20Gage">David Gage</a> featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick was not the only player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently struggled to find a full complement of 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there – a <a href="Try%23Conversion">conversion</a> against <a href="Devon%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Devon</a>.

The high injury toll and congested schedule contributed to complaints about Joe Warbrick's behaviour. His comments to the English press – who directed much of their focus towards him – were viewed negatively by some members of the squad; he was accused of neglecting to acknowledge the contributions of players such as <a href="Thomas%20Ellison">Thomas Ellison</a>, Gage, Keogh, and <a href="Edward%20McCausland">Edward McCausland</a> but to extol the efforts of himself and his brothers.
Warbrick said of his time in the British Isles: "My impression of England and its people during the tour was a very favourable one, more especially does this apply to private individuals. I found them everywhere very kind and attentive and apparently anxious to make one's visit as pleasant as possible". The term "private individuals" may have been used to exclude from praise both the RFU and London press. 

Following the tour he also criticised the partiality of the English referees, and believed that the English administrators displayed a double standard in their treatment of the Natives; the RFU treated the Native team's motives for touring with suspicion, believing the enterprise to be speculative and criticising them for not upholding the amateur principles the RFU liked to espouse. Yet the RFU continued to select <a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a> for England, despite him touring with the speculative and unsanctioned 1888 British team that travelled to New Zealand and Australia.

Warbrick and the team sailed to Australia for a leg of their tour described by historian Greg Ryan as "little more than a testimony to the motives of Scott and Eyton as speculators." Their time in Australia started in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, where the side mostly played <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Victorian Rules Football</a> against Melbourne clubs. These matches were played for financial rather than sporting reasons, and the team had little success at the sport. While the side only played a single rugby match in Victoria, in New South Wales and <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> they almost exclusively played rugby. Warbrick made few appearances in Australia – two in total – but continued functioning as team captain. The Natives had not lost a rugby match in Australia when they played their second match against the <a href="Queensland%20Reds">Queensland representative side</a>. The first match was won 22–0, and the second – held on 20 July – was expected to be another comfortable victory for the Natives. 

However, at half-time the scores were level, and with the exception of Billy Warbrick, the Natives had played poorly. There were rumours that four of the Natives had been paid by local bookmakers to throw the match. When Joe Warbrick spoke to the team at half-time, he threatened to expose the accused players; this was enough to prompt an improvement in the Natives' play, and the side recovered to win 11–7.

The team returned to New Zealand in August 1889, but the Queensland controversy still hung over the side. The Northern Rugby Union (later renamed the <a href="Queensland%20Rugby%20Union">Queensland Rugby Union</a>) did not take any action over the accusations, but the <a href="Otago%20Rugby%20Union">Otago Rugby Union</a> (ORU) decided to conduct an inquiry. The matter was not resolved until after the team arrived in Dunedin when the ORU announced there was no evidence "justifying the accusations", and dismissed taking any further action. The team continued to travel north and to play fixtures throughout the country. Joe Warbrick had played an earlier match in <a href="Gore%2C%20New%20Zealand">Gore</a> – against Mataura District XVI – where he again suffered injury. 

The team's final match was against Auckland on 24 August. The fixture was lost 7–2, but by this point several Native's players had departed the team, including Keogh, Ellison and Gage. Despite the grueling schedule and high number of injuries, the loss to Auckland ended a remarkable streak that had started with a victory over <a href="Widnes%20Vikings">Widnes</a> on 9 March; the Natives had not lost a rugby game in 31 matches, winning 30 and drawing the other. The Natives played a total of 107 rugby matches, including 74 in the British Isles, and the tour remains the longest in the sport's history.

Warbrick retired from rugby at the conclusion of the Natives' tour. He moved to the Bay of Plenty to farm, and occasionally turned out for the <a href="Tauranga">Tauranga</a> representative team. Five years after he retired he made a one-match first-class comeback when he played for Auckland against <a href="Taranaki%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Taranaki</a> in 1894. After this match, an Auckland newspaper wrote: 

Warbrick married Harriet Burt with whom he had one daughter, and he later worked as a tourist guide in the Rotorua area, where his brother Alfred was the Chief Government <a href="Tour%20guide">Guide</a>. On 30 August 1903, while working with his brother in the geothermal region of the area, Joe Warbrick was killed. The <a href="Waimangu%20Geyser">Waimangu Geyser</a>then the largest geyser in the worldunexpectedly erupted with Joe Warbrick and several tourists in the vicinity; four of them, including Warbrick, were killed instantly by the superheated water ejected during the eruption before they were swept towards Lake Rotomahana. Joe Warbrick had warned one of the tourists not to venture too close to the geyser; however she insisted on moving closer to get a better photograph. Warbrick accompanied her, and barely two minutes later the geyser erupted and killed the entire party.

As the captain and instigator of the 1888–89 Nativesthe first New Zealand team to tour the British IslesWarbrick had a lasting impact on the development of rugby in his homeland. When the Natives returned from tour they introduced a style of rugby as good as any ever seen in the country. According to Ryan, "their brand of sensational running style and combined forward play had never been seen in New Zealand." The speculative nature of the tour, which was outside the control of an official authority, concerned many of the provincial unions and gave further momentum to efforts to form a national body. In 1892 the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was founded which would, among other things, organise any representative tours. Many of the Natives went on to contribute to rugby as representative players, administrators, or referees. Two players, Ellison and Gage, went on to captain New Zealand.

In 2008 Warbrick was inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a>, and is a member of the Māori Sports Awards Hall of Fame. A short film, "Warbrick", written and directed by brothers Pere and Meihana Durie, was released in 2009 and depicts Joe Warbrick preparing an injury-depleted Natives squad for a match. The film was played for the All Blacks during their preparations for a match against <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> in 2009.

3 of Hearts (album)

3 of Hearts is an eponymous debut <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American girl group <a href="3%20of%20Hearts">3 of Hearts</a>. It was released on March 6, 2001, through the <a href="record%20label">record label</a> <a href="RCA%20Nashville">RCA Nashville</a>. "3 of Hearts" is a <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a> and <a href="country%20music">country music</a> album, though according to some music critics, it leans more towards <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>. The album was managed by American producer <a href="Byron%20Gallimore">Byron Gallimore</a>; its marketing focused on the group's <a href="Crossover%20music">crossover appeal</a> to target a teenaged and young-adult audience. 3 of Hearts performed on two national tours sponsored by <a href="Seventeen%20%28American%20magazine%29">"Seventeen"</a> magazine and <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a> respectively, and the singers were featured in several marketing campaigns.

Reviews of "3 of Hearts" were mixed; some critics praised the group's vocals and public image, but others criticized the songs as generic and lacking an authentic country sound. The album peaked at number 45 on <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> <a href="Top%20Country%20Albums">Top Country Albums</a> chart. Two singles and "Arizona Rain"were released and made appearances on the . The album's low sales and lack of appeal to country radio audiences led to RCA dropping the group.

<a href="3%20of%20Hearts">3 of Hearts</a> members Blaire Stroud, Katie McNeill, and Deserea Wasdin first performed together at a funeral, where they sang the hymn . They had each performed independently at various venues and aspired to pursue music as a career. At the suggestion of their family and friends, they recorded a <a href="Demo%20Tape">demo tape</a> and video. The tape was composed of four songs: <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a>s of works by <a href="Shania%20Twain">Shania Twain</a> and <a href="Martina%20McBride">Martina McBride</a>, a <a href="Gospel%20music">gospel</a> song, and "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>". McNeill's mother sent the cassette to record promoter Peter Svendsen. While organizing unsolicited demos and materials, Svendsen's daughter recommended he should listen to the tape. Stroud, McNeil, and Wasdin received offers from four <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>-based record labels, including <a href="RCA%20Nashville">RCA Nashville</a>, with whom they signed their record deal shortly after graduating from high school.

<a href="RCA%20Records">RCA</a> executive vice-president Butch Waugh said the record company was immediately drawn to the group because of their wholesome image and work ethic. Steve Hochman of "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" associated 3 of Hearts with a trend towards younger country performers, connecting them with singers <a href="Jessica%20Andrews">Jessica Andrews</a>, <a href="LeAnn%20Rimes">LeAnn Rimes</a>, and <a href="Lila%20McCann">Lila McCann</a>, and the band <a href="Marshall%20Dyllon">Marshall Dyllon</a>. The record label marketed 3 of Hearts and their album to a younger listener; the group's manager <a href="Ken%20Kragen">Ken Kragen</a> said that he hoped the group could revive interest in country music from a teenaged and young-adult audience, as the genre had fallen out of favorite with these demographics. Kragen has said that before he signed the trio, he almost retired from music, after being fired by singer-songwriter <a href="Kenny%20Rogers">Kenny Rogers</a>. In 2001, Rogers sued Kragen for allegedly poaching 3 of Hearts and other musical acts from his company, Rogers' Dreamcatcher Management Co.; Kragen responded by saying Rogers' company had rejected . A settlement was reached in 2003, and the terms of the agreement were not disclosed to the public.

American producer <a href="Byron%20Gallimore">Byron Gallimore</a> worked as the executive producer for the group's debut album; in the later half of 2000, the trio recorded the songs in the Tennessee <a href="recording%20studio">studio</a>s Essential Sound and Ocean Nashville. The music was <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> at the Emerald Sound Studios in Nashville, and <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastered</a> in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. Prior to the release of the album, song "Just Might Change Your Life" was featured on the soundtrack for the film <a href="Where%20the%20Heart%20Is%20%282000%20film%29">"Where the Heart Is"</a> (2000).

"3 of Hearts" is a <a href="teen%20pop">teen pop</a> and <a href="country%20music">country music</a> album that consists of eleven tracks. The instrumentals include fiddles and drums, which <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> has noted are commonly used in country music. Malcolm Mayhew, writing for the "<a href="Fort%20Worth%20Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>", identified the trio's sound as "country sprinkled with pop". He wrote that the album has a focus on a style of country music similar to that of American band the <a href="Dixie%20Chicks">Dixie Chicks</a>, with "pop touches" and "an occasional nod to <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin</a>". Several music critics said that "3 of Hearts" features more pop compositions than country ones; a writer for <a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">"Billboard"</a> wrote: "even with the most loose, liberal translation, no way is this anything close to country music." The same writer noted that the trio's music and style did not fit with the more "edgy" scene of their home state <a href="Texas">Texas</a>.

Songs include "peppy-squared, nearly interchangeable <a href="midtempo">midtempo</a>s" ("Love Is Enough," "It Happened to Me", "The Hard Way", and "Sugar and Daisies") and "note-bending, ("6, 8, 12", "Wash Away This Kiss", and "Over the Edge"). The album's opening trackthe <a href="uptempo">uptempo</a> "Love Is Enough"features lyrics about the importance of love, and an instrumental provided by a fiddle. The subject of romance is also explored in "Baby, That's The Way"which interprets true love through the message, "you'll know it's the real thing when you see it"and "Sugar and Daisies". "6, 8, 12" is a cover of American singer <a href="Brian%20McKnight">Brian McKnight</a>'s 2000 <a href="Back%20at%20One">single of the same name</a>.

"3 of Hearts" was initially scheduled for release on various dates in 2001June 5, June 6, and July 24 – before being pushed forward to March 6 that year. It was released as an <a href="Compact%20disc">audio CD</a>, <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a>, and <a href="Music%20download">digital download</a>. Jon Elliot, a senior director of marketing and artist development for RCA, said the promotional strategies for the album and the group focused primarily on "get[ting] their names out there and their faces visible". 3 of Hearts performed as part of a 2001 tour sponsored by <a href="Seventeen%20%28American%20magazine%29">"Seventeen"</a> magazine, in which they sang in American shopping malls in 50 cities as part of a showcase of <a href="prom">prom</a> fashions. They also participated in the <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a> Across America Tour. To prepare for the tours, the trio were given dance lessons by American singer and choreographer <a href="Toni%20Basil">Toni Basil</a>. Lorie Hollabaugh of "Billboard" praised the group's live performances as defined by "tightly woven harmonies".

Along with the performances, the group members were featured in magazine advertisements from April to July 2001; the features included a contest in which a reader could win a performance from the group at their school. 3 of Hearts was the first country act to partner with "Seventeen". The group also participated in a marketing campaign with <a href="Gillette">Gillette</a>, and discussions started with <a href="Warner%20TV">Warner TV</a> on a potential television series based on their lives. To further promote their music, 3 of Hearts visited radio stations. They also had a two-hour interview with <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">"Scholastic"</a> magazine and appeared on the cover. They were also prominently featured on boxes of <a href="Kellogg%27s">Kellogg's</a> cereal; Chet Flippo of <a href="CMT%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">CMT</a> described the promotion of 3 of Hearts as "a media blitz".

Following the album's release, 3 of Hearts was let go from RCA due to low sales and a lack of connection with the core audience of country radiothe middle-aged woman. In a 2002 interview, RCA chairman <a href="Joe%20Galante">Joe Galante</a> said he learned to "aim for your natural marketplace" from his experiences with 3 of Hearts and he felt marketing a country act for teenagers was not a wise business move.

"Love Is Enough" was released as the <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> from "3 of Hearts"; it was sent to radio stations in the United States on March 6, 2001. It was further promoted through an "enhanced commercial CD single", which included the accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for the song. The group performed "Love Is Enough" on "<a href="The%20Jenny%20Jones%20Show">The Jenny Jones Show</a>" as part of "nine young acts to watch in 2001". Deborah Evans Price of "Billboard" praised the single as conveying a "vibrant feel that evokes a sunny day with the windows down and the radio up", but found the lyrics and overall message to be cliché. "Arizona Rain" was released as the album's second single on July 23, 2001. The track was featured on the 2001 album "Country Heat 2002", which was made available through <a href="BMG%20Music%20Canada">BMG Music Canada</a>.

"Love Is Enough" and "Arizona Rain" both made appearances on "Billboard". "Love Is Enough" peaked at number 43 on the <a href="Country%20Airplay">Country Airplay</a> chart on May 19, 2001; the single remained on the chart for ten weeks. "Arizona Rain" reached number 59 on the Country Airplay chart on August 18, 2001, and remained on the chart for a week.

3 of Hearts' vocals and image received praise from music critics following the album's release. "Billboard" described the trio as "possess[ing] angelic voices" and praised "3 of Hearts" as "ear candy". "<a href="D%20Magazine">D Magazine</a>" said the album's pop composition could allow the group to have a <a href="Crossover%20music">crossover appeal</a>, and compared them to the Dixie Chicks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album as well-constructed and appealing, but criticized several songsspecifically "Over the Edge"as sounding dated. He positively compared the trio's vocals to those of American band <a href="Rascal%20Flatts">Rascal Flatts</a>, and preferred their wholesome image over the more sexualized one attached to American singer <a href="Willa%20Ford">Willa Ford</a>. In a mixed review, Mario Tarradell of the "<a href="Knight%20Ridder%20Tribune">Knight Ridder Tribune</a>" described the music as "breezy" and "refreshing", but noted that it was not innovative.

Commentators criticized "3 of Hearts" and the trio's vocals as generic and lacking an authentic country sound. "<a href="Country%20Standard%20Time">Country Standard Time</a>" Dan MacIntosh called the album manufactured, describing its content as "impersonal, yet functional, songs". He responded negatively to the lack of attitude in the group's voices, which he dismissed as "girlishly giddy vocals and pop-ish country backing". Editor Tom Roland, writing for the <a href="American%20Bar%20Association">American Bar Association</a>, panned the album's content for its "bright, but shallow declarations of puppy love". Even though he praised the trio as talented, he said their vocals had "none of the life experience that has been a traditional hallmark of country recordings".

"3 of Hearts" peaked at number 45 on the <a href="Top%20Country%20Albums">Top Country Albums</a> "Billboard" chart on August 11, 2001, remaining on the chart for six weeks.

Writing and production credits for the songs are taken from the booklet of "3 of Hearts". Byron Gallimore produced all of the songs for the album.

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> developed by <a href="Infinity%20Ward">Infinity Ward</a> and published by <a href="Activision">Activision</a>. An installment in the <a href="Call%20of%20Duty">"Call of Duty" series</a>, it was released in November 2007 for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and was ported to the Wii as "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition" in 2009. The game breaks away from the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> setting of previous entries in the series and is instead set in modern times. Developed for over two years, the game uses a proprietary <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>.

The story takes place in the year 2011, where a radical leader has executed the president of an unnamed country in the Middle East, and an <a href="ultranationalist">ultranationalist</a> movement ignites a <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> in Russia. The conflicts are seen from the perspectives of a <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Force%20Reconnaissance">U.S. Force Reconnaissance Marine</a> and a <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">British SAS commando</a>, and are set in various locales, such as the United Kingdom, the Middle East, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Ukraine. The <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> portion of the game features various <a href="game%20mode">game mode</a>s, and contains a leveling system that allows the player to unlock additional weapons, weapon attachments, and camouflage schemes as they advance.

The game received universal acclaim from critics, with the gameplay and story receiving particular praise, while criticism targeted the failure of the game to substantially innovate the first-person shooter genre. The game won numerous awards from gaming websites, including <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Best Xbox 360 Game. It was the top-selling game worldwide for 2007, selling around seven million copies by January 2008 and almost sixteen million by November 2013. It was followed by two sequels that continue the storyline: "" and "". A remastered version of the game, "", was released on <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> and PC alongside special editions of "" in November 2016. A standalone version was released in June 2017.

As opposed to earlier games in the <a href="Call%20of%20Duty">"Call of Duty" series</a>, the game features modern equipment and new features, many exclusive to the multiplayer part of the game, such as "killstreaks"; killing a number of enemies without the player dying in between kills allows access to various assets including airstrikes and helicopter support. A character can be positioned in one of three stances: standing, crouching, or prone, each affecting the character's rate of movement, accuracy, and stealth. Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage. As such, there are no armor or health power ups. When the character has taken damage, the edges of the screen glow red and the character's heartbeat increases. If the character stays out of fire, the character can recover. When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade, a marker indicates the direction of the grenade, helping the player to either flee or toss it back to the enemy.

The player takes on the role of various characters during a single-player campaign. The characters' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game. As such, the player's perspective changes from one character to another between missions. Each mission features a series of objectives; the player is led to each objective with the <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads up display</a>, which marks its direction and distance. Some objectives require that the player arrives at a checkpoint, while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location, stand their ground to defend an objective, or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation. After the credits, a special epilogue mission is unlocked for play, featuring a four-man squad retrieving a VIP from terrorists who have hijacked an airliner. The SAS rescue the VIP and escape before the plane is destroyed. The main campaign features 30 collectible pieces of intel that award the player with game cheats and visual filters such as infinite ammunition, cluster grenades, and increased <a href="Contrast%20%28vision%29">contrast</a>.

"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" features team-based and <a href="Deathmatch%20%28gaming%29">deathmatch</a>-based <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> modes on various maps. Each <a href="Game%20mechanic%23Game%20modes">mode</a> has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete. Players can call in <a href="Unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">UAV</a> <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> scans, air strikes, and attack helicopters, when they achieve three-, five-, and seven-enemy kill streaks respectively. A game ends when either a team or player has reached a predefined number of points, or the allotted time expires in which case the team or player with the most points wins. If the points are even when the time expires, Sudden Death mode is activated in which there is no re-spawning and the team who either has the last man standing, or achieves the objective first are the winners. If the player is in either of the two matches, then there is an Overtime match, in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory.

The player's performance in the multiplayer mode is tracked with <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s, which can be earned by killing opposing players, completing challenges, completing objectives, or by completing a round or match. As the player gains experience, they advance in level, unlocking new weapons, perks, challenges, and gameplay modes. The highest obtainable level is 55, but on the console versions of the game, the player has the option to enter "Prestige" mode, which returns their level to one and removes all accumulated unlockables. This process can be repeated up to 10 times with a different insignia being given each time.

As the player advances in levels, they earn the ability to customize their classes; this includes selecting their main weapon, side arm and special grenade type. Additionally, the player can select 3 perks, one from each of the three "Tiers", that can customize their character further. Perk effects include, but are not limited to, extra ammunition, increasing bullet damage by the player, or dropping a live <a href="grenade">grenade</a> when the player is killed. The player is also given the choice to complete challenges in order to receive even more experience points; challenges include achieving a certain number of kills with a specific weapon, shooting down a helicopter or performing a number of head shots. Additionally, when the player attains a certain amount of headshots with a specific weapon, excluding sidearms, the player unlocks extra weapon "camos", or camouflage, to use for that specific weapon.

During the single-player campaign, the player controls six different characters from a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person perspective</a>. The player assumes the role of recent <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) recruit Sergeant <a href="Soap%20MacTavish">John "Soap" MacTavish</a> for most of the game, starting with his enrollment in the 22nd SAS Regiment. Sergeant Paul Jackson is part of <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Force%20Reconnaissance">USMC 1st Force Recon</a> deployed to the Middle East, and the player controls Jackson's character during five levels of Act 1. <a href="Captain%20Price">Captain John Price</a> (voiced by actor <a href="Billy%20Murray%20%28actor%29">Billy Murray</a>) is an SAS officer who is playable in two flashback missions from 1996 in which he is still <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a>. The player also assumes the role of an American thermal-imaging TV operator aboard a <a href="Lockheed%20AC-130">Lockheed AC-130</a> gunship during one level, and a British SAS operative infiltrating a hijacked airliner to save a VIP in a secret level titled "Mile High Club". Finally, the player may control Yasir Al-Fulani, the <a href="president">president</a> of an unnamed Middle Eastern country in the game before he is executed, although he has no freedom of action beyond turning his head.

The game's <a href="Non-player%20character">non-playable characters</a> (NPCs) feature prominently in the story: Captain Price and his right-hand man, Gaz (voiced by <a href="Craig%20Fairbrass">Craig Fairbrass</a>), serve as mentors to Soap. Jackson's USMC platoon is led by Lieutenant Vasquez (voiced by <a href="David%20Sobolov">David Sobolov</a>) and Staff Sergeant Griggs (voiced by and modeled after Infinity Ward lead animator Mark Grigsby); Griggs later accompanies Soap in Russia. Sergeant Kamarov (voiced by <a href="Mark%20Ivanir">Mark Ivanir</a>) leads the Russian loyalists that aid SAS and USMC forces. "Nikolai" (voiced by Sven Holmberg) is a Russian informant who helps the SAS. Captain MacMillan (voiced by Zach Hanks) is Price's mentor and <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> during a flashback.

The antagonists in the story include Imran Zakhaev (voiced by <a href="Yevgeni%20Lazarev">Yevgeni Lazarev</a>), the leader of the Russian <a href="ultranationalist">ultranationalist</a> party and the main antagonist of the game; Khaled Al-Asad, the commander of the revolutionary forces in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and an ally of Imran Zakhaev; and Victor Zakhaev, the son of Imran Zakhaev and a priority figure in the ultranationalist party.

In 2011, a civil war has broken out in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> between its government and <a href="ultranationalist">ultranationalist</a>s who seek to restore Russia to its <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet-era</a> glamor. Meanwhile, a separatist group led by Khaled Al-Asad seizes power in a "small but oil-rich" country in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> through a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>, executing its president, Al-Fulani. Al-Asad is ruthless and has extreme <a href="Anti-Western%20sentiment">anti-Western views</a>, which prompts the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> to invade the country. In the afternoon of the second day of invasion, a <a href="platoon">platoon</a> of <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps%20Force%20Reconnaissance">USMC 1st Force Recon</a>, led by Lieutenant Vasquez, is sent to capture Al-Asad. The platoon attacks a TV station in which Al-Asad was believed to be broadcasting live, but discover only a looped recording. The group later engages in <a href="Urban%20warfare">urban combat</a> in an unnamed city south of the capital. During this time, they help support and subsequently repair a downed <a href="M1%20Abrams">M1 Abrams</a> tank to assist them.

In the meantime, John "Soap" MacTavish is recruited into a British <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) squad led by Captain Price. The group shortly conducts two operations, one which leads them to infiltrate a cargo ship in the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a>. Neutralizing the armed Russians on board, the group discover a <a href="nuclear%20device">nuclear device</a> labelled in Arabic and retrieve its manifest. Enemy <a href="MiG">MiG</a>s then attack and scuttle the ship, but the SAS narrowly escapes by helicopter.

The second operation takes them to Russia in order to rescue one of their allies, a Russian <a href="informant">informant</a> named Nikolai working within the Ultranationalist party. Assisted by Russian loyalist forces, Price's team succeeds in rescuing Nikolai. However, their helicopter is later brought down, forcing the group to make their way through enemy territory with support from an <a href="AC-130H%20Spectre">AC-130</a> gunship before they can be extracted. <a href="Military%20intelligence">Intelligence</a> gathered from these two missions indicates that Al-Asad may be in possession of a Russian nuclear device.

In the evening of the third day, the U.S. launches a full-scale assault on Al-Asad's presidential palace, aware of the SAS warning about the possible nuclear device. As <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Special%20Warfare%20Development%20Group">U.S. Navy SEALs</a> invade the palace, the Marines engage Al-Asad's ground forces. The assault, however, ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device suddenly <a href="Effects%20of%20nuclear%20explosions">detonates</a>, wiping out most of the city along with everyone in it.

Refusing to assume Al-Asad dead, Price's strike team supported by Russian loyalists raids a potential safe house in a village in <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> to eradicate the occupying Russian forces and capture Al-Asad. Shortly into the <a href="interrogation">interrogation</a>, Al-Asad's phone rings. After hearing the voice of the caller, Price executes Al-Asad and reveals that the caller was the leader of the ultranationalists: Imran Zakhaev. Price informs his squad about his assassination mission against Zakhaev in <a href="Pripyat%2C%20Ukraine">Pripyat, Ukraine</a> in 1996. In the aftermath of the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a> and <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">the collapse of the Soviet Union</a>, Zakhaev took advantage of the turmoil to profit from <a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> and used his new wealth to lure soldiers from the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a> to form his ultranationalist party. Price, then a lieutenant, and his superior, Captain MacMillan, were sent on a <a href="black%20operation">black operation</a> to eliminate him. Making their way through Pripyat and into Chernobyl, the two reached their vantage point in an abandoned hotel, with Price firing upon Zakhaev with a <a href="Barrett%20M82">Barrett M82</a> sniper rifle; however, the shot only severed Zakhaev's arm. Price and MacMillan barely escaped Zakhaev's henchmen.

Following the death of Al-Asad, Price's team hold off against Ultranationalist forces who arrive to avenge him. Later, a joint task force, composed of the SAS, Force Recon, and the loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son, Victor, to learn Zakhaev's whereabouts. After ambushing him in an enemy convoy at a vehicle checkpoint, Victor flees the scene but is soon cornered on the roof of an apartment building. Refusing to surrender, he commits suicide. Enraged, Zakhaev retaliates by taking control of a nuclear <a href="Missile%20launch%20facility">launch facility</a>.

An operation is launched by the task force to take back the site from Zakhaev’s forces via <a href="Halo%20jumping">halo jump</a>. However, Zakhaev promptly launches nuclear <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>s at the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Eastern Seaboard</a>, with the potential of causing 41 million casualties. The SAS and Force Recon, however, manage to breach the facility, seize the command room and <a href="range%20safety">remotely destroy the missiles</a> over the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. They escape in military trucks with Zakhaev's forces in hot pursuit.

An ultranationalist <a href="Mil%20Mi-24">Mi-24 Hind</a> helicopter destroys a vital bridge and traps the joint force. In the ensuing fight, a tanker explodes, and many of the group are either killed or injured. Zakhaev himself arrives and begins killing wounded soldiers when loyalists in a <a href="Mil%20Mi-28">Mi-28 Havoc</a> suddenly destroy his Mi-24 Hind and join the fray. Distracted, Zakhaev turns to the loyalist forces at which point Price gives Soap a M1911; the latter kills Zakhaev and his escort. Loyalist forces start tending to the wounded immediately.

In the epilogue, the missile incident and the ultranationalists' support of Al-Asad are covered up, thus causing the events of "".

"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" was developed by a team of a hundred people, over the course of two years. After "<a href="Call%20of%20Duty%202">Call of Duty 2</a>", the <a href="Infinity%20Ward">Infinity Ward</a> team decided to move away from the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> environment of previous games in the series. This resulted in three game concepts: "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare", "" and "". While developing the story for "Call of Duty 4", Infinity Ward chose to avoid referencing current, real-life wars, and keep the series' common theme of two opposing forces of similar strength. To enhance the realistic feel of the game, the development team attended a live-fire exercise at <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Ground%20Combat%20Center%20Twentynine%20Palms">Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms</a>, a training facility in the <a href="California">California</a> desert. This helped the developers to simulate the effects of being near an <a href="M1%20Abrams">Abrams tank</a> when it fires. The team also talked with <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marines</a> who were recently in combat to get a feel for the background, emotions, and attitude of Marines in combat. Veterans were also recruited to supervise <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> sessions and the <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> design of the game.
The development team designed the online multiplayer component to be balanced and rewarding for new players while still offering something for experienced players. An early idea to implement air support (air strikes and attack helicopters) involved players fighting over special zones to access a trigger for air support against enemies. This idea was discarded because it discouraged the type of deathmatch gameplay they intended. The kill streak reward system was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills. Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting. Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games—the developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well. Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire.

Most of the music for "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" was written by British composer <a href="Stephen%20Barton">Stephen Barton</a>, who had also contributed to <a href="film%20score">film score</a>s by <a href="Harry%20Gregson-Williams">Harry Gregson-Williams</a>, to whom, composed the main theme of the game. Several music tracks from the game are available on Infinity Ward's "7 Days of Modern Warfare" website, and some are available at Barton's own web site. The rap song played during the end credits is performed by "Call of Duty 4"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lead animator, Mark Grigsby.

"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" runs on the <a href="IW%20engine">IW engine</a>, specifically IW 3.0, featuring true world-dynamic lighting, <a href="High%20dynamic%20range%20rendering">HDR lighting effects</a>, dynamic shadows and <a href="depth%20of%20field">depth of field</a>. Bullet penetration is calculated by the engine, taking into account factors such as surface type and entity thickness. The game runs in a <a href="Display%20resolution">native resolution</a> of 600p on the Xbox 360 and PS3.

Certain objects, such as cars and some buildings, are destructible. This makes distinguishing <a href="Cover%20%28military%29">cover</a> from concealment important, as the protection provided by objects such as wooden fences and thin walls do not completely protect players from harm. Bullet stopping power is decreased after penetrating an object, and the decrease is dependent on the thickness and surface type of the object. The game makes use of a dynamic <a href="physics%20engine">physics engine</a>, not implemented in previous "Call of Duty" titles. Death animations are a combination of pre-set animations and <a href="ragdoll%20physics">ragdoll physics</a>. Console versions of "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" run at a consistent 60 <a href="Frame%20rate">frames per second</a>, and the Wii version runs at 30 frames per second. Code was included to determine <a href="Spawning%20%28computer%20gaming%29">spawning points</a> based on the nearby weapons and the relationship between enemy positions and <a href="Line%20of%20sight%20%28gaming%29">line of sight</a> to the points. The various criteria are meant to minimize players dying immediately after rejoining a match, or being "spawn-killed" due to players simply waiting for others to "respawn". However, enemies may still respawn infinitely, a notable feature in Call of Duty game engines.

The game engine has also been used for the development of two other <a href="Activision">Activision</a> games. An enhanced version of the original engine was used in "", the fifth installment in the "Call of Duty" series after "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare", while a slightly altered version has been used for the <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> video game "", as well as "<a href="GoldenEye%20007%20%282010%20video%20game%29">GoldenEye 007</a>" using a heavily modified version.

On April 27, 2007, the day before the release of the game's trailer, Infinity Ward launched a website called "Charlie Oscar Delta" to provide information on the game. Charlie Oscar Delta features a ranking system that allows users to complete missions to increase their rank and compete for prizes. Charlie Oscar Delta is derived from the <a href="NATO%20phonetic%20alphabet">NATO phonetic alphabet</a> and the initials of "Call of Duty". The first "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" trailer featuring game footage was released on April 28. An Xbox 360 "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" public <a href="beta%20test">beta test</a> was announced on August 30. The beta test was designed to test the servers, find glitches, and help balance out the weapons. It was originally only for residents of the U.S., but was later available to other countries. The beta concluded on September 30. The maximum rank for the beta was initially level 16, but was increased to level 25 towards the end of the beta. Three multiplayer maps were available for play: "Crash", "Vacant", and "Overgrown". A single-player demo for the PC was released on October 11 as a <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a> download. The demo includes one level, "The Bog", which showcases the advanced night vision and associated graphics capabilities.

The game was released as a standard version and a collector's edition. The Collector's Edition contains the standard retail game and a DVD containing a <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> entitled "Great SAS Missions", which consists of archive footage of the SAS in action and accounts from former SAS members. The DVD contains a "<a href="making-of">making-of</a>" featurette and a level walkthrough by the developers. Also included is a limited edition poster and a hardcover art book featuring never-before-seen concept, development, and final artwork. These elements were packaged in a larger cardboard version of the standard retail box. The collector's edition was originally only available in the U.S., but was later released in other countries. A "Game of the Year" edition was later released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The PlayStation 3 version included the Variety map pack on the disc, and while the Xbox 360 Game of the Year edition initially included an insert in the packaging which could be redeemed on Xbox Live Marketplace to download the Variety map pack, later releases did not contain the inserts, and so were no different from the original release of the game.

"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" was released for consoles and Windows in North America on November 6, 2007, in Australia on November 7, 2007, and in Europe on November 9, 2007. The <a href="macOS">Mac OS X</a> version of the game was developed by <a href="Aspyr%20Media">Aspyr</a> and released on September 26, 2008. It was released on the Mac App Store on January 16, 2011. It was rated 15 by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">BBFC</a>, M for Mature by the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">ESRB</a>, MA 15+ by the <a href="Office%20of%20Film%20and%20Literature%20Classification%20%28Australia%29">OFLC</a>, 16+ by the <a href="Pan%20European%20Game%20Information">PEGI</a>, and 18 by the <a href="Unterhaltungssoftware%20Selbstkontrolle">USK</a>. The <a href="Wii">Wii</a> <a href="Video%20game%20porting">port</a> of the game, titled "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition", was developed by <a href="Treyarch">Treyarch</a> and released on November 10, 2009, alongside "" and "".

As part of an exclusivity deal between <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and Activision, multiplayer map packs for the "Call of Duty" franchise, beginning with "Modern Warfare", were released first on <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>. The deal would ultimately last until "" in 2015, which introduces a new deal with <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony</a> and PlayStation platforms.

Infinity Ward released the Variety Map Pack for the Xbox 360 on April 4, 2008. It includes the multiplayer maps "Killhouse", "Creek", "Chinatown", and "Broadcast". The same map pack was released for the PlayStation 3 on April 24, 2008. The Variety Map Pack was downloaded by over one million people in its first nine days of release, a record for paid Xbox Live downloadable content, valued at <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>10 million. It was released as a free download for Windows on June 5, 2008, sponsored by <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a>, along with patch 1.6. A further patch for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game was announced over a year later in August 2009; the patch primarily addressed online multiplayer exploits. Patch 1.7 was released in June 2008. This patch can be applied to the Game of the Year edition directly with no prior patches. Earlier versions must have patch 1.6 applied first.

"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" received "universal acclaim" on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions, and "generally favorable reviews" for the Wii version, according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. The gameplay has been cited by reviewers to have brought the genre to "a new level of immersion and intensity that we had never seen before." "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" said about the multiplayer, "it's the multiplayer mode that solidifies the game's instant-classic status" and that "the campaign never lets up." <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> gave a favorable review for "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare", saying that the "high quality of that campaign and its terrific multiplayer options make "Call of Duty 4" a fantastic package." "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>" commented that "while it may not have revolutionized the genre, it comes damn close to perfecting it." "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" claims that "the amazingly deep multiplayer rivals" Halo 3"'s in terms of reach and scope."

The game's story has received a considerable amount of acclaim from reviewers. "GamePro" notes that "the intense single-player campaign offers up an action packed experience that features a tremendously compelling narrative; there are moments in the game that will send chills down your spine." <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> mentioned that the fact the "single-player campaign is over in a flash" as the only major flaw. While <a href="IGN">IGN</a> described the campaign as "still very linear" like that of its predecessors, "eschewing the concept of <a href="Sandbox%20mode">sandbox game</a>play," it noted that this resulted in "a much richer, more focused experience" with "beautifully scripted set pieces." IGN's Voodoo Extreme similarly remarked that it "virtually plays <a href="Rail%20shooter">on a rail</a>, but that's part of its charm." In contrast to later entries in the "Call of Duty" franchise, <a href="Ben%20Croshaw">Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw</a> of <a href="Zero%20Punctuation">Zero Punctuation</a> gave the game a positive review, praising how it "never sacrifices gameplay for story, or vice versa" and that it featured "less of the smarmy, black-and-white, 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee' <a href="jingoism">jingoism</a> that turns me off most war games".

Nevertheless, the game has also received criticism. "<a href="Xbox%20World%20360">Xbox World 360</a>" stated "It's smoke and mirrors and a host of cheap tricks," commenting on the notion that the game did not revolutionize the genre. "<a href="Pelit">Pelit</a>" also remarked that "the structure of the single player game should <a href="Ellipsis">...</a> have been updated" and that "barging from one invisible checkpoint to the next throughout the whole campaign just isn't good enough anymore."

"Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition" was ported by <a href="Treyarch">Treyarch</a>. The Wii version of "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" has fewer features than the other console versions. It does not support split-screen multiplayer, and the graphics are not as developed. However, it supports co-operative gameplay in the campaign on a single screen. At any moment, a second Wii remote can be activated giving the second player their own aiming crosshairs. The game received an aggregated score of 76% on Metacritic. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave the Wii version of the game, "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare – Reflex Edition", a score of 7.0, saying the visuals and pointer controls are not as polished as the Wii version of "", though they did mention the customization options and multiplayer are impressive. "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>" gave it 80%, praising it for packing everything from its next-gen counterpart, but again criticizing the visuals. <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> gave the game an 8.8, saying that despite some sacrifices, it retains everything good from its original version. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" scored the game at a 6.5, stating that while the game was rather poor graphically, even by Wii standards, the bigger problem was the Wii remote, stating that it did not have enough buttons to support "Modern Warfare's" control scheme, and also that it was quite imprecise, contrasting it with the dual analog system used by the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, and the mouse and keyboard system on the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> version of the game. GameSpot gave the game an 8.5, stating that the online was as addictive as the other versions, they also said that the controls "are precise and customizable enough to let you be all you can be".

Before "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" was released, it was predicted to sell even more copies than the highly successful "<a href="Halo%203">Halo 3</a>"; it had received reviews as high as "Halo 3"s, it was launching on three systems as opposed to one for "Halo 3", and demand for the game led to a wide range of retailers only having enough available to satisfy <a href="pre-order">pre-order</a>s. It fulfilled the prediction and the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> version became the best-selling video game in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> from November 2007 to January 2008 according to the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would go on to sell 1.57 million and 444,000 units, respectively, in the United States in November 2007. 1.47 million units of the Xbox 360 version were sold in December 2007; the game sold 331,000 copies for the Xbox 360 and 140,000 copies for the PlayStation 3 in January 2008. The Xbox 360 version was the third <a href="2007%20in%20video%20gaming%23United%20States">best-selling video game of 2007 in the U.S.</a> with 3.04 million units sold, behind "Halo 3", which sold 4.82 million units, according to the NPD Group. By January 2008, "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" had sold more than 7 million copies worldwide, and was the best-selling game of 2007. On June 3, 2008, <a href="Infinity%20Ward">Infinity Ward</a> reported that the game had sold over 10 million units. During a May 2009 conference call, <a href="Activision">Activision</a> announced that the game has sold 13 million copies, surpassing "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>" as the best selling game released that week of November 2007. By November 2013, the game had sold 15.7 million copies.

"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" was widely distributed online in the form of <a href="Copyright%20infringement">infringing copies</a>. Robert Bowling, Community Manager at Infinity Ward stated, "We pulled some disturbing numbers this past week about the amount of PC players currently playing Multiplayer... What wasn't fantastic was the percentage of those numbers who were playing on stolen copies of the game on stolen/cracked CD keys of pirated copies."

"Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare" received awards from various gaming sites and publications. Both <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> and <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> gave the game the Best Graphics of E3 2007 award, and the Best PlayStation 3 Game of 2007 award, and later ranked it as the third best first-person shooter on its "Top 10 FPS Games Ever!" list. It gained high praise from both video game magazine "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" and <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, having been named the Best Overall Game of 2007 by the former, and Game of the Year by the latter. Game Critics also named the game "Best Action Game." From other authorities such as <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and "<a href="X-Play">X-play</a>", and the "<a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>", the game won awards for areas such as Best Sound Design, Best Shooter of 2007, and Best Military Game.

Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa

Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa is a non-fiction book written by <a href="Stephen%20Lewis">Stephen Lewis</a> for the <a href="Massey%20Lectures">Massey Lectures</a>. Lewis wrote it in early to mid-2005 and <a href="House%20of%20Anansi%20Press">House of Anansi Press</a> released it as the lecture series began in October 2005. Each of the book's chapters was delivered as one lecture in a different Canadian city, beginning in Vancouver on October 18 and ending in Toronto on October 28. The speeches were aired on <a href="CBC%20Radio%20One">CBC Radio One</a> between November 7 and 11. The author and orator, Stephen Lewis, was at that time the <a href="United%20Nations%20Special%20Envoy%20for%20HIV/AIDS%20in%20Africa">United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa</a> and former <a href="Canadian%20ambassadors%20to%20the%20United%20Nations">Canadian ambassador to the United Nations</a>. Although he wrote the book and lectures in his role as a concerned Canadian citizen, his criticism of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN), international organizations, and other diplomats, including naming specific people, was called undiplomatic and led several reviewers to speculate whether he would be removed from his UN position.

In the book and the lectures, Lewis argues that significant changes are required to meet the <a href="Millennium%20Development%20Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by <a href="international%20financial%20institutions">international financial institutions</a> that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the <a href="structural%20adjustment%20loan">structural adjustment loan</a>s, with <a href="Conditionality">conditions</a> of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20Africa">spread of AIDS</a> and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by <a href="G8">G8</a> countries to levels beyond what they promise.

Book reviewers found the criticisms constructive and the writing sincere. His style focuses less on numbers and statistics, and more on connecting decisions by UN officials and western diplomats to consequences on the ground in Africa. His eyewitness accounts are said to be candid and emotional. The book spent seven weeks at #1 on "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>"'s Nonfiction Bestseller List. A second edition was released in June 2006. The Canadian Booksellers Association awarded its Libris Award for non-fiction book of the year to "Race Against Time" and its Author of the Year Award to Lewis in 2006.

At the time of publication, the author, <a href="Stephen%20Lewis">Stephen Lewis</a>, aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the <a href="United%20Nations%20Special%20Envoy%20for%20HIV/AIDS%20in%20Africa">United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa</a>, a position he held since 2001. Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of <a href="United%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund">United Nations Children's Fund</a> (1994–99), as the <a href="Canadian%20ambassadors%20to%20the%20United%20Nations">Canadian ambassador to the UN</a> (1984–88), and as leader of the <a href="Ontario%20New%20Democratic%20Party">Ontario New Democratic Party</a> (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became more vocal on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by "<a href="The%20Nature%20of%20Things">The Nature of Things</a>", entitled "Race Against Time" and "The Value of Life". Meanwhile he was invested as a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Canada">Companion of the Order of Canada</a>, awarded the <a href="Pearson%20Medal%20of%20Peace">Pearson Medal of Peace</a>, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by "<a href="MacLean%27s">MacLean's</a>" magazine. In 2005, he was invited to deliver the annual series of <a href="Massey%20Lectures">Massey Lectures</a> from which the book, "Race Against Time", was adapted. He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.

The book consists of five chapters, from which the five lectures were derived: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions. Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and Acknowledgments, and afterwards a Glossary section. The book's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006. In the Preface, written by Lewis in August 2005, he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and that the nature of the topic would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect. He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984. In the first chapter, Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN-related events like, in 1986, brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly's 13th Special Session. He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation, but focuses on the effects of <a href="Global%20financial%20system">international finance institutions'</a> <a href="Conditionality">conditional loans</a> since the late 1980s.

In the second chapter Lewis discusses his history in Africa, beginning in the 1960s as an English teacher in <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>. He contrasts Africa of the 1960s shedding colonial rule, optimistic in future prospects, with Africa of the 2000s struggling with AIDS and increasingly widespread hunger. He acknowledges the <a href="brain%20drain">brain drain</a> trend, noting "there are more <a href="Malawian">Malawian</a> doctors in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> [England] than in Malawi". In the third chapter Lewis examines how the UN, <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>, and the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) failed to fulfill promises of free access to <a href="primary%20education">primary education</a>. In the instances where school entry fees were eliminated, additional fees ("e.g." fees for uniforms, books, exams, and registration) had the same effect of limiting access. The fourth chapter elaborates on how women's issues are ignored or dismissed at international conferences and by African governments. Lewis identifies the gender discrimination that occurs even within the UN organization, whose management staff was dominated by males. He links the World Bank and IMF conditions of low social spending on education and healthcare by governments of recipient countries to the rampant spread of AIDS in those same countries. The disease decimated Africa's working age and farming population, leading to famine. He calls on the international financial institutions to pay "<a href="Reparation%20%28legal%29">reparations</a>" in the form of <a href="debt%20relief">debt relief</a>.

Lewis concludes that dramatic changes are required to meet the <a href="Millennium%20Development%20Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> by 2015. In the final chapter, he considers some potential measures that could help in Africa. He laments the shortfalls in funding by <a href="G8">G8</a> countries, despite the continued renewed promises for full funding of Millennium Development Goal implementation. His proposed measures include:

The writing style reflects the author's intent to use the text for a <a href="Public%20lecture">lecture series</a>. The narration addresses the audience while guiding it through explanations of the issues and anecdotal illustrations. Lewis' charismatic, eloquent, and energetic oration style is reflected in the writing. The tone has been described as loud and persuasive. One reviewer called it "vintage Lewis – incisive criticism leavened with high-blown rhetoric". The book focuses more upon real-world human experiences, rather than numbers and statistics, in discussing the effect of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the world's response. Lewis' eyewitness accounts are candid and vivid. For example, he recounts tours of hospitals and schools as he explains the dire straits of national health and education sectors, and he describes meetings with diplomats and staff from the UN, World Bank, and IMF as he explains their effect on foreign aid policies. The book is written from an idealistic perspective and, despite the anger and underlying sense of guilt, Lewis remains optimistic. While he was a professional diplomat, his <a href="memoir">memoir</a>-style reflections on specific people, such as <a href="Michel%20Camdessus">Michel Camdessus</a>, <a href="Carol%20Bellamy">Carol Bellamy</a>, and <a href="Thabo%20Mbeki">Thabo Mbeki</a> were called undiplomatic. Despite the book's undiplomatic style, Lewis retained his post as a UN Special Envoy until the term completed in December 2006.

The book was released on October 18 as Lewis began the Massey lecture series in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. The second lecture took place in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a> on the 20th, followed by <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> on the 22nd, <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax</a> on the 26th, and the final one in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> two days later. The series was recorded then aired on <a href="CBC%20Radio%20One">CBC Radio One</a>'s <a href="Ideas%20%28radio%20show%29">"Ideas"</a> between November 7 and 11. At each event Lewis fielded questions from the audience and participated in book signings. The publisher, <a href="House%20of%20Anansi%20Press">House of Anansi Press</a>, was on the last year of its contract with CBC to publish the Massey Lecture series; facing a competitive bid from <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a>, Anansi aggressively promoted "Race Against Time", with Lewis giving interviews to local media and attending receptions. CBC promoted the events nationally. Following an initial printing of 25,000 copies of the book by Anansi, along with the audio CDs produced by CBC Audio, there was a second printing in June 2006 with a new Afterword section.

In the Canadian market, "Race Against Time" debuted at #5 on "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>"'s Nonfiction Bestseller List on October 29. It spent seven weeks at #1, and forty weeks in the top ten. Excerpts from the book were published in "The Globe and Mail", "<a href="The%20Gazette%20%28Montreal%29">The Montreal Gazette</a>", and "<a href="Alternatives%20Journal">Alternatives Journal</a>". At the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Awards in June 2006, the book won non-fiction book of the year and Lewis won the Author of the Year Award. The book was short-listed for the <a href="Nereus%20Writers%27%20Trust%20Non-Fiction%20Prize">Pearson Writers' Trust Prize</a> and the <a href="Trillium%20Book%20Award">Trillium Book Award</a>.

The book was positively received by reviewers. The prose has been called magnificent, lucid, eloquent, and passionate. Lewis' emotional appeal has been called remarkably candid, sincere, powerful, and moving. Connecting the diplomatic and policy-level work of the UN and World Bank with specific effects on the ground in Africa, and describing the problem of orphans, were among the strengths of the book. Lewis' criticisms are constructive and, since they come from such an ardent multilateralist employed by the United Nations, authoritative. One reviewer questioned several of Lewis' potential solutions as contributing to the same system that consistently fails to address its flaws. The same reviewer identified as the book's weakness its political slant, which ignores corrupt or inefficient African governments and the realities of asking corporations and western governments to take steps against their self-interest, like canceling agricultural subsidies in the case of governments and donating profits in the case of businesses. Several reviewers noted that the book could be used as an effective tool to educate about the HIV/AIDS crisis and the plight of the people of sub-Saharan Africa.

An article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", in October 2005, reported on the book's criticism of South Africa's government, singling out President <a href="Thabo%20Mbeki">Thabo Mbeki</a> and Health Minister <a href="Manto%20Tshabalala-Msimang">Manto Tshabalala-Msimang</a>. Lewis claimed that the South African programs were half-hearted and confusing; a spokesperson for the Health Ministry characterized Lewis as a biased and uninformed judge of South Africa's situation, and countered that they are rapidly expanding treatment programs. In August 2006, as a keynote speaker at the <a href="XVI%20International%20AIDS%20Conference%2C%202006">International AIDS Conference</a> in Toronto, Lewis sustained his criticism, calling South Africa's government "still obtuse, dilatory and negligent about rolling out treatment".

Orval Leroy Grove (August 29, 1919 – April 20, 1992) was an American <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> who played for ten seasons in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> with the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>. In 207 career games, Grove pitched 1,176 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a> and posted a <a href="win%20%28baseball%29">win–loss record</a> of 63–73, with 66 <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a>s, 11 <a href="shutout">shutout</a>s, and a 3.78 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA).

The only freshman on the <a href="Proviso%20East%20High%20School">Proviso High School</a> varsity baseball team, Grove's pitching ability attracted the attention of the White Sox. After signing with the team in 1937, Grove moved between the major leagues and <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor leagues</a> for a few seasons until 1943, when he found a solid place in the White Sox's pitching rotation. Grove had a career-year in 1943, finishing the season with career-bests in ERA, wins, and complete games; in 1944, he made his only <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> appearance.

Grove spent four more full seasons with the White Sox, and after pitching one game in 1949, was sent to the <a href="Sacramento%20Solons">Sacramento Solons</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>. After playing four seasons with them, he formally retired from professional baseball. After retirement, he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago while continuing to pitch at the <a href="semi-professional">semi-pro</a> level. In 1992, Grove died at the age of 72.

Grove was born in <a href="West%20Mineral%2C%20Kansas">West Mineral</a>, Kansas, on August 29, 1919, and was raised in <a href="Maywood%2C%20Illinois">Maywood</a>, Illinois. By eighth grade, Grove developed a fondness for baseball and began pitching for the Proviso East High School baseball team. He became the first freshman member of the varsity team in school history. During a high school pitching career of three years, Grove lost only two games and pitched a <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> and two one-hitters. Over the summer of 1937, Grove attracted the attention of Chicago White Sox talent scout Doug Minor, who requested that he "come and workout with the Sox." Later that year, Grove was signed by the White Sox for $2,500 and began his minor league career, foregoing his senior season of high school.

Grove began his career with the <a href="Dallas%20Steers">Dallas Steers</a> of the <a href="Texas%20League">Texas League</a> at the start of the 1938 season. He played with the Steers until management began to replace young players with veterans due to the team's struggling form and moved Grove to the <a href="Longview%20Cannibals">Longview Cannibals</a>. As his first minor league season drew to a close, Grove planned on returning to Proviso High School to complete his education. At the end of the season, the <a href="St.%20Paul%20Saints%23History">St. Paul Saints</a> purchased Grove's contract to replenish their pitching staff.

After the 1939 season had begun, Grove became part of the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20Indians">Oklahoma City Indians</a> of the Texas League; St. Paul did not see much potential in him. Grove played well enough over the course of the season to receive votes for Most Valuable Player, which ultimately went to <a href="Nick%20Cullop%20%28outfielder%29">Nick Cullop</a>. In 1939, Grove had a peculiar game while pitching against the <a href="Tulsa%20Oilers%20%28baseball%29">Tulsa Oilers</a>. Playing in a night game with virtually no light due to storms, Grove did not allow a hit during his time on the mound, but earned the loss because he walked three men in a row, which allowed a run to score. As the <a href="1940%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1940 season</a> began, Grove became a part of the White Sox roster and began his Major League career.

During <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> in 1940, Hall of Fame pitcher <a href="Ted%20Lyons">Ted Lyons</a> said that Grove would have a great career, stating, "They'll never drive that sinker very far." Grove was an official part of the <a href="40-man%20roster">40-man roster</a> as the 1940 season began (teams started rather than ended the season with 40 men at this time), but had not made an appearance after a month on the roster. The White Sox planned to use three rookie pitchers, including Grove, during the final week of May, as they had three <a href="doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">doubleheaders</a> that week. Grove made his Major League debut on May 28, 1940. He pitched in two more games for the White Sox that season before being sent back to Oklahoma City. Grove finished 1940 with six innings of major league work over three games, allowing two <a href="earned%20run">earned run</a>s. The highlight of Grove's 1940 season came on August 11 against the Oilers; he pitched a complete game that lasted 12 innings, winning 1–0 against <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Dizzy%20Dean">Dizzy Dean</a>. Grove finished the minor league season with nine wins and eight losses, but the team saw issues with his control, and as a result he spent most of the next season in the minor leagues.

In 1941, Grove played two games for the White Sox, pitching seven innings and allowing eight runs during the two outings. He spent the start of the 1941 season at Oklahoma City, though on May 19 he was sent to the <a href="Shreveport%20Sports">Shreveport Sports</a> of the Texas League, where he spent the rest of the season. Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17–7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury late in the season, which he did not think much of at the time. In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri.

The following season, Grove was provided an opportunity to be a <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> for the White Sox. Over the course of the season, he started eight games and played in four more en route to a 4–6 record and a 5.16 ERA. In the middle of July, Dr. Philip Kruescher discovered that Grove had torn cartilage in his left knee, a result of the same injury which caused him problems for most of the season and the previous <a href="off-season">off-season</a>. Grove was scheduled for knee surgery, which necessitated two months of recovery, effectively ending his season. Issues with his knee drew concern both during and after the season. Dr. Kruescher stated that Grove had a "1 in 100" chance of playing again, but the surgery was a success, and by season's end Grove was able to test the knee and do light workouts. Complications arose shortly thereafter as an <a href="abscess">abscess</a> developed on the back of his knee, prompting another operation in December to correct the problem.

As the <a href="1943%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1943 season</a> began, the White Sox held strong doubts about Grove's status as a pitcher. They were so doubtful of his recovery from knee surgery that Grove was signed to a $1 contract until he could prove that his playing ability was back on par with the abilities of the other White Sox pitchers. After Grove proved himself in spring training, manager <a href="Jimmy%20Dykes">Jimmy Dykes</a> gave him his first major test of the season against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> in relief of <a href="Eddie%20Smith%20%28baseball%29">Eddie Smith</a>. He won the game in extra innings, and was placed in the starting rotation. In 1943, Grove had to deal with issues related to World War II and the selective service. He was originally classified as <a href="Selective%20Service%20System%23Classifications">3-A</a>, meaning that registration was deferred due to hardship to dependents, but was ordered to take the selective service screening examination in Cleveland in mid-May. After the examination, Grove was classified as 4-F, making him ineligible for military service, which meant that he could continue his baseball career.

Grove took advantage of his place in Chicago's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive decisions to start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees, which he lost as the result of a <a href="balk">balk</a>. At the time, Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive decisions to start a season. The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was <a href="Lefty%20Williams">Lefty Williams</a> in 1917, and the only one to do it since Grove was <a href="LaMarr%20Hoyt">LaMarr Hoyt</a> in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Yankees, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter when <a href="Joe%20Gordon">Joe Gordon</a> came up to bat. Gordon hit a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a> to left field that was fair by inches, ending Grove's closest bid for a Major League no-hitter. Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete games (18). He led the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team's staff. Grove's personal life improved along with his career. On January 8, 1944, he married Catherine Sloan, having met her at a party thrown for the White Sox by her father, Francis Sloan, a year and a half earlier.

Grove started the <a href="1944%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1944 season</a> with an interesting honor: he was assigned to the 4-F All-Star team, a group of 25 major league players who were the best of those exempt from military service. Grove was given the job of being the <a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a> starting pitcher for the White Sox. He pitched the first game of the season against the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> and their starting pitcher, <a href="Al%20Smith%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Al Smith</a>, on April 19, 1944, and won 3–1. Grove also managed to shut out the Yankees on May 18; it was the first time the Yankees had not scored a run in 1944. By mid-season, Grove had seven wins, six losses, five complete games, and a 3.40 ERA. Because of these statistics, he was selected to the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> All-Star team, his first and only career appearance. Five American League pitchers pitched in the All-Star Game on July 11, although Grove was one of the four on the roster who did not; therefore, his lone All-Star appearance was indeed only an appearance. During the second half of the season, Grove performed well at <a href="Comiskey%20Park">Comiskey Park</a>, but struggled on the road, at one point losing five straight games despite good run support from the White Sox. Grove finished the season with 14 wins, 15 losses, an ERA of 3.72, two shutouts, and a career best of nearly 235 innings pitched.

There was a sense of closure for Grove before the beginning of the <a href="1945%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1945 season</a>, as he was awarded $310 ($ today) in damages for the auto accident in 1941. He held out for a new contract in the off-season, and finally signed with the White Sox a couple weeks before the beginning of the season after becoming the last remaining holdout. Grove was the workhorse of the White Sox, leading the team in games pitched (33) and started (30), while remaining the youngest pitcher on the roster. He finished the season with 217 pitched innings, a career best four shutouts, a 14–12 record, and a 3.44 ERA.

The <a href="1946%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1946 season</a> saw Grove persist as a stable part of the White Sox pitching rotation. He pitched in 33 games during the season, second to <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closer</a> <a href="Earl%20Caldwell">Earl Caldwell</a>, and started in 26, second to <a href="Ed%20Lopat">Ed Lopat</a>'s 29. His best outing of the season occurred on August 3 against the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a>. Grove pitched a complete game and threw to the minimum 27 batters, allowing three hits and a walk, all of which were negated by <a href="double%20play">double play</a>s. He finished the season with more losses than wins because he was eager to succeed and was trying too hard, and because of this the coaching staff planned to make Grove into "as good a pitcher most of the time as he is some of the time". At the end of the 1946 season, Grove had eight wins and 13 losses, a 3.02 ERA, 10 complete games, and a league-leading 10 <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>es.

During the off-season, while preparations were underway for the <a href="1947%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1947 season</a>, Grove was the subject of trade discussions. Most notably, White Sox manager Ted Lyons and Cleveland Indians president <a href="Bill%20Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> discussed trading him for Indians pitcher <a href="Steve%20Gromek">Steve Gromek</a>, but the deal was nixed when they could not come to an agreement. As the season began, Grove remained part of the rotation, which was led by Lopat and included <a href="Joe%20Haynes%20%28baseball%29">Joe Haynes</a> and <a href="Frank%20Papish">Frank Papish</a>. While Grove started off the season well, he struggled through the middle of the year, going from May 18 to August 2 without winning a game. As a result, he was benched, and finished the season with 19 starts in 25 pitching appearances. For the first time, Grove finished a full season with an ERA above 4.00. He ended the season with six wins, eight losses, a 4.44 ERA, and six complete games. Grove spent the off-season working in the men's furnishings department of <a href="Henry%20C.%20Lytton">Henry C. Lytton</a>'s department store in Chicago.

In the <a href="1948%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1948 season</a>, the White Sox faced difficult decisions regarding their pitching staff and starting rotation. In the midst of Caldwell's departure and Papish's absence for most of the preseason, Grove remained a starter heading into the season, having pitched decently during spring training. In his final exhibition matchup of the season against <a href="Johnny%20Schmitz">Johnny Schmitz</a>, Grove pitched the full nine innings and the White Sox defeated the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> 1–0, making Grove the only White Sox pitcher to throw a complete game during the preseason. By the end of May, Grove was the lone White Sox pitcher with a complete game through the first several weeks of the season. However, Grove eventually lost his starting job, and by the end of the season, he had two wins, 10 losses, a 6.16 ERA, and had started 11 games out of 32 total pitching appearances.

As the <a href="1949%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20season">1949 season</a> began, Grove was again the subject of trade rumors. The <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> agreed to trade an outfielder, presumably <a href="Don%20Lund">Don Lund</a> or <a href="Jimmy%20Outlaw">Jimmy Outlaw</a>, in exchange for Grove, although the Tigers denied the existence of such a deal, stating "We need pitching, but I don't think Grove would help us." Grove pitched one game during the season on April 27, 1949, allowing four runs in two-thirds of an inning. In his one appearance against the Indians, he hit <a href="Lou%20Boudreau">Lou Boudreau</a> with a pitch, which prompted concern until X-rays revealed Boudreau's left elbow was only bruised.

Shortly afterward, Grove was demoted to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League, having pitched his final major league game. During his inaugural season at Sacramento, he was part of a pitching quartet that included <a href="Ken%20Holcombe">Ken Holcombe</a>, <a href="Bob%20Gillespie">Bob Gillespie</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Dasso">Frank Dasso</a>, and was declared by "Sporting News" sportswriter John B. Old as "the best any Coast League club ever had." Over the course of the next three seasons, Grove continued to pitch for the Solons. He was one of the workhorses of the 1950 squad, finishing the season with 17 victories.

His contract with the Solons promised him part of the purchase price if he was sold to the majors. When this did not occur, he considered quitting baseball and devoting himself full-time to his uncle's trucking business. However, Grove continued to play, and pitched 159 innings in 1951, compiling an 8–9 record. There was talk of his retiring in the off-season; however, Grove ended up playing part of the 1952 season, making his season debut on June 10 and playing for the rest of the season. After the season ended, Grove was traded to the <a href="Portland%20Beavers">Portland Beavers</a>, and refused to report, choosing instead to pitch at the semi-pro level. Grove stated, "I'm now pitching for Earl Smith Motors Pontiac sales service", signaling the end of his professional baseball career.

After his retirement from baseball, Grove continued to work with his uncle. His legacy lived on in his nephew, Wayne Grove. While playing for the Bellwood Lions of the Chicago Little League, Wayne pitched a no-hitter and struck out 15, and narrowly missed a perfect game when a runner got on base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning. Despite an unimpressive Major League career, Grove earned a few votes for induction into the Hall of Fame, receiving five votes in the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201958">1958 balloting</a> (1.9% of the required votes needed) and seven in the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201960">1960 balloting</a> (2.6% of the required votes needed).

Grove had four children and four grandchildren, and later was the co-owner of a car wash in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento</a>, California for 20 years. He became close friends with Joe Gordon, the player who broke up Grove's no-hitter, after moving to Sacramento. Grove died in <a href="Carmichael%2C%20California">Carmichael</a>, California on April 20, 1992, and is buried alongside his wife, Catherine.

Red River Trails

The Red River Trails were a network of <a href="Red%20River%20ox%20cart">ox cart</a> routes connecting the <a href="Red%20River%20Colony">Red River Colony</a> (the "Selkirk Settlement") and <a href="Fort%20Garry">Fort Garry</a> in <a href="Canada%20under%20British%20Imperial%20control%20%281764-1867%29">British North America</a> with the head of navigation on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> in the United States. These trade routes ran from the location of present-day <a href="Winnipeg%2C%20Manitoba">Winnipeg</a> in the <a href="Canadian%20province">Canadian province</a> of <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> across the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–United States border</a>, and thence by a variety of routes through what is now the eastern part of <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> and western and central <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> to <a href="Mendota%2C%20Minnesota">Mendota</a> and <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul</a>, Minnesota on the Mississippi.

Travellers began to use the trails by the 1820s, with the heaviest use from the 1840s to the early 1870s, when they were superseded by railways. Until then, these cartways provided the most efficient means of transportation between the isolated <a href="Red%20River%20Colony">Red River Colony</a> and the outside world. They gave the Selkirk colonists and their neighbours, the people, an outlet for their <a href="fur%20trade">furs</a> and a source of supplies other than the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, which was unable to enforce its monopoly in the face of the competition that used the trails.

Free traders, independent of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal "<a href="entrep%C3%B4t">entrepôt</a>" and link to the outside world for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along the trails connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada to the west of the rugged barrier known as the <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a>. For a time, this cross-border trade even threatened Canada's control of its western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a>s both north and south of the border, and the transportation corridor through which the trails once ran declined in importance. That corridor has now seen a resurgence of traffic, carried by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.

In 1812, <a href="Thomas%20Douglas%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Selkirk">Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk</a>, started a colony of settlers in <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a> where the <a href="Assiniboine%20River">Assiniboine River</a> joins the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20North">Red River</a> at the site of modern Winnipeg. Although fur posts were scattered throughout the Canadian northwest, and settlements of <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>rs and <a href="bison">bison</a> hunters were located in the vicinity of Selkirk's establishment, this colony was the only agricultural settlement between <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> and the Pacific Ocean. Isolated by geology behind the rugged <a href="Canadian%20Shield">Canadian Shield</a> and many hundreds of miles of wilderness, settlers and their neighbours had access to outside markets and sources of supply only by two water routes.

The first, maintained by the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> (in which Lord Selkirk was a principal investor), was a sea route from Great Britain to <a href="York%20Factory">York Factory</a> on <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a>, then up a chain of rivers and lakes to the colony, 780 miles (1250 km) from salt water to the Assiniboine. The alternative was the historic route of the rival <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a>'s voyageurs from <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> through <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> to <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Ontario">Fort William</a> on <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>. Above Superior, this route followed rivers and lakes to <a href="Lac%20La%20Croix%20First%20Nation">Lac la Croix</a> and west along the international border through <a href="Lake%20of%20the%20Woods">Lake of the Woods</a> to <a href="Rat%20Portage">Rat Portage</a>, and then down the <a href="Winnipeg%20River">Winnipeg River</a> to the Red. The distance from the Selkirk settlement to Lake Superior at Fort William was about 500 miles (800 km), but Lake Superior was only the start of a lengthy journey to Montreal where furs and supplies would be transshipped to and from Europe.

Neither of these routes was suitable for heavy freight. Lighter cargoes were carried in <a href="York%20boat">York boat</a>s to Hudson Bay or in canoes on the border route. Both routes required navigation of large and hazardous lakes, shallow and rapid-strewn rivers, and swampy creeks and bogs, connected by numerous portages where both cargo and watercraft had to be carried on men's backs.

But geology also provided an alternate route, albeit across foreign territory. The valleys of the Red and <a href="Minnesota%20River">Minnesota River</a>s lay in the beds of <a href="Glacial%20Lake%20Agassiz">Glacial Lake Agassiz</a> and its prehistoric outlet <a href="Glacial%20River%20Warren">Glacial River Warren</a>; the lands exposed when these bodies of water receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the <a href="Traverse%20Gap">Traverse Gap</a>, only a mile (1.6  km) of land separated the <a href="Bois%20des%20Sioux%20River">Bois des Sioux River</a>, a source stream of the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the <a href="Little%20Minnesota%20River">Little Minnesota River</a>, a source stream of the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>). The valley floors and uplands of the watercourses along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both as a source of supplies and an (illegal) outlet for their furs.

The rich fur areas along the upper Mississippi, Minnesota, <a href="Des%20Moines%20River">Des Moines</a>, and <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a>s, otherwise occupied by peoples of the <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a>, were exploited by independent fur traders operating from <a href="Prairie%20du%20Chien%2C%20Wisconsin">Prairie du Chien</a>, Wisconsin in the late eighteenth century. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, these traders established fur posts in the Minnesota River valley at <a href="Lake%20Traverse">Lake Traverse</a>, <a href="Big%20Stone%20Lake">Big Stone Lake</a>, <a href="Lac%20qui%20Parle">Lac qui Parle</a>, and <a href="Traverse%20des%20Sioux">Traverse des Sioux</a>. The large fur companies also built posts, including the North West Company's stations at <a href="Pembina%2C%20North%20Dakota">Pembina</a> and <a href="Walhalla%2C%20North%20Dakota">St. Joseph</a> in the valley of the Red River. The paths between these posts became parts of the first of the Red River Trails.

In 1815, 1822, and 1823, cattle were herded to the Red River Colony from Missouri by a route up the Des Moines River Valley to the Minnesota River, across the divide, then down the Red River to the Selkirk settlement. In 1819, following a devastating plague of locusts which left the colonists with insufficient seed even to plant a crop, an expedition was sent by snowshoe to purchase seed at Prairie du Chien. It returned by <a href="flatboat">flatboat</a> up the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers and down the Red River, arriving back at the settlement in the summer of 1820. In 1821, five dissatisfied settler families left the colony for <a href="Fort%20Snelling">Fort Snelling</a>, the forerunners of later tides of migration up and down the valley between the two nations. Two years later in 1823, Major <a href="Stephen%20Harriman%20Long">Stephen Harriman Long</a> was the first official U.S. representative to reach Pembina; his expedition came by way of the Minnesota and Red Rivers. These early expeditions on the watersheds of these two streams were among the earliest known through trips on the route of the first Red River Trail.

The West Plains Trail had originated with Native Americans, and before the ox cart traffic it connected the fur-<a href="trading%20post">trading post</a>s of the <a href="Columbia%20Fur%20Company">Columbia Fur Company</a>. In fact, that company introduced the <a href="Red%20River%20ox%20cart">Red River ox cart</a> to haul its furs and goods. It also developed the trails, and by the early 1830s, an expedition from the Selkirk settlement driving a flock of sheep from Kentucky to the Assiniboine found the trail to be well-marked.

From the Red River Settlement, the trail went south upstream along the Red River's west bank to Pembina, just across the international border. Pembina had been a fur-trading post since the last decade of the eighteenth century. From there, some traffic continued south along the river, but most cart trains went west along the <a href="Pembina%20River%20%28North%20Dakota%29">Pembina River</a> to <a href="Walhalla%2C%20North%20Dakota">St. Joseph</a> near the border and then south, or else cut the corner to the southwest in order to intercept the southbound trail from St. Joseph. This north-south trail paralleled the Red River about thirty miles (50 km) to the west. By staying on the uplands west of the Red River, this route avoided crossing the tributaries of that river near their confluences with the Red, and also kept out of the swampy, flood-prone, and mosquito-ridden bottomlands in the lakebed of Glacial Lake Agassiz which the river drained.
In what is now southeastern <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>, the trail veered to the south-southeast to close with the Red River at <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Minnesota">Georgetown</a>, <a href="Fort%20Abercrombie">Fort Abercrombie</a>, and <a href="Breckenridge%2C%20Minnesota">Breckenridge</a>, Minnesota, all of which came into existence in consequence of the passing cart traffic. From Breckenridge, the trail continued upstream along the east bank of the Red and <a href="Bois%20des%20Sioux%20River">Bois des Sioux River</a>s to the continental divide at Lake Traverse. Some traffic went along the lakeshore through the <a href="Traverse%20Gap">Traverse Gap</a> on the continental divide, then down either side of Big Stone Lake, source of the Minnesota River, while other carters took a short cut directly south from the Bois des Sioux across the open prairie through modern <a href="Graceville%2C%20Minnesota">Graceville</a>, Minnesota thereby avoiding the wet country in the Traverse Gap.

The trail continued on intertwined routes down both sides of the valley of the Minnesota River past fur posts at <a href="Lac%20qui%20Parle%20State%20Park">Lac qui Parle</a> and downstream locations, and the <a href="Upper%20Sioux%20Agency%20State%20Park">Upper Sioux</a> and <a href="Lower%20Sioux%20Agency">Lower Sioux Indian Agencies</a> and <a href="Fort%20Ridgely">Fort Ridgely</a>, all established in the 1850s. From Fort Ridgely, the trail struck across the open prairie to the Minnesota River at <a href="Traverse%20des%20Sioux">Traverse des Sioux</a> near modern-day <a href="St.%20Peter%2C%20Minnesota">St. Peter</a>, Minnesota, where the furs and goods were, at first, usually transshipped to flatboats. In later years, most cart trains crossed to the east bank and proceeded northeast along the wooded river bottoms and uplands to <a href="Fort%20Snelling">Fort Snelling</a> or Mendota, where the Minnesota River joined the Mississippi. From there furs were shipped down the Mississippi River to Saint Louis and other markets.

Sporadic at first, trade between Fort Garry and the Mississippi became more regular in 1835, when a caravan of traders from the Red River came to Mendota. The efforts of the Hudson's Bay Company to enforce its monopoly only induced the fur traders to avoid the company's jurisdiction by moving across the border to the United States. These included <a href="Norman%20Kittson">Norman Kittson</a> whose enormous fur-trading and shipping enterprise along the West Plains Trail started with one six-cart train in 1844. In later years, trains consisting of hundreds of ox carts were sent from Kittson's post at Pembina, just inside U.S. territory and safely outside the reach of the Hudson's Bay Company. While some of this fur traffic was shifted to other routes in 1854, the forts, missions, Indian agencies, and remaining through traffic to Fort Garry kept the trails busy, and they were improved in the 1850s and supplemented by military roads.

The West Plains Trail, although relatively level, went by a lengthy route through the lands of the <a href="Sioux">Dakota</a> people, and the shorter East Plains Trail also skirted Dakota land. The Dakota were the enemy of the <a href="Ojibwa">Ojibwa</a>, to whom the carters were related by blood and marriage. These tensions led to conflicts. One such bloody confrontation in the summer of 1844 (caused by an attack by carters on Dakota hunters) occurred when that year's expedition of free traders were in <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul</a>. This meant that they could not safely return by the normal route. The traders therefore struck northwest up the Mississippi to <a href="Old%20Crow%20Wing%2C%20Minnesota">Crow Wing</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Crow%20Wing%20River">Crow Wing River</a>, west up that river and across the <a href="height%20of%20land">height of land</a> to the fur post at <a href="Otter%20Tail%20Lake">Otter Tail Lake</a>, then northwest across the prairie to a crossing of the Red River near its confluence with the <a href="Forest%20River%20%28North%20Dakota%29">Forest River</a>. The next year, a southbound party followed its tracks, and by the year after (1846), the final route had been well-established inland from the Red River bottomlands. This trail was known as the Woods or Crow Wing Trail; it was also known locally as the Saint Paul Trail and Pembina Trail.
As the first of these names indicates, the path was partially wooded, as its southern reaches crossed the transition zone between the western prairies and eastern woodland. From Fort Garry, southbound cart trains followed the eastern edge of the Red River's Great Plains, crossing the <a href="Roseau%20River%20%28Manitoba%29">Roseau River</a> and the international border. In Minnesota, the trail was joined by a route coming from Pembina to the northwest, and continued south on a level prairie in the former lakebed of prehistoric Lake Agassiz. It ascended to and followed a firm gravelly ridge which was once among the higher beaches or strandlines of that ancient lake, forded the <a href="Red%20Lake%20River">Red Lake River</a> at the <a href="Old%20Crossing">Old Crossing</a> near modern <a href="Huot%2C%20Minnesota">Huot</a>, and angled south by southeast to the fur post at <a href="White%20Earth%2C%20Minnesota">White Earth</a>. At Otter Tail Lake, the route left the plains and turned east into a forest in the <a href="Leaf%20Mountains">Leaf Mountains</a> on the continental divide. Taking a difficult but scenic path east through the woods, the trail crossed the Mississippi River at <a href="Old%20Crow%20Wing">Old Crow Wing</a>. It then went south down the east bank of that river on a smooth and open glacial <a href="outwash">outwash</a> sandplain to <a href="Sauk%20Rapids%2C%20Minnesota">Sauk Rapids</a> and <a href="St.%20Cloud%2C%20Minnesota">East Saint Cloud</a>.

The final lap of the trail to Saint Paul, which had replaced Mendota as the principal "<a href="entrep%C3%B4t">entrepôt</a>" for the cart trade, continued along the sandplain on the east bank of the Mississippi. This route ran within a few miles of the river to <a href="Saint%20Anthony%20Falls">Saint Anthony Falls</a> and the community of that name which was growing on the east bank of the Mississippi. The trail then left the river and crossed open country to Saint Paul. The carters camped on the uplands west of the steamboat landing during the interval between their arrival with the furs and their return to the north with supplies and trade goods.

Inferior in terrain to other routes, the Woods Trail was superior in safety, as it was well within the lands of the Ojibwa. It was less well used during times of relative calm. In the late 1850s, its utility was increased by improvements made by the U.S. Army, which straightened and improved the winding ox path through the woods along the Leaf and Crow Wing Rivers, and also replaced the old trail along the Mississippi River between <a href="Fort%20Ripley%2C%20Minnesota">Fort Ripley</a> (near Crow Wing) and Sauk Rapids with a military road.

The Middle or East Plains Trail also came into common use in the 1840s. Shorter than the competing West Plain Trail, it became the route of the large cart trains originating from Pembina when well-known trader <a href="Henry%20Hastings%20Sibley">Henry Sibley</a> retired from the fur trade in 1854. His successor and former partner Norman Kittson moved their company's cart trains from the West Plains Trail in the Minnesota River valley to the East Plains route.

The East Plains Trail followed the older routes of the West Plains Trail from Pembina to Breckenridge, Minnesota, then struck east by a variety of routes out of the Red River Valley across the upper valleys of the <a href="Pomme%20de%20Terre%20River%20%28Minnesota%29">Pomme de Terre</a> and <a href="Chippewa%20River%20%28Minnesota%29">Chippewa Rivers</a> (tributaries of the Minnesota River), to <a href="St.%20Cloud%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Cloud</a> and <a href="Sauk%20Rapids%2C%20Minnesota">Sauk Rapids</a> on the Upper Mississippi. Soon however, a branch was added to connect the East Plains Trail with the Woods Trail. This link skirted the west slope of the Leaf Mountains and joined the East Plains routes at <a href="Elbow%20Lake%2C%20Grant%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Elbow Lake</a> or near the <a href="Otter%20Tail%20River">Otter Tail River</a>. At times, this eastern connection may have been the better-travelled of the two variants.

At Saint Cloud, the furs of some of the cart brigades were transshipped to river craft on the Mississippi, which operated to Saint Anthony Falls at <a href="Minneapolis%2C%20Minnesota">Minneapolis</a>. Other cart trains crossed the Mississippi and travelled on to Saint Paul on a route shared with the Woods Trail.

Over most of its route, the East Plains Trail went through a post-glacial landscape of lakes, moraines, and drumlins, with beautiful scenery and difficult swamps. As the area became settled during Minnesota's territorial and early statehood days, the routes were improved, <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> service was instituted, towns were established, and permanent settlement began.

The trails were first used to obtain seed and supplies for the Selkirk colony. They soon became <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a>s for local fur traders, and in the 1830s began to be heavily used by American fur traders operating just south of the international border. The Americans acquired furs from fur traders in British North America who were evading the Hudson's Bay Company monopoly on trade within its chartered domain.

The settlement at Fort Garry was isolated and at the end of a water and land route from York Factory, which was served by only one or two ships each year. Orders from Britain had to be placed a year in advance. But from Saint Paul, the settlers could obtain staples and other goods in the span of a single summer. In the face of these relative inconveniences and the economy of shipping over the trails, the Hudson's Bay Company was unable to compel all trade to go by way of York Factory on Hudson Bay, and by 1850 the company's monopoly was broken. In fact, the company itself all but abandoned the York Factory route for heavy trade in 1857, and instead shipped its own traffic in bond through the United States and over the Red River Trails.

The principal export from the Red River settlements was fur, but as the colony passed from a subsistence economy to one producing more than could be consumed locally the agricultural surplus was also sent south by ox cart. The imports were more varied; originally they were seed, spices, and other staples, liquor, tools, implements, and hardware. In midcentury the <a href="American%20Bison">buffalo</a> herds declined, and traffic in furs began to be replaced by the produce and needs of settlers. As settlement developed the trails became a "common carrier" for all manner of goods that could be carried by ox cart, including lamps and coal oil to burn in them, fine cloth, books, general merchandise, champagne, sheet-metal stoves, disassembled farm machinery and at least one piano, and a printing press and other accoutrements for the first newspaper in the Fort Garry region.

The typical carters were descended from French of the fur trade and their <a href="Ojibway">Ojibway</a> spouses. Their conveyance was the Red River ox cart, a simple vehicle derived either from the two-wheeled used in French Canada, or from Scottish carts. From 1801 on, this cart was modified so that it was made solely from local materials. It contained no iron at all. Instead it was constructed entirely of wood and animal hide. Two twelve-foot-long parallel oak shafts or "trams" bracketed the draft animal in front and formed the frame of the cart to the rear. Cross-pieces held the floorboards, while front, side and rear boards or rails enclosed the box. These wooden pieces were joined by <a href="Mortise%20and%20tenon">mortices and tenons</a>. The axle was also made of seasoned oak. It was lashed to the cart by strips of wet <a href="American%20Bison">bison</a> hide known by its <a href="Cree">Cree</a> name of "shaganappi", which shrank and tightened as they dried. The axles connected two spoked wheels, five or six feet in diameter, which were "dished" or in the form of a shallow cone, the apex of which was at the hubs, which were inboard of the rims. The carts were originally drawn by small horses obtained from the First Nations. After cattle were brought to the colony in the 1820s, oxen were used to haul the carts. They were preferred because of their strength, endurance, and cloven hooves which spread their weight in swampy areas.

The cart, constructed of native materials, could easily be repaired. A supply of shaganappi and wood was carried as a cart could break a half-dozen axles in a one-way trip. The axles were unlubricated, as grease would capture dust which would act as sandpaper and immobilize the cart. The resultant squeal sounded like an untuned violin, giving it the sobriquet of "the North West fiddle". One visitor wrote that "a den of wild beasts cannot be compared with its hideousness". The noise was audible for miles. The carts were completely unsprung, and only their flexible construction cushioned the shocks transmitted from the humps and hollows of the trail.

Southbound, the carts were loaded with fur, packed into the 90-pound (40 kg) bundles known in the fur trade as "". A cart could handle up to 800–1,000 pounds (360–450 kg). On their return the traders carried staples, trade goods, and manufactured goods unavailable at Fort Garry. In both directions, the cargo was covered with hide or canvas. The carts were lashed together in brigades of ten carts, with three drivers and an overseer. These brigades could join in trains up to two miles (three km) in length. Carts numbering in the low hundreds annually used the trails in the 1840s, many hundreds in the 1850s, and thousands in the late 1860s. These cart trains travelled about two miles (three km) an hour, and about twenty miles (thirty km) in a day.
After breaking camp in the morning, the carters set out across the prairie; transits of the unprotected open prairie between places of refuge were known as "". Streams often had to be forded; where the water was too deep, the carts were unloaded, the wheels were taken off and lashed together or affixed under the cart, the assemblage was covered with hide to form a hull, and the makeshift craft was reloaded and floated across. The traders endeavoured to ford a stream at the end of the day rather than start the next day with the crossing, to allow time to dry out overnight.

Streamside camps offered wood, water, and some protection from the hazards of open land. The prairie could be dangerous in time of native unrest, and trade ceased entirely for a time during the <a href="Dakota%20War%20of%201862">Dakota War of 1862</a>. Prairie fires, driven by winds, were a risk in dry spells. Wet weather turned rivers into torrents, approaches to streams into bogs, and worn paths into morasses. Blizzards could strand traders and threaten them with starvation. Insects harassed both the traders and their draft animals, depriving them of sleep and weakening them.

There were compensations. Game was plentiful and the traders rarely lacked fresh meat. Some saw in the seemingly boundless prairies a colourful ocean of grass, and summer storms could be awe-inspiring, although dangerous. While the prairie had its own grandeur, after weeks of travel over treeless <a href="steppe">steppe</a> the rivers, lakes, and woods of central Minnesota were a welcome relief.

After six or so weeks on the trail, the brigades reached Saint Paul. There the carters camped on the bluff above the town growing on the riverfront. Not all was harmonious. To the locals, the swarthy-complected carters up on the hill had a "devil-may-care" aspect, with their "curious commingling of civilized garments and barbaric adornments". One trader from the north called his host city "a wretched little village" where "drinking whisky seems to occupy at least half the time of the worth[y] citizens", while the rest were "employed in cheating each other or imposing upon strangers." The economic benefits of trade, and the separation of the carters' camp from the village below, may have helped keep relations civil. After about three weeks of trading, the "wild" carters from the north, now laden with goods, took their leave of the "den of blackguards" that was Saint Paul, returning to what they felt was a more civilized world. Their erstwhile hosts, on the other hand, thought their visitors were returning to an uncivilized and frozen wilderness.

At times, some ox cart trains did not go all the way through, but were supplemented by river craft. First <a href="flatboat">flatboat</a>s and then shallow-draft steamboats ascended the Minnesota River to Traverse des Sioux and upstream points, where they were met by cart brigades travelling the West Plains Trail. In 1851, weekly steamboat service on the Mississippi began between Saint Anthony Falls and Sauk Rapids on the Middle and Woods trails. In 1859, steamboat machinery was carried overland to the Red River where a boat was built, but service was intermittent. The Dakota War of 1862 and the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> delayed further improvements.

After the Civil War, the age of steam came to the region. After Ojibwe title to the Red River Valley had been extinguished on the United States side of the Canada–United States border by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Old%20Crossing">Treaty of Old Crossing</a> in 1863, steamboat service was revived on the Red River, and railways were built west from Saint Paul and <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth</a>, Minnesota on Lake Superior. A branch of the <a href="St.%20Paul%20and%20Pacific%20Railroad">St. Paul and Pacific Railroad</a> reached St. Cloud in 1866. Its mainline reached <a href="Willmar">Willmar</a> in 1869 and <a href="Benson%2C%20Minnesota">Benson</a>, Minnesota the following year. Each end-of-track town in its turn became the terminus for many of the cart trains. In 1871, the railway reached the Red River at Breckenridge, where revived steamboat service carried the traffic the rest of way to Fort Garry. The long trains of carts drawn by oxen were replaced by railway trains powered by steam, and the trails reverted to nature.

A few traces of the vanished trails still exist. Some local roads follow their routes; depressions in the landscape show where thousands of carts once passed, and even after more than a century of winters and springs, freezing and thawing the land, there are still places where soils remain compacted and resistant to the plow. Some of these subtle artifacts are marked or are visible to those with discerning eyes, but in most places the trails have been obliterated. Their locations are noted at parks and wayside signs, and trail locations near <a href="Baxter%2C%20Minnesota">Baxter</a>, <a href="St.%20Hilaire%2C%20Minnesota">St. Hilaire</a>, and <a href="West%20Union%2C%20Minnesota">West Union</a>, Minnesota are recognized on the U.S. <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

The Red River Trails are less well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in folklore as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with the exception of the Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention is due to the fact they did not lead to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.

The trails nevertheless were instrumental in the development of central North America. Traffic over the West Plains Trail sustained the Selkirk Settlement in its early years. The trails also gave settlers of that colony and their neighbours a route for migration as well as a highway for trade that was not dependent on the Hudson's Bay Company. As usage grew, old fur trading posts became settlements and new communities were established along the cart routes. The trails pioneered by the fur brigades accelerated development of Minnesota and North Dakota, and facilitated settlement of the Canadian northwest.

The trails had profound political effects during a time of Anglo-American tension. Both Britain and the U.S. were concerned about each other's cross-border influences. Born out of commercial needs and located by the dictates of geography, the trails helped create and contribute to these international influences and the tensions which resulted. The United States sent military expeditions along the route of the trails to assert national interests in the face of the continued British presence in the northwestern fur posts on soil which the U.S. claimed. The Americans were also concerned about the establishment of Lord Selkirk's colony as well as British claims to the Red River Valley. Finally the U.S. wanted to curtail Britain's attempts to get access to the Mississippi, access implicit in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> ending the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a>, and which Britain sought into the nineteenth century. The United States' assertion of dominion over its new territories parried and reversed the British domination of the fur trade in the upper Mississippi valley, which had continued for decades after the Revolutionary War settlement which had assigned those territories to the new nation.
Later, the economic dependence of the Selkirk Settlement and the Canadian northwest on the Red River trade routes to U.S. markets came to pose a threat to British and Canadian control of their territory. At a time when a sense of Canadian nationality was tenuous in the northwest, that region relied on the Red River Trails and its successor steamboat and rail lines as an outlet for its products and a source of supplies. An active <a href="Manifest%20Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a> faction in Minnesota sought to exploit these commercial ties as a means of acquiring northwestern Canada for the United States. This pressure prompted Canada to take over the Hudson's Bay Company territory in return for monetary and land compensation. It contributed to <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a> and the establishment of Manitoba. It also led to the decision that there should be an all-Canada route for the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>. Not until completion of that line in 1885 did Manitoba and the northwest finally have reliable and efficient access to eastern Canada by a route located entirely on Canadian soil.

Today, the international border is firmly established and peaceful; there is a greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.

Siberian accentor

The Siberian accentor ("Prunella montanella") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> that breeds in northern Russia from the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> eastwards across <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in Korea and eastern China, with rare occurrences in western Europe and northwestern North America. Its typical breeding habitat is <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> forests and open <a href="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> woodland, often close to water, although it also occurs in mountains and <a href="spruce">spruce</a> <a href="taiga">taiga</a>. It inhabits bushes and shrubs in winter, frequently near streams, but may also be found in dry grassland and woods

The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts and wings, with bright chestnut streaking on its back and a greyish-brown rump and tail. The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> ("eyebrow"). All plumages are quite similar. The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation.

Breeding over a huge area, the Siberian accentor has a large and apparently stable population. It is therefore evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), although, as a northern breeding species, it may be affected by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> in the long term. October and November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of this species into western Europe, reaching as far as the United Kingdom.

The <a href="accentor">accentor</a>s are a family of small ground-living <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a> birds, most of which are found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the <a href="dunnock">dunnock</a> is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, "Prunella", but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the <a href="Black-throated%20accentor">black-throated</a>, <a href="Brown%20accentor">brown</a>, <a href="Kozlov%27s%20accentor">Kozlov's</a>, <a href="Radde%27s%20accentor">Radde's</a> and <a href="Arabian%20accentor">Arabian accentor</a>s. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar <a href="Japanese%20accentor">Japanese accentor</a>.

On his return from his pioneering expedition to central and eastern Russia in 1768–1774, the Russian-based German zoologist <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a> formally described the Siberian accentor in 1776 as "Motacilla montanella". The accentors were moved to their current genus by French ornithologist <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> in 1816.

The Siberian accentor has two subspecies:
"Accentor" comes from the old scientific name for the Alpine accentor, "Accentor collaris". It derives from <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> and means "sing with another" (ad + cantor). The genus name "Prunella" is from the German "Braunelle", "dunnock", a diminutive of "braun", "brown", and the specific "montanella" is a diminutive of <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "montanus", "mountain".

The Siberian accentor is on average long and weighs . The adult of the nominate race has brown upperparts and wings, with bright chestnut streaking on its back and a greyish-brown rump and tail. There are two narrow whitish bars on the folded wings. The head has a dark brown crown, a long, wide pale yellow supercilium, a blackish patch behind the eye and grey sides to the neck. The underparts are <a href="ochre">ochre</a> yellow, becoming strongly buff on the flanks and greyish on the lower belly. There are rich chestnut streaks on the sides of the breast and the flanks. The <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is a warm red-brown, the sharply pointed bill is dark and the legs are reddish.

All plumages are similar. The female has slightly duller underparts with weaker streaking, and the juvenile is overall duller with brown spots on the breast and chest. Juvenile birds in autumn also show more wear to the tail feathers and the <a href="Flight%20feather%23Tertials">tertials</a> that cover the folded wing, and they often have a duller iris colour than the adults. The subspecies "P . m. badia" is somewhat smaller and darker than the nominate form, with richer brown upperparts, deeper buff underparts, and rustier flank streaks.

Adults undergo a complete <a href="moulting">moult</a> between July and September after breeding has finished. Juvenile birds have a partial moult in the same time period, replacing head, body and some <a href="Covert%20feather">wing covert</a> feathers.
The only species that can potentially be confused with the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.

The call of the Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic "ti-ti-ti". The male's song, given from the top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high "chirichiriri", variously described as similar to that of the Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.

The Siberian accentor breeds in a belt across northern Russia east from just west of the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific coast</a>, with a second, more fragmented, band across southern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in east China and Korea. Small numbers winter in Mongolia, but this species is only rarely recorded in Japan in winter.

The breeding habitat is <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> <a href="willow">willow</a> and <a href="birch">birch</a> forests, and open <a href="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> woodland, often close to rivers or bogs, although pairs are also found in mountains and <a href="spruce">spruce</a> <a href="taiga">taiga</a>. In winter, the Siberian accentor occupies bushes and shrubs, often near streams, but may also be found in dry grassland and woods.

Siberian accentors leave the north of their breeding range from mid-September onwards, but may stay for a further month or two in the south. In spring, returning birds pass through Mongolia from the end of March and south easternmost Russia in April and May, reaching their breeding grounds in May, perhaps as late as June in the far north.

Vagrant birds have been recorded in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and several European countries, as well as in North America. Most North American records have been in western <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, but as of February 2018 there had been records of single birds away from the Pacific coast in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> and <a href="Montana">Montana</a>.

Alaskan records, like those in western Europe, are mainly from late September to November; occurrences in Canada are less predictable, although mostly in autumn and winter, and mostly at <a href="bird%20feeder">bird feeder</a>s.

October and early November 2016 saw an unprecedented influx of Siberian accentors into western Europe, including first records for Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, in some cases attracting national attention and hundreds of <a href="twitcher">twitcher</a>s.

Prior to 2015, only 32 individuals had been recorded in western Europe, the majority in Finland and Sweden, but in October and early November 2016 at least 231 were reported. Records were from the Czech Republic (1), Denmark (11), Estonia (9), Finland (72), Germany (12), Hungary (1), Latvia (9), Lithuania (4), Netherlands (1), Norway (11), Poland (11), <a href="Republic%20of%20Karelia">Russian Karelia</a> (3), Sweden (71), the UK (14) and the Ukraine (2). Four additional birds in Sweden and one in Finland were not positively identified as Siberian, rather than black-throated, accentors. Those birds that were reliably aged all appeared to be in first-winter plumage. One of the UK birds lingered in Scotland, where it was found in February 2017.

The UK <a href="Met%20Office">Met Office</a> suggested that the influx of accentors was driven by strong and persistent easterly winds from Siberia, partially driven by a <a href="high-pressure%20area">high-pressure area</a> centred over Scandinavia. Another weather system produced easterlies in western Asia during the same period.
The weather conditions that carried the accentors so far west also bought large numbers of other Siberian migrants, including a record arrival of <a href="yellow-browed%20warbler">yellow-browed warbler</a>s in northwest Europe and a sprinkling of extreme eastern rarities such as the UK's first <a href="pale-legged%20leaf%20warbler">pale-legged leaf warbler</a> and the Netherlands' second <a href="eastern%20crowned%20warbler">eastern crowned warbler</a>. There have been suggestions that the accentor influx was augmented by high breeding success in Siberia in 2016, but there is no direct data to support that, and no obvious increase in numbers reaching North America.

Siberian accentors are typically skulking birds, readily disappearing into cover. They have an above average ability to maintain their body temperature in cold conditions, an adaptation to their sometimes cold environment.

The breeding season of the Siberian accentor is from June to August. Little is known about territorial or breeding behaviour, but birds of the nominate subspecies tend to occur in small groups of two to six closely spaced nests. This clumping does not appear to be shown by the southern subspecies, "P. m. badia". The nest is an open cup built above the ground in dense shrub, or where branches fork in a tree. The nest is constructed from coarse vegetation such as twigs and leaves, and lined with hair or fine grasses. The eggs are a glossy deep blue-green and measure ; they weigh about . The clutch of four to six eggs is incubated by the female for about ten days to hatching and the downy brown-black chicks are then fed by both parents. They are able to breed in the following year.

Two broods may be produced in the south of the range, just one further north.

The Siberian accentor feeds mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation including bushes and trees, and frequently from near <a href="snow%20field">snow field</a>s. Young birds are fed mainly on insects, especially the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, several food items being carried to the nest at each visit.

Seeds may be consumed in winter, and the accentors may also then feed near human habitation. Food plants include <a href="Empetrum%20nigrum">crowberry</a>, <a href="Persicaria%20bistorta">bistort</a> and members of the <a href="Amaranthaceae">aramanth</a> and <a href="Betulaceae">birch</a> families.

The total population for the Siberian accentor is uncertain, although estimates for the small European part of the range vary from 100–500 breeding pairs. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable. For this reason the Siberian accentor is evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a>, although as a northern breeding species it may in the long term be affected by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>.

Breeding densities have been recorded as over 30 pairs/km in northwestern Russia, depending on habitat, generally becoming lower, around 5 pairs/km in the east of the range. Weather is also a factor, with an atypically high density of 7.4 birds/km being recorded in the <a href="Taymyr%20Peninsula">Taymyr Peninsula</a> in 1983.

The Siberian accentor is parasitised by the <a href="Ixodes%20persulcatus">taiga tick</a>, which can host the <a href="spirochaete">spirochaete</a> "<a href="Borrelia%20burgdorferi">Borrelia burgdorferi</a>", the cause of <a href="Lyme%20disease">Lyme disease</a>.

Armillaria luteobubalina

Armillaria luteobubalina, <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the Australian honey fungus, is a species of <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a> in the family <a href="Physalacriaceae">Physalacriaceae</a>. Widely distributed in southern Australia, the fungus is responsible for a disease known as "Armillaria" root rot, a primary cause of "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" tree death and <a href="forest%20dieback">forest dieback</a>. It is the most <a href="plant%20pathogen">pathogenic</a> and widespread of the six "<a href="Armillaria">Armillaria</a>" species found in Australia. The fungus has also been collected in Argentina and Chile. <a href="Basidiocarp">Fruit bodies</a> have cream- to tan-coloured <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> that grow up to in diameter and <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> that measure up to long by thick. The fruit bodies, which appear at the base of infected trees and other woody plants in autumn (March–April), are <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, but require cooking to remove the bitter taste. The fungus is dispersed through <a href="spore">spore</a>s produced on <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> on the underside of the caps, and also by growing <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetatively</a> through the root systems of host trees. The ability of the fungus to spread vegetatively is facilitated by an aerating system that allows it to efficiently diffuse <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> through <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s—rootlike structures made of dense masses of <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e.

"Armillaria luteobubalina" was first described in 1978, after having been discovered several years earlier growing in a "Eucalyptus" plantation in southeastern Australia. It distinguished itself from other known Australian "Armillaria" species by its aggressive pathogenicity. It may take years for infected trees to show signs of disease, leading to an underestimation of disease prevalence. Studies show that the spread of disease in eucalypt forests is associated with infected stumps left following <a href="Logging%20in%20Australia">logging</a> operations. Although several methods have been suggested to control the spread of disease, they are largely economically or environmentally unfeasible. <a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analyses have determined that "A. luteobubalina" is closely related to "<a href="Armillaria%20montagnei">A. montagnei</a>" and that both of these species are in turn closely related to the Brazilian species "<a href="Armillaria%20paulensis">A. paulensis</a>". The distribution of "A. luteobubalina" suggests that it is an ancient species that originated before the separation of the precursor supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>.

"Armillaria luteobubalina" was first described in 1978 by mycologists <a href="Roy%20Watling">Roy Watling</a> and <a href="Glen%20Kile">Glen Kile</a>, who studied its effects on a fast-growing <a href="plantation">plantation</a> of "<a href="Eucalyptus%20regnans">Eucalyptus regnans</a>" near <a href="Traralgon%2C%20Victoria">Traralgon, Victoria</a>. The plantation, established in 1963, consisted largely of trees with a mean height of about . A cluster of dead and dying trees discovered in 1973 suggested attack by a virulent primary <a href="plant%20pathology">pathogen</a>, that is, one capable of infecting a host before invasion by other, secondary pathogens. This finding was inconsistent with the pathogenic behaviour of the known "Armillaria" species in Australia at the time, "<a href="Armillaria%20mellea">A. mellea</a>" and "A. elegans". Further study over the next few years showed that the fungus spread by the growth of underground <a href="mycelium">mycelia</a> in root systems, expanding outward from the initial infected stump at an average of per year. Most Australian records of "Armillaria" infections referred to "A. mellea", based on the presence of black <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s. For over one hundred years, "A. mellea" was thought to be a <a href="pleomorphism%20%28microbiology%29">pleiomorphic</a> (occurring in various distinct forms) species with a widespread distribution and host range, and variable pathogenicity. which led to great confusion among taxonomists and plant pathologists alike. In 1973, <a href="Veikko%20Hintikka">Veikko Hintikka</a> reported a technique to distinguish between "Armillaria" species by growing them together as single <a href="spore">spore</a> isolates on <a href="petri%20dish">petri dish</a>es and observing changes in the <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of the cultures. Using similar techniques, mycologists eventually determined that the "Armillaria mellea" <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a> in Europe and North America in fact consisted of five and ten distinct "biological species", respectively.

Watling and Kile compared the macroscopic and microscopic characters of the pathogenic "Armillaria" with "A. polymyces" (now known as "<a href="Armillaria%20obscura">A. obscura</a>"), "A. mellea", "<a href="Armillaria%20limonea">A. limonea</a>" and "<a href="Armillaria%20novae-zelandiae">A. novae-zelandiae</a>" and found sufficient differences between them to warrant designating the species as new. Its <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "lutea" "yellow", and was chosen to highlight an important distinguishing characteristic: the strong yellow colour of the cap and lack of reddish or brown tones in the stem typical of other resident "Armillaria".

A <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> study of South American "Armillaria" species concluded that "A. luteobubalina" is in a lineage that includes "<a href="Armillaria%20montagnei">A. montagnei</a>", and these are <a href="cladistics">sister</a> to a lineage containing "<a href="Armillaria%20paulensis">A. paulensis</a>", a species known from a single specimen collected in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, Brazil. Although they are very similar, specimens of "A. luteobubalina" have smaller spores than Argentinian specimens of "A. montagnei", and their distinctness is well-supported with phylogenetic analysis. Based on analysis of <a href="pectic">pectic</a> enzymes, "A. luteobubalina" is closely related to "<a href="Armillaria%20limonea">A. limonea</a>", a species found in New Zealand; this result corroborates phylogenetic analyses reported in 2003 and 2006. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> analysis of 27 collections of "A. luteobubalina" from southwest Western Australia and one from Traralgon revealed four distinct polymorphic groups. The genetic variety suggests it is native to Australia.

Up to in diameter, the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is convex to flattened in shape with a central <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a> (a rounded elevation) and is various shades of cream, yellow and tan. The cap surface is covered with darker scales and feels rough to the touch. The cap edge, or margin, is rolled inward in young specimens. The crowded <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are <a href="wikt%3Asinuate">sinuate</a> and white to cream in colour initially, brownish-cream or pinkish brown in maturity, and sometimes with yellow or rust-coloured marks close to the margins. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is central (that is, it joins the cap in the centre) and is up to long by thick. It is slightly thicker at its base than its apex, sometimes almost bulb-like. The stem surface is streaked with fibrils that run up and down its length. It has a floppy yellow wool-like <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> which may develop irregular, jagged edges with time. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is white, and in the stem has a woolly or stringy consistency. Although it has a hot-bitter taste, "Armillaria luteobubalina" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, and cooking removes the bitterness.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is white when fresh, but becomes more cream-coloured when dry. The smooth <a href="spore">spore</a>s are oval to ellipsoid, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), non-<a href="amyloid">amyloid</a> (meaning they do not absorb <a href="iodine">iodine</a> from <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>), and typically measure 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are thin-walled, hyaline, and lack <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s at their bases. They are usually four-spored but occasionally two-spored, with <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> (projections that attach to the spores) up to 4 μm long. The cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> that occur on the edge of a gill) are mostly club-shaped, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 15–30 by 6–10 μm.

Five other "Armillaria" species are found in Australia. Within the range of "A. luteobubalina", "<a href="Armillaria%20hinnulea">A. hinnulea</a>" is restricted to <a href="gully">gully</a> habitats. "<a href="Armillaria%20fumosa">A. fumosa</a>" is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations. "A. luteobubalina" and "A. montagnei" share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour, but the latter species has an olive-tinged cap, larger spores (9.5–11 by 5.5–7 µm compared to 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5 µm) and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in "A. luteobubalina". The morphology of the vegetative structures of "<a href="Armillaria%20limonea">A. limonea</a>" is distinctly different than "A. luteobubalina", and can be used to distinguish the two species. "A. novae-zelandiae" has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below the ring and is found in wet forests, and "A. pallidula" is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical Australia arising from dead tree stumps or the roots of dead or living trees. "A. luteobubalina" is the only "Armillaria" species which occurs in Western Australia. Distinguishing Australian species is economically important, because "A. luteobubalina" is more pathogenic than the other members of the genus. A molecular diagnostic test, developed in 2002, can accurately identify each species using <a href="DNA">DNA</a> extracted from its mycelia. Before this, species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season. This technology also revealed a variation in the molecular material of "A. luteobubalina" that suggested sexual reproduction.

"Armillaria luteobubalina" has been recorded in southeastern Australia, from the southeastern corner of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> through eastern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and across <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> into southeastern <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>. It also occurs in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and southwestern <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. Those of the <a href="karri%20forest">karri forest</a>s (consisting largely of the species "<a href="Eucalyptus%20diversicolor">E. diversicolor</a>") of the southwest have paler and yellower caps than those in the <a href="jarrah%20forest">jarrah forest</a>s (which contain predominantly "<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>") further north. The fruit bodies arise on wood, especially on stumps or around the base of trees, and often in huge numbers. They usually appear between April and July, although most production occurs in the second half of May. Abundant in woodlands, it can invade gardens and orchards, where it can attack many woody plants. The honey fungus infected and killed many plants near tuart trees ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20gomphocephala">Eucalyptus gomphocephala</a>") which had been cut down near <a href="Kings%20Park%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kings Park</a> in suburban Perth. "Armillaria luteobubalina" is commonly found in <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> forests in Australia, and is thought to be the most <a href="pathogenic">pathogenic</a> and most widespread "Armillaria" species in the major western Australian forest types. The mushroom has also been reported from southern South America, in Argentina and Chile. A 2003 study of the molecular phylogenetics and pattern of its distribution in South America and Australia indicate that "A. luteobubalina" is an ancient species, originating before the separation of the precursor supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. Genetic differences between isolates in the South American and Australian populations indicate a long period of geographical separation, and the authors suggest that they "later might be regarded as independent taxa".

Trees that are infected by "A. luteobubalina" show characteristic symptoms both above and below ground. Above the ground, the base of the tree develops inverted V-shaped lesions, and the infected wood undergoes <a href="white%20rot">white rot</a>, a fungal wood decay process where the <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> and <a href="lignin">lignin</a> of the <a href="Wood%23Heartwood%20and%20sapwood">sapwood</a> are both broken down, leaving the wood stringy. The <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> of the stem dies and becomes discoloured up to above the ground. Clusters of fruit bodies appear at the base of the tree in autumn. <a href="Crown%20%28botany%29">Crowns</a> may show gradual deterioration, or tree death may occur suddenly. Below the ground, characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting the ends of tree roots, white-rotted sapwood, and the presence of fan-shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark.

In selectively logged eucalypt forests in the central highlands of Victoria, it has been estimated that about 3–5% of the forest area is "moderately to severely affected" by "Armillaria" root rot caused by "A. luteobubalina". A review of eucalypt plantations planted in New South Wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by "A. luteobubalina" was rare, and only accounted for 1% of mortality in total. In this instance, the cases had been restricted to "<a href="Eucalyptus%20nitens">Eucalyptus nitens</a>" on the <a href="Dorrigo%20Plateau">Dorrigo Plateau</a>. Unlike other "Armillaria" species found in Australia's native forests, which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species, "A. luteobubalina" is a primary pathogen, and can infect healthy trees. Tree roots may be infected for years before showing above-ground symptoms, making it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of disease in a forest stand. Surveys are usually conducted in autumn, to coincide with the appearance of fruit bodies; infection is assessed by the presence of basal scars on the trees, and the appearance of fruit bodies. Several factors, however—such as cost, variable on-site conditions, and non-symptomatic diseased trees—make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections. One study showed that above-ground examinations detected only 50% of the trees actually infected, leading to underestimation of the incidence of true infection by 20–40%. The study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25- to 30-year-old karri regrowth forests in western Australia showed an average of 40–45% incidence of infection.

Several studies have shown that the spread of "Armillaria" root rot in eucalypt forests is associated with infected <a href="tree%20stump">stumps</a> that remain after an area has been <a href="logging">logged</a>. "Armillaria luteobubalina" can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in <a href="Ovens%2C%20Victoria">Ovens, Victoria</a>, the disease was spread to <a href="blueberry">blueberry</a> plants ("Vaccinium" species) via buried fragments of infected "Eucalyptus" that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale <a href="aerial%20photography">aerial photography</a> can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal <a href="dune">dune</a> woodlands, <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, and <a href="heath%20%28habitat%29">heath</a> communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>"), bull banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20grandis">Banksia grandis</a>"), marri ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20calophylla">E. calophylla</a>"), "<a href="Lasiopetalum%20floribundum">Lasiopetalum floribundum</a>", and "<a href="Acacia%20saligna">Acacia saligna</a>". It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20wandoo">E. wandoo</a>"). The fungus has also been reported to infect "<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>" species in Argentina, and "<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>" in Chile.
"Armillaria luteobubalina" uses "an elaborate, sophisticated aeration system" that enables it to efficiently deliver oxygen into the <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s, helping it thrive in low-oxygen environments. When grown in <a href="microbiological%20culture">culture</a>, the <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> develops into a continuous region of tissue with a perforated crust. This tissue is <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> and resistant to becoming waterlogged. Rhizomorphs develop beneath clusters of so-called "air-pores" near the perforations. These gas spaces connect the atmosphere with the central canal of the rhizomorph, to facilitate <a href="diffusion">diffusion</a> of oxygen and satiate the organism's high oxygen requirement during growth. This aeration system is thought to be an important factor in the organism's pathogenicity, allowing it to grow on wet or waterlogged root surfaces and send hyphae or rhizomorphs into live roots or cut stumps, where conditions may be <a href="hypoxia%20%28environmental%29">hypoxic</a>. The rhizomorphs have a dichotomous branching pattern, so that they split or bifurcate at various intervals. Experiments and field observations have shown that this allows the fungus to be a more aggressive and virulent pathogen than "Armillaria" species whose rhizomorphs branch <a href="monopodial">monopodial</a>ly (where lateral branches grow from a main stem). Although the structure of "A. luteobubalina" rhizomorphs is specialised for spread in potentially anaerobic conditions, the soil mycelium is adaptive and can amplify the absorptive surface of peripheral hyphae in response to the presence of nutrient-rich soil.

Methods for controlling the spread of "Armillaria" root rot include physical removal of infected trees, stumps and large roots; fumigation of soil around infected hosts; and injection of fumigants directly into infected hosts. These methods are often not practical due to high cost, introduction of toxic chemicals that affect other organisms, or health and safety issues for the operator. <a href="Biological%20pest%20control">Biological control</a> is another method that has been investigated to control root rot caused by "A. luteobubalina". In one study, thinning stumps of "Eucalyptus diversicolor" were simultaneously inoculated with "A. luteobubalina" and one of the <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> <a href="wood-decay%20fungus">wood decay fungi</a> "<a href="Coriolus%20versicolor">Coriolus versicolor</a>", "<a href="Stereum%20hirsutum">Stereum hirsutum</a>" and "<a href="Xylaria%20hypoxylon">Xylaria hypoxylon</a>"; all three fungi significantly reduced infection by "A. luteobubalinea". These results were echoed in another study of stumps in karri regrowth forests, where it was shown that the presence of other wood decay fungi suppressed the growth of "A. luteobubalina" on the stump base.

Omphalotus nidiformis

Omphalotus nidiformis, or ghost fungus, is a gilled <a href="basidiomycete">basidiomycete</a> <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a> most notable for its <a href="bioluminescence">bioluminescent</a> properties. It is known to occur primarily in southern Australia and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, but was reported from India in 2012 and 2018. The fan- or funnel-shaped <a href="Basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are up to across, with cream-coloured <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> overlain with shades of orange, brown, purple, or bluish-black. The white or cream <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> run down the length of the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, which is up to long and tapers in thickness to the base. The fungus is both <a href="saprotroph">saprotroph</a>ic and <a href="parasitism">parasitic</a>, and its fruit bodies are generally found growing in overlapping clusters on a wide variety of dead or dying trees.

First <a href="species%20description">described</a> scientifically in 1844, the fungus has been known by several names in its <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history. It was assigned its current name by <a href="Orson%20K.%20Miller%2C%20Jr.">Orson K. Miller, Jr.</a> in 1994. Its scientific name is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "nidus" "nest", hence 'nest shaped'. Similar in appearance to the common edible <a href="oyster%20mushroom">oyster mushroom</a>, it was previously considered a member of the same genus, "<a href="Pleurotus">Pleurotus</a>", and described under the former names "Pleurotus nidiformis" or "Pleurotus lampas". Unlike oyster mushrooms, "O. nidiformis" is <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a>; while not lethal, its consumption leads to severe <a href="cramp">cramp</a>s and vomiting. The toxic properties of the mushroom are attributed to compounds called <a href="illudin">illudin</a>s. "O. nidiformis" is one of several species in the <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan</a> genus "<a href="Omphalotus">Omphalotus</a>", all of which have bioluminescent properties.

The ghost fungus was initially described in 1844 by English naturalist <a href="Miles%20Joseph%20Berkeley">Miles Joseph Berkeley</a> as "Agaricus nidiformis". Berkeley felt it was related to "Agaricus ostreatus" (now "<a href="Pleurotus%20ostreatus">Pleurotus ostreatus</a>") but remarked it was a "far more magnificent species". Material was originally collected by Scottish naturalist <a href="James%20Drummond%20%28botanist%29">James Drummond</a> in 1841 on "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" wood along the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan River</a>. He wrote "when this fungus was laid on a newspaper, it emitted by night a phosphorescent light, enabling us to read the words around it; and it continued to do so for several nights with gradually decreasing intensity as the plant dried up." More material collected from near the base of a "sickly but living" shrub ("<a href="Grevillea%20drummondii">Grevillea drummondii</a>") was named as "Agaricus lampas" by Berkeley. He noted both were phosphorescent and closely related species. <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>n botanist <a href="Ronald%20Campbell%20Gunn">Ronald Campbell Gunn</a> collected material in October 1845 from that state, which Berkeley felt differed from previous collections in having more demarcated and less <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> gills and a shorter stipe, and named it "Agaricus phosphorus" in 1848. Italian mycologist <a href="Pier%20Andrea%20Saccardo">Pier Andrea Saccardo</a> placed all three named taxa in the genus "<a href="Pleurotus">Pleurotus</a>" in 1887. These names have been <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonymised</a> with "O. nidiformis", although the name "Pleurotus lampas" persisted in some texts, including the 1934–35 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of Australian fungi by <a href="John%20Burton%20Cleland">John Burton Cleland</a>. In reviewing the published literature, Victorian botanical liaison officer <a href="James%20Hamlyn%20Willis">Jim Willis</a> was aware of <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>'s placing of "Pleurotus olearius" into the genus "<a href="Omphalotus">Omphalotus</a>", but stopped short of transferring the ghost fungus across, even though he conceded it was wrongly placed in "Pleurotus". Investigating the species in 1994, <a href="Orson%20K.%20Miller%2C%20Jr.">Orson K. Miller, Jr.</a> gave the ghost fungus its current binomial name when he transferred it to the genus "Omphalotus" with other bioluminescent mushrooms.

The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> "nidiformis" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> terms "nīdus" 'nest' and "forma" 'shape' or 'form', hence 'nest shaped'. "Lampas" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "lampas"/λαμπας 'torch'. <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s include ghost fungus and Australian glow fungus. Drummond reported that the local <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">aborigine</a>s were fearful when shown the luminescent fungus and called out "chinga", a local word for spirit; Drummond himself likened it to a <a href="will-o%27-the-wisp">will-o'-the-wisp</a>. Likewise on the <a href="Springbrook%2C%20Queensland">Springbrook Plateau</a> in southeastern Queensland, the local <a href="Kombumerri%20people">Kombumerri people</a> believed the lights to be ancestors and gave the area a wide berth out of respect.

Several "Omphalotus" species with similar bioluminescent properties occur worldwide, all of which are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom ("<a href="Omphalotus%20olearius">O. olearius</a>") and the "tsukiyotake" ("<a href="Omphalotus%20japonicus">O. japonicus</a>" (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as "Lampteromyces japonicus" (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. A 2004 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> study shows the ghost fungus to be most closely related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom ("<a href="Omphalotus%20olivascens">O. olivascens</a>"), which is abundant in Southern and Central <a href="California">California</a>. Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus most closely resemble this species.

Laboratory breeding experiments with it and other "Omphalotus" species have revealed a low level of compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with "<a href="Omphalotus%20illudens">O. illudens</a>", the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the <a href="Pennsylvanian%20%28geology%29">Late Carboniferous</a> separation of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> from <a href="Laurasia">Laurasia</a> but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.

Miller noted there appeared to be two colour forms reported across its range, namely a more cream-coloured form with darker shades of brown and grey in its cap that darkens with age, and a more wholly brownish form with paler edges and darker centre to its cap. He found the cream-coloured form to be strongly luminescent—the brightest of any fungus in the genus—with the cap, stipe and gills all glowing. The brown form was generally fainter, with its luminescence restricted to the gills. However, some strongly luminescent wholly brown-coloured mushrooms were recorded, and laboratory experiments showed all <a href="Mating%20in%20fungi">interbred</a> freely and produced fertile offspring, leading Miller to conclude that these were <a href="Phenotype">phenotypic</a> variants of a single <a href="taxon">taxon</a>.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of the ghost fungus can be found on dead or diseased wood. They may be first seen at night as a pale whitish glow at the base of trees in a eucalypt forest. The <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is very variable in colour, sometimes cream though often tinted with orange, brownish, greyish, purple or even bluish-black shades. The margin is lighter, generally cream, though brown forms have tan or brown edges. The centre generally has several darker shades, and younger specimens are often darker. Growing up to in diameter it is funnel-shaped or fan-shaped in appearance with inrolled margins. The cream-white <a href="lamellae%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are decurrent and often drip with moisture. They are up to deep, somewhat distant to closely spaced, and have a smooth edge until they erode in maturity. The <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> may be central to lateral in its attachment to the cap and is up to long and tapers to the base. The thin <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is generally creamy white in colour, but can have reddish tones near the base of the stipe. There is no distinctive smell or taste. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is white.

The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are roughly elliptical, or, less commonly, somewhat spherical, and have dimensions of 7.5–9.5 by 5–7 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. They are thin-walled, <a href="inamyloid">inamyloid</a>, and have a smooth surface. Each features a prominent <a href="hilum%20%28biology%29">hilar appendage</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells), measuring 32–42 by 6–9 μm, are club-shaped and four-spored, with <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> up to 7 μm long. Cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> found on the gill edges) are abundant, and measure 15–40 by 3–6 μm; no pleurocystida (cystidia on the gill faces) are present. The <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> comprises a thin layer of 3–6 μm-wide <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e that are interwoven either loosely or tightly. All hyphae of "O. nidiformis" have <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s.
The bioluminescence of "O. nidiformis" fruit bodies is best seen in low-light conditions when the viewer's eyes have become <a href="Adaptation%20%28eye%29">dark-adapted</a>. The gills are the most luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age. Although the intensity of the luminescence is variable, <a href="William%20Henry%20Harvey">William Henry Harvey</a> once reported that it was bright enough to read a watch face by. It is not known if the <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> is also luminescent.

"Omphalotus nidiformis" may be confused with the <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> brown oyster mushroom ("<a href="Pleurotus%20australis">Pleurotus australis</a>"), which is brown and does not glow in the dark. Confusion with another edible lookalike, "Pleurotus ostreatus", common in the Northern Hemisphere and cultivated commercially, has been the source for at least one case of poisoning reported in the literature.

"Omphalotus nidiformis" occurs in two disjunct ranges in southern Australia. In southwest <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, it has been recorded from Perth and the Avon wheatbelt southwest to Augusta and east along the southern coastline to Esperance. In the southeast of the continent, it is found from eastern <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, where it has been recorded from <a href="Mount%20Gambier">Mount Gambier</a> and the <a href="Fleurieu%20Peninsula">Fleurieu Peninsula</a>, the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> around Adelaide, the <a href="Murraylands">Murraylands</a>, and north to the <a href="Flinders%20Ranges">Flinders Ranges</a> and from <a href="Lincoln%20National%20Park">Lincoln National Park</a> at the apex of the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a>, through to southeast <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. It also occurs in Tasmania. It can be found in eucalypt and pine forests, in habitats as diverse as the arid scrubland of <a href="Wyperfeld%20National%20Park">Wyperfeld National Park</a> and subalpine areas of <a href="Mount%20Buffalo%20National%20Park">Mount Buffalo National Park</a>, as well as in urban parks and gardens. Fruit bodies can be numerous and occur in overlapping clusters on dead wood. Outside Australia, it has been recorded from <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a>. In 2012, it was reported for the first time from <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>, India, where it was discovered growing on a <a href="Cocos%20nucifera">coconut tree</a> stump.

A <a href="Saprotroph">saprobe</a> or <a href="Parasitism">parasite</a>, "O. nidiformis" is nonspecific in its needs and is compatible with a wide variety of <a href="host%20%28biology%29">hosts</a>. It has been recorded on native "Banksia" (including "<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">B. attenuata</a>" and "<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>"), "<a href="Hakea">Hakea</a>", "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>", "<a href="Nuytsia%20floribunda">Nuytsia floribunda</a>" and various <a href="Myrtaceae">Myrtaceae</a>, including "<a href="Agonis%20flexuosa">Agonis flexuosa</a>" and "<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>" species, and especially "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>", as well as "<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>", "<a href="Casuarina">Casuarina</a>" species and "<a href="Allocasuarina%20fraseriana">Allocasuarina fraseriana</a>", and even <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> trees such as "<a href="Pinus">Pinus</a>" or "<a href="Platanus">Platanus</a>" species. It plays an important role in breaking down wood and <a href="nutrient%20cycle">recycling nutrients</a> into the soil.

"Omphalotus" species cause a <a href="Wood-decay%20fungus%23White%20rot">white rot</a> by breaking down <a href="lignin">lignin</a> in their tree hosts. The fungus infiltrates the <a href="wood%23Heartwood%20and%20sapwood">heartwood</a> of the tree via a breach in its bark, either by a branch falling, damage from insects or <a href="mistletoe">mistletoe</a>, or by mechanical damage from logging. "O. nidiformis" has been implicated in the heartwood rot of several species of eucalypt around Australia, including marri ("<a href="Corymbia%20calophylla">Corymbia calophylla</a>") in southwest Western Australia, in spotted gum ("<a href="Corymbia%20maculata">C. maculata</a>") and messmate ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20obliqua">Eucalyptus obliqua</a>") in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, and in blackbutt ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20pilularis">E. pilularis</a>"), Sydney blue gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20saligna">E. saligna</a>"), red stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20macrorhyncha">E. macrorhyncha</a>") and Forth River peppermint ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20radiata">E. radiata</a>") in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>.

The <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">US Department of Agriculture</a> considers there is a moderate to high risk of "O. nidiformis" being accidentally introduced to the United States in untreated eucalyptus woodchips from Australia. Nearly a century ago, Cleland and <a href="Edwin%20Cheel">Edwin Cheel</a> suggested that even though the fungus was of "no great economic importance", "it would be advisable to destroy it by burning wherever found."

Several species of "<a href="Tapeigaster">Tapeigaster</a>" flies have been collected from the fruit bodies, including "<a href="Tapeigaster%20cinctipes">T. cinctipes</a>", "<a href="Tapeigaster%20annulipes">T. annulipes</a>", and "<a href="Tapeigaster%20nigricornis">T. nigricornis</a>"; the latter species uses the fruit bodies as a host to rear its young. Fruit bodies in <a href="Springbrook%20National%20Park">Springbrook National Park</a> have been observed to attract nocturnal insects such as beetles, native cockroaches and crickets (white-kneed cricket ("<a href="Papuastus">Papuastus</a>" spp.) and thorny cricket), as well as <a href="Hedleyella%20falconeri">giant rainforest snails</a> ("Hedleyella falconeri") and <a href="red%20triangle%20slug">red triangle slug</a>s ("Triboniophorus graeffei"), which voraciously consume the fungus.

"Omphalotus nidiformis" is not edible. Although reputedly mild tasting, eating it will result in vomiting which generally occurs 30 minutes to two hours after consumption and lasts for several hours. There is no diarrhea and patients recover without lasting ill-effects. Its toxicity was first mentioned by <a href="Anthony%20M.%20Young">Anthony M. Young</a> in his 1982 guidebook "Common Australian Fungi". The toxic ingredient of many species of "Omphalotus" is a <a href="sesquiterpene">sesquiterpene</a> compound known as <a href="illudin">illudin</a> S. This, along with illudin M and a co-metabolite illudosin, have been identified in "O. nidiformis". The two illudins are common to the genus "Omphalotus" and not found in any other basidiomycete mushroom. An additional three compounds unique to "O. nidiformis" have been identified and named illudins F, G and H.

<a href="Irofulven">Irofulven</a>, a compound derived from illuden S, is undergoing <a href="phase%20II%20clinical%20trial">phase II clinical trial</a>s as a possible <a href="chemotherapy">therapy</a> for various types of cancers. Fruit body extracts have <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> and <a href="radical%20%28chemistry%29">free radical</a> <a href="scavenger%20%28chemistry%29">scavenging</a> properties, which may be attributed to the presence of <a href="natural%20phenol">phenolic</a> compounds.

Vladimir Lenin

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (22 April 1870 – 21 January 1924), better known by the <a href="Pseudonym">alias</a> Lenin, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and <a href="political%20theory">political theorist</a>. He served as <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">head of government</a> of <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Soviet Russia</a> from 1917 to 1924 and of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a <a href="one-party%20state">one-party</a> <a href="communist%20state">communist state</a> governed by the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Russian Communist Party</a>. Ideologically a <a href="Communism">communist</a>, he developed a variant of <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> known as <a href="Leninism">Leninism</a>; his ideas were posthumously codified as <a href="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>.
Born to a moderately prosperous middle-class family in <a href="Ulyanovsk">Simbirsk</a>, Lenin embraced <a href="Revolutionary%20socialism">revolutionary socialist</a> politics following <a href="Aleksandr%20Ulyanov">his brother's</a> 1887 execution. Expelled from <a href="Kazan%20%28Volga%20region%29%20Federal%20University">Kazan Imperial University</a> for participating in protests against the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>'s <a href="Tsarist%20autocracy">Tsarist government</a>, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for <a href="sedition">sedition</a> and exiled to <a href="Shushenskoye">Shushenskoye</a> for three years, where he married <a href="Nadezhda%20Krupskaya">Nadezhda Krupskaya</a>. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist <a href="Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Russian Social Democratic Labour Party</a> (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolshevik faction</a> against <a href="Julius%20Martov">Julius Martov</a>'s <a href="Mensheviks">Mensheviks</a>. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed <a href="Revolution%20of%201905">Revolution of 1905</a>, he later campaigned for the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> to be transformed into a Europe-wide <a href="proletarian%20revolution">proletarian revolution</a>, which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of <a href="Capitalist%20mode%20of%20production%20%28Marxist%20theory%29">capitalism</a> and its replacement with <a href="Socialist%20mode%20of%20production">socialism</a>. After the 1917 <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> ousted the <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar</a> and established a <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a>, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>, in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.
<a href="Council%20of%20People%27s%20Commissars">Lenin's Bolshevik government</a> initially shared power with the <a href="Left%20Socialist%20Revolutionaries">Left Socialist Revolutionaries</a>, elected <a href="All-Russian%20Congress%20of%20Soviets">soviets</a>, and a multi-party <a href="Russian%20Constituent%20Assembly">Constituent Assembly</a>, although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">treaty</a> with the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> and promoted <a href="world%20revolution">world revolution</a> through the <a href="Communist%20International">Communist International</a>. Opponents were suppressed in the <a href="Red%20Terror">Red Terror</a>, a violent campaign administered by the <a href="Cheka">state security services</a>; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right</a> and <a href="Left-wing%20politics">left-wing</a> anti-Bolshevik armies in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a> of 1919–1921. Responding to wartime devastation, <a href="Russian%20famine%20of%201921">famine</a>, and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the market-oriented <a href="New%20Economic%20Policy">New Economic Policy</a>. Several non-Russian nations secured independence after 1917, but three <a href="Treaty%20on%20the%20Creation%20of%20the%20USSR">re-united</a> with Russia through <a href="Treaty%20on%20the%20Creation%20of%20the%20USSR">the formation of the Soviet Union</a> in 1922. In increasingly poor health, Lenin died at his <a href="dacha">dacha</a> in <a href="Gorki%20Leninskiye">Gorki</a>, with <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government. 
Widely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive <a href="cult%20of%20personality">personality cult</a> within the Soviet Union until <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">its dissolution</a> in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind Marxism–Leninism and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive individual, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the <a href="working%20class">working class</a>, while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an authoritarian regime responsible for <a href="Political%20repression%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">political repression and mass killings.</a>

Lenin's father, <a href="Ilya%20Ulyanov">Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov</a>, was from a family of <a href="Serfdom%20in%20Russia">serfs</a>; his ethnic origins remain unclear, with suggestions being made that he was <a href="Russians">Russian</a>, <a href="Chuvash%20people">Chuvash</a>, <a href="Mordvins">Mordvin</a>, or <a href="Kalmyks">Kalmyk</a>. Despite this lower-class background he had risen to middle-class status, studying physics and mathematics at <a href="Kazan%20%28Volga%20region%29%20Federal%20University">Kazan Imperial University</a> before teaching at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Nobles">Penza Institute for the Nobility</a>. Ilya married <a href="Maria%20Alexandrovna%20Ulyanova">Maria Alexandrovna Blank</a> in mid-1863. Well educated and from a relatively prosperous background, she was the daughter of a wealthy <a href="History%20of%20Germans%20in%20Russia%2C%20Ukraine%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union">German</a>–<a href="Swedish%20diaspora">Swedish</a> <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> mother, and a <a href="Russian%20Jews">Russian Jewish</a> father who had <a href="Apostasy%20in%20Judaism">converted to Christianity</a> and worked as a physician. It is likely that Lenin was unaware of his mother's half-Jewish ancestry, which was only discovered by his sister Anna after his death. Soon after their wedding, Ilya obtained a job in <a href="Nizhny%20Novgorod">Nizhny Novgorod</a>, rising to become Director of Primary Schools in the <a href="Ulyanovsk">Simbirsk</a> district six years later. Five years after that, he was promoted to Director of Public Schools for the province, overseeing the foundation of over 450 schools as a part of the government's plans for modernisation. His dedication to education earned him the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Vladimir">Order of St. Vladimir</a>, which bestowed on him the status of <a href="Russian%20nobility">hereditary nobleman</a>.

Lenin was born in Simbirsk on 22 April 1870 and <a href="infant%20baptism">baptised</a> six days later; as a child he was known as "Volodya", a dimunitive of Vladimir. He was one of eight children, having two older siblings, Anna (born 1864) and <a href="Aleksandr%20Ulyanov">Alexander</a> (born 1866). They were followed by three more children, Olga (born 1871), Dmitry (born 1874), and Maria (born 1878). Two later siblings died in infancy. Ilya was a devout member of the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> and baptised his children into it, although Maria—a <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> by upbringing—was largely indifferent to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, a view that influenced her children.

Both parents were <a href="monarchism">monarchists</a> and <a href="liberal%20conservatism">liberal conservatives</a>, being committed to the <a href="emancipation%20reform%20of%201861">emancipation reform of 1861</a> introduced by the reformist <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a>; they avoided political radicals and there is no evidence that the police ever put them under surveillance for subversive thought. Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in <a href="Lenino-Kokushkino">Kokushkino</a>. Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister Olga, whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour. A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gimnazia.

In January 1886, when Lenin was 15, his father died of a <a href="brain%20haemorrhage">brain haemorrhage</a>. Subsequently, his behaviour became erratic and confrontational and he renounced his belief in God. At the time, Lenin's elder brother Alexander—whom he affectionately knew as Sasha—was studying at <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20State%20University">Saint Petersburg University</a>. Involved in political agitation against the <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarchy</a> of the <a href="reactionary">reactionary</a> Tsar <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III</a>, Alexander Ulyanov studied the writings of banned leftists and organised anti-government protests. He joined a revolutionary cell bent on assassinating the Tsar and was selected to construct a bomb. Before the attack could take place the conspirators were arrested and tried, and in May, Alexander was executed by hanging. Despite the emotional trauma of his father's and brother's deaths, Lenin continued studying, graduated from school at the top of his class with a gold medal for exceptional performance, and decided to study law at Kazan University.

Upon entering Kazan University in August 1887, Lenin moved into a nearby flat. There, he joined a "<a href="zemlyachestvo">zemlyachestvo</a>", a form of university society that represented the men of a particular region. This group elected him as its representative to the university's "zemlyachestvo" council, and in December, he took part in a demonstration against government restrictions that banned student societies. The police arrested Lenin and accused him of being a ringleader in the demonstration; he was expelled from the university, and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Russia%29">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> exiled him to his family's Kokushkino estate. There, he read voraciously, becoming enamoured with <a href="Nikolay%20Chernyshevsky">Nikolay Chernyshevsky</a>'s 1863 pro-revolutionary novel "<a href="What%20Is%20To%20Be%20Done%3F%20%28novel%29">What Is To Be Done?</a>".

Lenin's mother was concerned by her son's radicalisation, and was instrumental in convincing the Interior Ministry to allow him to return to the city of <a href="Kazan">Kazan</a>, but not the university. On his return, he joined <a href="Nikolai%20Fedoseev">Nikolai Fedoseev</a>'s revolutionary circle, through which he discovered <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s 1867 book "". This sparked his interest in <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, a socio-political theory that argued that society developed in stages, that this development resulted from <a href="class%20struggle">class struggle</a>, and that <a href="capitalism">capitalist society</a> would ultimately give way to <a href="Socialist%20mode%20of%20production">socialist society</a> and then <a href="communist%20society">communist society</a>. Wary of his political views, Lenin's mother bought a country estate in Alakaevka village, <a href="Samara%20Oblast">Samara Oblast</a>, in the hope that her son would turn his attention to agriculture. He had little interest in farm management, and his mother soon sold the land, keeping the house as a summer home.

In September 1889, the Ulyanov family moved to the city of <a href="Samara%2C%20Russia">Samara</a>, where Lenin joined <a href="Alexei%20Sklyarenko">Alexei Sklyarenko</a>'s socialist discussion circle. There, Lenin fully embraced Marxism and produced a Russian language translation of Marx and <a href="Friedrich%20Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>'s 1848 political pamphlet, "<a href="The%20Communist%20Manifesto">The Communist Manifesto</a>". He began to read the works of the Russian Marxist <a href="Georgi%20Plekhanov">Georgi Plekhanov</a>, agreeing with Plekhanov's argument that Russia was moving from <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> to capitalism and so socialism would be implemented by the <a href="proletariat">proletariat</a>, or urban working class, rather than the <a href="peasant">peasant</a>ry. This Marxist perspective contrasted with the view of the <a href="agrarian%20socialism">agrarian-socialist</a> <a href="Narodniks">Narodnik</a> movement, which held that the peasantry could establish socialism in Russia by forming peasant communes, thereby bypassing capitalism. This Narodnik view developed in the 1860s with the <a href="Narodnaya%20Volya">People's Freedom Party</a> and was then dominant within the Russian revolutionary movement. Lenin rejected the premise of the agrarian-socialist argument, but was influenced by agrarian-socialists like <a href="Pyotr%20Tkachev">Pyotr Tkachev</a> and <a href="Sergei%20Nechaev">Sergei Nechaev</a>, and befriended several Narodniks.

In May 1890, Maria—who retained societal influence as the widow of a nobleman—persuaded the authorities to allow Lenin to take his exams <a href="External%20degree">externally</a> at the University of St Petersburg, where he obtained the equivalent of a first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a>. Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Sklyarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data on Russian society, using it to support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. He wrote a paper on peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal "<a href="Russkaya%20Mysl">Russian Thought</a>".

In late 1893, Lenin moved to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. There, he worked as a barrister's assistant and rose to a senior position in a Marxist revolutionary cell that called itself the "Social-Democrats" after the Marxist <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a>. Publicly championing Marxism within the socialist movement, he encouraged the founding of revolutionary cells in Russia's industrial centres. By late 1894, he was leading a Marxist workers' circle, and meticulously covered his tracks, knowing that police spies tried to infiltrate the movement. He began a romantic relationship with <a href="Nadezhda%20Krupskaya">Nadezhda "Nadya" Krupskaya</a>, a Marxist schoolteacher. He also authored a political tract criticising the Narodnik agrarian-socialists, "What the "Friends of the People" Are and How They Fight the Social-Democrats", based largely on his experiences in Samara; around 200 copies were illegally printed in 1894.

Lenin hoped to cement connections between his Social-Democrats and <a href="Emancipation%20of%20Labour">Emancipation of Labour</a>, a group of Russian Marxist émigrés based in Switzerland; he visited the country to meet group members Plekhanov and <a href="Pavel%20Axelrod">Pavel Axelrod</a>. He proceeded to Paris to meet Marx's son-in-law <a href="Paul%20Lafargue">Paul Lafargue</a> and to research the <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune of 1871</a>, which he considered an early prototype for a proletarian government. Financed by his mother, he stayed in a Swiss health spa before travelling to Berlin, where he studied for six weeks at the <a href="Berlin%20State%20Library">Staatsbibliothek</a> and met the Marxist activist <a href="Wilhelm%20Liebknecht">Wilhelm Liebknecht</a>. Returning to Russia with a stash of illegal revolutionary publications, he travelled to various cities distributing literature to striking workers. While involved in producing a news sheet, "Rabochee delo" (""Workers' Cause""), he was among 40 activists arrested in St. Petersburg and charged with sedition.

Refused legal representation or bail, Lenin denied all charges against him but remained imprisoned for a year before sentencing. He spent this time theorising and writing. In this work he noted that the rise of <a href="industrial%20capitalism">industrial capitalism</a> in Russia had caused large numbers of peasants to move to the cities, where they formed a proletariat. From his Marxist perspective, Lenin argued that this Russian proletariat would develop <a href="class%20consciousness">class consciousness</a>, which would in turn lead them to violently overthrow <a href="Tsarism">Tsarism</a>, the <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>, and the <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> and to establish a <a href="Dictatorship%20of%20the%20proletariat">proletariat state</a> that would move toward socialism.

In February 1897, he was sentenced without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia. He was granted a few days in Saint Petersburg to put his affairs in order and used this time to meet with the Social-Democrats, who had renamed themselves the <a href="League%20of%20Struggle%20for%20the%20Emancipation%20of%20the%20Working%20Class">League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class</a>. His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in <a href="Shushenskoye">Shushenskoye</a>, <a href="Minusinsky%20District">Minusinsky District</a>, where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to swim in the <a href="Yenisei%20River">Yenisei River</a> and to hunt <a href="duck">duck</a> and <a href="snipe">snipe</a>.

In May 1898, Nadya joined him in exile, having been arrested in August 1896 for organising a strike. She was initially posted to <a href="Ufa">Ufa</a>, but persuaded the authorities to move her to Shushenskoye, claiming that she and Lenin were engaged; they married in a church on 10 July 1898. Settling into a family life with Nadya's mother Elizaveta Vasilyevna, in Shushenskoye the couple translated English socialist literature into Russian. Keen to keep up with developments in German Marxism – where there had been an ideological split, with <a href="Revisionism%20%28Marxism%29">revisionists</a> like <a href="Eduard%20Bernstein">Eduard Bernstein</a> advocating a peaceful, electoral path to socialism – Lenin remained devoted to violent revolution, attacking revisionist arguments in "A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats". He also finished "<a href="The%20Development%20of%20Capitalism%20in%20Russia">The Development of Capitalism in Russia</a>" (1899), his longest book to date, which criticised the agrarian-socialists and promoted a Marxist analysis of Russian economic development. Published under the pseudonym of "Vladimir Ilin", upon publication it received predominantly poor reviews.

After his exile, Lenin settled in <a href="Pskov">Pskov</a> in early 1900. There, he began raising funds for a newspaper, "<a href="Iskra">Iskra</a>" (""Spark""), a new organ of the Russian Marxist party, now calling itself the <a href="Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Russian Social Democratic Labour Party</a> (RSDLP). In July 1900, Lenin left Russia for Western Europe; in Switzerland he met other Russian Marxists, and at a <a href="Corsier">Corsier</a> conference they agreed to launch the paper from <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, where Lenin relocated in September. Containing contributions from prominent European Marxists, "Iskra" was smuggled into Russia, becoming the country's most successful <a href="Underground%20press">underground publication</a> for 50 years. He first adopted the pseudonym "Lenin" in December 1901, possibly based on the <a href="River%20Lena">River Lena</a>; he often used the fuller pseudonym of "N. Lenin", and while the N did not stand for anything, a popular misconception later arose that it represented "Nikolai". Under this pseudonym, he published the political pamphlet "<a href="What%20Is%20To%20Be%20Done%3F">What Is To Be Done?</a>" in 1902; his most influential publication to date, it dealt with Lenin's thoughts on the need for a <a href="vanguard%20party">vanguard party</a> to lead the proletariat to revolution.

Nadya joined Lenin in Munich, becoming his personal secretary. They continued their political agitation, as Lenin wrote for "Iskra" and drafted the RSDLP programme, attacking ideological dissenters and external critics, particularly the <a href="Socialist%20Revolutionary%20Party">Socialist Revolutionary Party</a> (SR), a Narodnik agrarian-socialist group founded in 1901. Despite remaining a Marxist, he accepted the Narodnik view on the revolutionary power of the Russian peasantry, accordingly penning the 1903 pamphlet "To the Village Poor". To evade <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>n police, Lenin moved to London with "Iskra" in April 1902, there becoming friends with fellow Russian Marxist <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. In London, Lenin fell ill with <a href="erysipelas">erysipelas</a> and was unable to take such a leading role on the "Iskra" editorial board; in his absence, the board moved its base of operations to <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>.

The <a href="2nd%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">second RSDLP Congress</a> was held in London in July 1903. At the conference, a schism emerged between Lenin's supporters and those of <a href="Julius%20Martov">Julius Martov</a>. Martov argued that party members should be able to express themselves independently of the party leadership; Lenin disagreed, emphasising the need for a strong leadership with complete control over the party. Lenin's supporters were in the majority, and Lenin termed them the "majoritarians" ("bol'sheviki" in Russian; thus <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>); in response, Martov termed his followers the "minoritarians" ("men'sheviki" in Russian; thus <a href="Mensheviks">Mensheviks</a>). Arguments between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks continued after the conference; the Bolsheviks accused their rivals of being opportunists and reformists who lacked discipline, while the Mensheviks accused Lenin of being a despot and autocrat. Enraged at the Mensheviks, Lenin resigned from the "Iskra" editorial board and in May 1904 published the anti-Menshevik tract "<a href="One%20Step%20Forward%2C%20Two%20Steps%20Back">One Step Forward, Two Steps Back</a>". The stress made Lenin ill, and to recuperate he went on a hiking holiday in rural Switzerland. The Bolshevik faction grew in strength; by the spring, the whole RSDLP Central Committee was Bolshevik, and in December they founded the newspaper "<a href="Vpered%20%28newspaper%29">Vpered</a>" ("Forward").

In January 1905, the <a href="Bloody%20Sunday%20%281905%29">Bloody Sunday</a> massacre of protesters in St. Petersburg sparked a spate of civil unrest known as the <a href="Revolution%20of%201905">Revolution of 1905</a>. Lenin urged Bolsheviks to take a greater role in the events, encouraging violent insurrection. In doing so, he adopted SR slogans regarding "armed insurrection", "mass terror", and "the expropriation of gentry land", resulting in Menshevik accusations that he had deviated from orthodox Marxism. In turn, he insisted that the Bolsheviks split completely with the Mensheviks; many Bolsheviks refused, and both groups attended the <a href="3rd%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Third RSDLP Congress</a>, held in London in April 1905. Lenin presented many of his ideas in the pamphlet "<a href="Two%20Tactics%20of%20Social%20Democracy%20in%20the%20Democratic%20Revolution">Two Tactics of Social Democracy in the Democratic Revolution</a>", published in August 1905. Here, he predicted that Russia's liberal bourgeoisie would be sated by a transition to <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> and thus betray the revolution; instead he argued that the proletariat would have to build an alliance with the peasantry to overthrow the Tsarist regime and establish the "provisional revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry".

In response to the revolution of 1905, Tsar <a href="Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a> accepted a series of liberal reforms in his <a href="October%20Manifesto">October Manifesto</a>, after which Lenin felt it safe to return to St. Petersburg. Joining the editorial board of "Novaya Zhizn" (""New Life""), a radical legal newspaper run by <a href="Maria%20Fyodorovna%20Andreyeva">Maria Andreyeva</a>, he used it to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for a successful revolution. Recognising that membership fees and donations from a few wealthy sympathisers were insufficient to finance the Bolsheviks' activities, Lenin endorsed the idea of robbing post offices, railway stations, trains, and banks. Under the lead of <a href="Leonid%20Krasin">Leonid Krasin</a>, a group of Bolsheviks began carrying out such criminal actions, the best known taking place in June 1907, when a group of Bolsheviks acting under the leadership of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> committed <a href="1907%20Tiflis%20bank%20robbery">an armed robbery of the State Bank</a> in <a href="Tiflis">Tiflis</a>, Georgia.

Although he briefly supported the idea of reconciliation between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Lenin's advocacy of violence and robbery was condemned by the Mensheviks at the <a href="4th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Fourth Party Congress</a>, held in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> in April 1906. Lenin was involved in setting up a Bolshevik Centre in <a href="Repino%2C%20Saint%20Petersburg">Kuokkala</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Finland">Grand Duchy of Finland</a>, which was at the time a semi-autonomous part of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, before the Bolsheviks regained dominance of the RSDLP at its <a href="5th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Social%20Democratic%20Labour%20Party">Fifth Congress</a>, held in London in May 1907. As the Tsarist government cracked down on opposition – both by disbanding Russia's legislative assembly, the <a href="Second%20Duma">Second Duma</a>, and by ordering its <a href="secret%20police">secret police</a>, the <a href="Okhrana">Okhrana</a>, to arrest revolutionaries – Lenin fled Finland for Switzerland. There he tried to exchange those banknotes stolen in Tiflis that had identifiable serial numbers on them.

<a href="Alexander%20Bogdanov">Alexander Bogdanov</a> and other prominent Bolsheviks decided to relocate the Bolshevik Centre to Paris; although Lenin disagreed, he moved to the city in December 1908. Lenin disliked Paris, lambasting it as "a foul hole", and while there he sued a motorist who knocked him off his bike. Lenin became very critical of Bogdanov's view that Russia's proletariat had to develop a socialist culture in order to become a successful revolutionary vehicle. Instead, Lenin favoured a vanguard of socialist intelligentsia who would lead the working-classes in revolution. Furthermore, Bogdanov – influenced by <a href="Ernest%20Mach">Ernest Mach</a> – believed that all concepts of the world were relative, whereas Lenin stuck to the orthodox Marxist view that there was an objective reality independent of human observation. Bogdanov and Lenin holidayed together at <a href="Maxim%20Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a>'s villa in <a href="Capri">Capri</a> in April 1908; on returning to Paris, Lenin encouraged a split within the Bolshevik faction between his and Bogdanov's followers, accusing the latter of deviating from Marxism.

In May 1908, Lenin lived briefly in London, where he used the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> <a href="British%20Museum%20Reading%20Room">Reading Room</a> to write "<a href="Materialism%20and%20Empirio-criticism">Materialism and Empirio-criticism</a>", an attack on what he described as the "bourgeois-reactionary falsehood" of Bogdanov's relativism. Lenin's factionalism began to alienate increasing numbers of Bolsheviks, including his former close supporters <a href="Alexei%20Rykov">Alexei Rykov</a> and <a href="Lev%20Kamenev">Lev Kamenev</a>. The Okhrana exploited his factionalist attitude by sending a spy, <a href="Roman%20Malinovsky">Roman Malinovsky</a>, to act as a vocal Lenin supporter within the party. Various Bolsheviks expressed their suspicions about Malinovsky to Lenin, although it is unclear if the latter was aware of the spy's duplicity; it is possible that he used Malinovsky to feed false information to the Okhrana.

In August 1910, Lenin attended the <a href="International%20Socialist%20Congress%2C%20Copenhagen%2C%201910">Eighth Congress</a> of the <a href="Second%20International">Second International</a> – an international meeting of socialists – in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> as the RSDLP's representative, following this with a holiday in Stockholm with his mother. With his wife and sisters he then moved to France, settling first in <a href="Bombon%2C%20Seine-et-Marne">Bombon</a> and then Paris. Here, he became a close friend to the French Bolshevik <a href="Inessa%20Armand">Inessa Armand</a>; some biographers suggest that they had an extra-marital affair from 1910 to 1912. Meanwhile, at a Paris meeting in June 1911, the RSDLP Central Committee decided to move their focus of operations back to Russia, ordering the closure of the Bolshevik Centre and its newspaper, "Proletari". Seeking to rebuild his influence in the party, Lenin arranged for <a href="Prague%20Party%20Conference">a party conference</a> to be held in <a href="Prague">Prague</a> in January 1912, and although 16 of the 18 attendants were Bolsheviks, he was heavily criticised for his factionalist tendencies and failed to boost his status within the party.

Moving to <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia%20and%20Lodomeria">Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria</a>, a culturally Polish part of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, he used <a href="Jagellonian%20University">Jagellonian University</a>'s library to conduct research. He stayed in close contact with the RSDLP, which was operating in the Russian Empire, convincing the Duma's Bolshevik members to split from their parliamentary alliance with the Mensheviks. In January 1913, Stalin – whom Lenin referred to as the "wonderful Georgian" – visited him, and they discussed the future of non-Russian ethnic groups in the Empire. Due to the ailing health of both Lenin and his wife, they moved to the rural town of <a href="Bia%C5%82y%20Dunajec">Biały Dunajec</a>, before heading to <a href="Bern">Bern</a> for Nadya to have surgery on her <a href="goitre">goitre</a>.

Lenin was in <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a> when the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out. The war pitted the Russian Empire against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and due to his Russian citizenship, Lenin was arrested and briefly imprisoned until his anti-Tsarist credentials were explained. Lenin and his wife returned to Bern, before relocating to <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> in February 1916. Lenin was angry that the German Social-Democratic Party was supporting the German war effort – a direct contravention of the Second International's <a href="International%20Socialist%20Congress%2C%20Stuttgart%201907">Stuttgart resolution</a> that socialist parties would oppose the conflict – and thus saw the Second International as defunct. He attended the <a href="Zimmerwald%20Conference">Zimmerwald Conference</a> in September 1915 and the <a href="Kienthal%20Conference">Kienthal Conference</a> in April 1916, urging socialists across the continent to convert the "imperialist war" into a continent-wide "civil war" with the proletariat pitted against the bourgeoisie and aristocracy. In July 1916, Lenin's mother died, but he was unable to attend her funeral. Her death deeply affected him, and he became depressed, fearing that he too would die before seeing the proletarian revolution.

In September 1917, Lenin published "<a href="Imperialism%2C%20the%20Highest%20Stage%20of%20Capitalism">Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism</a>", which argued that <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a> was a product of <a href="monopoly%20capitalism">monopoly capitalism</a>, as capitalists sought to increase their profits by extending into new territories where wages were lower and raw materials cheaper. He believed that competition and conflict would increase and that war between the imperialist powers would continue until they were overthrown by proletariat revolution and socialism established. He spent much of this time reading the works of <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>, <a href="Ludwig%20Feuerbach">Ludwig Feuerbach</a>, and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, all of whom had been key influences on Marx. This changed Lenin's interpretation of Marxism; whereas he once believed that policies could be developed based on predetermined scientific principles, he concluded that the only test of whether a policy was correct was its practice. He still perceived himself as an orthodox Marxist, but he began to diverge from some of Marx's predictions about societal development; whereas Marx had believed that a "bourgeoisie-democratic revolution" of the middle-classes had to take place before a "socialist revolution" of the proletariat, Lenin believed that in Russia, the proletariat could overthrow the Tsarist regime without an intermediate revolution.

In February 1917, the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> broke out in St. Petersburg – renamed <a href="Petrograd">Petrograd</a> at the beginning of the First World War – as industrial workers went on strike over food shortages and deteriorating factory conditions. The unrest spread to other parts of Russia, and fearing that he would be violently overthrown, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated. The State Duma took over control of the country, establishing a <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a> and converting the Empire into a new <a href="Russian%20Republic">Russian Republic</a>. When Lenin learned of this from his base in Switzerland, he celebrated with other dissidents. He decided to return to Russia to take charge of the Bolsheviks, but found that most passages into the country were blocked due to the ongoing conflict. He organised a plan with other dissidents to negotiate a passage for them through Germany, with whom Russia was then at war. Recognising that these dissidents could cause problems for their Russian enemies, the German government agreed to permit 32 Russian citizens to travel in a <a href="sealed%20train">"sealed" train</a> carriage through their territory, among them Lenin and his wife. The group travelled by train from Zürich to <a href="Sassnitz">Sassnitz</a>, proceeding by ferry to <a href="Trelleborg">Trelleborg</a>, Sweden, and from there to the <a href="Haparanda">Haparanda</a>–<a href="Tornio">Tornio</a> border crossing and then to <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> before taking the final train to Petrograd.

Arriving at Petrograd's <a href="Finland%20Station">Finland Station</a>, Lenin gave a speech to Bolshevik supporters condemning the Provisional Government and again calling for a continent-wide European proletarian revolution. Over the following days, he spoke at Bolshevik meetings, lambasting those who wanted reconciliation with the Mensheviks and revealing his "<a href="April%20Theses">April Theses</a>", an outline of his plans for the Bolsheviks, which he had written on the journey from Switzerland. He publicly condemned both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries – who dominated the influential <a href="Petrograd%20Soviet">Petrograd Soviet</a> – for supporting the Provisional Government, denouncing them as traitors to socialism. Considering the government to be just as imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by <a href="Soviet%20%28council%29">soviet</a>s, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society. By contrast, the Mensheviks believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism and accused Lenin of trying to plunge the new Republic into civil war. Over the coming months, he campaigned for his policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for the Bolshevik newspaper "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>", and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.

Sensing growing frustration among Bolshevik supporters, Lenin suggested an armed political demonstration in Petrograd to test the government's response. Amid deteriorating health, he left the city to recuperate in the Finnish village of <a href="Neivola">Neivola</a>. The Bolsheviks' armed demonstration, the <a href="July%20Days">July Days</a>, took place while Lenin was away, but upon learning that demonstrators had violently clashed with government forces, he returned to Petrograd and called for calm. Responding to the violence, the government ordered the arrest of Lenin and other prominent Bolsheviks, raiding their offices, and publicly alleging that he was a German "<a href="agent%20provocateur">agent provocateur</a>". Evading arrest, Lenin hid in a series of Petrograd <a href="safe%20house">safe house</a>s. Fearing that he would be killed, Lenin and fellow senior Bolshevik <a href="Grigory%20Zinoviev">Grigory Zinoviev</a> escaped Petrograd in disguise, relocating to <a href="Razliv">Razliv</a>. There, Lenin began work on the book that became "<a href="The%20State%20and%20Revolution">The State and Revolution</a>", an exposition on how he believed the socialist state would develop after the proletariat revolution, and how from then on the state would gradually wither away, leaving a <a href="Pure%20communism">pure communist society</a>. He began arguing for a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection to topple the government, but at a clandestine meeting of the party's central committee this idea was rejected. Lenin then headed by train and by foot to Finland, arriving at Helsinki on 10 August, where he hid away in safe houses belonging to Bolshevik sympathisers.

In August 1917, while Lenin was in Finland, <a href="Lavr%20Kornilov">General Lavr Kornilov</a>, the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army, sent troops to Petrograd in what appeared to be a <a href="Kornilov%20Affair">military coup attempt</a> against the Provisional Government. Premier <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a> turned to the Petrograd Soviet – including its Bolshevik members – for help, allowing the revolutionaries to organise workers as <a href="Red%20Guards%20%28Russia%29">Red Guards</a> to defend the city. The coup petered out before it reached Petrograd, but the events had allowed the Bolsheviks to return to the open political arena. Fearing a counter-revolution from right-wing forces hostile to socialism, the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet had been instrumental in pressurising the government to normalise relations with the Bolsheviks. Both the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries had lost much popular support because of their affiliation with the Provisional Government and its unpopular continuation of the war. The Bolsheviks capitalised on this, and soon the pro-Bolshevik Marxist Trotsky was elected leader of the Petrograd Soviet. In September, the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the workers' sections of both the Moscow and Petrograd Soviets.

Recognising that the situation was safer for him, Lenin returned to Petrograd. There he attended a meeting of the Bolshevik Central Committee on 10 October, where he again argued that the party should lead an armed insurrection to topple the Provisional Government. This time the argument won with ten votes against two. Critics of the plan, Zinoviev and Kamenev, argued that Russian workers would not support a violent coup against the regime and that there was no clear evidence for Lenin's assertion that all of Europe was on the verge of proletarian revolution. The party began plans to organise the offensive, holding a final meeting at the <a href="Smolny%20Institute">Smolny Institute</a> on 24 October. This was the base of the <a href="Military%20Revolutionary%20Committee">Military Revolutionary Committee</a> (MRC), an armed militia largely loyal to the Bolsheviks that had been established by the Petrograd Soviet during Kornilov's alleged coup.

In October, the MRC was ordered to take control of Petrograd's key transport, communication, printing and utilities hubs, and did so without bloodshed. Bolsheviks besieged the government in the <a href="Winter%20Palace">Winter Palace</a>, and overcame it and arrested its ministers after the cruiser "<a href="Russian%20cruiser%20Aurora">Aurora</a>", controlled by Bolshevik seamen, fired on the building. During the insurrection, Lenin gave a speech to the Petrograd Soviet announcing that the Provisional Government had been overthrown. The Bolsheviks declared the formation of a new government, the <a href="Council%20of%20People%27s%20Commissars">Council of People's Commissars</a> or "Sovnarkom". Lenin initially turned down the leading position of <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Chairman</a>, suggesting Trotsky for the job, but other Bolsheviks insisted and ultimately Lenin relented. Lenin and other Bolsheviks then attended the <a href="All-Russian%20Congress%20of%20Soviets%23Second%20Congress">Second Congress of Soviets</a> on 26 and 27 October, and announced the creation of the new government. Menshevik attendees condemned the illegitimate seizure of power and the risk of civil war. In these early days of the new regime, Lenin avoided talking in Marxist and socialist terms so as not to alienate Russia's population, and instead spoke about having a country controlled by the workers. Lenin and many other Bolsheviks expected proletariat revolution to sweep across Europe in days or months.

The Provisional Government had planned for a Constituent Assembly to be elected in November 1917; against Lenin's objections, Sovnarkom agreed for the vote to take place as scheduled. In the <a href="Russian%20Constituent%20Assembly%20election%2C%201917">constitutional election</a>, the Bolsheviks gained approximately a quarter of the vote, being defeated by the agrarian-focused Socialist Revolutionary Party. Lenin argued that the election was not a fair reflection of the people's will, that the electorate had not had time to learn the Bolsheviks' political programme, and that the candidacy lists had been drawn up before the <a href="Left%20Socialist%20Revolutionaries">Left Socialist Revolutionaries</a> split from the Socialist Revolutionaries. Nevertheless, the newly elected <a href="Russian%20Constituent%20Assembly">Russian Constituent Assembly</a> convened in Petrograd in January 1918. Sovnarkom argued that it was counter-revolutionary because it sought to remove power from the soviets, but the Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviks denied this. The Bolsheviks presented the Assembly with a motion that would strip it of most of its legal powers; when the Assembly rejected the motion, Sovnarkom declared this as evidence of its counter-revolutionary nature and forcibly disbanded it.

Lenin rejected repeated calls – including from some Bolsheviks – to establish a coalition government with other socialist parties. Sovnarkom partially relented; although refusing a coalition with the Mensheviks or Socialist Revolutionaries, in December 1917 they allowed the Left Socialist Revolutionaries five posts in the cabinet. This coalition only lasted four months, until March 1918, when the Left Socialist Revolutionaries pulled out of the government over a disagreement about the Bolsheviks' approach to ending the First World War. At their <a href="7th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Communist%20Party%20%28Bolsheviks%29">7th Congress</a> in March 1918, the Bolsheviks changed their official name from the "Russian Social Democratic Labour Party" to the "Russian Communist Party", as Lenin wanted to both distance his group from the increasingly reformist German Social Democratic Party and to emphasise its ultimate goal: a communist society.

Although ultimate power officially rested with the country's government in the form of Sovnarkom and the <a href="All-Russian%20Central%20Executive%20Committee">Executive Committee</a> (VTSIK) elected by the <a href="All-Russian%20Congress%20of%20Soviets">All-Russian Congress of Soviets</a> (ARCS), the Communist Party was "de facto" in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no longer had a role in governing Russia. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets. Russia had become a <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a>.

Within the party was established a <a href="Politburo%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Political Bureau</a> ("Politburo") and <a href="Orgburo">Organisation Bureau</a> ("Orgburo") to accompany the existing <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Central Committee</a>; the decisions of these party bodies had to be adopted by Sovnarkom and the <a href="Council%20of%20Labor%20and%20Defense">Council of Labour and Defence</a>. Lenin was the most significant figure in this governance structure; as well as being the Chairman of Sovnarkom and sitting on the Council of Labour and Defence, he was on the Central Committee and Politburo of the Communist Party. The only individual to have anywhere near this influence was Lenin's right-hand man, <a href="Yakov%20Sverdlov">Yakov Sverdlov</a>, who died in March 1919 during a <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">flu pandemic</a>. In November 1917, Lenin and his wife took a two-room flat within the Smolny Institute; the following month they left for a brief holiday in Halia, Finland. In January 1918, he survived an assassination attempt in Petrograd; <a href="Fritz%20Platten">Fritz Platten</a>, who was with Lenin at the time, shielded him and was injured by a bullet.

Concerned that the German Army posed a threat to Petrograd, in March 1918 Sovnarkom relocated to Moscow, initially as a temporary measure. There, Lenin, Trotsky, and other Bolshevik leaders moved into the <a href="Kremlin">Kremlin</a>, where Lenin lived with his wife and sister Maria in a first floor apartment adjacent to the room in which the Sovnarkom meetings were held. Lenin disliked Moscow, but rarely left the city centre during the rest of his life. He survived a second assassination attempt, in Moscow in August 1918; he was shot following a public speech and injured badly. A Socialist Revolutionary, <a href="Fanny%20Kaplan">Fanny Kaplan</a>, was arrested and executed. The attack was widely covered in the Russian press, generating much sympathy for Lenin and boosting his popularity. As a respite, in September 1918 he was driven to the <a href="Gorki%20Leninskiye">Gorki estate</a>, just outside Moscow, recently acquired for him by the government.

Upon taking power, Lenin's regime issued a series of decrees. The first was a <a href="Decree%20on%20Land">Decree on Land</a>, which declared that the <a href="landed%20estate">landed estate</a>s of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for <a href="Collective%20farming">agricultural collectivisation</a> but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, the government issued the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary. They claimed the measure would be temporary; the decree was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">freedom of the press</a>.

In November 1917, Lenin issued the <a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20the%20Peoples%20of%20Russia">Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia</a>, which stated that non-Russian ethnic groups living inside the Republic had the right to cede from Russian authority and establish their own independent nation-states. Many nations declared independence: <a href="Finnish%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Finland</a> and <a href="Act%20of%20Independence%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuania in December 1917</a>, Latvia and Ukraine in January 1918, <a href="Estonian%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Estonia in February 1918</a>, <a href="Transcaucasian%20Democratic%20Federative%20Republic">Transcaucasia in April 1918</a>, and <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Poland in November 1918</a>. Soon, the Bolsheviks actively promoted communist parties in these independent nation-states, while in July 1918, at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of the Soviets, a constitution was approved that reformed the Russian Republic into the <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a>. Seeking to modernise the country, the government officially converted Russia from the <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a> to the <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> used in Europe.

In November 1917, Sovnarkom issued a decree abolishing Russia's legal system, calling on the use of "revolutionary conscience" to replace the abolished laws. The courts were replaced by a two-tier system: <a href="Revolutionary%20tribunal%20%28Russia%29">Revolutionary Tribunals</a> to deal with counter-revolutionary crimes, and <a href="People%27s%20Court%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">People's Courts</a> to deal with civil and other criminal offences. They were instructed to ignore pre-existing laws, and base their rulings on the Sovnarkom decrees and a "socialist sense of justice". November also saw an overhaul of the armed forces; Sovnarkom implemented <a href="Egalitarianism">egalitarian</a> measures, abolished previous ranks, titles, and medals, and called on soldiers to establish committees to elect their commanders.

In October 1917, Lenin issued a decree limiting work for everyone in Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated that the government would guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a <a href="Likbez">literacy campaign</a> was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, by giving them economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, <a href="Zhenotdel">Zhenotdel</a>, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed the separation of church and state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.

In November 1917, Lenin issued the Decree on Workers' Control, which called on the workers of each enterprise to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a <a href="Supreme%20Council%20of%20the%20National%20Economy">Supreme Council of the National Economy</a> (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation did not take place until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.

A faction of the Bolsheviks known as the "<a href="Left%20communism">Left Communists</a>" criticised Sovnarkom's economic policy as too moderate; they wanted nationalisation of all industry, agriculture, trade, finance, transport, and communication. Lenin believed that this was impractical at that stage, and that the government should only nationalise Russia's large-scale capitalist enterprises, such as the banks, railways, larger landed estates, and larger factories and mines, allowing smaller businesses to operate privately until they grew large enough to be successfully nationalised. Lenin also disagreed with the Left Communists about economic organisation; in June 1918, he argued that centralised economic control of industry was needed, whereas Left Communists wanted each factory to be controlled by its workers, a <a href="syndicalism">syndicalist</a> approach that Lenin considered detrimental to the cause of socialism.

Adopting a <a href="Left-libertarianism">left libertarian</a> perspective, both the Left Communists and other factions in the Communist Party critiqued the decline of democratic institutions in Russia. Internationally, many socialists decried Lenin's regime and denied that he was establishing socialism; in particular, they highlighted the lack of widespread political participation, popular consultation, and industrial democracy. In late 1918, the Czech-Austrian Marxist <a href="Karl%20Kautsky">Karl Kautsky</a> authored an <a href="Anti-Leninism">anti-Leninist</a> pamphlet condemning the anti-democratic nature of Soviet Russia, to which Lenin published a vociferous reply. German Marxist <a href="Rosa%20Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a> echoed Kautsky's views, while the Russian <a href="anarchism">anarchist</a> <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a> described the Bolshevik seizure of power as "the burial of the Russian Revolution".

Upon taking power, Lenin believed that a key policy of his government must be to withdraw from the First World War by establishing an armistice with the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> of Germany and Austria-Hungary. He believed that ongoing war would create resentment among war-weary Russian troops – to whom he had promised peace – and that these troops and the advancing German Army threatened both his own government and the cause of international socialism. By contrast, other Bolsheviks – in particular <a href="Nikolai%20Bukharin">Nikolai Bukharin</a> and the Left Communists – believed that peace with the Central Powers would be a betrayal of international socialism and that Russia should instead wage "a war of revolutionary defence" that would provoke an uprising of the German proletariat against their own government.

Lenin proposed a three-month armistice in his <a href="Decree%20on%20Peace">Decree on Peace</a> of November 1917, which was approved by the <a href="Second%20Congress%20of%20Soviets">Second Congress of Soviets</a> and presented to the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. The Germans responded positively, viewing this as an opportunity to focus on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> and stave off looming defeat. In November, armistice talks began at <a href="Brest-Litovsk">Brest-Litovsk</a>, the headquarters of the German high command on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a>, with the Russian delegation being led by Trotsky and <a href="Adolph%20Joffe">Adolph Joffe</a>. Meanwhile, a ceasefire until January was agreed. During negotiations, the Germans insisted on keeping their wartime conquests – which included Poland, Lithuania, and <a href="Courland">Courland</a> – whereas the Russians countered that this was a violation of these nations' rights to self-determination. Some Bolsheviks had expressed hopes of dragging out negotiations until proletarian revolution broke out throughout Europe. On 7 January 1918, Trotsky returned from Brest-Litovsk to St. Petersburg with an ultimatum from the Central Powers: either Russia accept Germany's territorial demands or the war would resume.

In January and again in February, Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to accept Germany's proposals. He argued that the territorial losses were acceptable if it ensured the survival of the Bolshevik-led government. The majority of Bolsheviks rejected his position, hoping to prolong the armistice and call Germany's bluff. On 18 February, the German Army launched <a href="Operation%20Faustschlag">Operation Faustschlag</a>, advancing further into Russian-controlled territory and conquering <a href="Dvinsk">Dvinsk</a> within a day. At this point, Lenin finally convinced a small majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee to accept the Central Powers' demands. On 23 February, the Central Powers issued a new ultimatum: Russia had to recognise German control not only of Poland and the Baltic states but also of Ukraine, or face a full-scale invasion.

On 3 March, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> was signed. It resulted in massive territorial losses for Russia, with 26% of the former Empire's population, 37% of its agricultural harvest area, 28% of its industry, 26% of its railway tracks, and three-quarters of its coal and iron deposits being transferred to German control. Accordingly, the Treaty was deeply unpopular across Russia's political spectrum, and several Bolsheviks and Left Socialist Revolutionaries resigned from Sovnarkom in protest. After the Treaty, Sovnarkom focused on trying to foment proletarian revolution in Germany, issuing an array of anti-war and anti-government publications in the country; the German government retaliated by expelling Russia's diplomats. The Treaty nevertheless failed to stop the Central Powers' defeat; in November 1918, the German Emperor <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a> resigned and the country's new administration signed the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">Armistice</a> with the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a>. As a result, Sovnarkom proclaimed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk void.

By early 1918, many cities in western Russia faced famine as a result of chronic food shortages. Lenin blamed this on the <a href="kulaks">kulaks</a>, or wealthier peasants, who allegedly hoarded the grain that they had produced to increase its financial value. In May 1918, he issued a requisitioning order that established armed detachments to confiscate grain from kulaks for distribution in the cities, and in June called for the formation of <a href="Committees%20of%20Poor%20Peasants">Committees of Poor Peasants</a> to aid in requisitioning. This policy resulted in vast social disorder and violence, as armed detachments often clashed with peasant groups, helping to set the stage for the civil war. A prominent example of Lenin's views was his <a href="Lenin%27s%20Hanging%20Order">August 1918 telegram to the Bolsheviks of Penza</a>, which called upon them to suppress a peasant insurrection by publicly hanging at least 100 "known kulaks, rich men, [and] bloodsuckers".

Requisitioning disincentivised peasants from producing more grain than they could personally consume, and thus production slumped. A booming <a href="black%20market">black market</a> supplemented the official state-sanctioned economy, and Lenin called on <a href="Speculation">speculators</a>, black marketeers and <a href="looting">looters</a> to be shot. Both the Socialist Revolutionaries and Left Socialist Revolutionaries condemned the armed appropriations of grain at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets in July 1918. Realising that the Committees of the Poor Peasants were also persecuting peasants who were not kulaks and thus contributing to anti-government feeling among the peasantry, in December 1918 Lenin abolished them.

Lenin repeatedly emphasised the need for terror and violence in overthrowing the old order and ensuring the success of the revolution. Speaking to the <a href="All-Russian%20Central%20Executive%20Committee">All-Russian Central Executive Committee</a> of the Soviets in November 1917, he declared that "the state is an institution built up for the sake of exercising violence. Previously, this violence was exercised by a handful of moneybags over the entire people; now we want ... to organise violence in the interests of the people." He strongly opposed suggestions to abolish capital punishment. Fearing anti-Bolshevik forces would overthrow his administration, in December 1917 Lenin ordered the establishment of the <a href="Cheka">Emergency Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage</a>, or Cheka, a political police force led by <a href="Felix%20Dzerzhinsky">Felix Dzerzhinsky</a>.

In September 1918, Sovnarkom passed a decree that inaugurated the <a href="Red%20Terror">Red Terror</a>, a system of repression orchestrated by the Cheka. Although sometimes described as an attempt to eliminate the entire bourgeoisie, Lenin did not want to exterminate all members of this class, merely those who sought to reinstate their rule. The majority of the Terror's victims were well-to-do citizens or former members of the Tsarist administration; others were non-bourgeois anti-Bolsheviks and perceived social undesirables such as prostitutes. The Cheka claimed the right to both sentence and execute anyone whom it deemed to be an enemy of the government, without recourse to the Revolutionary Tribunals. Accordingly, throughout Soviet Russia the Cheka carried out killings, often in large numbers. For example, the Petrograd Cheka executed 512 people in a few days. There are no surviving records to provide an accurate figure of how many perished in the Red Terror; later estimates of historians have ranged between 10,000 and 15,000, and 50,000 to 140,000.

Lenin never witnessed this violence or participated in it first-hand, and publicly distanced himself from it. His published articles and speeches rarely called for executions, but he regularly did so in his coded telegrams and confidential notes. Many Bolsheviks expressed disapproval of the Cheka's mass executions and feared the organisation's apparent unaccountability. The Party tried to restrain its activities in February 1919, stripping it of its powers of tribunal and execution in those areas not under official <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>, but the Cheka continued as before in swathes of the country. By 1920, the Cheka had become the most powerful institution in Soviet Russia, exerting influence over all other state apparatus.

A decree in April 1919 resulted in the establishment of <a href="Internment">concentration camps</a>, which were entrusted to the Cheka, later administered by a new government agency, <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a>. By the end of 1920, 84 camps had been established across Soviet Russia, holding about 50,000 prisoners; by October 1923, this had grown to 315 camps and about 70,000 inmates. Those interned in the camps were used as <a href="slave%20labour">slave labour</a>. From July 1922, intellectuals deemed to be opposing the Bolshevik government were exiled to inhospitable regions or deported from Russia altogether; Lenin personally scrutinised the lists of those to be dealt with in this manner. In May 1922, Lenin issued a decree calling for the execution of anti-Bolshevik priests, causing between 14,000 and 20,000 deaths. The Russian Orthodox Church was worst affected; the government's anti-religious policies also impacted on <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> churches, <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> synagogues, and <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> mosques.

Lenin expected Russia's aristocracy and bourgeoisie to oppose his government, but he believed that the numerical superiority of the lower classes, coupled with the Bolsheviks' ability to effectively organise them, guaranteed a swift victory in any conflict. In this, he failed to anticipate the intensity of the violent opposition to Bolshevik rule in Russia. The ensuing <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> pitted the pro-Bolshevik Reds against the anti-Bolshevik <a href="White%20movement">Whites</a>, but also encompassed ethnic conflicts on Russia's borders and conflict between both Red and White armies and local peasant groups, the <a href="Green%20armies">Green armies</a>, throughout the former Empire. Accordingly, various historians have seen the civil war as representing two distinct conflicts: one between the revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries, and the other between different revolutionary factions.

The White armies were established by former Tsarist military officers, and included <a href="Anton%20Denikin">Anton Denikin</a>'s <a href="Volunteer%20Army">Volunteer Army</a> in <a href="South%20Russia%20%281919%E2%80%931920%29">South Russia</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Kolchak">Alexander Kolchak</a>'s forces in Siberia, and <a href="Nikolai%20Yudenich">Nikolai Yudenich</a>'s troops in the newly independent Baltic states. The Whites were bolstered when 35,000 members of the <a href="Czechoslovak%20Legion">Czech Legion</a> – <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> from the conflict with the Central Powers – turned against Sovnarkom and allied with the <a href="Committee%20of%20Members%20of%20the%20Constituent%20Assembly">Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly</a> (Komuch), an anti-Bolshevik government established in Samara. The Whites were also backed by Western governments who perceived the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a betrayal of the Allied war effort and feared the Bolsheviks' calls for world revolution. In 1918, the United Kingdom, France, United States, Canada, Italy, and Serbia landed 10,000 troops in <a href="Murmansk">Murmansk</a>, seizing <a href="Kandalaksha">Kandalaksha</a>, while later that year British, American, and Japanese forces landed in <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>. Western troops soon pulled out of the civil war, instead only supporting the Whites with officers, technicians and armaments, but Japan remained because they saw the conflict as an opportunity for territorial expansion.

Lenin tasked Trotsky with establishing a <a href="Red%20Army">Workers' and Peasants' Red Army</a>, and with his support, Trotsky organised a <a href="Revolutionary%20Military%20Council">Revolutionary Military Council</a> in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, as well as most of <a href="Great%20Russia">Great Russia</a>, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries. The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the <a href="White%20Terror%20%28Russia%29">White Terror</a>, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.

In July 1918, Sverdlov informed Sovnarkom that the Ural Regional Soviet had overseen the <a href="Execution%20of%20the%20Romanov%20family">execution of the former Tsar and his immediate family</a> in <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> to prevent them from being rescued by advancing White troops. Although lacking proof, biographers and historians like <a href="Richard%20Pipes">Richard Pipes</a> and <a href="Dmitri%20Volkogonov">Dmitri Volkogonov</a> have expressed the view that the killing was probably sanctioned by Lenin; conversely, historian James Ryan cautioned that there was "no reason" to believe this. Whether Lenin sanctioned it or not, he still regarded it as necessary, highlighting the precedent set by the <a href="execution%20of%20Louis%20XVI">execution of Louis XVI</a> in the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>.

After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had abandoned the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary <a href="Yakov%20Grigorevich%20Blumkin">Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin</a> assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Mirbach">Wilhelm von Mirbach</a>, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident would lead to a relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then <a href="Left%20SR%20uprising">launched a coup in Moscow</a>, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.

By 1919, the White armies were in retreat and by the start of 1920 were defeated on all three fronts. Although Sovnarkom were victorious, the territorial extent of the Russian state had been reduced, for many non-Russian ethnic groups had used the disarray to push for national independence. In some cases—such as the north-eastern European nations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Finland—the Soviets recognised their independence and concluded peace treaties. In other cases, the Red Army suppressed secessionist movements; by 1921 they had defeated the Ukrainian national movements and occupied the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, although <a href="Basmachi%20movement">fighting</a> in <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> lasted until the late 1920s.

After the German <a href="Ober%20Ost">Ober Ost</a> garrisons were withdrawn from the Eastern Front following the Armistice, <a href="Soviet%20westward%20offensive%20of%201918%E2%80%9319">both Soviet Russian armies</a> and Polish ones moved in to fill the vacuum. The newly independent Polish state and the Soviet government each sought territorial expansion in the region. Polish and Russian troops first clashed in February 1919, with the conflict developing into the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a>. Unlike the Soviets' previous conflicts, this had greater implications for the export of revolution and the future of Europe. Polish forces pushed into Ukraine and by May 1920 <a href="Kiev%20Offensive%20%281920%29">had taken</a> <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> from the Soviets. After forcing the <a href="Polish%20Army">Polish Army</a> back, Lenin urged the Red Army to invade Poland itself, believing that the Polish proletariat would rise up to support the Russian troops and thus spark European revolution. Trotsky and other Bolsheviks were sceptical, but agreed to the invasion. The Polish proletariat did not rise, and the Red Army was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Warsaw%20%281920%29">Battle of Warsaw</a>. The Polish armies pushed the Red Army back into Russia, forcing Sovnarkom to sue for peace; the war culminated in the <a href="Peace%20of%20Riga">Peace of Riga</a>, in which Russia ceded territory to Poland.

After the Armistice on the Western Front, Lenin believed that the breakout of European revolution was imminent. Seeking to promote this, Sovnarkom supported the establishment of <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Kun">Béla Kun</a>'s <a href="Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic">communist government in Hungary</a> in March 1919, followed by the <a href="Bavarian%20Council%20Republic">communist government in Bavaria</a> and <a href="Revolutions%20of%201917%E2%80%9323">various revolutionary socialist uprisings</a> in other parts of Germany, including <a href="Spartacist%20uprising">that of the Spartacus League</a>. During Russia's Civil War, the Red Army was sent into the newly independent national republics on Russia's borders to aid Marxists there in establishing soviet systems of government. In Europe, this resulted in the creation of new communist-led states in <a href="Commune%20of%20the%20Working%20People%20of%20Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="Latvian%20Socialist%20Soviet%20Republic">Latvia</a>, <a href="Lithuanian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic%20%281918%E2%80%9319%29">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Socialist%20Soviet%20Republic%20of%20Byelorussia">Belarus</a>, and <a href="Ukrainian%20Soviet%20Republic">Ukraine</a>, all of which were officially independent of Russia, while further east it led to the creation of communist governments in <a href="Georgian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Georgia</a>, and then in <a href="Mongolian%20People%27s%20Republic">Outer Mongolia</a>. Various senior Bolsheviks wanted these absorbed into the Russian state; Lenin insisted that national sensibilities should be respected, but reassured his comrades that these nations' new Communist Party administrations were under the "de facto" authority of Sovnarkom.

In late 1918, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">British Labour Party</a> called for the establishment of an international conference of socialist parties, the <a href="Labour%20and%20Socialist%20International">Labour and Socialist International</a>. Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international socialist conference to offset its impact. Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, Trotsky, <a href="Christian%20Rakovsky">Christian Rakovsky</a>, and <a href="Angelica%20Balabanoff">Angelica Balabanoff</a>, the <a href="1st%20Congress%20of%20the%20Comintern">First Congress</a> of this <a href="Communist%20International">Communist International</a> ("Comintern") opened in Moscow in March 1919. It lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within the countries of the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in their own nations. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings, with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern. During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments. While Zinoviev became Comintern's President, Lenin retained significant influence over it.

The <a href="2nd%20World%20Congress%20of%20the%20Comintern">Second Congress of the Communist International</a> opened in Petrograd's <a href="Smolny%20Institute">Smolny Institute</a> in July 1920, representing the last time that Lenin visited a city other than Moscow. There, he encouraged foreign delegates to emulate the Bolsheviks' seizure of power, and abandoned his longstanding viewpoint that capitalism was a necessary stage in societal development, instead encouraging those nations under colonial occupation to transform their pre-capitalist societies directly into socialist ones. For this conference, he authored "", a short book articulating his criticism of elements within the British and German communist parties who refused to enter their nations' parliamentary systems and trade unions; instead he urged them to do so to advance the revolutionary cause. The conference had to be suspended for several days due to the ongoing war with Poland, and was relocated to Moscow, where it continued to hold sessions until August. Lenin's predicted world revolution did not materialise, as the Hungarian communist government was overthrown and the German Marxist uprisings suppressed.

Within the Communist Party, there was dissent from two factions, the <a href="Group%20of%20Democratic%20Centralism">Group of Democratic Centralism</a> and the <a href="Workers%27%20Opposition">Workers' Opposition</a>, both of which accused the Russian state of being too centralised and bureaucratic. The Workers' Opposition, which had connections to the official state trade unions, also expressed the concern that the government had lost the trust of the Russian working class. They were angered by Trotsky's suggestion that the trade unions be eliminated. He deemed the unions to be superfluous in a "<a href="workers%27%20state">workers' state</a>", but Lenin disagreed, believing it best to retain them; most Bolsheviks embraced Lenin's view in the 'trade union discussion'. To deal with the dissent, at the <a href="10th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Russian%20Communist%20Party%20%28Bolsheviks%29">Tenth Party Congress</a> in February 1921, Lenin introduced a ban on factional activity within the party, under pain of expulsion.

Caused in part by a drought, the <a href="Russian%20famine%20of%201921">Russian famine of 1921</a> was the most severe that the country had experienced since <a href="Russian%20famine%20of%201891%E2%80%9392">that of 1891</a>, resulting in around five million deaths. The famine was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the famine victims, the US government established an <a href="American%20Relief%20Administration">American Relief Administration</a> to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored. During the famine, <a href="Patriarch%20Tikhon">Patriarch Tikhon</a> called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be <a href="1922%20confiscation%20of%20Russian%20Orthodox%20Church%20property">forcibly appropriated and sold</a>. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.

In 1920 and 1921, local opposition to requisitioning resulted in anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings breaking out across Russia, which were suppressed. Among the most significant was the <a href="Tambov%20Rebellion">Tambov Rebellion</a>, which was put down by the Red Army. In February 1921, workers went on strike in Petrograd, resulting in the government proclaiming martial law in the city and sending in the Red Army to quell demonstrations. In March, the <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a> began when sailors in <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> revolted against the Bolshevik government, demanding that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that independent trade unions be given freedom of assembly and that peasants be allowed free markets and not be subject to requisitioning. Lenin declared that the mutineers had been misled by the Socialist Revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, calling for violent reprisals. Under Trotsky's leadership, the Red Army put down the rebellion on 17 March, resulting in thousands of deaths and the internment of survivors in labour camps.

In February 1921, Lenin introduced a <a href="New%20Economic%20Policy">New Economic Policy</a> (NEP) to the Politburo; he convinced most senior Bolsheviks of its necessity and it passed into law in April. Lenin explained the policy in a booklet, "On the Food Tax", in which he stated that the NEP represented a return to the original Bolshevik economic plans; he claimed that these had been derailed by the civil war, in which Sovnarkom had been forced to resort to the economic policies of "<a href="war%20communism">war communism</a>". The NEP allowed some private enterprise within Russia, permitting the reintroduction of the wage system and allowing peasants to sell produce on the open market while being taxed on their earnings. The policy also allowed for a return to privately owned small industry; basic industry, transport and foreign trade remained under state control. Lenin termed this "<a href="state%20capitalism">state capitalism</a>", and many Bolsheviks thought it to be a betrayal of socialist principles. Lenin biographers have often characterised the introduction of the NEP as one of his most significant achievements and some believe that had it not been implemented then Sovnarkom would have been quickly overthrown by popular uprisings.

In January 1920, the government brought in universal labour conscription, ensuring that all citizens aged between 16 and 50 had to work. Lenin also called for a mass electrification project, the <a href="GOELRO%20plan">GOELRO plan</a>, which began in February 1920; Lenin's declaration that "communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country" was widely cited in later years. Seeking to advance the Russian economy through foreign trade, Sovnarkom sent delegates to the <a href="Genoa%20Conference%20%281922%29">Genoa Conference</a>; Lenin had hoped to attend but was prevented by ill health. The conference resulted in a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Rapallo%20%281922%29">Russian agreement with Germany</a>, which followed on from an earlier <a href="Anglo-Soviet%20Trade%20Agreement">trade agreement with the United Kingdom</a>. Lenin hoped that by allowing foreign corporations to invest in Russia, Sovnarkom would exacerbate rivalries between the capitalist nations and hasten their downfall; he tried to rent the oil fields of <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a> to an American corporation to heighten tensions between the US and Japan, who desired Kamchatka for their empire.

To Lenin's embarrassment and horror, in April 1920 the Bolsheviks held a party to celebrate his fiftieth birthday, which was also marked by widespread celebrations across Russia and the publication of poems and biographies dedicated to him. Between 1920 and 1926, twenty volumes of Lenin's "Collected Works" were published; some material was omitted. During 1920, several prominent Western figures visited Lenin in Russia; these included the author <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> and the philosopher <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, as well as the anarchists <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>. Lenin was also visited at the Kremlin by Armand, who was in increasingly poor health. He sent her to a sanatorium in <a href="Kislovodsk">Kislovodsk</a> in the Northern Caucasus to recover, but she died there in September 1920 during a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemic. Her body was transported to Moscow, where a visibly grief-stricken Lenin oversaw her burial beneath the Kremlin Wall.

Lenin was seriously ill by the latter half of 1921, suffering from <a href="hyperacusis">hyperacusis</a>, <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>, and regular headaches. At the Politburo's insistence, in July he left Moscow for a month's leave at his Gorki mansion, where he was cared for by his wife and sister. Lenin began to contemplate the possibility of suicide, asking both Krupskaya and Stalin to acquire <a href="potassium%20cyanide">potassium cyanide</a> for him. Twenty-six physicians were hired to help Lenin during his final years; many of them were foreign and had been hired at great expense. Some suggested that his sickness could have been caused by metal <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> from the <a href="bullet">bullet</a>s that were lodged in his body from the 1918 assassination attempt; in April 1922 he underwent a surgical operation to remove them. The symptoms continued after this, with Lenin's doctors unsure of the cause; some suggested that he was suffering from <a href="neurasthenia">neurasthenia</a> or <a href="cerebral%20arteriosclerosis">cerebral arteriosclerosis</a>; others believed that he had <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, an idea endorsed in a 2004 report by a team of neuroscientists, who suggested that this was later deliberately concealed by the government. In May 1922, he suffered his first stroke, temporarily losing his ability to speak and being paralysed on his right side. He convalesced at Gorki, and had largely recovered by July. In October he returned to Moscow; in December he suffered a second stroke and returned to Gorki.

Despite his illness, Lenin remained keenly interested in political developments. When the Socialist Revolutionary Party's leadership was found guilty of conspiring against the government in a trial held between June and August 1922, Lenin called for their execution; they were instead imprisoned indefinitely, only being executed during the <a href="Great%20Purges">Great Purges</a> of Stalin's leadership. With Lenin's support, the government also succeeded in virtually eradicating Menshevism in Russia by expelling all Mensheviks from state institutions and enterprises in March 1923 and then imprisoning the party's membership in concentration camps. Lenin was concerned by the survival of the Tsarist bureaucratic system in Soviet Russia, and became increasingly worried by this in his final years. Condemning bureaucratic attitudes, he suggested a total overhaul to deal with such problems, in one letter complaining that "we are being sucked into a foul bureaucratic swamp".

Krupskaya later produced a document that came to be known as "<a href="Lenin%27s%20Testament">Lenin's Testament</a>"; she stated that her husband had dictated it between December 1922 and January 1923. The document discussed the personal qualities of Lenin's comrades, particularly Trotsky and Stalin. It recommended that Stalin be removed from the position of General Secretary of the Communist Party, deeming him ill-suited for the position. Instead it recommended Trotsky for the job, describing him as "the most capable man in the present Central Committee"; it highlighted Trotsky's superior intellect but at the same time criticised his self-assurance and inclination toward excess administration. Some historians have questioned whether Lenin ever produced the document, suggesting instead that it may have been written by Krupskaya, who had personal differences with Stalin; Stalin never publicly voiced concerns about its authenticity. During this period, Lenin dictated a criticism of the bureaucratic nature of the <a href="Workers%27%20and%20Peasants%27%20Inspectorate">Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate</a>, calling for the recruitment of new, working-class staff as an antidote to this problem, while in another article he called for the state to combat illiteracy, promote punctuality and conscientiousness within the populace, and encourage peasants to join cooperatives.

In Lenin's absence, Stalin had begun consolidating his power both by appointing his supporters to prominent positions, and by cultivating an image of himself as Lenin's closest intimate and deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin's regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who had access to him. Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should retain its monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing his annoyance.

The most significant political division between the two emerged during the <a href="Georgian%20Affair">Georgian Affair</a>. Stalin had suggested that both Georgia and neighbouring countries like Azerbaijan and Armenia should be merged into the Russian state, despite the protestations of their national governments. Lenin saw this as an expression of Great Russian ethnic chauvinism by Stalin and his supporters, instead calling for these nation-states to join Russia as semi-independent parts of a greater union, which he suggested be called the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia. After some resistance to the proposal, Stalin eventually accepted it, but – with Lenin's agreement – he changed the name of the newly proposed state to the <a href="Union%20of%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republics">Union of Soviet Socialist Republics</a> (USSR). Lenin sent Trotsky to speak on his behalf at a Central Committee plenum in December, where the plans for the USSR were sanctioned; these plans were then ratified on 30 December by the Congress of Soviets, resulting in the formation of the Soviet Union. Despite his poor health, Lenin was elected chairman of the new government of the Soviet Union.

In March 1923, Lenin suffered a third stroke and lost his ability to speak; that month, he experienced partial paralysis on his right side and began exhibiting <a href="sensory%20aphasia">sensory aphasia</a>. By May, he appeared to be making a slow recovery, regaining some of his mobility, speech, and writing skills. In October, he made a final visit to the Kremlin. In his final weeks, Lenin was visited by Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Bukharin, with the latter visiting him at his Gorki mansion on the day of his death. On 21 January 1924, Lenin fell into a coma and died later that day. His official cause of death was recorded as an incurable disease of the blood vessels.

The government publicly announced Lenin's death the following day. On 23 January, mourners from the Communist Party, trade unions, and soviets visited his Gorki home to inspect the body, which was carried aloft in a red coffin by leading Bolsheviks. Transported by train to Moscow, the coffin was taken to the <a href="House%20of%20Trade%20Unions">House of Trade Unions</a>, where the body <a href="Lying%20in%20state">lay in state</a>.
Over the next three days, around a million mourners came to see the body, many queuing for hours in the freezing conditions. On 26 January, the eleventh All-Union Congress of Soviets met to pay respects to the leader, with speeches being made by Kalinin, Zinoviev, and Stalin, but notably not Trotsky, who had been convalescing in the Caucasus. Lenin's funeral took place the following day, when his body was carried to Red Square, accompanied by martial music, where assembled crowds listened to a series of speeches before the corpse was placed into the vault of a specially erected mausoleum. Despite the freezing temperatures, tens of thousands attended.

Against Krupskaya's protestations, Lenin's body was embalmed to preserve it for long-term public display in the Red Square mausoleum. During this process, Lenin's brain was removed; in 1925 an institute was established to dissect it, revealing that Lenin had suffered from severe <a href="sclerosis%20%28medicine%29">sclerosis</a>.
In July 1929, the Politburo agreed to replace the temporary mausoleum with a permanent granite alternative, which was finished in 1933. The sarcophagus in which Lenin's corpse was contained was replaced in 1940 and again in 1970. From 1941 to 1945 the body was moved from Moscow and stored in <a href="Tyumen">Tyumen</a> for safety amid the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. As of 2017 the body remains on public display in <a href="Lenin%27s%20Mausoleum">Lenin's Mausoleum</a> on <a href="Red%20Square">Red Square</a>.

Lenin was a devout Marxist, and believed that his interpretation of Marxism – first termed "Leninism" by Martov in 1904 – was the sole authentic and orthodox one. According to his Marxist perspective, humanity would eventually reach pure communism, becoming a stateless, classless, egalitarian society of workers who were free from <a href="Exploitation%20of%20labour">exploitation</a> and <a href="Marx%27s%20theory%20of%20alienation">alienation</a>, controlled their own destiny, and abided by the rule "<a href="from%20each%20according%20to%20his%20ability%2C%20to%20each%20according%20to%20his%20needs">from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs</a>". According to Volkogonov, Lenin "deeply and sincerely" believed that the path he was setting Russia on would ultimately lead to the establishment of this communist society.

Lenin's Marxist beliefs led him to the view that society could not transform directly from its present state to communism, but must first enter a period of socialism, and so his main concern was how to convert Russia into a socialist society. To do so, he believed that a "dictatorship of the proletariat" was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy. He defined socialism as "an order of civilized co-operators in which the <a href="means%20of%20production">means of production</a> are socially owned", and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a <a href="Post-scarcity%20economy">society of abundance</a>. To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with – in his words – "all citizens" becoming "hired employees of the state". Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and <a href="statism">statist</a>, with both production and distribution strictly controlled. He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation. In this way, his calls for "workers' control" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a "workers' state". This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.

Before 1914, Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy. Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists, his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement, including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists. He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances, including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse. Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.

In his theoretical writings, particularly "Imperialism", Lenin discussed what he regarded as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it had reached a new stage: <a href="state%20monopoly%20capitalism">state monopoly capitalism</a>. He believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its <a href="Emancipation">liberationist</a> vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.

Lenin believed that the <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democracy</a> of capitalist countries gave the illusion of democracy while maintaining the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie"; describing the representative democratic system of the United States, he referred to the "spectacular and meaningless duels between two bourgeois parties", both of whom were led by "astute multimillionaires" that exploited the American proletariat. He opposed liberalism, exhibiting a general antipathy toward <a href="liberty">liberty</a> as a value, and believing that liberalism's freedoms were fraudulent because it did not free labourers from capitalist exploitation.

He declared that "Soviet government is many millions of times more democratic than the most democratic-bourgeois republic", the latter of which was simply "a democracy for the rich". He regarded his "dictatorship of the proletariat" as democratic because, he claimed, it involved the election of representatives to the <a href="Soviet%20%28council%29">soviets</a>, workers electing their own officials, and the regular rotation and involvement of all workers in the administration of the state. Lenin's belief as to what a proletariat state should look like nevertheless deviated from that adopted by the Marxist mainstream; European Marxists like Kautsky envisioned a democratically-elected parliamentary government in which the proletariat had a majority, whereas Lenin called for a strong, centralised state apparatus that excluded any input from the bourgeois.

Lenin was an <a href="internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalist</a> and a keen supporter of <a href="world%20revolution">world revolution</a>, deeming national borders to be an outdated concept and nationalism a distraction from class struggle. He believed that in a socialist society, the world's nations would inevitably merge and result in a single <a href="world%20government">world government</a>. He believed that this socialist state would need to be a centralised, <a href="unitary%20state">unitary one</a>, and regarded <a href="federalism">federalism</a> as a bourgeois concept. In his writings, Lenin espoused <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialist</a> ideas and stated that all nations deserved "the right of self-determination". 
He thus supported <a href="war%20of%20national%20liberation">wars of national liberation</a>, accepting that such conflicts might be necessary for a minority group to break away from a <a href="socialist%20state">socialist state</a>, because socialist states are not "holy or insured against mistakes or weaknesses".

Prior to taking power in 1917, he was concerned that ethnic and national minorities would make the Soviet state ungovernable with their calls for independence; according to the historian <a href="Simon%20Sebag%20Montefiore">Simon Sebag Montefiore</a>, Lenin thus encouraged Stalin to develop "a theory that offered the ideal of autonomy and the right of secession without necessarily having to grant either". On taking power, Lenin called for the dismantling of the bonds that had forced minority ethnic groups to remain in the Russian Empire and espoused their right to secede, but also expected them to reunite immediately in the spirit of proletariat internationalism. He was willing to use military force to ensure this unity, resulting in armed incursions into the independent states that formed in Ukraine, Georgia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic states. Only when its conflicts with Finland, the Baltic states, and Poland proved unsuccessful did Lenin's government officially recognise their independence.

Lenin saw himself as a man of destiny, and firmly believed in the righteousness of his cause and his own ability as a revolutionary leader. Biographer <a href="Louis%20Fischer">Louis Fischer</a> described him as "a lover of radical change and maximum upheaval", a man for whom "there was never a middle-ground. He was an either-or, black-or-red exaggerator". Highlighting Lenin's "extraordinary capacity for disciplined work" and "devotion to the revolutionary cause", Pipes noted that he exhibited much <a href="charisma">charisma</a>. Similarly, Volkogonov believed that "by the very force of his personality, [Lenin] had an influence over people". Conversely, Lenin's friend Gorky commented that in his physical appearance as a "baldheaded, stocky, sturdy person", the communist revolutionary was "too ordinary" and did not give "the impression of being a leader".

Historian and biographer <a href="Robert%20Service%20%28historian%29">Robert Service</a> asserted that Lenin had been an intensely emotional young man, who exhibited strong hatred for the Tsarist authorities. According to Service, Lenin developed an "emotional attachment" to his ideological heroes, such as Marx, Engels and Chernyshevsky; he owned portraits of them, and privately described himself as being "in love" with Marx and Engels. According to Lenin biographer James D. White, Lenin treated their writings as "holy writ", a "religious dogma", which should "not be questioned but believed in". In Volkogonov's view, Lenin accepted Marxism as "absolute truth", and accordingly acted like "a religious fanatic". Similarly, Bertrand Russell felt that Lenin exhibited "unwavering faith – religious faith in the Marxian gospel". Biographer Christopher Read suggested that Lenin was "a secular equivalent of theocratic leaders who derive their legitimacy from the [perceived] truth of their doctrines, not popular mandates". Lenin was nevertheless an <a href="atheist">atheist</a> and a <a href="Criticism%20of%20religion">critic of religion</a>, believing that socialism was inherently atheistic; he thus considered <a href="Christian%20socialism">Christian socialism</a> a contradiction in terms.

Service stated that Lenin could be "moody and volatile", and Pipes deemed him to be "a thoroughgoing misanthrope", a view rejected by Read, who highlighted many instances in which Lenin displayed kindness, particularly toward children. According to several biographers, Lenin was intolerant of opposition and often dismissed outright opinions that differed from his own. He could be "venomous in his critique of others", exhibiting a propensity for mockery, ridicule, and "ad hominem" attacks on those who disagreed with him. He ignored facts that did not suit his argument, abhorred compromise, and very rarely admitted his own errors. He refused to change his opinions, until he rejected them completely, after which he would treat the new view as if it was just as unchangeable. Lenin showed no sign of <a href="sadistic%20personality%20disorder">sadism</a> or of personally desiring to commit violent acts, but he endorsed the violent actions of others and exhibited no remorse for those killed for the revolutionary cause. Adopting an <a href="amorality">amoral</a> stance, in Lenin's view the end always justified the means; according to Service, Lenin's "criterion of morality was simple: does a certain action advance or hinder the cause of the Revolution?"

Aside from Russian, Lenin spoke and read French, German, and English. Concerned with physical fitness, he exercised regularly, enjoyed cycling, swimming, and hunting, and also developed a passion for mountain walking in the Swiss peaks. He was also fond of pets, in particular cats. Tending to eschew luxury, he lived a spartan lifestyle, and Pipes noted that Lenin was "exceedingly modest in his personal wants", leading "an austere, almost ascetic, style of life". Lenin despised untidiness, always keeping his work desk tidy and his pencils sharpened, and insisted on total silence while he was working. According to Fischer, Lenin's "vanity was minimal", and for this reason he disliked the <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> that the Soviet administration began to build around him; he nevertheless accepted that it might have some benefits in unifying the communist movement.

Despite his revolutionary politics, Lenin disliked revolutionary experimentation in literature and the arts, for instance expressing his dislike of <a href="expressionism">expressionism</a>, <a href="futurism">futurism</a>, and <a href="cubism">cubism</a>, and conversely favouring <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a> and Russian <a href="Classic%20book">classic literature</a>. Lenin also had a conservative attitude towards sex and marriage. Throughout his adult life, he was in a relationship with Krupskaya, a fellow Marxist whom he married. Lenin and Krupskaya both regretted that they never had children, and they enjoyed entertaining their friends' offspring. Read noted that Lenin had "very close, warm, lifelong relationships" with his close family members; he had no lifelong friends, and Armand has been cited as being his only close, intimate confidante.

Ethnically, Lenin identified as Russian. Service described Lenin as "a bit of a snob in national, social and cultural terms". The Bolshevik leader believed that other European countries, especially Germany, were culturally superior to Russia, describing the latter as "one of the most benighted, medieval and shamefully backward of Asian countries". He was annoyed at what he perceived as a lack of conscientiousness and discipline among the Russian people, and from his youth had wanted Russia to become more culturally European and Western.

Volkogonov claimed that "there can scarcely have been another man in history who managed so profoundly to change so large a society on such a scale". Lenin's administration laid the framework for the system of government that ruled Russia for seven decades and provided the model for later Communist-led states that came to cover a third of the inhabited world in the mid-20th century. Thus, Lenin's influence was global. A controversial figure, Lenin remains both reviled and revered, a figure who has been both idolised and demonised. Even during his lifetime, Lenin "was loved and hated, admired and scorned" by the Russian people. This has extended into academic studies of Lenin and Leninism, which have often been polarised along political lines.

The historian <a href="Albert%20Resis">Albert Resis</a> suggested that if the October Revolution is considered the most significant event of the 20th century, then Lenin "must for good or ill be considered the century's most significant political leader". White described Lenin as "one of the undeniably outstanding figures of modern history", while Service noted that the Russian leader was widely understood to be one of the 20th century's "principal actors". Read considered him "one of the most widespread, universally recognizable icons of the twentieth century", while Ryan called him "one of the most significant and influential figures of modern history". "Time" magazine named Lenin one of the , and one of their top 25 political icons of all time.

In the Western world, biographers began writing about Lenin soon after his death; some – like <a href="Christopher%20Hill%20%28historian%29">Christopher Hill</a> – were sympathetic to him, and others – like Richard Pipes and <a href="Robert%20Gellately">Robert Gellately</a> – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised him as a man who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, <a href="Historical%20revisionism">revisionists</a> in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.

Various historians and biographers have characterised Lenin's administration as <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarian</a>, and as a <a href="police%20state">police state</a>, and many have described it as a one-party dictatorship. Several such scholars have described Lenin as a dictator; Ryan stated that he was "not a dictator in the sense that all his recommendations were accepted and implemented", for many of his colleagues disagreed with him on various issues. Fischer noted that while "Lenin was a dictator, [he was] not the kind of dictator Stalin later became", while Volkogonov believed that whereas Lenin established a "dictatorship of the Party", it would only be under Stalin that the Soviet Union became the "dictatorship of one man".

Conversely, various Marxist observers – including Western historians Hill and <a href="John%20Rees%20%28activist%29">John Rees</a> – argued against the view that Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states. Ryan contends that the leftist historian <a href="Paul%20Le%20Blanc%20%28historian%29">Paul Le Blanc</a> "makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than in some of the major Western leaders of the twentieth century". Ryan also posits that for Lenin, 'revolutionary' violence was merely a means to an end: the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world – a world without violence. Historian <a href="J.%20Arch%20Getty">J. Arch Getty</a> remarked, "Lenin deserves a lot of credit for the notion that the meek can inherit the earth, that there can be a political movement based on social justice and equality." Some left-wing intellectuals, among them <a href="Slavoj%20%C5%BDi%C5%BEek">Slavoj Žižek</a>, <a href="Alain%20Badiou">Alain Badiou</a>, Lars T. Lih, and <a href="Fredric%20Jameson">Fredric Jameson</a>, advocate reviving Lenin's uncompromising revolutionary spirit to address contemporary global problems.

In the Soviet Union, a cult of personality devoted to Lenin began to develop during his lifetime, but was only fully established after his death. According to historian Nina Tumarkin, it represented the world's "most elaborate cult of a revolutionary leader" since that of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> in the United States, and has been repeatedly described as "quasi-religious" in nature. Busts or statues of Lenin were erected in almost every village, and his face adorned postage stamps, crockery, posters, and the front pages of Soviet newspapers "Pravda" and "<a href="Isvestia">Isvestia</a>". The places where he had lived or stayed were converted into museums devoted to him. Libraries, streets, farms, museums, towns, and whole regions were named after him, with the city of Petrograd being renamed "Leningrad" in 1924, and his birthplace of Simbirsk becoming "Ulyanovsk". The <a href="Order%20of%20Lenin">Order of Lenin</a> was established as one of the country's highest decorations. All of this was contrary to Lenin's own desires, and was publicly criticised by his widow.

Various biographers have stated that Lenin's writings were treated in a manner akin to <a href="holy%20scripture">holy scripture</a> within the Soviet Union, while Pipes added that "his every opinion was cited to justify one policy or another and treated as gospel". Stalin systematised Leninism through a series of lectures at the <a href="Sverdlov%20University">Sverdlov University</a>, which were then published as "Questions of Leninism". Stalin also had much of the deceased leader's writings collated and stored in a secret archive in the <a href="Marx%E2%80%93Engels%E2%80%93Lenin%20Institute">Marx–Engels–Lenin Institute</a>. Material, such as Lenin's collection of books in Kraków, were also collected from abroad for storage in the Institute, often at great expense. During the Soviet era, these writings were strictly controlled and very few had access. All of Lenin's writings that proved useful to Stalin were published, but the others remained hidden, and knowledge of both Lenin's non-Russian ancestry and his noble status was suppressed. In particular, his Jewish ancestry was suppressed until the 1980s, perhaps out of Soviet anti-Semitism, and so as not to undermine Stalin's Russification efforts, and perhaps so as not to provide fuel for anti-Soviet sentiment among international anti-Semites. After the discovery of Lenin's Jewish ancestry, this aspect was repeatedly emphasised by the Russian far right, who claimed that his inherited Jewish genetics explained his desire to uproot traditional Russian society. Under Stalin's regime, Lenin was actively portrayed as a close friend of Stalin's who had supported Stalin's bid to be the next Soviet leader. During the Soviet era, five separate editions of Lenin's published works were published in Russian, the first beginning in 1920 and the last from 1958 to 1965; the fifth edition was described as "complete", but in reality had much omitted for political expediency.

After Stalin's death, <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> became leader of the Soviet Union and began a process of <a href="de-Stalinization">de-Stalinisation</a>, citing Lenin's writings, including those on Stalin, to legitimise this process. When <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> took power in 1985 and introduced the policies of "<a href="glastnost">glastnost</a>" and "<a href="perestroika">perestroika</a>", he too cited these actions as a return to Lenin's principles. In late 1991, amid the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a>, Russian President <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a> ordered the Lenin archive be removed from Communist Party control and placed under the control of a state organ, the <a href="Russian%20Centre%20for%20the%20Preservation%20and%20Study%20of%20Documents%20of%20Recent%20History">Russian Centre for the Preservation and Study of Documents of Recent History</a>, at which it was revealed that over 6,000 of Lenin's writings had gone unpublished. These were declassified and made available for scholarly study. Yeltsin did not dismantle the Lenin mausoleum, recognising that Lenin was too popular and well respected among the Russian populace for this to be viable.

In Russia in 2012, a proposal from the <a href="Liberal%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Russia">Liberal Democratic Party of Russia</a>, with the support of some members of the governing <a href="United%20Russia">United Russia</a> party, proposed the removal of all Lenin monuments, a proposal strongly opposed by the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Communist Party of the Russian Federation</a>. In Ukraine, during and after the 2013–14 <a href="Euromaidan">Euromaidan</a> protests, thousands of Lenin statues were <a href="Demolition%20of%20monuments%20to%20Vladimir%20Lenin%20in%20Ukraine">damaged or destroyed</a> by protesters who viewed them as a symbol of Russian imperialism, and in April 2015 the Ukrainian government ordered that all others be dismantled to comply with <a href="Decommunization%20in%20Ukraine">decommunisation laws</a>.

According to Lenin biographer <a href="David%20Shub">David Shub</a>, writing in 1965, it was Lenin's ideas and example that "constitutes the basis of the Communist movement today". Communist regimes professing allegiance to Lenin's ideas appeared in various parts of the world during the 20th century. Writing in 1972, the historian <a href="Marcel%20Liebman">Marcel Liebman</a> stated that "there is hardly any insurrectionary movement today, from Latin America to Angola, that does not lay claim to the heritage of Leninism".

After Lenin's death, Stalin's administration established an ideology known as <a href="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a>, a movement that came to be interpreted differently by various contending factions in the Communist movement. After being forced into exile by Stalin's administration, Trotsky argued that Stalinism was a debasement of Leninism, which was dominated by bureaucratism and Stalin's own personal dictatorship. Marxism-Leninism was adapted to many of the 20th century's most prominent revolutionary movements, forming into variants such as <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>, <a href="Maoism">Maoism</a>, "<a href="Juche">Juche</a>", <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20Thought">Ho Chi Minh Thought</a>, and <a href="Politics%20of%20Fidel%20Castro">Castroism</a>. Conversely, many later Western communists such as <a href="Manuel%20Azc%C3%A1rate">Manuel Azcárate</a> and Jean Ellenstein who were involved in the <a href="Eurocommunism">Eurocommunist</a> movement expressed the view that Lenin and his ideas were irrelevant to their own objectives, thereby embracing a Marxist but not Marxist-Leninist perspective.

God of War III

God of War III is an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> video game developed by <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> (SCE). Released for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> (PS3) console on March 16, 2010, the game is the fifth installment in the <a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">"God of War" series</a>, the seventh chronologically, and the sequel to 2007's "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a>". Loosely based on <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the game is set in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> with vengeance as its central motif. The <a href="player%20character">player controls</a> the protagonist and former God of War <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, after his betrayal at the hands of his father <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>, King of the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian gods</a>. Reigniting the <a href="Titanomachy">Great War</a>, Kratos ascends <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> until he is abandoned by the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a>. Guided by <a href="Athena">Athena</a>’s spirit, Kratos battles monsters, gods, and Titans in a search for <a href="Pandora">Pandora</a>, without whom he cannot open <a href="Pandora%27s%20box">Pandora's Box</a>, defeat Zeus, and end the reign of the Olympian gods.

The gameplay is similar to previous installments, focusing on <a href="combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based</a> combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">bosses</a>. The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzles</a> and <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> elements. Compared with previous installments, "God of War III" offers a revamped magic system, more enemies, new camera angles, and <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>.

"God of War III" was critically acclaimed upon release, with a reviewer from <a href="IGN">IGN</a> stating that it redefines the word "scale" in video games. It has been praised for its graphics, particularly of Kratos, which IGN called "perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in video games". The game received several awards, including "Most Anticipated Game of 2010" and "Best PS3 Game" at the 2009 and 2010 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, respectively, and the "Artistic Achievement" award at the 2011 <a href="7th%20British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) Video Game Awards. The second best-selling game in the "God of War" series and the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20PlayStation%203%20video%20games">ninth best-selling PlayStation 3 game of all time</a>, it sold nearly 5.2 million copies worldwide by June 2012 and was included in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>" released for PlayStation 3 on August 28, 2012. In celebration of the "God of War" franchise's tenth anniversary, a remastered version of "God of War III", titled "<a href="%23God%20of%20War%20III%20Remastered">God of War III Remastered</a>", was released on the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> on July 14, 2015.

"God of War III" is an <a href="action-adventure">action-adventure</a> game with <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> elements. It is a <a href="third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="single-player%20video%20game">single-player</a> video game. As with previous installments, the player controls the character <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a> from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Fixed">fixed-camera</a> perspective in <a href="combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based combat</a>, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle games</a>. The enemies are an assortment of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythological</a> creatures, including <a href="centaur">centaur</a>s, <a href="harpy">harpies</a>, <a href="chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimeras</a>, <a href="cyclops">cyclopes</a>, <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s, <a href="minotaur">minotaur</a>s, <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Siren</a>s, <a href="cerberus">cerberus</a>es, and <a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a>s. The player must also climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, and swing on ropes to proceed through the game. The puzzles included vary in difficulty: some puzzles only require objects to be placed in a specific position, while some require timing and precision, such as a puzzle with mechanics similar to "<a href="Guitar%20Hero">Guitar Hero</a>". In addition to finding Gorgon Eyes and <a href="Phoenix%20%28mythology%29">Phoenix</a> Feathers of the previous games, Minotaur Horns are a new item to be found. Where the eyes and feathers increase the player's <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">health</a> and <a href="magic%20point">magic</a> meters, the horns increase the items meter, which allows further use of secondary weapons, called "Items".

Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Exile, replacing the Blades of <a href="Athena">Athena</a> used in previous installments and the opening moments of the game. The weapon is a pair of blades attached to chains wrapped around the Kratos' wrists and forearms that can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of <a href="Hades">Hades</a>, the <a href="Nemean%20lion">Nemean</a> Cestus, and the <a href="Nemesis%20%28mythology%29">Nemesis</a> Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, similar to the Blades of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of <a href="onyx">onyx</a>.

Unlike in previous games, magical abilities are learned with the acquisition of a new weapon, giving each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of Exile. Magic gives Kratos a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones, known as Items, are acquired: the Bow of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, the Head of <a href="Helios">Helios</a>, and the Boots of <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>. All three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios can be used as a lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.

The relics <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>'s Trident, the <a href="Golden%20Fleece">Golden Fleece</a>, and <a href="Icarus">Icarus</a>' Wings acquired in previous games are retained and used to overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden Fleece used to deflect enemy attacks. Hades' Soul allows Kratos to swim in the River <a href="Styx">Styx</a>. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a>", is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.

New additions to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a <a href="ranged%20weapon">ranged-grab</a> maneuver which, depending on the weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes or force them away—necessary at certain points in the game, with Kratos riding harpies across chasms—and a simple grab allowing him to use a weak foe as a <a href="battering%20ram">battering ram</a>. Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near defeated foes and providing additional abilities like unlimited magic during <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">bonus play</a>. The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the game's completion. This mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks—for example, killing all enemies without weapons in a limited amount of time. The player may <a href="unlockable%20%28gaming%29">unlock</a> additional rewards, such as bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a> of the characters and environments, by completing the game's difficulty levels and challenge mode. A new mode, the Combat Arena, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose opponents to hone playing skills.

As with previous games, "God of War III" is set in an alternate version of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a> populated by <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian gods</a>, <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>, <a href="Greek%20Heroic%20Age">heroes</a>, and other characters from Greek mythology. The game is set across several locations on <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a>, including the Tomb of <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, the ancient city of <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a>, the Path of <a href="Eos">Eos</a>, the <a href="Labyrinth">Labyrinth</a>, several areas of the Palace of the Gods, such as the Forum and <a href="Hera">Hera</a>'s Gardens, and the <a href="Greek%20underworld">Underworld</a> and <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>.

The Tomb of Ares—housing the former God of War's remains—and the city of Olympia lie on the sides of Mount Olympus. Just beyond the city is the Path of Eos, a hidden cavern near the foot of Olympus. The Palace of the Gods is the home of the Olympians, and features the Forum (a small coliseum), Hera's Gardens, and the chambers of Aphrodite and Poseidon. The Labyrinth is a large aerial puzzle constructed by the architect <a href="Daedalus">Daedalus</a> to imprison <a href="Pandora">Pandora</a> in the Caverns of Olympus, home of <a href="Scorpius%23Mythology">Skorpius</a> and its offspring. The Underworld, ruled by <a href="Hades">Hades</a> and divided by the River Styx, is the realm of the dead. Hades' palace contains the remains of his wife, <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a>, whom Kratos killed in "". The Underworld is also home to statues of the three Judges of the Underworld, who hold the Chain of Balance connecting the Underworld to Olympus. Tartarus is the prison of the dead where the Titan <a href="Cronus">Cronos</a> was banished after Kratos retrieved Pandora's Box from Pandora's Temple in "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">God of War</a>".

Kratos (voiced by <a href="Terrence%20C.%20Carson">Terrence C. Carson</a>), the protagonist of the game, is a Spartan <a href="demigod">demigod</a> warrior who became the God of War after killing Ares and seeks revenge on Zeus for his betrayal. Other characters include Greek gods such as Athena (<a href="Erin%20Torpey">Erin Torpey</a>), the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' mentor and ally; Zeus (<a href="Corey%20Burton">Corey Burton</a>), King of the Gods and the primary antagonist; Poseidon (<a href="Gideon%20Emery">Gideon Emery</a>), God of the Sea; Hades (<a href="Clancy%20Brown">Clancy Brown</a>), God of the Underworld; <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> (<a href="Rip%20Torn">Rip Torn</a>), the <a href="Blacksmith">Smith God</a>; Hermes (<a href="Greg%20Ellis%20%28actor%29">Greg Ellis</a>), Messenger of the Gods and the God of Speed and Commerce; Helios (<a href="Crispin%20Freeman">Crispin Freeman</a>), the Sun God; Hera (<a href="Adrienne%20Barbeau">Adrienne Barbeau</a>), Queen of the Gods who controls plant life; and Aphrodite (<a href="April%20Stewart">April Stewart</a>), Goddess of Love and Sexuality. Several Titans are featured, including <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a> (<a href="Susan%20Blakeslee">Susan Blakeslee</a>), Cronos (George Ball), <a href="Epimetheus%20%28mythology%29">Epimetheus</a>, <a href="Oceanus">Oceanus</a>, and <a href="Perses%20%28Titan%29">Perses</a>. Other characters include <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> (<a href="Kevin%20Sorbo">Kevin Sorbo</a>), a demigod and Kratos' half-brother; the architect Daedalus (<a href="Malcolm%20McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>), Icarus's father; and Pandora (<a href="Natalie%20Lander">Natalie Lander</a>), Hephaestus's artificial daughter. Minor characters include the three Judges of the Underworld: King <a href="Minos">Minos</a> (<a href="Mark%20Moseley%20%28actor%29">Mark Moseley</a>), King <a href="Rhadamanthus">Rhadamanthus</a>, and King <a href="Aeacus">Aeacus</a>; <a href="Pirithous">Peirithous</a> (<a href="Simon%20Templeman">Simon Templeman</a>), an Underworld prisoner in love with Persephone, and Kratos' wife and daughter: Lysandra (<a href="Gwendoline%20Yeo">Gwendoline Yeo</a>) and Calliope (<a href="Debi%20Derryberry">Debi Derryberry</a>), who appear in a plot sequence in which Kratos journeys through his own psyche.

Continuing immediately after "God of War II", Kratos, Gaia, and the other Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian gods. Poseidon launches an assault against the Titans, but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to flood Greece. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him nothing more than a pawn for the Titans' revenge.

Kratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; the souls of the Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by Athena's spirit, who had previously sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that he must extinguish the Flame of Olympus to kill Zeus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades and releases the souls of the Underworld. He considers searching for Calliope's soul, but Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia, where he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.

Kratos continues his ascent, murdering powerful foes that include the Titan Perses and the god Helios; Helios' death plunges Greece into eternal darkness. This leads to an encounter with Hermes, who mocks Kratos for his past sins. Kratos chases Hermes and arrives at the Chamber of the Flame. Kratos discovers that Pandora's Box is in the Flame of Olympus and is key to the success of his quest, as it was in "God of War" (2005). Athena appears, telling Kratos that the flames around the box can only be quelled by Pandora. Kratos then continues after the overconfident Hermes, whom he catches and kills, releasing a plague on Greece. At the Forum, he has an audience with the drunken Hera, who ignores his request for Pandora's location and summons Hercules. After discussing his jealousy of his half-brother, Hercules attacks Kratos, but is killed. Kratos then encounters Aphrodite, who is indifferent to his war on Olympus. She leads him to her estranged husband Hephaestus through Hyperion's Gate, a <a href="teleportation">teleportation</a> device. In a suicide mission, the blacksmith sends Kratos to Tartarus to retrieve the <a href="Omphalos%20Stone">Omphalos Stone</a> so he can forge a new weapon for the Spartan. Kratos finds Cronos, kills the Titan for the stone, and returns to Hephaestus. After forging the weapon, the god tries to kill Kratos himself. Instead, the Spartan kills Hephaestus, who claims that he was trying to protect his daughter Pandora, who was imprisoned in the Labyrinth after Kratos opened her box. Reusing the Hyperion Gate, Kratos travels through Hera's Gardens where he kills Hera, ending all Greek plant life, and makes his way to the Labyrinth to find Pandora.

The imprisoned architect Daedalus tells Kratos to unite the Labyrinth. Completing this task, Kratos fights his way through the aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so the Labyrinth can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises the Labyrinth, and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through her gaping chest wound and continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and his daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.

Athena reappears, demanding that Kratos return what she thinks he took from Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils of the world in the box, she placed hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild what had been destroyed. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope to heal all he had destroyed. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.

In a <a href="post-credits%20scene">post-credits scene</a>, a trail of blood leads away from an abandoned Blade of Olympus, with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.

In a 2007 interview with <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>, "God of War" creator and game director <a href="David%20Jaffe">David Jaffe</a> explained his original intention for the series, which is different from the actual ending of "God of War III", which was based on game director Stig Asmussen's vision. Jaffe's idea was that ""God of War" explains, or ultimately will explain, why there are no more Greek myths". He said that it would have been "hell on earth" as the gods and Titans battled each other for domination. Other mythological pantheons would have become involved after Kratos killed Zeus and the other Greek gods, and the result would be that humankind no longer believed in the gods—according to Jaffe, the only way a god can truly die. "God of War III" was first mentioned by "God of War II" game director <a href="Cory%20Barlog">Cory Barlog</a> at a "God of War II" launch event. Barlog said that the game would have full <a href="1080p">1080p</a> HD resolution (changed to <a href="720p">720p</a> in final release) and support <a href="Sixaxis">Sixaxis</a> tilt and vibration functions. Announced before the <a href="DualShock%203">DualShock 3</a> controller was introduced, this caused confusion since the Sixaxis controller does not support rumble. During the 2009 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a> (GDC), the creative team said that the Sixaxis tilt capability had been removed because they "could not find a suitable situation to use Sixaxis in the game effectively".

After the first eight months of development, Barlog left Santa Monica for other opportunities, and Stig Asmussen took over as game director; Asmussen previously served as lead environment artist and art director on "God of War" and "God of War II", respectively. In an interview with <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, Asmussen said that Barlog "had a major impact on the game" and although he had left the team, they spoke several times afterwards and "bounced a few ideas off him," but there was no formal collaboration. He also said that David Jaffe "[had] been around the studio a few times" and they "[had] gone over some high-level stuff with him to get his observations and feedback." Early in development when Barlog was still with the team, he expressed interest in a <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative</a> mode "if we can do something unique with it". In November 2009, Asmussen told "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" that although a multiplayer option had been discussed, it was unsuitable for "God of War III": "There's a story we want to tell and an experience we want to deliver, and multi-player doesn't fit into that." By December 2009, the game was in its final developmental stages.

In December 2008, Sony reported that "God of War III" would be the last game in the series. However, in January 2010 John Hight told <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>: "While "God of War III" will conclude the trilogy, it won't spell the end of the franchise ... We're going to be really careful about what we do next". Asmussen mentioned the possibility of <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>; the game would be shipped with the regular challenge mode, and new challenge modes might be released as downloadable content to maintain the series. In March 2009, it was reported that Sony was seeking opinions about a collector's edition from PlayStation 3 owners. In October, an "Ultimate Edition" was unveiled for North America, and an "Ultimate Trilogy Edition" was announced soon afterwards for a limited European, Australian, and New Zealand release. A "Trilogy Edition" was announced for Japan, where the <a href="Computer%20Entertainment%20Rating%20Organization">Computer Entertainment Rating Organization</a> (CERO) gave the game an adults-only Z rating after the previous two versions were considered suitable for players 17 and older.

Asmussen said that one of the greatest challenges in developing "God of War III" for the PlayStation 3 was the "complexity of everything"; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the "level of detail [that was] expected [was] so high and intricate, it [crossed] multiple departments." He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment. The character model for Kratos in the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> (PS2) games used about 5,000 <a href="polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygons</a>; the PS3 model was about 20,000 – a high number, but less than that used by other models such as <a href="Nathan%20Drake%20%28character%29">Nathan Drake</a> in "", who used 35,000. Ken Feldman, the art director, commented that the polygon count was not the only factor, and cited the increased texture detail as one of the reasons for Kratos's realistic appearance. The developers used a new technique called blended normal <a href="texture%20mapping">mapping</a> to add realism to the basic model and hugely enhance the range of animation available (e.g., muscle movement, including visible veins, and facial animations). All of the main protagonists were animated by hand because the animators produced more effective work than basic motion capture, though the voice actors' facial movements were recorded by <a href="Image%20Metrics">Image Metrics</a>'s performance capture system. For animating things like hair, the animators created a secondary animation code, known as <a href="Dynamic%20simulation">Dynamic Simulation</a>, which allows the PS3 itself to mathematically calculate the way it should look; it accurately generates motion that previously took the animators long hours to replicate.

The engine for "God of War III" was from the first two installments. Santa Monica senior producer Steve Caterson said that the development team ported <a href="Kinetica%20%28game%20engine%29">"God of War II"s engine</a> to the PlayStation 3 and were able to quickly play the game. Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content. As the game was being developed, the code department would swap out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system. Feldman said that although they were re-using the engine from "God of War II", the core engine for "God of War III" was brand new. Between the 2009 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) and the time the game shipped, <a href="spatial%20anti-aliasing">morphological anti-aliasing</a> (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said "improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate." MLAA is "now a popular edge-detection process that can cost-effectively remove jagged edges from each frame", which helped Santa Monica free up the processing cycle and "allowed them to add to the spectacle in other ways." Diamand also said that "depth-of-field, motion blur, crepuscular 'god' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed" during that same time period.

Asmussen estimated overall game length to be 10 to 20 hours, "depending on how good of a gamer you are." Santa Monica studio director John Hight reassured players that "God of War III" lasts longer than 10 hours: "We've done a lot of play testing on it ... We know, for a really hardcore player, it'll take them longer than it took them to play either of the previous "God of War" games." The finished game script was about 120 pages long, and the number of onscreen enemies increased from 15 in the previous games to a maximum of 50. To light the game, Turtle by <a href="Illuminate%20Labs">Illuminate Labs</a> was used. Head of development Christer Ericson of SCE Santa Monica Studio confirmed that "God of War III" has seamless loading; no loading screens and no <a href="hard%20disk%20drive">hard disk drive</a> installation requirement. <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment%20America">SCE America</a> animator Bruno Velazquez said that while the first two "God of War" titles had <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> (CGI) cinematics, there would be no true CGI in the third game: "all the cutscenes are created using our in-game engine." A "God of War III" game trailer debuted on <a href="GameTrailers%20TV%20with%20Geoff%20Keighley">Spike's "GameTrailers TV"</a> on February 11, 2010, and Asmussen confirmed that all footage is of gameplay. New camera angles were added; during some major battles the player can still control Kratos while the camera <a href="panning%20%28camera%29">pans</a> away from the fight, and a <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> camera view was used for the final portion of the Poseidon and Zeus <a href="boss%20fight">boss fight</a>s. According to Sony Santa Monica director of technology Tim Moss, "God of War III" used 35 <a href="gigabyte">gigabyte</a>s (GB) of <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a>. "God of War III"s budget was $44 million <a href="USD">USD</a>, and the game had a staff of 132 at the end of its development.

Several voice actors returned from previous installments, including Terrence C. Carson, Erin Torpey, Corey Burton, Debi Derryberry, and Gwendoline Yeo, voicing Kratos, Athena, Zeus, Calliope, and Lysandra, respectively. Susan Blakeslee, who voiced two characters in "God of War", voiced Gaia. Narrator <a href="Linda%20Hunt">Linda Hunt</a>, who previously voiced Gaia, only provided an introductory narration for the game. Rip Torn, Natalie Lander, and Malcolm McDowell joined the cast of voice actors. <a href="Lloyd%20Sherr">Lloyd Sherr</a> and <a href="Nolan%20North">Nolan North</a>, who had originally voiced Cronos and Hades, were replaced by George Ball and Clancy Brown, respectively. Kevin Sorbo was chosen to voice Hercules because of his portrayal of the character in the television series, "". <a href="Elijah%20Wood">Elijah Wood</a> had a minor voice role, and <a href="Josh%20Keaton">Josh Keaton</a> and <a href="Fred%20Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>, who voiced characters in previous games, also had minor roles.

At <a href="E3%202009">E3 2009</a>, the "God of War III" <a href="game%20demo">demo</a> was unveiled, with Kratos on the cliffs of Mount Olympus battling Olympian legionnaires, a centaur, a chimera, and a cyclops. He decapitates Helios, encounters Perses, rides harpies, and uses the Blades of Athena and new weapons (the Nemean Cestus and Bow of Apollo). On October 28, 2009, <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment%20Europe">SCE Europe</a> sent emails to PlayStation Network members with an activation code for the demo. On October 30, GameStop began providing voucher codes for customers who pre-ordered the game, and early copies of "<a href="God%20of%20War%20Collection">God of War Collection</a>" had a voucher code to download the demo. The Blu-ray version of "<a href="District%209">District 9</a>" included the "God of War III" demo and a "making of" featurette, and the demo was released to <a href="Qore%20%28PlayStation%20Network%29">Qore</a> subscribers on February 4, 2010. On February 25, Sony Computer Entertainment released the demo for download on the PlayStation Store in Europe and North America. Just before the game's release, "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" published an article comparing the graphics in the "God of War III" demo to those in the final game, reporting improved lighting and realistic <a href="motion%20blur">motion blur</a> in the final release.

"God of War III" was released in North America on March 16, 2010,<ref name="3/16"></ref> on March 18 in Australia, March 19 in Europe, and March 25 in Japan. The game outsold its <a href="God%20of%20War%20II">predecessor</a> by nearly 400,000 copies in its first week. According to retail tracker <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, "God of War III" sold about 1.1 million copies in the United States by the end of March 2010, making it the best-selling game of that month, and its opening-month sales were 32 percent higher than those of "God of War II". By June 2012, "God of War III" had sold almost 5.2 million copies worldwide—about 2.8 million in North America, 2 million in <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s, and 417,866 in Japan and Asia. The game is also part of <a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28PlayStation%20range%29">PlayStation 3's Greatest Hits lineup</a>. On August 28, 2012, "God of War III", "God of War Collection", and "" were released in North America as the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>", part of Sony's PlayStation Collections line.

"God of War III" had an extensive marketing campaign before its release. This campaign began in early 2008 when a teaser for "God of War III" appeared as an image (the original <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> logo surrounded by the Greek <a href="omega">omega</a>) at the end of the instruction manual for "God of War: Chains of Olympus." This was soon followed by a teaser trailer screened at Sony's 2008 E3 press conference. Another trailer premiered at the 2008 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, and an "official" "God of War III" trailer was released in February 2009. A new trailer debuted with the release of "God of War III" on March 16, 2010.

In October 2009, SCE Santa Monica Studio announced the "God of War III Ultimate Edition", available by pre-order in North America. The package included a replica Pandora's Box, a limited-edition "The Art of God of War III" book, and downloadable content (DLC) from the PlayStation Network, which included the "Challenge of Exile" mode, Kratos' "Dominus" costume, the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29%23Film%20and%20documentaries">God of War: Unearthing the Legend</a>" documentary, the "God of War Trilogy Soundtrack", and the " <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a>". A limited "Ultimate Trilogy Edition" was released in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand and included the contents of the "Ultimate Edition", as well as "God of War Collection", four Kratos costumes, and "God of War" postcards. A "God of War III" PS3 bundle, with a 250GB PS3 and a copy of "God of War III", was also available in Europe.<ref name="1/21/10"></ref> A "God of War III" media kit with special packaging and content was distributed to journalists in the <a href="PAL">PAL</a> regions, and several were given as prizes on PlayStation Europe's website during the week of March 22, 2010. In Japan, "God of War III" was released in two packages: a standalone version and a "God of War Trilogy Edition". The latter included "God of War III", "God of War Collection", an art book, and a Kratos skin.

For pre-orders, some retailers included a premium costume for Kratos: the Apollo, Forgotten Warrior, and Phantom of Chaos skins from <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, <a href="Game%20Crazy">Game Crazy</a> and <a href="Play.com">Play.com</a>, and <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a>, respectively. GameStop pre-orders also included a poster signed by "God of War III" concept artist <a href="Andy%20Park%20%28comics%29">Andy Park</a> and an entry in its "Be the Envy of the Gods" <a href="sweepstakes">sweepstakes</a>. <a href="7-Eleven">7-Eleven</a> issued a "God of War III" poster for pre-orders and sold a Kratos' Fury <a href="Slurpee">Slurpee</a> in "God of War III" cups. The cups and their specially marked <a href="Mountain%20Dew">Mountain Dew</a> bottles had codes usable on the Slurpee website for "God of War III" downloadable content, including a behind-the-scenes video, <a href="computer%20wallpaper">wallpapers</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Home">PlayStation Home</a> content, and an in-game Kratos skin, the Morpheus Armor.

In December 2009, Santa Monica accepted video submissions from players to determine the ultimate "God of War" fan. The top 18 submissions were included in the closing credits of "God of War: Unearthing the Legend", and all winners received a copy of the "God of War III Ultimate Edition" signed by the development team. Sony and <a href="Spike%20TV">Spike TV</a> sponsored a Last Titan Standing contest, in which fans over 21 could win a chance to play "God of War III" before its mainstream release. Spike's "GameTrailers TV" presented "God of War III: Last Titan Standing" on March 15, 2010, and the winner received a custom-made "God of War III" PS3. A week before "God of War III"s release, the developers released Kratos' backstory on the "God of War" website, under the title "Path to Olympus".

On March 20, 2010, a <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> car driven by <a href="Joey%20Logano">Joey Logano</a> during the <a href="Scotts%20Turf%20Builder%20300">Scotts Turf Builder 300</a> had a "God of War III" and GameStop-themed paint design.<ref name="3/10/2010"></ref> In April, <a href="Machinima.com">Machinima.com</a> released five "Art of the Game" videos for "God of War III" on the PlayStation Store, featuring interviews with team developers. A "God of War III" <a href="action%20figure">action figure</a> line was produced by DC Unlimited. To celebrate the game's entrance into Sony's Greatest Hits library, Santa Monica sponsored a sweepstakes from March 4 to April 1, 2011. Fans could submit an original design of an "Ultimate "God of War" Monster" for one of three prizes: a limited folio edition, a special edition, and a paperback edition of "The Art of God of War III", signed by the development team.

The game has 36 <a href="PS3%20trophies">trophies</a>, awarded for player achievements (for example, "Releasing the Floodgates" for killing Poseidon). When players received the platinum trophy, they were linked to the website spartansstandtall.com. On May 4, 2010, the site became the official website for "God of War: Ghost of Sparta", the next installment in the series and the second for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>. Early copies of "Ghost of Sparta" (and all digital copies in Europe) included a voucher to download Kratos' brother Deimos as a costume for use in "God of War III".

On November 2, 2010, the Dominus character skin and Challenge of Exile mode—previously exclusive to the "Ultimate Edition" and "Ultimate Trilogy Edition"—were released as a bundle on the PlayStation Store. The bundle is free for <a href="PlayStation%20Plus">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers, who could receive the Phantom of Chaos and Forgotten Warrior skins when purchasing "God of War" and "God of War II", respectively, for a limited time. All previous pre-order bonus costumes—Apollo, Forgotten Warrior, and Phantom of Chaos—and the 7-Eleven promotional DLC—the Morpheus Armor—were also released on the PlayStation Store.

God of War III Remastered is a <a href="High-definition%20remasters%20for%20PlayStation%20consoles">remastered port</a> of "God of War III" for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> console. It was first released in North America on July 14, 2015, followed by Australia and mainland Europe on July 15, and the UK on July 17. Santa Monica's Creative Director Cory Barlog announced the remastered game in celebration of the "God of War" franchise's tenth anniversary. Ported by Wholesale Algorithms, the remastered version has full 1080p support targeted at 60 <a href="frame%20rate">frames per second</a> and features a photo mode, allowing players to edit their photos and share their favorite moments. All of the DLC that was released for "God of War III" is included with "God of War III Remastered". By the end of its first week of release, "God of War III Remastered" was ninth in sales at retail in the UK. For the entire month of July 2015, the downloadable version was the seventh best-selling PlayStation 4 title from the PlayStation Store.

In March and April 2010, "God of War III: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game", composed by <a href="Gerard%20Marino">Gerard K. Marino</a>, <a href="Ron%20Fish">Ron Fish</a>, <a href="Mike%20Reagan">Mike Reagan</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Rona">Jeff Rona</a>, and <a href="Cris%20Velasco">Cris Velasco</a>, was included as downloadable content in the "God of War III Ultimate Edition" and "Ultimate Trilogy Edition". Its <a href="Compact%20Disc">CD</a> was released on March 30 by SCE and <a href="Sumthing%20Else">Sumthing Else</a>. The soundtrack was recorded by the Skywalker Session Orchestra and the Czech National Symphony Chorus. Each composer provided a different aesthetic to the score: for example, Marino's approach was brooding, rhythmic, and percussive, and Fish set hopeless and somber moods. In an interview with Game Music Online, Mike Reagan said that although the composers might have used each other's themes, they did not collaborate with each other. Reagan said the real collaboration came from Clint Bajakian, Senior Music Supervisor at Sony, and his team. In scoring for "God of War III", Reagan said that the composers were "able to explore more melodic development than we were on the first ["God of War"]." The score was recorded under the new <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Musicians">American Federation of Musicians</a> video game agreement and because of Sony’s vision and support, the composers were able to record locally with some of the best musicians in the world. In an interview with PlayStation.Blog, Clint Bajakian described the different ensembles that recorded the score: the <a href="Brass%20instrument">brass</a> section is the "lead guitar", the <a href="choir">choir</a> gives the game its epic feel, the <a href="string%20instrument">strings</a> are the body of the sound, and the <a href="percussion%20instrument">percussion</a> is the foundation.

A nine-out-of-ten review from Square Enix Music Online praised the soundtrack's orchestration, calling it the best score in the series to date. <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a> praised its quality, saying that the compositions were strong and it was "fantastic" as standalone music. A six-out-of-ten review from Tracksounds said that although the score "lacks the intricacy and personality that could set it apart and give it a sense of uniqueness...[it] delivers on its promise of a loud, wrathful bundle of tunes you can kill gods to...for better or worse." The reviewer said to "Enjoy in small doses." At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, the soundtrack was nominated for Best Original Score.

"God of War III" received "universal acclaim" according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> with a score of 92 out of 100, and a score of 92.07% from <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>. Adam Sessler of "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>" said that the game "finishes the trilogy on an exceptionally high note", and it "blends all of its best attributes into a stellar experience." IGN's Chris Roper said that "God of War III" "practically redefines" scale in video games, singling out the size of the Titans as being "larger than entire levels in other games". Mike Jackson of "<a href="PlayStation%20Official%20Magazine%20-%20UK">Official PlayStation Magazine UK</a>" called it the biggest "God of War" game yet; if it was the series' last game, ""God of War III" gives PlayStation's toughest hero the send-off he deserves."

Matt Leone of <a href="1UP.com">1UP</a> said that the gameplay has "variety ... You seemingly see, acquire, and participate in something new around every corner". According to Leone, each weapon "adds a lot of depth to the combat system." Christian Donlan of "Eurogamer" said that the "combat system, level flow, and pacing of bosses and puzzles remains largely untouched. But everything's bigger, grander and more elaborate." He praised the weapons' accessibility, saying that it is easy to quickly switch between them. According to Tom McShea of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, the combat and scale "have been pushed further than ever before ... creating an experience so focused and explosively fun that it's hard to put down, and even harder to forget." McShea said that regardless of repetition, "the brutality of combat is one of the most satisfying aspects of "God of War III"." Joe Juba of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" called "God of War III" "visceral" and "brutal", and Kratos "the undisputed king of the genre." Jackson, however, said the core gameplay's familiarity "makes it feel less than the very, very best", and according to Roper, two of the three additional weapons are similar to the main blades; they "have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large they're more of the same."

Its plot received mixed reviews. GameTrailers said that "God of War III"s storyline makes Greek mythology more interesting. <a href="GameFront">GameFront</a>'s Phil Hornshaw said it had an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. According to Donlan, the story is as simple as it can get. McShea said that although it does not pick up until near the end, it "becomes powerful and moving in unexpected ways, peaking in a thrilling conclusion that successfully touches on many different emotions and provides closure for this epic tale." Juba, on the other hand, considered that the plot "doesn't have any standout revelations or developments".

Jackson called "God of War III"s graphics as good as (if not better than) those in "<a href="Killzone%202">Killzone 2</a>" and "". According to Juba, the "cinematic camera work [is] even more impressive than Naughty Dog's feats with "Uncharted 2"." Roper said, ""God of War III" presents some of the most impressive visuals that I've ever seen in a game. Kratos in particular looks phenomenal, and is perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in videogames." According to GameTrailers, "the levels are expertly designed" and the game's scale is the most outstanding visual achievement.

"God of War III" was awarded the "Most Anticipated Game of 2010" at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, it was awarded "Best PS3 Game" and "Best Graphics", and Kratos received the "Biggest Badass" award. It was also a nominee for "Game of the Year", "Best Action Adventure Game", "Best Original Score", and "Character of the Year" (Kratos). Other individual awards include "Best Action/Adventure Game" (<a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a>), "Best Action Game" (<a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>), "Best PS3 Game" (<a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>), and "Best PS3 Exclusive" (<a href="Shacknews">Shacknews</a>). At the 2011 <a href="7th%20British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) Video Game Awards, "God of War III" received the "Artistic Achievement" award, and it was a nominee for the "Action" and "Gameplay" awards.

Though the original release of "God of War III" was met with critical acclaim, "God of War III Remastered" only garnered generally favorable reviews, receiving aggregate scores of 80.37% and 81 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Reviewers found it odd that Sony decided to remaster "God of War III" for PlayStation 4, as its story picks up immediately from the ending of "God of War II", which may confuse newcomers who have never played the previous games. Praise was given to the smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because the original already had impressive graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.

The Simpsons Game

The Simpsons Game is an <a href="action%20game">action</a> <a href="platform%20game">platformer</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> based on the animated <a href="television%20series">television series</a> "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" and loosely on "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Movie">The Simpsons Movie</a>", made for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>, <a href="Wii">Wii</a>, <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>. The game was developed, published, and distributed by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. It was released in North America in October 2007 and worldwide in November 2007. It features an original storyline written by "The Simpsons" writers <a href="Tim%20Long">Tim Long</a>, <a href="Matt%20Selman">Matt Selman</a>, and <a href="Matt%20Warburton">Matt Warburton</a>. In the <a href="meta-joke">self-referential</a> plot, the family discovers that they are forced to participate in another "The Simpsons" video game. Similar to the show, the game pokes fun at <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>, other video games, and Electronic Arts, its publisher.

The game follows the five Simpson family members—<a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer</a>, <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a> (with <a href="Maggie%20Simpson">Maggie</a>), <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a>, and <a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa</a>—who learn they are part of a video game and are given superpowers to resolve several situations. Eventually, they must save their <a href="history%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28third%20generation%29">8-bit</a> predecessors from <a href="Will%20Wright%20%28game%20designer%29">Will Wright</a>, and the creator of their video game character selves, <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a>. The Simpson family travels to four scenarios in parodies of other games to collect key cards used to infiltrate their creator's mansion and ultimately to save their predecessors from destruction.

The game was met with mixed reception from video game critics. They praised its visuals and writing, which included many parodies of other video games, while they criticized its short length and poor <a href="camera%20system">camera system</a>, which did not always function properly. "The Simpsons Game" received the Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show award at the 2007 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a> and was nominated for Best Video Game Writing at the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Awards%202007">2007</a> <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a>s. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold worldwide.

Players of "The Simpsons Game" are able to control the <a href="Simpson%20family">Simpson family</a> (except <a href="Maggie%20Simpson">Maggie</a>), each with their own unique abilities. Two different family members are playable in each level, aside from the <a href="tutorial">tutorial</a> level, "The Land of Chocolate", in which only <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer</a> is playable, and the final level, "Game Over", where all members of the family are playable. The game contains sixteen levels, called episodes, and each requires specific powers to complete. For example, in the fourth episode, "Lisa the Tree Hugger", the player is required to use <a href="Lisa%20Simpson">Lisa</a>'s "Hand of Buddha" power to move large objects, and <a href="Bart%20Simpson">Bart</a>'s slingshot to shut down machines. Enemies unique to each episode are featured, with the exception of the final level, in which enemies that have already been defeated are <a href="Palette%20swap">"recycled" with different colors</a>.

Several challenges are made available after all episodes are completed. These include finding all the collectibles for each character, finding all the video game clichés, and in the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, and <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> versions, completing a certain task related to each episode's plot in a <a href="time%20trial">time trial</a>.

"The Simpsons Game"s <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">head-up display</a> features <a href="health%20%28game%20mechanic%29">health meters</a> for both characters in each level, and an attack meter and special power meter for the character currently controlled by the player. The game features a two player <a href="co-op%20mode">co-op mode</a>, which has a <a href="split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">split screen</a> and allows each player to control one of the two characters featured on that level.

The DS version of the game was developed separately from its console counterparts and is a side scrolling adventure. It also offers several features that are not available in the other versions. Several <a href="minigame">minigame</a>s are available to unlock and play, most which are updated versions of arcade games such as "<a href="Frogger">Frogger</a>" and "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>", the latter which references the aliens <a href="Kang%20and%20Kodos">Kang and Kodos</a> from the "<a href="Treehouse%20of%20Horror%20%28series%29">Simpsons Treehouse of Horror</a>" episodes. A <a href="digital%20pet">virtual pet</a> is also accessible, called "Pet Homer", which allows players to feed, entertain, and save Homer from threats such as choking and heart attacks.

Homer is the first playable character available to the player in "The Land of Chocolate" level. His abilities involve turning into the "Homer ball" by eating food <a href="power-ups">power-ups</a> to let him roll and slam objects; turn into a Gummi Homer by eating small <a href="gummi%20bear">gummi</a> "<a href="Venus%20de%20Milo">Venus de Milo</a>s" to shoot gummi <a href="grenades">grenades</a>; eat hot <a href="chili%20peppers">chili peppers</a> to become Insanity Pepper Homer to use <a href="lava">lava</a> and fire bombs; and inhale <a href="helium">helium</a> to become a balloon to float in the air. Homer's special power is a giant burp, which can stun enemies. Bart first appears in the second level of the game "Bartman Begins". He can turn into <a href="Bartman%20%28comics%29">Bartman</a>, allowing him to use <a href="zip-line">zip-line</a>s, climb certain walls, glide over long distances, and do other acrobatic feats. Bart's special power is releasing a flood of <a href="bat">bat</a>s towards enemies. He can use his <a href="slingshot">slingshot</a> to defeat enemies and hit targets from afar.

Lisa is introduced in the fourth level "Lisa the Tree Hugger". Her main attack style is kicking, and her power is the "Hand of Buddha". She can use it to flick, smash, freeze, or send lightning bolts to enemies, as well as lift certain items. Lisa's special power is playing her <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a> to attack and stun enemies. As the levels progress, Lisa can use her saxophone to turn enemies against each other. <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a> is the least-playable character. Introduced in the fifth level, "Mob Rules", Marge learns her power is to make large crowds obey her. She can use her mob to break down obstacles, build objects, attack enemies, and repair objects. Maggie is, in effect, an extension of Marge, briefly playable in air ducts and other small spaces.

The game begins with Homer having a <a href="Burns%20Verkaufen%20der%20Kraftwerk">candy-induced fantasy about a world of chocolate</a> where he tries to catch and eat a white chocolate rabbit; upon waking up he is upset to find that it was all a dream.

Bart goes to the video game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent "Grand Theft Scratchy" game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual falls down from the sky in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers that he and the rest of his family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop <a href="Jimbo%20Jones">Jimbo</a>, <a href="Kearney%20Zzyzwicz">Kearney</a>, and <a href="Dolph%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Dolph</a> from stealing from the Natural History Museum sent by <a href="Principal%20Seymour%20Skinner">Princical Skinner</a> to use the museum exhibits for the science class, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of "Grand Theft Scratchy" in <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a>, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.

During dinner, the family is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an argument about what they should be doing with them. Aliens <a href="Kang%20and%20Kodos">Kang and Kodos</a> decide to strike Earth, and an <a href="alien%20invasion">alien invasion</a> unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit <a href="Professor%20Frink">Professor Frink</a>. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> where all video games are made. After saving him from a <a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28character%29">giant gorilla</a>, Frink gives them "The Simpsons Game"s player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid <a href="Captain%20McCallister">Captain McCallister</a> in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they save the Springfield Mall and <a href="Cletus%20Spuckler">Cletus</a> from the aliens.

In order to find out the truth, the family turns to the Internet to discover more about the powers they have in the game, but are accidentally sent to the game engine when Homer spills beer over the keyboard. There, they discover <a href="Will%20Wright%20%28game%20designer%29">Will Wright</a>, who is destroying copies of an old <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28third%20generation%29">8-bit</a> "The Simpsons" game and its characters. The family manages to save their 8-bit predecessors before they are destroyed by Wright, and discover that they will also become obsolete when the next "The Simpsons" game is released. The only way to prevent this is to talk to the creator of the games and convince him not to destroy them. In order to access his mansion, the family needs to acquire four key cards from four upcoming "Simpsons" games. First, Homer and Marge defeat a two-headed dragon whose heads are those of Patty and Selma in the "Neverquest" game. Marge and Lisa then travel to "Grand Theft Scratchy", eliminating all offensive material and replacing it with more family-friendly material. Next, Homer and Bart travel to <a href="Nazi-occupied%20France">France</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> to thwart Mr. Burns' plan to steal priceless French paintings, in the "Medal of Homer" game. Lisa and Homer then travel to ancient Japan to defeat the evil Mr. Dirt and his "Sparklemon" in the "Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game".

Once they have all four key cards, Bart and Homer infiltrate the creator's mansion. They are greeted by <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a>, who sends "<a href="Futurama">Futurama</a>" characters <a href="Bender%20%28Futurama%29">Bender</a> and <a href="Dr.%20Zoidberg">Dr. Zoidberg</a> after them. The family manages to defeat them, however, and Groening admits that he is only creating new games for the money, and destroys the game engine. The Simpsons, along with several other characters from the games, escape to Springfield, where the aliens are still attacking. Lisa uses her power to create a stairway to heaven in order for the family to ask God for advice. After he is defeated in a game of "<a href="Dance%20Dance%20Revolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a>", God reveals that the video game that they're in is a mini-game in another video game about Earth. He dropped the video game manual by accident, thus endowing the family with superpowers. Realizing his misdemeanor, he promises to restore Springfield, let them keep their powers, and to improve the working conditions of all video game characters. He also gives Homer three wishes. Lisa asks if God ever wonders if he himself is a character in a video game. As God nervously scoffs at this theory, it turns out that <a href="Ralph%20Wiggum">Ralph Wiggum</a> is playing the entire game before he looks at the screen, wondering who was looking at him.

The game's storyline was written by <a href="Tim%20Long">Tim Long</a>, <a href="Matt%20Selman">Matt Selman</a>, and <a href="Matt%20Warburton">Matt Warburton</a>, who are all regular writers on "The Simpsons". They wanted to create something that appealed to the fans of the show, and was, in its own right, "a great new game". <a href="Matt%20Groening">Matt Groening</a> and the writers had continuous feedback on the game's content, from its "look and feel" to its puzzles and gameplay. The game's <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>, Scot Amos, said it was an amazing partnership between the writers and the developers. Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided to call it "The Simpsons Game" and not add a subtitle was because they felt it was a restart of "the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a big, new, fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time".
"The Simpsons Game" was published by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> and developed by its subsidiary, <a href="Visceral%20Games">EA Redwood Shores</a>; the company had signed a contract for the video game rights to "The Simpsons" in 2005. The game's lead designer, Greg Rizzer, said that when he asked his bosses if they could parody some Electronic Arts games including "<a href="Medal%20of%20Honor%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Medal of Honor</a>", they were enthusiastic about it. "The Simpsons Game", which parodies video games from 30 years prior to 2007, was forced to have some of its content removed after several video game companies complained about it. Rizzer, however, was still pleased with the amount of parody in the game and considered "The Simpsons" the "perfect vehicle to poke fun at the games industry". At the 2007 <a href="Games%20Convention">Games Convention</a> in <a href="Leipzig%2C%20Germany">Leipzig</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, a poster for "Grand Theft Scratchy", one of the levels in "The Simpsons Game" and a parody of "<a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>", was asked to be taken down by an employee of <a href="Rockstar%20Games">Rockstar Games</a>, the company that develops the "Grand Theft Auto" series of video games. Several companies, however, embraced the game's parody of their video games, including developers from <a href="Harmonix">Harmonix</a>, who were pleased with the game's "Sitar Hero", a parody of Harmonix's "<a href="Guitar%20Hero">Guitar Hero</a>" video game. In addition to game parodies, "The Simpsons Game" also features several cameos with satirical spins, including Matt Groening as himself and Will Wright as an antagonist.

The graphics for the game's characters are <a href="cel-shaded%20animation">cel-shaded</a>, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle that the camera views them from, in order to recreate the 2D, hand-drawn look seen in the show. The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment.. There is a different cover for the game on each console.

The game received mixed reception, receiving an aggregated score of 71% on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version of the game. Praise focused on the game's visuals and writing, which lampooned the gaming industry and the show itself. "The Simpsons Game" won the award for Best Game Based on a Movie or TV Show at the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a> 2007, and was nominated for the first-ever award for Best Video Game Writing at the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Awards%202007">Writers Guild of America Awards 2007</a>. As of January 31, 2008, four million copies of the game have been sold overall. Its PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS releases each received a "Platinum" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies per version in the United Kingdom. ELSPA presented the game's Wii, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable versions with "Silver" certifications, for sales of 100,000 units or more each in the region. Peter Nowak of <a href="CBC%20News">CBC News</a> named it the third-best game of 2007 and described it as "easily the best game starring the wacky residents of Springfield".

The game's use of "The Simpsons"-style humor received a mixed reception. Both <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> and <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> said that the game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual "The Simpsons" fans by <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and <a href="GameDaily">GameDaily</a>, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> said that it was worth it to see the humorous parodies. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in "The Simpsons" humor should purchase a <a href="box%20set">box set</a> of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.

Eurogamer praised the involvement of people from "The Simpsons" television series with the game's development and GameZone enjoyed the two-character mechanics of the game and had fun collecting unlockable items. GameTrailers thought the graphics and animations looked great and appreciated the hand-drawn appearances, even though they found it obvious that the characters were "never really meant to jump into the third dimension" because of their second-dimension roots.

Criticism of the game focused on its short, uninspiring gameplay and troublesome <a href="camera%20system">camera system</a>. GameSpot considered the gameplay "nothing special" while GameZone called it a "pretty shallow" game that depended too much on repetitive jumping puzzles and a weak combat system. The game disappointed IGN because it did not include an online feature and it was deemed too short. The camera system was found to be problematic by both GameZone and GameSpy, who called it "a pain" and a "busted" feature; GameDaily also found it bothersome because it often got stuck.

The DS version of the game, which was significantly different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though "The Simpsons Game" parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used them anyway, making it a pointless endeavor.

Electronic Arts planned to produce a sequel to the game, entitled "The Simpsons Game 2", along with a <a href="Nintendo%20Wii">Nintendo Wii</a> version of "<a href="Dead%20Space%202">Dead Space 2</a>", but both were cancelled in 2011 because the studio decided to make room for other projects.

Washington quarter

The Washington quarter is the present <a href="Quarter%20%28U.S.%20coin%29">quarter dollar</a> or 25-cent piece issued by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a>. The coin was first struck in 1932; the original version was designed by sculptor <a href="John%20Flanagan%20%28sculptor%29">John Flanagan</a>.

As the United States prepared to celebrate the 1932 bicentennial of the birth of its first president, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, members of the bicentennial committee established by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> sought a Washington <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a>. They wanted to displace for that year only the regular issue <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty half dollar</a>; instead Congress permanently replaced the <a href="Standing%20Liberty%20quarter">Standing Liberty quarter</a>, requiring that a depiction of Washington appear on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> of the new coin. The committee had engaged sculptor <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a> to design a commemorative medal, and wanted her to adapt her design for the quarter. Although Fraser's work was supported by the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> and its chairman, Charles W. Moore, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a> chose a design by Flanagan, and Mellon's successor, <a href="Ogden%20L.%20Mills">Ogden L. Mills</a>, refused to disturb the decision.

The new silver quarters entered circulation on August 1, 1932; and continued to be struck in silver until the Mint transitioned to copper-nickel clad coinage in 1965. A special <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> commemorating the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a> was used in 1975 and 1976, with all pieces bearing the double date 1776–1976; there are no 1975-dated quarters. Since 1999, the original eagle reverse has not been used; instead that side of the quarter has commemorated <a href="50%20State%20Quarters">the 50 states</a>, <a href="District%20of%20Columbia%20and%20United%20States%20Territories%20Quarter%20Program">the nation's other jurisdictions</a>, and <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> sites—the last as part of the <a href="America%20the%20Beautiful%20Quarters">America the Beautiful Quarters</a> series, which will continue until 2021. The bust of Washington was made smaller beginning in 1999; in 2010 it was restored to bring out greater detail.

On December 2, 1924, Congress created the United States <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> Bicentennial Commission. The 200th anniversary of the birth of Washington, the first President of the United States, would occur in 1932, and Congress wished to plan for the event well in advance. President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> was "ex officio" chairman of the commission, which included government officials as well as prominent private citizens such as automobile manufacturer <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>. In 1929, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Secretary of Commerce</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>, succeeded Coolidge both as president and in his commission role. By that time, however, the commission had become inactive, doing little after sending out an initial flurry of press releases. A new group, the George Washington Bicentennial Committee was established by Act of Congress in February 1930.

Hoover was concerned about the large numbers of designs used for commemorative coins in the 1920s; he feared that confusion would aid counterfeiters. When a commemorative coin bill was sent to him by Congress, Hoover vetoed it on April 21, 1930. In a lengthy veto message delivered to Congress with the returned bill, Hoover noted his counterfeiting concerns, and stated that the coins were selling badly anyway—large quantities of <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar</a>s remained unsold.

The Bicentennial Committee wanted a commemorative Washington half dollar, and sought to assuage Hoover's concerns by proposing that all 1932 half dollars depict Washington instead of bearing the usual <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty</a> design. <a href="The%20Depression">The Depression</a> had decreased demand for coin in commerce; no half dollars had been struck in 1930, and none would be until 1933. Most commemorative coins at the time were struck in a quantity of a few thousand. The half dollar was seen as the largest and most prominent design—the <a href="Peace%20dollar">Peace dollar</a> was not then being struck and did not circulate in much of the country. Other commemoratives had been sold at a premium, the Washington half dollar would, for one year, be the normal Mint issue. Although it had not yet received congressional approval, the committee went ahead and began a competition. The committee anticipated that the same artist would first design the committee's medal and then the coin. The obverse of both medal and coin were to be based on the <a href="George%20Washington%20%28Houdon%29">well-known sculpture of Washington</a> (1786) by French sculptor <a href="Jean-Antoine%20Houdon">Jean-Antoine Houdon</a>; the artist was not restricted as to the reverse design. By law, coinage designs were approved by the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>, at that time <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a>, a noted art collector and connoisseur; it was anticipated he would interpose no objection to the plan.

After reviewing the entries, both the Bicentennial Committee and Fine Arts Commission agreed on designs by <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a>. The wife of <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, designer of the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>, Laura Fraser was a notable coin designer in her own right, having designed several commemorative coins, including the Oregon Trail Memorial pieces. With a right-facing Washington, Fraser's designs were to be used for the medal, and, as those involved expected, the half dollar as well.

On February 9, 1931, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> Representative <a href="Randolph%20Perkins">Randolph Perkins</a> introduced legislation for a Washington quarter, to the dismay of the Bicentennial Committee and Fine Arts Commission. The <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures issued a memorandum stating that the design of the existing <a href="Standing%20Liberty%20quarter">Standing Liberty quarter</a> had been found to be unsatisfactory, and that the new piece would not only be struck for 1932, it would permanently replace the older design. Thus, a new quarter would both be a tribute to Washington on his bicentennial, and relieve the Mint of the burden of having to coin a difficult-to-strike piece. On February 12, Fine Arts Commission Chairman Charles W. Moore wrote to the House Committee, objecting to the change of denomination, and proposing that they mandate that Laura Fraser's design for the medal also appear on the coin. Moore was ignored, and Congress passed authorizing legislation for a Washington quarter on March 4, 1931. The act provided that Washington's image, to appear on the obverse, was to be based on the "celebrated bust" of the former president by <a href="Jean-Antoine%20Houdon">Jean-Antoine Houdon</a>; Fraser had based her design on Houdon's work.

On July 14, 1931, Assistant Mint Director <a href="Mary%20Margaret%20O%27Reilly">Mary Margaret O'Reilly</a> wrote to Moore, asking the Commission's advice on a design competition for the new quarter. Moore replied, stating that as Fraser had won the competition for the medal, she should adapt her design for the quarter. Secretary Mellon responded to Moore, stating that as the Treasury had been no party to the earlier design agreement, it was not bound by it, and would not follow it. The Treasury proceeded to hold a design competition, and when the Fine Arts Commission met to consider the submitted designs in an advisory role, it selected those submitted by Fraser. The designs were submitted to Mellon in November 1931; he selected Flanagan's design and notified Moore of the decision. Moore and commission member <a href="Adolph%20Weinman">Adolph Weinman</a> (who had designed the <a href="Mercury%20dime">Mercury dime</a> and <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty half dollar</a>) attempted to get Mellon to change his mind, but only got him to agree to allow the various sculptors more time to improve their entries—they had asked for more time just for Fraser. On January 20, 1932, following resubmissions, the commission affirmed its support of the Fraser designs.

Mellon left office on February 12, 1932; he was succeeded by <a href="Ogden%20L.%20Mills">Ogden L. Mills</a>. With a new Secretary of the Treasury in office, Moore renewed his protest, sending Mills a letter on March 31 deprecating Flanagan's design and urging the new secretary to accede to the commission's recommendation. Mills had already been briefed by O'Reilly on the quarter matter, and responded to Moore on April 11. Secretary Mills informed Moore that the chairman's letter had caused him to request changes from the sculptor, but that he would not override Mellon's decision. On April 16, the selection of Flanagan's designs was publicly announced.

Mellon was aware of which artists had submitted which designs, and has been accused of discriminating against Fraser as a woman. Numismatic historian <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> stated, "it has been learned that Mellon knew all along who had submitted the winning models, and his male chauvinism partly or wholly motivated his unwillingness to let a woman win." Bowers, however, noted that Mellon had approved Fraser's designs for commemorative coins several times, as well as those by other women, and that no contemporary source speaks to any bias on Mellon's part. Bowers called the belief "modern numismatic fiction". Fraser's design was used in 1999 as a commemorative <a href="half%20eagle">half eagle</a> issued 200 years after Washington's death.

As originally struck, the quarter depicts a head of Washington facing left, with "Liberty" above the head, the date below, and "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>" in the left field. On the reverse, an eagle with wings outspread perches on a bundle of arrows framed below by two olive branches.

In 1785, the French sculptor <a href="Jean-Antoine%20Houdon">Jean-Antoine Houdon</a> was commissioned by the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> to sculpt a bust of Washington, who had led the nascent United States to victory in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Houdon had been recommended by the recently returned <a href="United%20States%20Minister%20to%20France">United States Minister to France</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. The retired general sat for Houdon at <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>, the Washington family home in <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax County, Virginia</a> between October 6 and 12, 1785. The sculptor took a life mask of the general's face—Washington's adopted granddaughter <a href="Eleanor%20Parke%20Custis%20Lewis">Nelly Custis</a>, aged six at the time, later recalled her shock in seeing Washington lying on a table, as she thought dead, covered by a sheet and by the plaster for the mask. She was told that two quills extended into his nostrils, providing him with air. A bust at Mount Vernon today testifies to that visit. On his return to Paris, Houdon used his visage of General Washington in a number of sculptural settings, including the commissioned statue for the General Assembly, which still stands in marble in the <a href="Virginia%20State%20Capitol">Virginia State Capitol</a>.

Portraits of Washington on medals and in other media subsequent to the sculptor's visit were most often based on Houdon's work, beginning with the 1786 "Washington Before Boston" medal engraved by Pierre Simon DuViviers. Although only one American, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, had appeared on a circulating US coin by the 1920s, the Houdon bust had been used as the basis of the portrait of Washington on the commemorative <a href="Lafayette%20dollar">Lafayette dollar</a> dated 1900 and on the <a href="United%20States%20Sesquicentennial%20coinage">Sesquicentennial half dollar</a> of 1926. According to coin dealer and numismatic historian <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, the Houdon bust, even then, was the most common representation of Washington on coins and medals. Little is known of Flanagan's creative process, although models of Flanagan's quarter with a different portrayal of Washington, facing right, and with a different eagle, have come on the market. Flanagan's adaptation differs from the Houdon bust in some particulars: for example, the shape of the head is different, and there is a roll of hair on the quarter not found on the bust.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> said of Flanagan's quarter, "a die designer could do little wrong in having Houdon's Neoclassic image as his prototype ... Still, it might be asked whether or not it was fair to force an ideal[ized] portrait of Washington made in 1785 on an artist working in 1932. There is something cold and lifeless about the results." Vermeule suggests that the quarter started a trend of similar portrait coins issued by the United States, notably the <a href="Jefferson%20nickel">Jefferson nickel</a> and <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">Franklin half dollar</a>. The historian preferred Laura Fraser's version, and termed Flanagan's reverse "a stiff bit of heraldry amid too large a wreath and too much or too large lettering".

In early July 1932, newspapers announced that the Washington quarter was being struck and would be issued at the end of the month, once there were sufficient pieces for a nationwide distribution. They stressed that the new quarter was not a commemorative.

The quarter was released into circulation on August 1, 1932. There was no great need for the coins in commerce; despite that, it was announced that six million pieces would be struck in honor of the Washington bicentennial. The coins were generally well received, though the reverse prompted discussion as to whether a bald eagle was depicted, or some other sort of eagle. An eagle expert consulted by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" concluded it was a bald eagle.

About 6.2 million quarters were struck in 1932, of which 5.4 million were coined at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia</a> mint. Production runs of just over 400,000 each occurred at the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco</a> mints; these are still the low mintages of the series. The small mintage of the 1932 Denver piece meant that few were available to be hoarded by coin dealers, leading to present-day scarcity in <a href="mint%20state">mint state</a> or uncirculated condition; the <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a>s on the 1932-D and 1932-S have been counterfeited. No quarters were struck at any mint in 1933, as there was an oversupply caused by the 1932 issue.

Unlike many earlier coins, the Washington quarter struck exceptionally well, bringing out its full details. This sharpness is possible because the designs of both sides were spread out, with no points of high relief. Nevertheless, the Mint repeatedly adjusted the design. In the first three years of striking (1932, 1934 and 1935), three different varieties of the obverse are known. They are generally called after the appearance of "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust"></a>", to the left of Washington's head: the Light Motto, Medium Motto, and Heavy Motto. Only the first was used in 1932. All three were used on the 1934 Philadelphia strikes, though only the latter two on the 1934 Denver Mint coins. In 1935 only the Medium Motto was used at all three mints. However, the Heavy Motto apparently proved most satisfactory to the Mint as beginning in 1936 only pieces of that variety were struck at all sites.

For unknown reasons, the original reverse hub was used only in 1932; a new hub was used when coining resumed in 1934. The original style had a high rim around the reverse design, protecting it from wear so well that 1932 quarters in lower grade generally are about equally worn on either side. In later years, with a lowered rim, circulated silver pieces tend to be more worn on the reverse.

The fine-tuning of the design continued through the end of silver production with pieces dated 1964. During that time, the obverse was modified six times. One revision, in 1944, left Flanagan's initials, on the cutoff of the bust, distorted; this was adjusted the following year. Beginning in 1937, and continuing until the end of silver circulation production with pieces dated 1964, a very slightly different reverse was used for <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a>s, as opposed to circulation pieces. This is most evident in examining the letters "es" in "States" which almost touch on circulation strikes, and display a separation on proofs.

The piece was struck in numbers exceeding 100 million in some years through 1964. The San Francisco Mint ceased striking coins after 1955; it struck no quarters that year or in 1949.

In 1964, there was a severe shortage of coins. Silver prices were rising, and the public responded by hoarding not only the wildly popular new coin, the <a href="Kennedy%20half%20dollar">Kennedy half dollar</a>, but the other denominations, including the non-silver cent and nickel. Hopeful that issuing more 1964-dated coins would counter the speculation in them, the Treasury obtained Congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.

The Mint's production of coins rapidly depleted the Treasury's stock of silver. Prices for the metal were rising to such an extent that, by early June 1965, a dollar in silver coin contained 93.3 cents' worth of it at market prices. On June 3, 1965, President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> announced plans to eliminate silver from the dime and quarter in favor of a clad composition, with layers of copper-nickel on each side of a layer of pure copper. The half dollar was changed from 90% silver to 40%. Congress passed the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201965">Coinage Act of 1965</a> in July, under which the Mint transitioned from striking 1964-dated silver quarters to striking 1965-dated clad quarters. Beginning on August 1, 1966, the Mint began to strike 1966-dated pieces, and thereafter it resumed the normal practice of striking the current year's date on each piece.

The new clad quarters were struck without <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> in 1965–1967, regardless of the mint of origin. Beginning in 1968, mint marks were used again, except that Philadelphia continued to issue coins without them. The San Francisco Mint had reopened, but from 1968, it struck quarters only for collectors, for the most part <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a>s. The Mint adjusted both sides of the coin for the initiation of clad coinage, lowering the relief (the modified reverse design exists on some 1964-dated silver quarters). The obverse was slightly changed in 1974, with some details sharpened. Mint marks on post-1965 pieces are found on the lower right of the obverse, to the right of Washington's neck.

In January 1973, Representative <a href="Richard%20C.%20White">Richard C. White</a> introduced legislation for commemorative dollars and half dollars for the 1976 <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>. On June 6, Mint Director <a href="Mary%20Brooks">Mary Brooks</a> testified before a congressional committee, and responding to concerns that only the two least-popular denominations would be changed, agreed to support the temporary redesign of the quarter as well. On October 18, 1973, President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> signed legislation mandating a temporary redesign of the three denominations for all coins issued after July 4, 1975, and struck before January 1, 1977. These pieces would bear the double date 1776–1976. In addition to circulation pieces, Congress mandated that 45 million Bicentennial coins be struck in 40% silver. Fearful of creating low-mintage pieces which might be hoarded as the cent recently had been, thus creating a shortage of quarters, in December 1974 the Mint obtained congressional approval to continue striking 1974-dated quarters, half dollars and dollars until Bicentennial coinage began. Accordingly, there are no 1975-dated quarters. Almost two billion Bicentennial quarters were struck, as the Mint sought to assure that there would be plenty of souvenirs of the anniversary. The Mint sold the silver sets, in both uncirculated and proof, for more than a decade before ending sales at the end of 1986. Jack L. Ahr's colonial drummer, which had appeared on the Bicentennial quarter, was replaced after 1976 by Flanagan's original reverse.

Beginning in 1976, and continuing over the following twenty years, Mint engravers modified the design a number of times. The <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>'s mint mark "P" was used beginning in 1980. Coins dated 1982 and 1983, both from Philadelphia and Denver, command a large premium over face value when found in near-pristine condition. Beginning in 1992, the Mint began selling silver proof sets, including a quarter struck in .900 silver; this has continued to the present day. Although President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> signed authorizing legislation for these pieces in 1990, coinage did not begin until 1992 due to difficulty in obtaining sufficient coinage blanks in .900 silver.

The Mint traces the origins of the <a href="50%20State%20Quarters">50 State Quarters</a> program to a congressional hearing in June 1995, at which Mint Director <a href="Philip%20N.%20Diehl">Philip N. Diehl</a>, as well as prominent numismatists, urged Congress to pass legislation allowing a series of circulating commemorative coins similar to the <a href="quarter%20%28Canadian%20coin%29">quarters</a> Canada had recently struck for its provinces. In response, Congress passed the United States Commemorative Coins Act of 1996, which was signed by President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> on October 20, 1996. The act directed the Mint to study whether a series of commemorative quarters would be successful. The Mint duly studied the matter, and reported favorably. Although the act had given <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Robert%20Rubin">Robert Rubin</a> the authority to carry out the report by selecting new coin designs, Secretary Rubin preferred to await congressional action. The resulting 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act was signed by President Clinton on December 1, 1997. Under the act, each of the fifty states would be honored with a new quarter, to be issued five a year beginning in 1999, with the sequence of issuance determined by the order the states had entered the Union. The act allowed the Secretary to determine the position of the required legends, such as "" on the coin: To accommodate a large design on the reverse, "" and "" were moved to the obverse, and the bust of Washington shrunken slightly. A state's design would be selected by the Treasury Secretary on the recommendation of the state's governor.

As part of the series, the Mint sold collector's versions in proof, including pieces struck in .900 silver. The Mint also sold a large number of numismatic items, including rolls and bags of coins, collector's maps, and other items designed to encourage coin collecting among the general public. The Mint estimated that the government profited by $3 billion through <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a> on coins saved by the public and through other revenues, over what it would otherwise have earned.

Legislation to extend the program to the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a> and <a href="Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Organized%20Territory">the territories</a> had been four times passed by the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, but the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> had failed to consider it each time. Provisions authorizing such a program were inserted into an urgent appropriations bill, and passed in December 2007. The resultant 2009 District of Columbia and U.S. Territories Quarters Program maintained the Washington obverse but on the reverse displayed designs in honor of the District of Columbia, <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>, <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>, and the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a>, all minted in 2009.

In 2008, Congress passed the America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act. This legislation called for 56 coins, one for each state or other jurisdiction, to be issued five per year beginning in 2010 and concluding in 2021. Each coin features a <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> site, one to a jurisdiction. Flanagan's head of Washington was restored to bring out detail. In addition to the circulating pieces and collector's versions, <a href="America%20the%20Beautiful%20Silver%20Bullion%20Coins">bullion pieces</a> with 5 troy ounces (155 g) of silver are being struck with the quarter's design.

In February 2012, President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> included in his <a href="2013%20United%20States%20federal%20budget">2013 budget</a> a provision, inserted at the behest of Mint officials, which if enacted would mandate that the silver dimes, quarters, and half dollars produced for collectors be a minimum of .900 silver, rather than requiring that exact fineness. If the provision becomes law, the Mint intends to strike the collector's coins from .999 silver. Alloy which is .900 fine is now being used by the Mint only for these pieces; .999 silver, which is also used for bullion pieces, would be cheaper for the Mint to produce. Customers would pay an additional charge to reflect the extra silver content. In May of that year, the Mint announced plans to strike the first circulation-quality quarters at the San Francisco Mint since 1954, to be sold only at a premium in bags and rolls. All five 2012 designs were struck, the first circulation-quality coins struck at San Francisco since 1983 (when <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a>s were struck without mint mark), and the first with the S mint mark since the <a href="Anthony%20dollar">Anthony dollar</a> in 1981 (struck for mint sets only).

Heian Palace

The or was the original imperial palace of <a href="Heian-ky%C5%8D">Heian-kyō</a> (present-day <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>), the capital of <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, from 794 to 1227. The palace, which served as the imperial residence and the administrative centre of for most of the <a href="Heian%20period">Heian period</a> (from 794 to 1185), was located at the north-central location of the city in accordance with the <a href="China">Chinese</a> models used for the design of the capital.

The palace consisted of a large rectangular <a href="%23Greater%20Palace%20%28Daidairi%29">walled enclosure</a>, which contained several ceremonial and administrative buildings including the government ministries. Inside this enclosure was the separately walled <a href="%23Inner%20Palace%20%28Dairi%29">residential compound</a> of the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">emperor</a> or the "Inner Palace" ("Dairi"). In addition to the emperor's living quarters, the Inner Palace contained the residences of the imperial consorts, as well as certain official and ceremonial buildings more closely linked to the person of the emperor.

The original role of the palace was to manifest the centralised government model adopted by Japan from China in the 7th century—the "<a href="Daij%C5%8D-kan">Daijō-kan</a>" and its subsidiary Eight Ministries. The palace was designed to provide an appropriate setting for the emperor's residence, the conduct of great affairs of state, and the accompanying ceremonies. While the residential function of the palace continued until the 12th century, the facilities built for grand state ceremonies began to fall into disuse by the 9th century. This was due to both the abandonment of several statutory ceremonies and procedures and the transfer of several remaining ceremonies into the smaller-scale setting of the Inner Palace.

From the mid-Heian period, the palace suffered several fires and other disasters. During reconstructions, emperors and some of the office functions resided outside the palace. This, along with the general loss of political power of the court, acted to further diminish the importance of the palace as the administrative centre. Finally in 1227 the palace burned down and was never rebuilt. The site was built over so that almost no trace of it remains. Knowledge of the palace is thus based on contemporary literary sources, surviving diagrams and paintings, and limited excavations conducted mainly since the late 1970s.

The palace was located at the northern centre of the rectangular Heian-kyō, following the Chinese model (specifically that of the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> capital of <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>) adopted already for the <a href="Heij%C5%8D%20Palace">Heijō Palace</a> in the earlier capital <a href="Heij%C5%8D-ky%C5%8D">Heijō-kyō</a> (in present-day <a href="Nara%2C%20Nara">Nara</a>), and <a href="Nagaoka-ky%C5%8D">Nagaoka-kyō</a>. The south-eastern corner of the Greater Palace was located in the middle of the present-day <a href="Nijo%20Castle">Nijō Castle</a>. The main entrance to the palace was the gate <a href="Suzakumon">Suzakumon</a> (), which formed the northern terminus of the great <a href="Suzaku%20Avenue">Suzaku Avenue</a> that ran through the centre of the city from the gate <a href="Raj%C5%8Dmon">Rashōmon</a>. The palace thus faced south and presided over the symmetrical urban plan of Heian-kyō. In addition to the Suzakumon, the palace had 13 other gates located symmetrically along the side walls. A led to each of the gates, except for the three along the northern side of the palace, which was coterminous with the northern boundary of the city itself.

The palace was the first and most important structure to be erected at the new capital of Heian-kyō, where the court moved in 794 following <a href="Emperor%20Kanmu">Emperor Kanmu</a>'s order. The palace was not completely ready by the time of the move, however—the Daigokuden was completed only in 795, and the government office in charge of its construction was disbanded only in 805.

The grand Chinese-style compounds of Chōdō-in and Buraku-in started to fall into disuse quite early on, in parallel with the decline of the elaborate Chinese-inspired "<a href="ritsury%C5%8D">ritsuryō</a>" government processes and bureaucracy, which were gradually either abandoned or reduced to empty forms. The centre of gravity of the palace complex moved to the Inner Palace or Dairi, and the Shishinden and later even the Seiryōden overtook the Daigokuden as loci for the conduct of official government business. 

In parallel with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began to be regarded as increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One reason may be the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.

Fires were a constant problem as the palace compound was constructed almost entirely of wood. The Daigokuden was reconstructed after fires in 876, 1068 and in 1156 despite its limited use. However, after the major fire of 1177 which destroyed much of the Greater Palace, the Daigokuden was never again rebuilt. The Burakuin was destroyed by a fire in 1063 and was never rebuilt.

As of 960, the Dairi was also repeatedly destroyed by fires, but it was systematically rebuilt and used as the official imperial residence until the late 12th century. During periods of rebuilding the Dairi following fires, the emperors frequently had to stay at their secondary palaces within the city. Often these secondary palaces were provided by the powerful <a href="Fujiwara%20clan">Fujiwara</a> family, which especially in the latter part of the Heian period exercised "de facto" control of politics by providing consorts to successive emperors. Thus the residences of the emperors' maternal grandparents started to usurp the residential role of the palace even before the end of the Heian period. The institution of rule by retired emperors or the from 1086 further added to the declining importance of the palace as retired emperors exercised power from their own residential palaces inside and outside the city.

After a fire in 1177, the original palace complex was abandoned and emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former "sato-dairi") within the city and villas outside it. In 1227 a fire finally destroyed what remained of the Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In 1334 <a href="Emperor%20Go-Daigo">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> issued an edict to rebuild the Greater Palace, but no resources were available to support this and the project came to nothing. The present <a href="Kyoto%20Gosho">Kyoto Imperial Palace</a> is located immediately to the west of the site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city. The <a href="Jingi-kan">Jingi-kan</a>, the final standing section of the palace, remained in use until 1585.

While the palace itself has been completely destroyed, a significant amount of information regarding it has been obtained from contemporary and almost contemporary sources. The Heian Palace figures as a background for action in many Heian period literary texts, both fiction and non-fiction. These provide important information on the palace itself, court ceremonies and functions held there as well as everyday routines of the courtiers living or working there. Notable examples include the <a href="Tale%20of%20Genji">Tale of Genji</a> by <a href="Murasaki%20Shikibu">Murasaki Shikibu</a>, the so-called <a href="Pillow%20Book">Pillow Book</a> by <a href="Sei%20Sh%C5%8Dnagon">Sei Shōnagon</a> and the chronicle <a href="Eiga%20Monogatari">Eiga Monogatari</a>. In addition, paintings in certain <a href="emakimono">emakimono</a> picture scrolls depict (sometimes fictional) scenes that took place at the palace; the Genji Monogatari Emaki, dating from about 1130 is perhaps the best-known example. Finally, there are also partially damaged contemporary maps of the palace from the 10th and 12th centuries showing the layout and function of the buildings within Dairi.

In addition to literary evidence, archaeological excavation conducted mainly since the late 1970s have revealed further information about the palace. In particular, the existence and location of buildings such as the Buraku-in compound has been verified against the contemporary documentary sources.

The was a walled rectangular area extending approximately from north to south between the first and second major east-west avenues and and from west to east between the and north-south avenues.
The three main structures within the Greater Palace were the "Official Compound" , the "Reception Compound" and the . 

Chōdō-in was a rectangular walled enclosure situated directly to the north of the Suzakumon gate in the centre of the southern wall of the Greater Palace. It was based on Chinese models and followed Chinese architectural styles, and archaeological evidence from earlier capitals shows that this building complex was present in earlier palaces and had a remarkably stable design from the 7th century onwards.

The main building within the Chōdō-in was the or the Great Audience Hall, facing south at the northern end of the compound. This was a large (approximately 52 m (170 ft) east to west and 20 m (65 ft) north to south) Chinese-style building with white walls, vermilion pillars and green tiled roofs, intended to host the most important state ceremonies and functions. The southern part of the Chōdō-in was occupied by the Twelve Halls where the bureaucracy was seated for ceremonies according to strict order of precedence. The <a href="Heian%20Jing%C5%AB">Heian Jingū</a> shrine in Kyoto includes an apparently faithful reconstruction of the Daigokuden in somewhat reduced scale. 

It was in the Chōdō-in that Accession Audiences were held, the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">emperor</a> was supposed to preside over early morning deliberations on major state affairs by the bureaucracy, receive monthly reports from officials, hold New Year Congratulations and receive foreign ambassadors. However, the practice of the morning deliberations ceased to be followed by 810 as did the monthly reports. Foreign ambassadors were no longer received for most of the Heian period, and the New Year celebrations were abbreviated and moved into the <a href="%23Inner%20Palace%20%28Dairi%29">Dairi</a> by the end of the 10th century, leaving the Accession Audiences and certain Buddhist ceremonials as the only ones held in the Chōdō-in.

The Buraku-in was another large rectangular Chinese-style compound, situated to the west of the Chōdō-in. It was built for official celebrations and banquets and used also for other types of entertainment such as archery contests. Like the Chōdō-in, also the Buraku-in had a hall at the central northern end of the enclosure overseeing the court. This hall, the , was used by the emperor and courtiers presiding over activities in the Buraku-in. However, like the Chōdō-in, the Buraku-in also fell gradually into disuse as many functions were moved to the Dairi. Its site is one of the few within the palace area that has been excavated.

Apart from the Inner Palace, the remaining area of the Greater Palace was occupied by ministries, lesser offices, workshops, storage buildings and the large open space of the "Banqueting Pine Grove" or to the east of the Dairi. The buildings of the "Council of State" or were situated in a walled enclosure immediately to the east of the Chōdō-in, laid out in the typical symmetrical plan of buildings opening to a courtyard in the south. The palace also housed the , apart from <a href="T%C5%8D-ji">Tō-ji</a> and <a href="Sai-ji">Sai-ji</a>, the only <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> establishment permitted within the capital. Its placement right next to the Inner Palace shows the influence of the <a href="Shingon%20Buddhism">Shingon sect</a> during the early Heian Period.

The Inner Palace or Dairi was located to the north-east of the Chōdō-in, somewhat to the east of the central north-south axis of the Greater Palace. Its central feature was the "Throne Hall". The Dairi encompassed the emperor's quarters and the pavilions of the imperial consorts and ladies-in-waiting (collectively, the "<a href="K%C5%8Dky%C5%AB">Kōkyū</a>"). The Dairi was enclosed within two sets of walls. In addition to the Dairi itself, the outer walls enclosed some household offices, storage areas, and the , a walled area of <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> buildings associated with the emperor's religious functions, situated to the west of the Dairi itself, at the geographic centre of the Greater Palace. The principal gate of the larger enclosure was the , located in the southern wall along the median north-south axis of the Dairi.

The Dairi proper, the residential compound of the emperor, was enclosed within another set of walls to the east of Chūwain. It measured approximately 215 m (710 ft) north to south and 170 m (560 ft) east to west. The main gate was the at the centre of the southern wall of the Dairi enclosure, immediately to the north of the Kenreimon gate. In contrast to the solemn official Chinese-style architecture of the Chōdō-in and the Buraku-in, the Dairi was built in more intimate Japanese architectural style — if still on a grand scale. The Inner Palace represented a variant of the <a href="Shinden%20zukuri">shinden style</a> architecture used in the aristocratic villas and houses of the period. The buildings, with unpainted surfaces and gabled and shingled cypress bark roofs, were raised on elevated wooden platforms and connected to each other with covered and uncovered slightly elevated passages. Between the buildings and passages were gravel yards and small gardens. 

The largest building of the Dairi was the "Throne Hall" or , a building reserved for <a href="official%20functions">official functions</a>. It was a rectangular hall measuring approximately 30 m (98 ft) east to west and 25 m (82 ft) north to south, and situated along the median north-south axis of the Dairi, overseeing a rectangular courtyard and facing the Shōmeimon gate. A tachibana orange tree and a sakura cherry tree stood symmetrically on both sides of the front staircase of the building. The courtyard was flanked on both sides by smaller halls connected to the Shishinden, creating the same configuration of buildings (influenced by Chinese examples) that was found in the aristocratic shinden style villas of the period. 
The Shishinden was used for official functions and ceremonies that were not held at the Daigokuden of the Chōdō-in complex. It took over much of the intended use of the larger and more formal building from an early date, as the daily business of government ceased to be conducted in the presence of the emperor in the Daigokuden already at the beginning of the ninth century. Connected to this diminishing reliance on the official government procedures described in the "<a href="Ritsury%C5%8D">Ritsuryō code</a>" was the establishment of a personal secretariat to the emperor, the "Chamberlain's Office" or . This office, which increasingly took over the role of coordinating the work of government organs, was set up in the , the hall to the south-west of the Shishinden.

To the north of the Shishinden stood the , a similarly constructed hall of somewhat smaller size that was intended to function as the emperor's living quarters. However, beginning already in the ninth century, the emperors often chose to reside in other buildings of the Dairi. A third still smaller hall, the was located next to the north along the main axis of the Dairi. After the Dairi was rebuilt following a fire in 960, the regular residence of the emperors moved to the smaller , an east-facing building located immediately to the north-west from Shishinden. Gradually the Seiryōden began to be used increasingly for meetings as well, with emperors spending much of their time in this part of the palace. The busiest part of the building was the , where high-ranking nobles came to meet in the presence of the emperor.

The empress, as well as the official and unofficial imperial consorts, was also housed in the Dairi, occupying buildings in the northern part of the enclosure. The most prestigious buildings, housing the empress and the official consorts, were the ones that had appropriate locations for such use according to the originally Chinese design principles (the , the and the , as well as the ones closest to the imperial residence in Seiryōden (the and the ).
The lesser consorts and ladies-in-waiting occupied other buildings in the northern half of the Dairi.

One of the <a href="Imperial%20Regalia%20of%20Japan">Imperial Regalia of Japan</a>, the emperor's replica of the <a href="Yata%20no%20kagami">sacred mirror</a>, was also housed in the of the Dairi.

The present-day <a href="Kyoto%20Gosho">Kyoto Imperial Palace</a>, located in what was the north-eastern corner of Heian-kyō, reproduces much of the Heian-period Dairi, in particular the Shishinden and the Seiryōden.

The creature appears to have fulfilled Dean's greatest wish: that his mother had not been killed when he was a child. Dean is happy in the new world until it becomes apparent that his previous work as a hunter of supernatural creatures has been undone. At this point, he rejects the alternate reality, and attempts to find a method to bring himself back.

The episode was written by <a href="Raelle%20Tucker">Raelle Tucker</a>, and marked the directorial debut of series creator <a href="Eric%20Kripke">Eric Kripke</a>. It featured the return of deceased characters <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Mary%20Winchester">Mary Winchester</a> (<a href="Samantha%20Smith%20%28actress%29">Samantha Smith</a>) and <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Jessica%20Lee%20Moore">Jessica Moore</a> (<a href="Adrianne%20Palicki">Adrianne Palicki</a>). Kripke enjoyed expanding upon the character of Mary, who was only briefly depicted in earlier episodes. The production schedule had to be altered to accommodate Palicki, who was simultaneously working on the TV series "<a href="Friday%20Night%20Lights%20%28TV%20series%29">Friday Night Lights</a>".

Despite obtaining low ratings, the episode acquired positive critical reviews that both praised Ackles' performance and welcomed the return of Smith and Palicki to the series. Tucker also received a <a href="Constellation%20Awards">Constellation Award</a> for her work on the episode.

The episode begins in an abandoned warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the <a href="jinn">djinn</a> that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself in a world in which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a>. He and his brother Sam (<a href="Jared%20Padalecki">Jared Padalecki</a>) were not raised to be <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Hunters">hunters of supernatural creatures</a>, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (<a href="Michelle%20Borth">Michelle Borth</a>), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)—another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that all the people that he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat adversarial relationship. After visiting the grave of his father <a href="John%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">John</a>, who died the previous year of a stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.

In need of something silver—a weakness of the djinn—Dean breaks into his mother's house to steal a sterling silver knife. However, he is caught by Sam, who thinks he's stealing from their mother. While Dean at first pretends that he needs the knife to repay a gambling debt, he eventually reveals the truth. Although Sam does not believe him, he accompanies his brother to the djinn's warehouse lair. There Dean discovers that the young woman he has been having visions of is a victim of the djinn. It's clear that she is alive but in an hallucinatory state—a way for the djinn to keep its victims unresisting while it feeds—Dean realizes that he, too, is within an illusory world. Knowing that a person wakes up if he or she dies in a dream, he decides to kill himself. Carmen, Jessica, and his mother appear and try to talk him out of it. Dean resists the urge to stay, and awakens in the real world after stabbing himself. Sam, who is already in the warehouse trying to rescue him, is attacked by the djinn, but Dean kills the creature.

Series creator Eric Kripke's first experience as director was slated for the twentieth episode of the season, and Raelle Tucker was scheduled to pen it. Kripke wanted a script that was as "director-proof as possible", but that would "play with structure and really do something different". He shot down every idea the writers pitched to him until Tucker suggested an alternate reality episode. Drawing inspiration from the "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>" episode "<a href="Normal%20Again">Normal Again</a>", Kripke was excited by the concept. He felt Dean's definitive moment was the death of his mother Mary, so the "diversion path" of the new reality would be based on the question, "What if mom never died?" This change allows Sam and Dean to live normal lives, though at the cost of their relationship. The point of the false reality, in Kripke's opinion, was to show that the brothers would not be close if they had not become hunters. The staff tried to persuade him to remove this aspect, but he thought it would be "lame" for Sam and Dean to have a ""<a href="7th%20Heaven%20%28TV%20series%29">7th Heaven</a>" relationship". Once the story was fully developed, Tucker was given free rein over the script; this surprised her because she expected Kripke to "be more of a backseat driver than he was".

The opportunity to bring back the character of Mary Winchester excited Kripke. Though she is a driving force behind the brothers' quest to kill the demon Azazel and is referenced numerous times throughout the first two seasons, her two appearances in the series were very brief. The episode allowed the character to be expanded upon, depicting her as a "really perfect and idyllic mother". However, Kripke felt that Dean would realize something was amiss if he was granted a "perfect dream world", so John Winchester, who died in the second season premiere, remained dead.

The final version of the episode differed from the original concept. It was initially intended for Dean to be a "huge loser" in his new life; being a hunter is what gives him structure and purpose. Without hunting, he would be a jobless barfly. Kripke compared the new reality to a <a href="Charles%20Bukowski">Charles Bukowski</a> novel, but noted that the selfless Dean still preferred the new universe, with Sam happy and living a good life. However, executive producer Robert Singer and others convinced him to change this, because they did not think Dean would be happy suddenly waking up in such a reality. Another variation stemmed from Dean's lack of someone to confide in—normally Sam is his confidant. Because the writers found it difficult to communicate Dean's feelings, early drafts of the script included a number of internal monologues. These were ultimately replaced by a scene in which he discusses the djinn with a professor. The studio wanted the scene of Dean and his girlfriend Carmen kissing on the sofa to include sex. However, Kripke could not work it into the script, because he found it unrealistic that she would deliberately be late for her job as a hospital nurse.

The writers wanted to use a wish to create the new reality, and chose a genie to facilitate it. The Islamic <a href="Genie">djinn</a>—the origins of genie folklore—became the episode's monster, but featured the "bastardized western conception" of wish-granting to fit the episode. To avoid the typical portrayal of <a href="Jinn%20in%20popular%20culture">genies in popular culture</a>—such as those from "<a href="Genie%20%28Aladdin%29">Aladdin</a>" and "<a href="I%20Dream%20of%20Jeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a>"—they chose to create a "logical twist on the lore" by making the creature vampiric. Tucker originally intended for the creature's feeding method to be mystical—it would inhale its victim's life essence from his or her mouth. However, Kripke preferred to style it more like a horror movie, and had the djinn feed from a <a href="Shunt%20%28medical%29">shunt</a> in its victim's neck.

The creature's appearance was inspired by an image of a woman with a <a href="Mehndi">henna-tattooed</a> back that Kripke found on the internet. He thought it would be intriguing to have the villain's entire body tattooed. The actor who portrayed the djinn—<a href="Mackenzie%20Gray">Mackenzie Gray</a>—had a shaved head, so special effects makeup artist Toby Lindala only used a minor prosthetic to cover Gray's eyebrows. Lindala found the tattoos to be a "particular challenge" because they were "intricate designs". The production schedule could not accommodate the six hours needed to apply the makeup each day, so the actor was booked with the condition that the make-up not be removed for four days. Gray's personal life was affected by this, as people on the street were scared by his appearance. Lindala was surprised that Gray was able to keep the tattoos undamaged outside of filming.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> for the episode took place in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. Kripke wanted <a href="Adrianne%20Palicki">Adrianne Palicki</a> to reprise her role of Jessica Moore—Sam's deceased girlfriend—but she was busy filming for the Texas-based television series "<a href="Friday%20Night%20Lights%20%28TV%20series%29">Friday Night Lights</a>". Because Jessica was an integral aspect of the storyline, the production schedule was adjusted to accommodate the actress. The first five days of filming commenced for "What Is and What Should Never Be", and production then shifted to "<a href="All%20Hell%20Breaks%20Loose%20%28Supernatural%29">All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One</a>" until Palicki became available for the final three days of filming. However, she was not present for filming of the episode's climax. Instead, the actress filmed her part in front of a <a href="Chroma%20key">blue screen</a>, and was later digitally added into the scene.

Because the series usually has a dark atmosphere, often consisting of "sets with grime and a sense of danger", Kripke wanted there to be a contrast between the two worlds. Therefore, he requested that production designer Jerry Wanek build the "most beautiful, warm, affectionate sets you’ve ever seen". Cinematographer Serge Ladouceur also made the usual shadows and "moody lighting" more colorful and warm. Though it rained almost constantly through filming, perfect weather arose for filming of one of the main contrasting scenes—Dean mowing the lawn. Kripke wanted it to appear "too perfect to be real", and was able to film the "sunny, beautiful scene". The "creepy" warehouse used as a lair by the djinn was a redesigned warehouse set from the television series "<a href="Kyle%20XY">Kyle XY</a>".
One of the first directors Kripke had become acquainted with and learned from was <a href="David%20Nutter">David Nutter</a>. Kripke thus wanted to include homages to Nutter's work on the <a href="Pilot%20%28Supernatural%29">pilot</a>; some scenes of the new reality were meant to be recreations from the first episode. The crew attempted to match the camera angles, lighting, and music as much as possible. While Sam and Jessica sleeping together in bed was supposed to be an exact replica of a similar scene, the fight between the brothers differed. Because the new Sam is "pretty much a wussy", Dean is able to take him down instantly. Tucker noted that it was also a "sneaky way" of hinting that the new reality was merely an illusion, as he is "re-experiencing that moment from the pilot because his fantasy world is being generated by what he already knows and has lived".

Many of the photos present throughout the Winchester home were <a href="photoshopped">photoshopped</a> by graphic artist Mary-Ann Liu. Each one was discussed and refined, as Kripke felt they were important to show the new Winchester family history. Some pictures, such as Dean at the prom and Sam at graduation, were edited versions of photos from Ackles' and Padalecki's childhood.

The episode's synthesized orchestral score was written by <a href="Christopher%20Lennertz">Christopher Lennertz</a>. As of production of the <a href="Supernatural%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a>, the episode has been his favorite one to score. Lennertz used a solo bassoon for the emotional scenes in the alternate reality rather than the cello he normally uses for Sam and Dean's relationship. He noted that it "set a very interesting lead tone for the episode". Following the series' tradition, the episode also featured rock songs.

In its original broadcast, "What Is and What Should Never Be" was viewed by an estimated 3.11 million viewers, one of the lowest ratings for the season. Conversely, writer Raelle Tucker won the Constellation Award for "Best Overall 2007 Science Fiction Film or Television Script" for her work on the episode, and the episode garnered positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of <a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a> "adored" the episode, and considered it to be Jensen Ackles' best performance of the series. She experienced an "emotional roller coaster the entire hour", finding Dean's monologue at his father's grave to be "crushing" but the lawnmower scene to be "hilarious". Likewise, Diana Steenbergen of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave the episode a rating of 9.2 out of 10, praising the quick pace, "heavy" character development, and "ton and a half of angst". She, too, felt that Ackles "hits the ball out of the park", and noted that the episode's humor stemmed from Ackles' willingness to be a "big goofball". Actresses Samantha Smith and Adrianne Palicki were "a treat", although Steenbergen would have liked <a href="Jeffrey%20Dean%20Morgan">Jeffrey Dean Morgan</a> to return.

Tom Burns of <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO</a> deemed the episode as "one of the strongest hours of "Supernatural" all season", feeling that "the actors really stepped up their game...and sold every moment". He also noted the "unapologetically emotional" Ackles, who "[wore] his joy, sadness, and anxiety all over this face, but always [kept] things real and in character". Though Burns believed that "wish-world" stories have been overused in fiction, he felt that Ackles' "hardcore acting chops" allowed the episode to "escape from mediocrity". The "outstanding" and "well crafted" episode was given a 7 out of 7 by <a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>'s Brett Love. He considered the djinn as "one of the better representations" of genies in popular culture, and noted that the creature had the "perfect creepy look to it". He was pleased to see Smith and Palicki return, and found the character of Carmen to be "a nice addition to the family". Don Williams of <a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a> agreed, and ranked the episode third in his list of the best episodes of the first three seasons. Deeming it the best standalone episode, he noted that it "can be embraced by anyone who enjoys clever writing, great acting, or a shirtless Jensen Ackles".

Triptych, May–June 1973

Triptych, May–June 1973 is a <a href="triptych">triptych</a> completed in 1973 by the Irish-born artist <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a> (1909–1992). The oil-on-canvas was painted in memory of Bacon's lover <a href="George%20Dyer%20%28burglar%29">George Dyer</a>, who committed suicide on the eve of the artist's retrospective at Paris's <a href="Grand%20Palais">Grand Palais</a> on 24 October 1971. The triptych is a portrait of the moments before Dyer's death from an overdose of pills in their hotel room. Bacon was haunted and preoccupied by Dyer's loss for the remaining years of his life and painted many works based on both the actual suicide and the events of its aftermath. He admitted to friends that he never fully recovered, describing the 1973 triptych as an exorcism of his feelings of loss and guilt.

The work is stylistically more static and monumental than Bacon's earlier triptychs of Greek figures and friends' heads. It has been described as one of his "supreme achievements" and is generally viewed as his most intense and tragic canvas. Of the three "<a href="Black%20Triptychs">Black Triptychs</a>" Bacon painted when confronting Dyer's death, "Triptych, May–June 1973" is generally regarded as the most accomplished. In 2006, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"'s art critic Sarah Crompton wrote that "emotion seeps into each panel of this giant canvas ... the sheer power and control of Bacon's brushwork take the breath away". "Triptych, May–June 1973" was purchased at auction in 1989 by <a href="Esther%20Grether">Esther Grether</a> for $6.3 million, then a record for a Bacon painting.

Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon "George was down the far end of the bar and he came over and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the prominent artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End of London</a> in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.

Bacon's relationships prior to Dyer had all been with older men who were as tumultuous in temperament as the artist himself, but each had been the dominating presence. Peter Lacy, his first lover, would often tear up the young artist's paintings, beat him up in drunken rages, and leave him on the street half-conscious. Bacon was attracted to Dyer's vulnerability and trusting nature. Dyer was impressed by Bacon's self-confidence and his artistic success, and Bacon acted as a protector and father figure to the insecure younger man. Dyer was, like Bacon, a borderline alcoholic and similarly took obsessive care with his appearance. Pale-faced and a chain-smoker, Dyer typically confronted his daily hangovers by drinking again. His compact and athletic build belied a docile and inwardly tortured personality; the art critic <a href="Michael%20Peppiatt">Michael Peppiatt</a> described him as having the air of a man who could "land a decisive punch". Their behaviours eventually overwhelmed their affair, and by 1970, Bacon was merely providing Dyer with enough money to stay more or less permanently drunk.
As Bacon's work moved from the extreme subject matter of his early paintings to portraits of friends in the mid-1960s, Dyer became a dominating presence in the artist's work. Bacon's treatment of his lover in these canvasses emphasises his subject's physicality while remaining uncharacteristically tender. More than any other of the artist's close friends portrayed during this period, Dyer came to feel inseparable from his effigies. The paintings gave him stature, a "raison d'être", and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer's "brief interlude between life and death". Many critics have cited Dyer's portraits as favourites, including <a href="Michel%20Leiris">Michel Leiris</a> and Lawrence Gowling. Yet as Dyer's novelty diminished within Bacon's circle of sophisticated intellectuals, the younger man became increasingly bitter and ill at ease. Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him, he did not pretend to understand or even like them. "All that money an' I fink they're reely 'orrible", he observed with choked pride. He abandoned crime but soon descended into alcoholism. Bacon's money allowed Dyer to attract hangers-on who would accompany him on massive <a href="binge%20drinking">benders</a> around London's <a href="Soho">Soho</a>. Withdrawn and reserved when sober, Dyer was insuppressible when drunk, and would often attempt to "pull a Bacon" by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle. Dyer's erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin—with his cronies, with Bacon, and with Bacon's friends. Most of Bacon's art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance—an intrusion into the world of high culture to which "their" Bacon belonged. Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent. By 1971, he was drinking alone and was only in occasional contact with his former lover.

In October 1971, Dyer accompanied Bacon to Paris for the opening of the artist's retrospective at the "<a href="Grand%20Palais">Grand Palais</a>". The show was the high point of Bacon's career to date, and he was now being described as Britain's "greatest living painter". Dyer was now a desperate man, and although he was "allowed" to attend, he was well aware that he was "slipping", in every sense, out of the picture. To draw Bacon's attention he earlier planted cannabis in Bacon's flat, then phoned the police, and he had attempted suicide on a number of occasions. Dyer committed suicide, via an overdose of barbiturates, on the eve of the Paris exhibition in their shared hotel room. Bacon spent the following day surrounded by people eager to meet him. In mid-evening he was informed that Dyer had taken an overdose of <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s and was dead. Though devastated, Bacon continued with the retrospective and displayed powers of self-control "to which few of us could aspire", according to Russell. Bacon was deeply affected by the loss of Dyer, and he had recently lost four other friends and his nanny. From this point on, death haunted his life and work. Though he gave a stoic appearance at the time, he was inwardly broken. He did not express his feelings to critics, but later admitted to friends that "daemons, disaster and loss" now stalked him as if his own version of the <a href="Erinyes">Eumenides</a>. Bacon spent the remainder of his stay in Paris attending to promotional activities and funeral arrangements. He returned to London later that week to comfort Dyer's family. The funeral proved to be an emotional affair for all, and many of Dyer's friends, including hardened East-End criminals, broke down in tears. As the coffin was lowered into the grave one attendant screamed "you bloody fool!". Although Bacon remained stoic throughout, in the following months Dyer preoccupied his imagination as never before. To confront his loss, he painted a number of tributes on small canvasses and his three "Black Triptych" masterpieces.

In each panel, Dyer is framed by a doorway, and set against a flat, anonymous foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic <a href="Colm%20T%C3%B3ib%C3%ADn">Colm Tóibín</a>, "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed in the shape of a demon or <a href="Erinyes">Eumenide</a>. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, "life seems to visibly drain ... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the blackness of the background has enveloped the subject, and it "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws."

In the right panel, Dyer is shown with his eyes shut, vomiting into a hand basin. In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon often used to place a sense of energy into his paintings. In this work, the arrows point to a man about to die, and according to Tóibín they scream "Here!", "Him!". The arrow of the right panel, according to Tóibín, points to a "dead figure on the lavatory bowl, as though telling the Furies where to find him". The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and by the fact that Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses. The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground.
"Triptych, May–June 1973" has been said to achieve its tension by locating voluptuously described figures in an austere, cage-like space. The foreground of each panel is bounded by a wall, which runs parallel to a framing door. Each door admits a stark black into its frame, while the walls establish a link between each of the three Black Triptychs. In 1975, the curator Hugh M. Davis noted that while Bacon's earlier triptychs had been set in public spaces "open to all kinds of visitor", the Black Triptychs are set in a "deeply private realm, to which only the individual—accompanied, perhaps, by one or two of his closest friends—has access". In 1999, Yard wrote that the sense of foreboding and ill-omen conjured by the Eumenides of Bacon's "<a href="Three%20Studies%20for%20Figures%20at%20the%20Base%20of%20a%20Crucifixion">Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion</a>" (1944) reappears in the triptych as a "batlike void that snared the figure of George Dyer as he subsides into the supple curves of death". John Russell observed that the painting's background describes an area which is half studio, half condemned cell. A reviewer of the 1975 <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> exhibition found a resemblance between the concept of the central panel and <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>'s engraving "<a href="Melencolia%20I">Melencolia I</a>" (1514)—in the figure's pose, the bat form, and the panel's radiance—suggesting that Bacon's late triptychs evoke "memorable figural formulations" of classic Western culture.

Bacon later stated that "painting has nothing to do with colouring surfaces", and in general he was not preoccupied with detailing his backgrounds: "When I feel that I have to some extent formed the image, I put the background in to see how it's going to work and then I go with the image itself." He told David Sylvester that he intended his "hard, flat, bright ground" to juxtapose with the complexity of the central images, and noted that "for this work, it can work more starkly if the background is very united and clear. I think that probably is why I have used a very clear background against which the image can articulate itself". Bacon usually applied paint to the background quickly, and with "great energy"; however, he thought of it as a secondary element. He used its colour to establish tone, but in his mind the real work began when he came to paint the figures.

Critics have argued whether the triptych should be read sequentially from left to right. Davies believes the work is a narrative, panoramic view of Dyer's suicide, and that the triptych's format implies a temporal continuity between each frame. Ernst van Alphen has argued that, notwithstanding spatial inconsistencies—the light bulb featured in the central panel is missing from the two outer canvasses, while the doorway view is reversed in the center panel—the triptych is a "plain representation of a story".

Bacon's work from the 1970s has been described by the art critic Hugh Davies as the "frenzied momentum of a struggle against death". Bacon admitted during a 1974 interview that he thought the most difficult aspect of aging was "losing your friends". This was a bleak period in his life, and though he was to live for another seventeen years, he felt that his life was almost over, "and all the people I've loved are dead". His concern is reflected in the darkened flesh and background tones of his paintings from this period. His acute sense of mortality and awareness of the fragility of life were heightened by Dyer's death in Paris. In the next three years he painted many images of his former lover, including the series of three "Black Triptychs" which have come to be seen as among his best work. A number of characteristics bind the triptychs together: the form of a monochromatically rendered doorway features centrally in all, and each is framed by flat and shallow walls. In each three Dyer is stalked by a broad shadow; which takes the form of pools of blood or flesh in the outer panels and the wings of the angel of death in the left hand and central images. In its display caption for "<a href="Triptych%E2%80%93August%201972">Triptych–August 1972</a>" the <a href="Tate%20gallery">Tate gallery</a> wrote, "What death has not already consumed seeps incontinently out of the figures as their shadows."
Each of the three "<a href="Black%20Triptychs">Black Triptychs</a>" displays sequential views of a single figure, and each seems to be intended to be viewed as if stills from a film. The figures rendered are not drawn from any of Bacon's usual intellectual sources; they do not depict <a href="Golgotha">Golgotha</a>, <a href="Lucius%20Accius">Handes</a>, or <a href="Leopold%20Bloom">Leopold Bloom</a>. In these pictures Bacon strips Dyer from the context of both Dyer's own life and the artist's life, and presents him as a nameless, slumped, gathering of flesh, awaiting the onset of death. Describing the Black Triptychs in 1993, the art critic <a href="Juan%20Vicente%20Aliaga">Juan Vicente Aliaga</a> wrote that "the horror, the abjection that oozed from the crucifixes has been transformed in his last paintings into quiet solitude. The masculine bodies entwined in a carnal embrace have given way to the solitary figure leaning over the washbasin, standing firm on the smooth ground, neutral, bald-headed, his convex back deformed, his testicles contracted in a fold."

When asked by the broadcaster <a href="Melvyn%20Bragg">Melvyn Bragg</a> in 1984 if the portraits painted in the wake of Dyer's death were depictions of his emotional reaction to the event, Bacon replied that he did not consider himself to be an "<a href="expressionism">expressionist</a> painter". He explained that he was "not trying to express anything, I wasn't trying to express the sorrow about somebody committing suicide ... but perhaps it comes through without knowing it". When Bragg inquired if he often thought about death, the artist replied that he was always aware of it, and that although "it's just around the corner for [me], I don't think about it, because there's nothing to think about. When it comes, it's there. You've had it." Reflecting on the loss of Dyer, Bacon observed that as part of aging, "life becomes more of a desert around you". He told Bragg that he believed in "nothing. We are born and we die and that's it. There is nothing else." Bragg asked Bacon what he did about that reality, and after the artist told him he did nothing about it, Bragg pleaded, "No Francis, you try and paint it."

Throughout his career, Bacon consciously and carefully avoided explaining the meaning behind his paintings, and pointedly observed that they were not intended as narratives, nor open to interpretation. When Bragg challenged him with the observation that "Triptych, May–June 1973" was the nearest the artist had come to telling a story, Bacon admitted that "it is in fact the nearest I've ever done to a story, because you know that is the triptych of how [Dyer] was found". He went on to say that the work reflected not just his reaction to Dyer's death, but his general feelings about the fact that his friends were then dying around him "like flies". A borderline alcoholic himself, Bacon continued to explain that his dead friends were "generally heavy drinkers", and that their deaths led directly to his composition of a series of meditative self-portraits which emphasised his own aging and awareness of the passage of time.

The history of <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa F.C.</a> from 1961 to the current season covers the fluctuating fortunes of the club during the 1960s and 1970s, the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> victory in 1982 and the present day's <a href="EFL%20Championship">EFL Championship</a> club.

The late 1960s was a turbulent time for the club and pressure from fans led to a change of ownership and management. The problems started when the club was <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> from the first tier of English football for the third time, under manager <a href="Dick%20Taylor%20%28football%20manager%29">Dick Taylor</a> in 1967. Within two years, pressure from supporters had led to the resignation of the <a href="board%20of%20directors">board of directors</a>. The club was then relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>. In the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football">1971–72 season</a> Aston Villa returned to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> as champions with a record 70 points. In 1974 <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a> was appointed manager and by 1975 he had led the club back into the First Division and into European competition. The club was back among the elite and it continued to have much success under Saunders and won the league in the <a href="1980-81%20in%20English%20football">1980–81</a> season. Saunders' resignation halfway through the <a href="1981-82%20in%20English%20football">1981–82</a> season came as a surprise, with the club in the quarter-final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his assistant manager <a href="Tony%20Barton%20%28footballer%29">Tony Barton</a> who guided them to 1–0 victory over <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="1982%20European%20Cup%20Final">European Cup final</a> in Rotterdam. However, winning the cup marked a pinnacle and the club fell steadily down the League standings over the next five years and was <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegated</a> in 1987. However, the club was promoted the following year and achieved second place in the Football League in 1989.

Villa was one of the founding members of the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> in 1992, and finished runners-up to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">inaugural season</a>. The 1990s was a decade of inconsistency; the club had three different managers and league positions were unpredictable, despite winning two League Cups. They reached the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> <a href="FA%20Cup%20Final">Final</a> for the first time since 1957 in <a href="2000%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2000</a>, but lost 1–0 to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> in the last game to be played at the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">old Wembley Stadium</a>. Once again Villa's league position fluctuated under various managers and in the summer of 2006, <a href="David%20O%27Leary">David O'Leary</a> left under acrimonious circumstances. <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a> soon arrived and received a rapturous reception. After 23 years as chairman and largest shareholder, owning approximately 38% of the club, <a href="Doug%20Ellis">Doug Ellis</a> decided to sell his stake to <a href="Randy%20Lerner">Randy Lerner</a>, the owner of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">NFL</a> franchise <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>. The arrival of a new owner and manager marked the start of sweeping changes throughout the club, including a new crest, a new kit sponsor and new players in the summer of 2007. After several years of narrowly avoiding the drop, Villa were relegated at the end of the 2015–16 season.

Winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="1961%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1961</a> was a pinnacle for the club. Although Villa finished seventh in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a>, the following season saw the beginning of a decline in form that would see them finish in 15th place in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1963</a> and fourth from bottom in <a href="1963-64%20in%20English%20football">1964</a>. The manager <a href="Joe%20Mercer">Joe Mercer</a> parted company with the club in July 1964 because of these results and his declining health. His replacement, <a href="Dick%20Taylor">Dick Taylor</a>, managed to avoid relegation in the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football">1964–65 season</a> as Villa finished 16th after a poor start to the season. The following year Villa finished 16th once again. Following a 4–2 final day defeat by <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> the club was relegated to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> in the <a href="1966-67%20in%20English%20football">1966–67 season</a>. Manager <a href="Dick%20Taylor%20%28football%20manager%29">Dick Taylor</a> was sacked and <a href="Tommy%20Cummings">Tommy Cummings</a> was appointed in his place. The decline was not solely the responsibility of the manager; the club had an ageing five-man board "who had failed to adapt to the new football reality." The club had neither developed a scouting network nor an effective coaching structure. The board had also sold two of Villa's best players, <a href="Phil%20Woosnam">Phil Woosnam</a> and <a href="Tony%20Hateley">Tony Hateley</a>. The fans' calls for the board to resign became more and more pronounced when Villa finished 16th in the Second Division in 1968. 

Events on the pitch came to a head in November 1968, with Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two; the board sacked Cummings. On 21 November 1968 the problems in the boardroom were highlighted when a board member, George Robinson, resigned. Following his resignation the board issued a statement: "[The board] would make available, by their resignation, such seats as new financial arrangements might require." Aston Villa F.C was up for sale. After much speculation, control of the club was bought by <a href="London">London</a> financier <a href="Pat%20Matthews">Pat Matthews</a>, who brought in local travel-agent <a href="Doug%20Ellis">Doug Ellis</a> as <a href="chair%20%28official%29">chairman</a> of the new board that was convened on 16 December 1968. Two days later <a href="Tommy%20Docherty">Tommy Docherty</a> was appointed as manager.

Docherty rebuilt confidence in the team and Villa went on to win five consecutive games and retained a place in the Second Division. In the short time that Docherty had been at the club, attendances rose significantly from a low of just over 12,000 against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> in December. In the summer of 1969 the first share issue since 1896 raised £200,000 for the club, £140,000 of which was spent on new players. In the following season, however, Villa took ten games to register a win. By Christmas 1969, Villa were at the bottom of the Second Division and Docherty was sacked. His successor, <a href="Vic%20Crowe">Vic Crowe</a>, was unable to prevent Aston Villa from being relegated to the third tier of English football for the first time in its history in the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20in%20English%20football">1969–70 season</a>. Despite finishing fourth in the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> in the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20in%20English%20football">1970–71 season</a>, Villa reached the <a href="1971%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> after beating <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in the semi-final. They were defeated in the final by <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a> 2–0. The <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football">1971–72 season</a> saw the club return to the Second Division as champions with a then divisional record 70 points. They were invited to take part in the <a href="1972%20FA%20Charity%20Shield">1972 FA Charity Shield</a> but lost 1–0 to <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a>. In the autumn of 1972, there was a revolt in the boardroom and four of the five directors voted to oust Doug Ellis from the board. Within 43 days though, Ellis was reinstated as chairman after he received the support of the largest shareholder Pat Matthews, and the supporters at an <a href="Extraordinary%20General%20Meeting">EGM</a>, who also voted to replace the existing directors. Their first season back in the Second Division in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20in%20English%20football">1972–73</a> saw Villa narrowly miss out on a second successive promotion when they finished third. However, the following season Villa finished 14th and Ellis sacked Crowe, replacing him with <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a>.

For the club's centenary season of <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75</a>, Saunders brought in only two new players, <a href="Frank%20Carrodus">Frank Carrodus</a> and <a href="Leighton%20Phillips">Leighton Phillips</a>. At the end of his first season in charge, Villa were back in the First Division after finishing second, and had won the <a href="1975%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1975 League Cup final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. Villa beat <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> 1–0 with <a href="Ray%20Graydon">Ray Graydon</a> scoring the winning goal. At the beginning of the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">1975–76 season</a> Doug Ellis resigned as chairman but remained on the board. Ellis left the club in a good position on the field. They were in the First Division and the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> for the first time due to the League Cup win of 1975. The club's first season of European football was short-lived though as they were beaten 5–1 by <a href="Royal%20Antwerp%20FC">Antwerp</a> in the first round. In the following season, Villa finished fourth in the League, and reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. In the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77 season</a>, two years after their last League Cup win, they beat Everton 3–2 in the <a href="1977%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1977 Final</a> after a second replay.

In the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20in%20English%20football">1977–78 season</a> Villa reached the quarter-final of the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> where they went out 4–3 <a href="two-legged%20match">on aggregate</a> against <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his team in the summer of 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board. The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned from the board. Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances. <a href="Allan%20Evans%20%28footballer%29">Allan Evans</a>, <a href="Ken%20McNaught">Ken McNaught</a> and <a href="Kenny%20Swain">Kenny Swain</a> were brought into the defence and <a href="Des%20Bremner">Des Bremner</a> was brought into the midfield to play alongside <a href="Dennis%20Mortimer">Dennis Mortimer</a> and <a href="Gordon%20Cowans">Gordon Cowans</a>. <a href="Tony%20Morley">Tony Morley</a> and <a href="Gary%20Shaw">Gary Shaw</a> were the new strike partnership. When <a href="Peter%20Withe">Peter Withe</a> was signed from <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> in the summer of 1980, Saunders had built a team that was to see much success in the next few years.

The first success was to come in the <a href="1980-81%20in%20English%20football">1980–81 season</a> when Villa won their first League Championship for 71 years, fighting off competition from <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> and <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> using only 14 playing staff in the whole season. The title was sealed on the final day of the season when they lost 2–0 at <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> but still finished top as Ipswich Town, the only side still in contention for the title, lost to <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a>. This triumph was popularly known as the "transistor championship" as Villa fans had turned up at the game listening to the progress of the Ipswich game on their <a href="transistor">transistor</a> audio sets.

The next season Villa did not start well and they were in mid-table at Christmas although the club was still in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>. In the first round Villa beat <a href="Valur">Valur</a> 7–0 on aggregate. In the second round they scored twice at <a href="Berliner%20FC%20Dynamo">Dynamo Berlin</a> to achieve a 2–2 draw, which saw them go through due to the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>. These victories were in contrast to their poor performance in the league. By February 1982, the club were lying 19th in the First Division and Saunders resigned. It was later disclosed that the then chairman, Ron Bendall, had offered him a revised, shorter term, contract, which he had refused to accept. Saunders' assistant <a href="Tony%20Barton%20%28footballer%29">Tony Barton</a> was promoted in his place. When Barton took over, although Villa were in a poor league position, they were in the quarter-final of the European Cup. In the quarter-finals, they beat <a href="Dynamo%20Kiev">Dynamo Kiev</a> over two legs. Gordon Cowans is quoted as saying, "Once we got past Dynamo Kiev we began thinking we could go all the way." In the semi-final, they played <a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> over two legs, with Tony Morley scoring to secure Aston Villa's place in the final.

On 26 May 1982, just three months after being appointed manager, Barton guided Villa to a 1–0 victory over <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="1982%20European%20Cup%20Final">European Cup final</a> in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>. As of January 2008, Villa remain one of only five English teams to have won the European Cup, along with <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, Liverpool, Manchester United and <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>. They were the underdogs in the final and were expected to lose.

The final was held in <a href="Feijenoord%20Stadion">Feyenoord Stadium</a>, Rotterdam, with an attendance of 39,776. Only nine minutes into the game, Villa lost their experienced goalkeeper <a href="Jimmy%20Rimmer">Jimmy Rimmer</a> to a shoulder injury. He was replaced by 23-year-old reserve goalkeeper <a href="Nigel%20Spink">Nigel Spink</a>, who had only played one match for the club in five years since joining from <a href="Chelmsford%20City%20F.C.">Chelmsford</a>. Spink went on to make one of his best performances for the club against the highly experienced Bayern strikeforce, which included <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Rummenigge">Karl-Heinz Rummenigge</a>. Other key players in this Villa side included <a href="Tony%20Morley">Tony Morley</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Cowans">Gordon Cowans</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Mortimer">Dennis Mortimer</a>.

The win was not followed with more success and the team performed badly in the following seasons. At the <a href="Annual%20general%20meeting">AGM</a> in October 1982, it was revealed that the club were in £1.6 million of debt, mainly due to escalating wages and building costs, including the construction of the North Stand. At the end of November Ron and Donald Bendall resigned from the board to be replaced by Doug Ellis, who bought Ron Bendall's 42% shareholding. In January 1983, Villa beat Barcelona 3–1 on aggregate to win the <a href="1982%20UEFA%20Super%20Cup">1982 UEFA Super Cup</a>. Barton remained in charge for two seasons after the European Cup triumph, but was sacked at the end of the <a href="1983-84%20in%20English%20football">1983–84 season</a> despite Villa finishing tenth in the First Division and reaching the semi-finals of the League Cup. <a href="Shrewsbury%20Town%20F.C.">Shrewsbury Town</a> manager <a href="Graham%20Turner">Graham Turner</a> was brought in as his successor. Turner was unable to reverse the decline, and in 1986 Villa narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division. A lacklustre start to the following season saw Turner sacked halfway through September. <a href="Billy%20McNeill">Billy McNeill</a> was hired in his place, but was unable to save Villa from relegation. They were relegated to the Second Division just five years after winning the European Cup. McNeill handed in his notice and moved to <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a> when the season ended. Chairman Ellis persuaded <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> manager <a href="Graham%20Taylor%20%28football%20manager%29">Graham Taylor</a> to take over the reins and set about rebuilding the team.

Taylor's first season at Villa ended with automatic promotion as Second Division runners-up, being pipped to the title by <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>. One player who contributed to that season's success was the recently signed <a href="David%20Platt%20%28footballer%29">David Platt</a>, a former Manchester United reserve who had signed from <a href="Crewe%20Alexandra%20F.C.">Crewe Alexandra</a> for £200,000 just after Taylor's arrival. Before he left in 1991, Platt scored 68 goals in his 155 appearances for the club. Villa avoided relegation on the last day of the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89 season</a> as other results favoured them. In the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90 season</a> they emerged as surprise contenders for the title, leading for three weeks in the latter stages of the season before finishing in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Taylor departed for the England manager's job and was succeeded by Slovak coach <a href="Jozef%20Venglo%C5%A1">Jozef Vengloš</a>, the first foreign manager in the First Division.

The <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91 season</a> was Vengloš's only season as manager of Aston Villa. Their second-place finish the previous season earned them qualification for the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> as one of the first English clubs to enter European competition after ban resulting from the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a> was lifted. They beat first round opponents <a href="FC%20Ban%C3%ADk%20Ostrava">Baník Ostrava</a> over two legs, and won the first leg of the second round tie against <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a>. However, this lead was overturned by Inter in the return leg 3–0, and Villa were eliminated. The defeat started a decline, and by the end of the season they were two places above the relegation zone. Vengloš stepped down and David Platt was sold to Italian side <a href="A.S.%20Bari">Bari</a> for £5 million. Aston Villa's new manager was <a href="Ron%20Atkinson">Ron Atkinson</a>, who had taken <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup and had won the League Cup with <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>. In his first season in charge, <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20in%20English%20football">1991–92</a>, Villa finished in sixth place and thus became one of the founder members of the <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a>.

In his first 18 months in charge, Atkinson bought <a href="Earl%20Barrett">Earl Barrett</a>, <a href="Dean%20Saunders">Dean Saunders</a>, <a href="Andy%20Townsend">Andy Townsend</a>, <a href="Dalian%20Atkinson">Dalian Atkinson</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Richardson%20%28footballer%29">Kevin Richardson</a>, <a href="Ray%20Houghton">Ray Houghton</a> and <a href="Shaun%20Teale">Shaun Teale</a>. They all helped the club to finish as runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> season of <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20FA%20Premier%20League">1992–93</a>. The strike partnership of Saunders and Atkinson established itself as one of the most successful partnerships in the Premiership. On 27 March 1994 Villa won the <a href="1994%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> 3–1, to secure a second successive UEFA Cup campaign, although their Premier League form dipped and they finished 10th. At the end of the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94 season</a>, they played their last game at a <a href="terrace%20%28stadium%29">terraced</a> <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a> before it was converted over the summer to an <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater stadium</a> to comply with the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a>. In November 1994, Atkinson was dismissed following a poor start to the season.

Leicester City's manager <a href="Brian%20Little%20%28footballer%29">Brian Little</a> was forbidden to speak to Aston Villa by their board, after rumours began circulating that Ellis wanted to hire him. Although maintaining that he had not spoken to Ellis about the possibility of taking over at Villa, Little resigned from his post at Leicester even though he was contracted to the club until the end of the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98 season</a>. Three days after his resignation, Ellis hired him as the new Villa manager. Little kept Villa in the Premiership, and then reshaped the squad in the 1995 close-season by selling most of the club's older players and buying in several younger ones. Villa won the <a href="1996%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1996 League Cup</a> with a win over <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a>, reached the FA Cup semi-finals and finished fourth in the Premiership in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20in%20English%20football">1995–96 season</a>. In February 1998, with Villa standing 15th in the Premiership and speculation rife that he would be sacked, Little resigned, stating that, "There were certain things going on behind the scenes which were affecting my own managerial position." Ellis came out with a statement directly challenging that it had anything to do with the management at Villa Park. Instead, he suggested it was due to a "variety of pressures" including abuse directed towards Little and his family by irate fans. 

Ellis appointed <a href="John%20Gregory%20%28footballer%29">John Gregory</a>, a former Aston Villa coach, as Little's successor. Gregory revitalised the team and Villa finished seventh in the Premiership and qualified for the UEFA Cup. Usually, only the top six teams qualified for European competition, but due to the progress of other teams in the top seven it was the first time that a seventh placed club had automatically qualified for the UEFA Cup. Despite the £12.6 million sale of <a href="Dwight%20Yorke">Dwight Yorke</a>, a player who had scored 97 goals in 287 appearances for the club, to Manchester United in August 1998, John Gregory had guided Aston Villa to the top of the Premiership by the middle of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">1998–99 season</a>. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 for the first time since 1957, but lost 1–0 to Chelsea in the last final to be played at the <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">old Wembley Stadium</a>. The <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20in%20English%20football">2000–01 season</a> saw Villa finish eighth in the Premiership, although they did eventually qualify for the UEFA Cup by winning the <a href="Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a> in August 2001. In November 2001, Gregory accused Ellis of "living in a time-warp", but was forced to apologise a few days later after provoking an uproar. While Gregory remained in his job, the relationship between him and Ellis was strained. Gregory resigned on 24 January 2002, with Villa occupying a familiar mid-table position in the league.

In January 2002, chairman Doug Ellis once again appointed Graham Taylor as manager. Villa finished the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">2001–02 season</a> in eighth place, which was similar to most of their other Premiership finishes. Taylor quit as manager for the second time after the end of the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03 season</a>. Villa had just finished 16th in the Premiership, losing twice to arch rivals <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a>. <a href="David%20O%27Leary">David O'Leary</a>, who had taken Leeds United to the semi-finals of the 2000–01 Champions League, was brought in as Taylor's replacement. O'Leary took the team to sixth in the table, with a 2–0 home defeat against Manchester United on the final day meaning that they narrowly missed out on a UEFA Cup place. In <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a>, Villa slowly fell down the table and finished in 16th place. The poor placing came despite O'Leary having spent more than £13 million the previous summer on players such as <a href="Milan%20Baro%C5%A1">Milan Baroš</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Phillips%20%28footballer%29">Kevin Phillips</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20Bouma">Wilfred Bouma</a>.

Frustration within the club soon reared its head when, on 14 July 2006, a group of Villa players criticised the chairman's alleged parsimony and lack of ambition in an interview with a local newspaper. The club immediately dismissed the report as "ridiculous", but it emerged over the following few days that a group of senior players had indeed instigated the move, possibly with O'Leary's backing. The following week, O'Leary left the club by mutual consent after three years as Aston Villa manager and his assistant <a href="Roy%20Aitken">Roy Aitken</a> became <a href="caretaker%20manager">caretaker manager</a>.

At a press conference on 4 August 2006, Doug Ellis introduced <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a> as the new manager and O'Neill said, 

After several years of speculation and failed bids, the 23-year reign of Doug Ellis as chairman came to an end. Ellis, the largest shareholder with approximately 38%, decided to sell his stake. For many years supporters groups had been urging Ellis to resign, though the actions including two "Ellis out" protests, and an "Ellis out" march marked an increase in intensity. The decision to leave the club was likely to have been prompted by Ellis' ill-health. <a href="Randy%20Lerner">Randy Lerner</a>, the owner of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">NFL</a> franchise <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, was announced as the preferred bidder. On 25 August, it was announced that he had secured 59.69% of the club's shares. By 26 September 2006, Lerner had achieved a 90% shareholding, and could complete his buy-out of the rest of the shares. Lerner appointed several new people to the Board including General <a href="Charles%20C%20Krulak">Charles C Krulak</a>. Ellis was given a <a href="Emeritus">President Emeritus</a> (Life President) role.

Aston Villa started the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20FA%20Premier%20League">2006–07 Premiership campaign</a> well, with <a href="Olof%20Mellberg">Olof Mellberg</a> scoring the first competitive goal at <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a>'s new <a href="Emirates%20Stadium">Emirates Stadium</a>. The January signings of <a href="John%20Carew">John Carew</a>, <a href="Ashley%20Young">Ashley Young</a> and <a href="Shaun%20Maloney">Shaun Maloney</a> bolstered the squad. Villa finished in 11th place in the league with 50 points, ending the season with an unbeaten run of nine league games. The last home game of the season, a 3–0 victory over <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a>, was used to mark the 25th anniversary of Villa winning the European Cup in 1982. Before kick-off, the 1982 winning team paraded the trophy in front of a full stadium. Scarves bearing the words "Proud History—Bright Future" were given out to all home team supporters attending the match.
<a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">2007–08</a> saw Villa progress further, finishing sixth to qualify for the <a href="Intertoto%20Cup">Intertoto Cup</a>. A victory against Danish side <a href="Odense%20BK">Odense BK</a> over two legs in the final, during the summer of 2008, put Villa into <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">European competition</a> for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">2008–09 season</a>, the first time in seven years. They reached the group stage of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup that season</a> with relative ease, and played their first match against Dutch club <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> at Villa Park, winning 2–1. The first major final of the Lerner era was the <a href="2010%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">2010 Football League Cup Final</a>; Villa lost 2–1 to Manchester United at Wembley Stadium. Five days before the opening day of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">2010–11 season</a>, O'Neill resigned as manager with immediate effect. The reserve team coach, <a href="Kevin%20MacDonald%20%28footballer%29">Kevin MacDonald</a>, took over as caretaker manager for the opening games of the season. Randy Lerner returned to England from the United States to interview potential candidates for the post. On 8 September 2010, the club announced that <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a> would become the manager of Aston Villa, the first managerial appointment of Lerner's reign. On 20 April 2011, Houllier was admitted to hospital suffering from chest pains. Further tests showed that Houllier had suffered from a recurrence of a heart problem. The last games of the season saw Houllier's assistant, <a href="Gary%20McAllister">Gary McAllister</a>, take over in a caretaker capacity. On 1 June 2011, the club issued a statement that Houllier had left the club by mutual consent leaving the club looking for their fifth manager, including caretakers, of the year. Houllier was replaced by the former Birmingham City manager <a href="Alex%20McLeish">Alex McLeish</a> on 17 June 2011, despite numerous protests from fans against his appointment. McLeish's appointment marked the first time in history that a manager had moved directly from Birmingham to Villa.

McLeish's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011–12 season after Villa finished in 16th place, only just above the relegation zone. On 2 July 2012, Aston Villa confirmed the appointment of former <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> manager <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a> as the replacement for McLeish. On 28 February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of £53.9 million. Lerner put the club up for sale on 12 May 2014, with an estimated value of £200 million. With Lerner still on board, in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Aston%20Villa%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a> Aston Villa scored just 12 goals in 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history, and Lambert was sacked on 11 February 2015. He was replaced by <a href="Tim%20Sherwood">Tim Sherwood</a>, who saved Villa from relegation in the 2014–15 season and took them to the <a href="2015%20FA%20Cup%20Final">2015 FA Cup Final</a>.

Despite saving them from relegation the previous season, Sherwood was sacked as manager on 15 October 2015, after six consecutive league losses, with Kevin MacDonald taking the role of interim manager. On 2 November 2015, Frenchman <a href="R%C3%A9mi%20Garde">Rémi Garde</a> agreed a three-and-a-half year deal to become the manager, but he left on 29 March 2016 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table. The club was eventually relegated from the Premier League on 16 April following a 1–0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford.

In June 2016, Chinese businessman <a href="Tony%20Xia">Tony Xia</a> bought the club for £76 million. <a href="Roberto%20Di%20Matteo">Roberto Di Matteo</a> was appointed as the club's new manager before the new season in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a>, and was sacked after 12 games with the club in 19th place and having only won one match against <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham</a>; he was replaced by former Birmingham City manager <a href="Steve%20Bruce">Steve Bruce</a>, however Bruce could only lead the club to 13th in the table that season.
In the 2017/18 season Bruce led Villa to a 4th place after their best winning sequence since 1990, including winning seven games in a row. Having qualified for the play-offs and beaten Middlesbrough in the semi-final they ultimately lost 1–0 to Fulham in the <a href="2018%20EFL%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2018 EFL Championship play-off Final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. Following the play-off final loss financial problems began to emerge with Tony Xia struggling to move money out of China to maintain basic football operations.

In July 2018 Aston Villa were taken over by Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens with a 55% controlling stake who promised significant investment and restructuring of the club. In October 2018 they sacked Bruce with Villa sitting 12th in the table after 11 games. They appointed boyhood Villa fan <a href="Dean%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201971%29">Dean Smith</a>.

Rhodes blood libel

The Rhodes blood libel was an 1840 event of <a href="blood%20libel%20against%20Jews">blood libel against Jews</a>, in which the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> community accused <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s on the island of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> (then part of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>) of the <a href="ritual%20murder">ritual murder</a> of a <a href="Christians">Christian</a> boy who disappeared in February of that year.

Initially the libel garnered support from the <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">consuls</a> of several <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an countries, including the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="July%20Monarchy">France</a>, the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>, although later several supported the Jewish community. The <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> governor of Rhodes broke with the long tradition of the Ottoman governments (which had previously denied the factual basis of the <a href="blood%20libel">blood libel</a> accusations) and supported the ritual murder charge. The government arrested several Jewish subjects, some of whom were tortured and confessed. It blockaded the entire Jewish quarter for twelve days.

The Jewish community of Rhodes appealed for help from the Jewish community in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, who forwarded the appeal to European governments. In the United Kingdom and Austria, Jewish communities gained support from their governments. They sent official dispatches to the <a href="ambassador">ambassador</a>s in Constantinople unequivocally condemning the blood libel. A consensus developed that the charge was false. The governor of Rhodes sent the case to the central government, which initiated a formal inquiry into the affair. In July 1840, that investigation established the innocence of the Jewish community. Finally, in November of the same year, the Ottoman <a href="sultan">sultan</a> issued a decree ("<a href="firman%20%28decree%29">firman</a>") denouncing the blood libel as false.

The existence of a Jewish community in Rhodes was first documented toward the end of the <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> period. In a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> decree dated to 142 BC, Rhodes is listed among the areas notified of the renewal of the pact of friendship between the Roman senate and the Jewish nation. The Jews of Rhodes are mentioned in documents at the time of the <a href="Arab">Arab</a> conquest of the island in the 7th century. In the 12th century, <a href="Benjamin%20of%20Tudela">Benjamin of Tudela</a> found some 400 Jews in the city of Rhodes.

In <a href="1481%20Rhodes%20earthquake">1481 and 1482</a>, earthquakes destroyed the Jewish quarter, so that only 22 families remained in the city. After an epidemic of <a href="Bubonic%20plague">plague</a> in 1498–1500, the <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Knights Hospitaller</a>, who ruled the island at that time, expelled those of the remaining Jews who would not be <a href="baptism">baptized</a>. In the next two decades, the Hospitallers brought to the island between 2,000 and 3,000 captured Jews who were kept as slaves to work on fortifications.

In 1522, these Jews and their descendants helped the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottomans</a> seize Rhodes. Under the Ottoman rule, Rhodes became an important <a href="Sephardi">Sephardi</a> center, home to many famous <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>s. By the 19th century, the wealthier Jews were merchants in cloth, silk, sulfur, and resins. The rest were small shopkeepers and artisans, street vendors, and fishermen. The community was governed by a council of seven officials. Sources give the number of Jews during the 19th century between 2,000 and 4,000.

The <a href="blood%20libel%20against%20Jews">blood libel against Jews</a> originated in <a href="England">England</a> in 1144 with the case of <a href="William%20of%20Norwich">William of Norwich</a>. The accusation that Jews used the blood of Christian children to prepare "<a href="matzo">matzo</a>s" for the <a href="Passover">Passover</a> became a staple of Christian <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, with the total number of recorded ritual murder accusations reaching 150. With the strengthening of standards of evidence in legal cases, the number of charges began to decline, and few blood libel cases reached European courts after 1772. Nevertheless, some instances of ritual murder accusation arose as late as the 19th century.

In the Middle East, the blood libel was deeply ingrained in the consciousness of local Christian communities. Accusations of blood libel were commonplace in the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. After the Ottomans conquered the Byzantine lands, <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> communities were usually the source of ritual murder charges against Jews, often at times of social and economic tensions. The first appearance of the blood libel under Ottoman rule took place in the reign of <a href="Mehmet%20II">Mehmet II</a>. Subsequently, accusations of ritual murder were only sporadic and Ottoman authorities usually condemned them. In the 16th century, Sultan <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> issued a "firman", formally denouncing blood libel charges against the Jews.

With the increase of Christian influence in the Ottoman Empire, the standing of the Jews declined. The <a href="sultan">sultan</a>'s <a href="Hatt-i%20Sharif%20of%20Gulhane">Hatt-i Sharif of Gulhane</a>, proclaimed in 1839, ushered in an era of liberal reforms known as <a href="Tanzimat">Tanzimat</a>. This period further enhanced the status of the Christians and eroded the power of authorities to protect the Jews. Before 1840, cases of blood libel occurred in <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> in 1810 and in <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> in 1826.

In 1840, contemporaneous with the affair in Rhodes, a more famous case of blood libel, known as the <a href="Damascus%20affair">Damascus affair</a>, was developing in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, while the city was under the short-lived control of <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali of Egypt</a>. On February 5, <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin">Capuchin</a> <a href="friar">friar</a> Thomas and his servant Ibrahim Amara went missing, and the Jews of Damascus were accused of murdering them to collect their blood for <a href="Passover">Passover</a> <a href="matzo">matzo</a>s. The local Christian community, the governor, and the French consul, who received full support from Paris, actively pursued the ritual murder charge. The accused Jews were tortured, and some of them confessed to having killed Father Thomas and his servant. Their testimonies were used by the accusers as the irrefutable proof of guilt. The case drew international attention, arousing active protests from the European Jewish diaspora.

On February 17, 1840, a boy from a <a href="Greek%20Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> family in Rhodes went for a walk and did not return. The next day his mother reported the disappearance to the Ottoman authorities. The island's governor, <a href="Yusuf%20Pasha">Yusuf Pasha</a>, ordered a search, but several days' efforts proved fruitless. The European consuls pressed the governor to solve the case: the boy's family was Christian, though without foreign protection. The Greek Christian population of Rhodes, meanwhile, had no doubts that the boy had been murdered by the Jews for ritual purposes. An eyewitness reported: "It was firmly believed that the child in question was doomed to be sacrificed by the Jews. The whole island was agitated from one end to the other." The assurance of the local Christians having been impressed upon the Ottoman authorities, they began searching the Jewish quarter, again in vain.

Several days later, two Greek women reported having seen the boy walking towards the city of Rhodes accompanied by four Jews. The women claimed that one of the Jews was Eliakim Stamboli, who was arrested, questioned, and subjected to five hundred blows of the "<a href="bastinado">bastinado</a>". On February 23, he was interrogated again and tortured in the presence of many dignitaries, including the governor, the <a href="qadi">qadi</a> (<a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> judge), the Greek <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a>, and European consuls. Jews of Rhodes reported that Stamboli was "loaded with chains, many stripes were inflicted upon him and red-hot wires were run through his nose, burning bones were applied to his head and a very heavy stone was laid upon his breast, insomuch as he was reduced to the point of death." Under torture, Stamboli confessed to the ritual murder charge and incriminated other Jews, opening the door to further arrests. Some half dozen Jews were accused of the crime and tortured, and the chief <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a> was intensely questioned as to whether Jews practice ritual murder.

At the instigation of the Greek clergy and the European consuls, the governor Yusuf Pasha blockaded the Jewish quarter on the eve of <a href="Purim">Purim</a> and arrested Jacob Israel the chief rabbi. The inhabitants could obtain neither food nor fresh water. The Jews thwarted a subversive attempt to smuggle a dead body into the Jewish quarter. The Muslim authorities, on the whole, were not keen to pursue the ritual murder accusation against the Jews. The Muslim official in charge of the blockade was found smuggling bread to the imprisoned residents; at the insistence of the British consul, he was <a href="bastinado">bastinado</a>ed and dismissed from service. The <a href="qadi">qadi</a> openly sympathized with the Jews. At the end of February, he initiated further hearings on the case, after which evidence was declared insufficient to convict the prisoners. The governor, on the other hand, refused to lift the blockade of the Jewish quarter, though he seemed to waver somewhat. In early March he sent to Constantinople asking for instructions. Only after the blockade had lasted for twelve days was the governor forced to lift it by a high treasury official who visited the island on a tour of inspection. At that point, the Jews thought that the affair was over and "returned thanks to the Almighty for their deliverance".

The relief, however, was dashed in early March by news of the <a href="Damascus%20affair">Damascus affair</a>. Reports that the Jews of Damascus had confessed to having murdered Father Thomas reinforced the belief of the Christian community in the ritual murder charge. The British consul reported that "the Greeks cried loud that justice had not been rendered to them and that the rabbi and chiefs ought to have been imprisoned… In order to keep the populace quiet… it was decided that these should be arrested." Eight Jews were arrested, including the chief rabbi and David Mizrahi, who were tortured by being suspended swinging from hooks in the ceiling in the presence of the European consuls. Mizrahi lost consciousness after six hours, while the rabbi was kept there for two days until he suffered a hemorrhage. Nevertheless, neither confessed and they were released after a few days. The other six Jews remained in prison in early April.

The European vice-consuls in Rhodes were united in believing the ritual murder charge. They played the key role in the interrogation, with J. G. Wilkinson, the British consul, and E. Masse from Sweden being involved. During the interrogation of the chief rabbi, Wilkinson asked, referring to the qadi's decision to dismiss the case: "What signifies the Mollah's judgment to us after what happened in Damascus and it is proved that, according to the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, Christian blood must be used in making your <a href="Passover">Passover</a> bread?" The consuls were also present during much of the torture. When the chief rabbi, an Austrian subject, was tortured, he appealed to Austrian vice-consul Anton Giuliani, who replied: "What rabbi? What do you complain about? So you are not dead yet."

Some Jewish inhabitants of Rhodes accused the consuls of a conspiracy to exploit the case in order to eliminate Elias Kalimati, a local Jew, who represented the business interests of Joel Davis, a Jewish businessman from <a href="London">London</a>. Davis was rapidly increasing his share in the profitable sponge exports from the island, and he was a major business rival of the European consuls. Elias Kalimati, however, was not among the persons held in the affair, calling that allegation into question. Other Jewish sources claimed that "[t]he consuls stated openly… their purpose of exterminating the Jews of Rhodes or to compel them to change their religion."

In the first days of the blockade, someone managed to smuggle a letter out of the Jewish quarter to the Jewish leadership in Constantinople. It was not until March 27 that the leaders of the Jewish community in the Ottoman capital forwarded it to the <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild family</a>, together with a similar call for help from the Jews of Damascus. To these documents, the Jewish leaders attached their own statement in which they cast doubt on their ability to influence the sultan.

The intervention of the Rothschilds bore the quickest fruit in Austria. The head of the Rothschild family bank in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Salomon%20Mayer%20von%20Rothschild">Salomon Mayer von Rothschild</a>, played the key role in raising financing for the Austrian Empire, and he had a very close relationship with the Austrian <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a> <a href="Klemens%20Wenzel%20von%20Metternich">von Metternich</a>. On April 10, Metternich dispatched instruction regarding both the Damascus and Rhodes affairs to <a href="Bartholom%C3%A4us%20von%20St%C3%BCrmer">Bartholomäus von Stürmer</a>, ambassador in Constantinople, and <a href="Anton%20von%20Laurin">Anton von Laurin</a>, consul in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. In his dispatch, Metternich wrote: "The accusation that Christians are deliberately murdered for some blood-thirsty Passover festival is by its nature absurd…" Regarding the Rhodes case, the chancellor instructed von Stürmer "to tip the wink to the Turkish regime, so that they instruct pasha of Rhodes accordingly and that you let [our] vice-consul in Rhodes know that in such cases he should work in the spirit of sensible mediation." Von Stürmer, responded, "[T]here have been no persecutions against the Jewish population, at least not by the authorities."

In the UK, it took the Jewish community longer to react to the calls for help from Rhodes and Damascus. The Board of Deputies of the British Jews convened on April 21 to discuss the blood libels. They resolved to request the British, Austrian, and French governments to intercede with the Ottoman government and stop the persecutions. The resolution condemning the ritual murder charges was published as a paid advertisement in 35 British journals; it appeared twice in the most important newspapers. On April 30, a delegation elected by the Board met with the foreign secretary <a href="Henry%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, who called the blood libel a "calumny" and promised that "the influence of the British government should be exerted to put a stop to [the] atrocities." In his dispatch of May 5, the foreign secretary told <a href="John%20Ponsonby%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Ponsonby%20of%20Imokilly">Lord Ponsonby</a>, the British ambassador in Constantinople, to communicate the material on the Rhodes affair to the Ottoman government "officially and in writing" and to "request… an immediate and strict inquiry to be made… especially into the allegation that these atrocities were committed at the instigation of the Christians and the European consuls."

A consensus formed within the European diplomatic community in Constantinople that the persecution of the accused Jews had to be stopped. This opinion was held not only by Lord Ponsonby, but also by von Stürmer, whose correspondence revealed that he was not at all convinced of the innocence of the Jews; by the French ambassador Edouard Pontois, whose government stood by the French consuls who supported blood libels in Rhodes and Damascus; and by the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n ambassador Hans von Königsmark. Consequently, the way was open for Lord Ponsonby, by far the most powerful diplomat in Constantinople, to intervene unopposed on behalf the Jews of Rhodes.

In response to Yusuf Pasha's request, the Ottoman government sent its instructions to Rhodes, where they arrived at the end of April. The government would set up an official investigatory commission before which representatives of the Jewish and Greek communities were ordered to present their evidence. In mid-May, the government sent orders to release the six remaining Jewish prisoners. On May 21, they were ceremoniously called before the court ("<a href="shura">shura</a>") and freed under the guarantees of the elders of the Jewish community.

The Christians responded to these actions of the central government with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air. The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks, and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews. When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the <a href="bastinado">bastinado</a>. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.

The Greek and Jewish delegations from Rhodes, each numbering five, arrived at Constantinople on May 10. In the capital they were joined by the qadi, the French consul, and the Austrian vice-consul. On May 26, the investigatory tribunal held its first open session chaired by <a href="Rifaat%20Bey">Rifaat Bey</a>. The qadi argued that "the entire affair is the product of hatred; [and] was instigated by the English and Austrian consuls alone." The consuls insisted on the guilt of the Jews, and they presented a concurring written testimony from their colleagues who stayed on Rhodes.

The case dragged on for two more months, as the British ambassador insisted on bringing to light the facts implicating the Rhodes governor of torture. Finally, on July 21 the verdict was announced. In its first part, the case between "the Greek population of Rhodes, the plaintiff, and the Jewish population, defendant", the result was acquittal. In its second part, Yusuf Pasha was dismissed from his post as governor of Rhodes because "he had permitted procedures to be employed against the Jews which are not authorized in any way by the law and which are expressly forbidden by the <a href="Hatt-i%20Sharif">Hatt-i Sharif</a> of 3 November". The British ambassador praised the investigation as one during which "[t]he affair of Rhodes was examined with fairness" and called the verdict "a signal proof of the justice and humanity with which the <a href="Sublime%20Porte">Sublime Porte</a> acts."

In July 1840, a delegation headed by <a href="Adolphe%20Cr%C3%A9mieux">Adolphe Crémieux</a> and Sir <a href="Moses%20Montefiore">Moses Montefiore</a> left for Egypt to save the Jews of Damascus. Crémieux and Montefiore requested Muhammad Ali to transfer the investigation to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> or have the case considered by European judges. However, their request was denied. The delegation, concerned primarily with the release of the imprisoned Jews of Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that it was an act of justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.

After completing his mission to Muhammad Ali, Montefiore was returning to Europe by way of Constantinople. On October 15, 1840, in the Ottoman capital he had a meeting with Lord Ponsonby, to whom Montefiore suggested that following the precedent set by Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan should issue a decree ("firman") formally denouncing the blood libel and effectively sealing the cases both in Rhodes and in Damascus. The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea, and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with <a href="Koca%20Mustafa%20Re%C5%9Fid%20Pasha">Reshid Pasha</a>. Montefiore prepared a draft text of the "firman" and had its French translation read to Reshid Pasha, who responded encouragingly.

Montefiore's audience with the sultan took place at the palace late in the evening on October 28. Montefiore described in his diary that as he and his party were driving to the palace, "[t]he streets were crowded; many of the Jews had illuminated their houses." During the audience, Montefiore read aloud a formal address in which he thanked the sultan for his stand in the Rhodes case. In turn, the sultan assured his guests that their request would be granted. The "firman" was delivered to Montefiore on November 7, and a copy was subsequently provided to the <a href="Hakham%20Bashi">Hakham Bashi</a>. Citing the judgment in the Rhodes case, the decree stated that a careful examination of Jewish beliefs and "religious books" had demonstrated that "the charges brought against them… are pure calumny. The Jewish nation shall possess the same privileges as are granted to the numerous other nations who submit to our authority. The Jewish nation shall be protected and defended."

George Went Hensley (May 2, 1881 – July 25, 1955) was an American <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> minister best known for popularizing the practice of <a href="snake%20handling">snake handling</a>. A native of rural <a href="Appalachia">Appalachia</a>, Hensley experienced a religious conversion around 1910: on the basis of his interpretation of scripture, he came to believe that the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> commanded all Christians to handle venomous snakes.

Hensley was part of a large family that had moved between <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, before settling in Tennessee shortly after his birth. Following his conversion, he traveled through the <a href="Southeastern%20United%20States">Southeastern United States</a>, teaching a form of Pentecostalism that emphasized strict personal holiness and frequent contact with venomous snakes. Although illiterate, he became a licensed minister of the <a href="Church%20of%20God%20%28Cleveland%2C%20Tennessee%29">Church of God</a> (<a href="Cleveland%2C%20Tennessee">Cleveland, Tennessee</a>) in 1915. After traveling through Tennessee for several years conducting Church of God-sanctioned services, he resigned from the denomination in 1922. Hensley was married four times and fathered thirteen children. He had many conflicts with his family members because of his drunkenness, frequent travels, and inability to earn steady income, factors cited by his first three wives as reasons for their divorces.

Hensley was arrested in Tennessee on <a href="moonshine">moonshine</a>-related charges during the <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley traveled to <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, where he held <a href="Revival%20meeting">revival services</a>, though he and his family rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known as the <a href="Church%20of%20God%20with%20Signs%20Following">Church of God with Signs Following</a>, in Tennessee and <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have been bitten by many snakes without ill effect, and toward the end of his career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400 bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill. He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.

Hensley told his children he was from <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> and that his family's roots were in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. In reality, his family lived in <a href="Hawkins%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Hawkins County, Tennessee</a>, in 1880, the year historian David Kimbrough argues Hensley was born. One of 13 children, Hensley lived in Tennessee in Hawkins County and <a href="Loudon%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Loudon County</a> in the 1880s. His family lived in <a href="Big%20Stone%20Gap%2C%20Virginia">Big Stone Gap, Virginia</a>, in the 1890s, and there he witnessed an elderly woman handle a snake during a revival service at a <a href="coal%20mining">coal mining</a> camp. His mother and sisters were very religious, and he was reared a <a href="Baptists">Baptist</a>.

Hensley left the Baptist church in 1901, the year he married Amanda Winniger. The couple moved to her brother's farm in <a href="Ooltewah%2C%20Tennessee">Ooltewah</a>, where they lived in a shack. Hensley worked in local <a href="ore">ore</a> mines, helped in his brother-in-law's lumber business, and was involved in making <a href="moonshine">moonshine</a>, a common practice in the region. Hensley experienced a <a href="Religious%20conversion">conversion</a> while attending a <a href="Church%20of%20God%20%28Cleveland%2C%20Tennessee%29">Holiness Pentecostal Church of God</a> service in Ooltewah, led by an evangelist's teenage son. He forsook alcohol, tobacco, and friendships with those he deemed "worldly".

Hensley was initially content following his experience at the Church of God, but he began to question whether he was living a sufficiently righteous life. He became fixated on a passage in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> (<a href="Mark%2016">Mark 16</a>:17–18, <a href="King%20James%20Version">KJV</a>): "And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name ... They shall take up serpents", which suggests that Christians might take up "serpents" without injury. Psychologists <a href="Ralph%20W.%20Hood">Ralph W. Hood</a> and W. Paul Williamson, as well as one of Hensley's children, have proposed that his preoccupation with this verse arose from a childhood memory of witnessing <a href="snake%20handling">snake handling</a> in Virginia. Hensley later recalled that he began to doubt his salvation and withdrew to a nearby hill to pray and seek God's will. In a 1947 newspaper interview, he claimed to have seen a snake while walking on the hill. He said that he knelt in prayer, took hold of it, then brought it to his church and told the congregation to also prove their salvation by holding the snake.

Hensley's first experience with snake handling occurred between 1908 and 1914, after which he held snake-handling services in parts of rural Tennessee. His supporters later asserted that a <a href="Christian%20revival">revival</a> broke out at the start of his ministry, a claim considered dubious by historians. At first, the Church of God did not object to his snake-handling services, and, in 1914, he held a snake-handling meeting with a Church of God bishop in Cleveland, Tennessee. The next year, Hensley applied to be licensed as a Church of God minister, but required his wife's assistance to complete the paperwork owing to his illiteracy. He had memorized some Bible verses but also stated that he received divine <a href="revelation">revelation</a> while speaking. After being licensed, Hensley held Church of God services throughout Tennessee, including revival services at church general assemblies. He preached about the <a href="Baptism%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit">Baptism of the Holy Spirit</a>, a Pentecostal teaching that referred to an additional spiritual experience after conversion. His ministry was often mentioned in Church of God newsletters, and his wife Amanda contributed an article about him. In the 1910s, Hensley is thought to have led churches in <a href="Grasshopper%20Valley">Grasshopper Valley</a> (northwest of <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Tennessee">Cleveland, Tennessee</a>), Cleveland, and <a href="Birchwood%2C%20Tennessee">Birchwood, Tennessee</a>.

Hensley was short, normally soft-spoken, and friendly with churchgoers. Most attendees at his services were miners or farmers from the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>. Congregants typically arrived at services on horseback or in a <a href="Ford%20Model%20A%20%281927%E2%80%9331%29">Model A Ford</a>. Many were from Holiness Pentecostal backgrounds, but unfamiliar with the snake-handling practice. Hensley's sister Bertha, who lived in Ohio, was also a licensed minister with the Church of God. In 1922, he conducted services with her in Ohio. Around that time, more articles documenting his ministry were published in the denomination's newsletter, and by the early 1920s snakes were regularly handled in Church of God services.

In 1922, Hensley resigned from the Church of God, citing "trouble in the home". His resignation marked the zenith of the practice of snake handling in the denomination. He separated from Amanda around this time, possibly owing to his temper or drunkenness. Arrested on moonshine-related charges in 1923, he was sentenced to four months in jail and fined $100. (This occurred during the <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition Era</a>, when alcohol production and consumption were illegal in the U.S.) In lieu of jail time, he was permitted to serve the sentence at the <a href="Silverdale%20Detention%20Center">Silverdale workhouse</a>. He was initially placed on a <a href="chain%20gang">chain gang</a> constructing roads, but the guards found him likable and gave him other assignments. After being sent to a nearby well for water, Hensley fled and evaded recapture, possibly by hiding in the mountains near his sister's farm in Ooltewah. While a fugitive, he may have been arrested and released on unrelated charges. He ultimately fled Tennessee to his sister's house in Ohio.

After arriving in Ohio, Hensley returned to his personal ministry and held services in the area. Because he was illiterate, Bertha would read passages from the Bible during services, after which Hensley would deliver a sermon on a theme drawn from the verses. He also frequently preached on the topic of <a href="faith%20healing">faith healing</a> during this period. He remained in Ohio for several years, divorcing Amanda in 1926.

While ministering at a <a href="Salvation%20Army">Salvation Army</a> church in Ohio in 1926, Hensley met Irene Klunzinger. He married her in 1927, although he was about 25 years her senior. After the wedding, they moved to <a href="Washingtonville%2C%20Ohio">Washingtonville, Ohio</a>, near one of Hensley's brothers. There Hensley found employment at a coal mine and Irene gave birth to their first child. They later moved to nearby <a href="Malvern%2C%20Ohio">Malvern, Ohio</a>, where she bore their second child.

In 1932, Hensley and his family moved to <a href="Pineville%2C%20Kentucky">Pineville, Kentucky</a>, after a religious layman, who had seen Hensley handle snakes in Chattanooga, entreated him to come to the area. He returned to ministry and built the Pineville Church of God. Hensley established the church himself and characterized it as a "free Pentecostal" church. He continued to move frequently, a practice which Thomas Burton of <a href="East%20Tennessee%20State%20University">East Tennessee State University</a> attributes to "wanderlust". In July 1935, Irene gave birth to a child in <a href="Pennington%20Gap%2C%20Virginia">Pennington Gap, Virginia</a>, and a month later, they were living in <a href="St.%20Charles%2C%20Virginia">St. Charles, Virginia</a>, while Hensley performed snake-handling services in the area. He successfully drew crowds to his preaching. In <a href="Norton%2C%20Virginia">Norton, Virginia</a>, 500 people attended an event, although that service was thrown into disarray after a boy in the audience killed one of the snakes. In 1936, Hensley built a house on the back of a trailer truck and drove to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to hold revival services. By March 1936, he had reached <a href="Tampa">Tampa</a>, Florida, where he drew over 100 people to a snake-handling service. He traveled to <a href="Bartow%2C%20Florida">Bartow, Florida</a>, where over 700 people attended one of his tent meetings. He subsequently ministered in <a href="Bloomingdale%2C%20Florida">Bloomingdale, Florida</a>, before traveling north to <a href="Barrow%20County%2C%20Georgia">Barrow County, Georgia</a>, in late April. During a service in Barrow, a young agricultural worker was bitten by a snake and became ill. Hensley spoke to reporters and claimed that the man was bitten because he was "not quite ready for the demonstrations of the power". He predicted that the young man would miraculously recover, but the man died. This was the first death by snakebite to occur at one of Hensley's services. He conducted the man's funeral and left the area for fear of prosecution. His conduct was condemned by a local newspaper.

Hensley traveled to Ohio to bring one of his sons to live with a sister of Irene while attending school. Hensley then returned to Pineville, where he worked as a railroad conductor and pastored the East Pineville Church of God. He was arrested for handling snakes and moved to <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>, in 1939. He subsequently bought a farm near Knoxville.

Hensley lived in Tennessee until at least late 1941. He then moved to <a href="Evansville%2C%20Indiana">Evansville, Indiana</a>, after separating from Irene. After a brief stay in Pineville, Hensley returned to Ooltewah in 1943. There he stayed with family members and held religious services. Snake handling had lost popularity since the late 1920s and groups that promoted <a href="nontrinitarianism">nontrinitarianism</a> had become popular. Various churches in the area barred those who practiced snake handling from membership.

In 1943, Raymond Hayes, a young adherent of Hensley's teachings, arrived in the Ooltewah area and began successfully preaching about snake handling. Hensley and Hayes started a church together in 1945, which they named the "Dolly Pond Church of God with Signs Following". Later in 1945, a member of the church was bitten by a snake and died. The members of the church continued to handle snakes at services, including at the funeral of the man who died from snakebite. The man's death was viewed as ordained by God to test the faith of the congregants, and to demonstrate to non-believers that the snakes they handled were, in fact, dangerous. That year, Hensley was arrested for snake handling in <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>. He was given a $50 fine, which he refused to pay even when threatened with a workhouse sentence. He was released after members of his church appealed to authorities.

Hensley continued to travel around Tennessee, receiving a mixed reception from those who were aware of his past. Some who knew him were willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role, but he remained estranged from most of his family. His son Roscoe saw him preach in 1944. The younger Hensley was also a pastor by then, but had never seen his father conduct a service.

In 1946, Hensley married for the third time, but his wife, Inez Hutcheson, left him after less than a year of marriage. After their separation, Hensley began to preach in Chattanooga. During services, he began asserting that he had been miraculously healed after being paralyzed for a year following a coal-mining accident. Kimbrough disputes his claim, noting that there is no one-year gap in the records of Hensley moving or actively ministering. Hensley continued to live in Chattanooga until the early 1950s; he moved to <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens, Georgia</a>, in the early to mid-1950s.

Hensley was the father of eight children with his first wife, Amanda. They separated in 1922. One of their children claimed that the separation occurred after an incident in which Hensley became drunk and fought a neighbor. Amanda left the area and found work in a Chattanooga hosiery mill, but soon became ill and bedridden. Hensley's sister and brother-in-law traveled to Chattanooga to care for her.

Hensley had five children with his second wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately felt that he was unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although later she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for a <a href="Goitre">goiter</a>. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.

Hensley met Inez Hutcheson, a widow with ten children, in 1946 while performing a service in <a href="Soddy-Daisy%2C%20Tennessee">Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee</a>. After Hensley spoke with her, she accepted the doctrine of snake handling. He soon proposed marriage, which she accepted. They lived in the Soddy-Daisy area for several months. Although he had hoped that she would travel with him and read Bible passages during his services, she left him after less than a year of marriage, and their union was soon dissolved. In 1951, Hensley married Sally Norman in Chattanooga. After their wedding, she traveled with him as he ministered in Tennessee and Kentucky.

In early July 1955, Hensley began a series of meetings near <a href="Altha%2C%20Florida">Altha, Florida</a>. He conducted the meetings without snakes for three weeks, before procuring a snake and bringing it to a Sunday afternoon service on July 24. Several dozen people gathered at an abandoned blacksmith shop for the observance. During the service, Hensley loudly delivered a sermon on the topic of faith. He removed the snake from the lard can in which it was stored, wrapped it around his neck, and rubbed it on his face. He walked around the audience while preaching and then returned the snake to the can. As he placed the snake into the can, it bit him on his wrist. After a few minutes, Hensley became visibly ill, experiencing severe pain, a discolored arm, and <a href="hematemesis">hematemesis</a>. He refused medical attention, although he remained in pain and was urged to seek treatment both by congregants and the <a href="Calhoun%20County%2C%20Florida">Calhoun County</a> Sheriff. One eyewitness claimed that Hensley attributed his suffering to the congregation's lack of faith, although his wife Sally stated that she believed it was the will of God. Hensley died early the next morning. Calhoun County Judge Hannah Gaskin ruled his death a suicide.

Hensley's relatives traveled from Tennessee to Florida for his funeral, at which a <a href="country%20music">country music</a> band played. He was buried two days after his death at a cemetery from the blacksmith shop where he was bitten. After the funeral, some of the congregants met and declared their intention to continue handling snakes. Sally resolved to continue spreading her late husband's teachings, saying after the incident that she had not lost "an ounce of faith".

Hensley's theology, with the exception of his snake handling, was typical of other fundamentalist Pentecostal churches. His teachings on personal holiness bore a resemblance to doctrines of the <a href="Wesleyanism">Wesleyan Holiness</a> tradition. In his sermons he condemned a number of practices as sinful, including gambling, consuming alcohol, wearing lipstick, and playing baseball.

The 17th and 18th verses in chapter 16 of the Gospel of Mark, the , formed the core of Hensley's justification of snake handling and other <a href="Gift%20of%20miracles">miraculous activities</a> (he also drank poison in some services, including <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a> and <a href="battery%20acid">battery acid</a>). He interpreted the passage as a command, rather than an observation of events that occurred in the lives of some <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">Apostles</a>, as Christians have traditionally interpreted the verses. By handling snakes, he saw himself as part of a continuing tradition that originated in a New Testament injunction. He upheld the ability to handle venomous snakes without harm as proof of salvation and evidence of steadfast faith, linking the practice to <a href="Glossolalia">speaking in tongues</a>. To him, snake handling was a modern-day confirmation of God's power to supernaturally deliver people from harm. He often cast snakes as a representation of the <a href="Devil">Devil</a> and interpreted the legal difficulties he encountered as religious persecution. He labeled those who rejected the observance of snake handling "unbelievers".

Many writers have attempted to designate one person, often Hensley, as the progenitor of Appalachian religious snake handling. Although these writers have emphasized Hensley's role in propagating the practice, Kimbrough notes that claims that he originated it are usually unsubstantiated by research, and the origins of the observance are unclear. Hood and Williamson argue that the beginnings of Pentecostal snake handling rites cannot be ascribed to a single person, and that the observance arose independently on multiple occasions. There is no doubt among historians, however, that Hensley helped spread Pentecostal snake handling throughout the Southeast, and that media coverage of Hensley's ministry was influential in prompting various churches to include the practice in their services.

Media coverage of the movement has focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership and in particular his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement.

Thurman Tucker

Thurman Lowell Tucker (September 26, 1917May 7, 1993) was an American <a href="professional%20baseball">professional baseball</a> player. A <a href="center%20fielder">center fielder</a>, Tucker played in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> for nine seasons in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> with the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> and <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>. In 701 career games, Tucker recorded a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of .255 and accumulated 24 <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triples</a>, nine <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s, and 179 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBI). He was nicknamed "Joe E." Tucker because of his resemblance to comedian <a href="Joe%20E.%20Brown">Joe E. Brown</a>.

Born and raised in Texas, Tucker first played professionally with the <a href="Siloam%20Springs%20Travelers">Siloam Springs Travelers</a>. After gradually progressing through <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a>, he signed with the Chicago White Sox before the 1941 season. His major league debut came the following year and he spent two years as the White Sox's starting center fielder until he enlisted in the armed forces during World War II. Upon his return, Tucker played two more seasons for the White Sox. Subsequently, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians, for whom he played four years, and continued to play minor league baseball throughout the 1950s. After his retirement, he became a major league scout and insurance agent.

Thurman Tucker was born on September 26, 1917, and raised in <a href="Gordon%2C%20Texas">Gordon, Texas</a>. In high school, he was a three-sport athlete, playing baseball (where he was a <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a>), <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, and <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a>. After graduating in 1935, he played semi-professional baseball and enrolled in a baseball school located in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>. In 1936, at age 18, Tucker signed as a professional with the <a href="Fayetteville%20Bears">Fayetteville Bears</a> of the <a href="Arkansas%E2%80%93Missouri%20League">Arkansas–Missouri League</a>, but left the team after only two weeks, without playing a game. Soon after, he was signed by the <a href="Siloam%20Springs%20Travelers">Siloam Springs Travelers</a> of the same league, where he began his professional career.

In 1936, his first season with the Travelers, Tucker changed fielding positions and became an outfielder. In 117 games, he had a .319 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> and 25 <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">doubles</a>. The following year, he was to play for the <a href="El%20Dorado%20Lions">El Dorado Lions</a> of the <a href="Cotton%20States%20League">Cotton States League</a>, but a back injury caused him to miss nearly the entire season. After recovering from the injury, Tucker continued to progress through the minors, spending 1938 with two separate clubs; he played 55 games for the <a href="Abbeville%20A%27s">Abbeville A's</a> of the <a href="Evangeline%20Baseball%20League">Evangeline Baseball League</a> and 50 games for the <a href="Greenville%20Bucks">Greenville Bucks</a> of the Cotton States League. He remained in the Cotton States League for 1939, playing for the <a href="Clarksdale%20Red%20Sox">Clarksdale Red Sox</a>, at the time a minor league affiliate of the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>. In 136 games for Clarksdale, Tucker had a .298 batting average and 10 <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triples</a>. During his first few years in the minor leagues, one manager asked him to take up <a href="clowning">clowning</a> due to his resemblance to <a href="Joe%20E.%20Brown">Joe E. Brown</a> and his nickname as a result, Joe E. Tucker objected due to his serious nature and the idea was later dropped.

Tucker's breakthrough minor league year came in 1940, his second with Clarksdale. By the end of June, he was leading the Cotton State League with a batting average of .374. After playing in 97 games, finishing with an average of .390, Tucker was promoted and played in 40 games for the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20Indians">Oklahoma City Indians</a>. At the end of the season, Chicago White Sox <a href="farm%20team">farm</a> manager Billy Webb was impressed enough to purchase Tucker's contract from Oklahoma City. At the beginning of the 1941 season, Tucker failed to win the final outfield spot on the White Sox roster from <a href="Dave%20Short">Dave Short</a>, and consequently spent 1941 at Oklahoma City, where he was coached by <a href="Rogers%20Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a>. In 141 games for the Indians, Tucker had a batting average of .246 and 12 triples.

At spring training for the 1942 season, Tucker competed against <a href="Dave%20Philley">Dave Philley</a> for the final outfield spot. White Sox management liked Tucker's defensive abilities, leading to them adding Tucker to their 1942 major league roster; Tucker made his major league debut on April 14, 1942. After playing two games for the White Sox, Tucker was sent down to the <a href="Fort%20Worth%20Cats%20%28Texas%20League%29">Fort Worth Cats</a> of the <a href="Texas%20League">Texas League</a>, where he spent most of the season and hit .313 in 144 games. When the minor league season ended, Tucker returned to the major league squad, and finished the year having played seven games for the White Sox.

Of the Chicago White Sox outfielders at the beginning of the 1943 season, only <a href="Wally%20Moses">Wally Moses</a> was assured of a place on the team. During spring training, manager <a href="Jimmy%20Dykes">Jimmy Dykes</a> was impressed by Tucker, who was competing for the starting center fielder position alongside <a href="Moose%20Solters">Moose Solters</a>. Consequently, after spring training Tucker became the starting center fielder for 1943, and the team's <a href="leadoff%20hitter">leadoff hitter</a>. Partway through the season, Tucker's performance caught the eye of American League President <a href="Will%20Harridge">Will Harridge</a>, who noted him as someone the public came out to watch in the absence of stars serving in World War II. Among Tucker's achievements during the year were a <a href="walk-off%20home%20run">walk-off home run</a> on July 26 to win a game against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> 2–1. Tucker finished the season with a .235 batting average, six triples, and 79 <a href="base%20on%20balls">walks</a> in 135 games. He also stole 29 bases, the third best total in the AL, and was caught stealing 17 times, which was second in the league.

Tucker passed a physical examination for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> before the 1944 season began. Although expected to be called up to serve in the war that year, he was able to play the entire season for the White Sox. Tucker hit very well during the first month of 1944; he had a .403 batting average on May 16, which led the American League. His hitting and fielding abilities impressed critics: sportswriter <a href="Fred%20Lieb">Fred Lieb</a> noted him as a breakout performer that year, and manager Jimmy Dykes called Tucker the finest defensive outfielder in the American League. Tucker and <a href="Dixie%20Walker">Dixie Walker</a> led their respective leagues in batting average throughout June; at the end of the month, Tucker had an average of .369 in the American League while Walker had an average of .377 in the National League. Owing to his achievements, Tucker was added to the 1944 <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> roster for the only time in his career. He was the leadoff hitter in the <a href="1944%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">1944 Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>, but went hitless in four at-bats.

Tucker's form faded after the All-Star Game; in early July, he had a hitless streak of 28 at-bats, causing his batting average to shrink from .375 to .327, resulting in losing his status as league leader. When his average fell to .320 after recording one base hit in 35 at-bats, he was removed from the starting lineup for a weekend matchup against the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> in an attempt to halt his decline. Tucker returned to the starting lineup shortly after being removed, and finished the season with a batting average of .287 and six triples. At the end of July that season, both Tucker and <a href="George%20Case">George Case</a> participated in a 75-yard dash as part of the White Sox's annual benefit for the war effort; Tucker lost the race to Case by a yard. After the season ended, Tucker formally joined the Navy, and spent the 1945 season serving in the war.

When the players returned to their teams at the end of the war, Tucker was slated to be the starting center fielder for the 1946 season, working alongside Wally Moses and <a href="Taffy%20Wright">Taffy Wright</a>. Unlike the previous season, he struggled with the bat at first, and was relegated to his original status on the White Sox roster as a good fielder but a poor hitter. At the end of June, Tucker had a batting average of .229, nearly 150 points lower than his average at the same point in 1944. His form recovered in the second half of the season and he finished the year with a batting average of .288 and 20 doubles, both career highs. As the <a href="1947%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">1947 Chicago White Sox season</a> began, Tucker remained in his center field position after hitting .400 in the last month of the 1946 season, while rookie Dave Philley played in left field and Taffy Wright and <a href="Bob%20Kennedy">Bob Kennedy</a> <a href="platoon%20system">platooned</a> in right field. However, he started the year by missing some playing time due to a stomach ailment, and did not play regularly for the White Sox until the middle of May. After returning to regular play, Tucker alternated playing time with Philley, and he finished the season with a .236 batting average in 89 games.

On January 27, 1948, Tucker was traded to the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> for <a href="Ralph%20Weigel">Ralph Weigel</a>; the Indians front office regarded Tucker as "the finest defensive player in baseball." He started off the year as the starting center fielder for the Indians, and in one early matchup against the Detroit Tigers, was the only player not to record a hit in an 8–2 victory. He missed three weeks of playing time in June after breaking a finger when he was hit by a pitch. Upon returning to the lineup, Tucker spent most of the second half of the season as a <a href="fourth%20outfielder">fourth outfielder</a>, splitting time with <a href="Allie%20Clark">Allie Clark</a> and playing in the outfield alongside <a href="Larry%20Doby">Larry Doby</a> and <a href="Dale%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29">Dale Mitchell</a>. He finished the season with a .260 batting average and 52 runs in 83 games, and ended the season with a perfect <a href="fielding%20percentage">fielding percentage</a> of 1.000. Tucker participated in game six of the <a href="1948%20World%20Series">1948 World Series</a>, scoring a run in the sixth inning on a <a href="base%20on%20balls">walk</a> en route to a 4–3 win for the Indians.

The Indians planned to use Tucker as their fourth outfielder for the 1949 season when he served mostly as backup to Doby. He was relegated mostly to <a href="pinch%20hitting">pinch hitting</a> duties, and finished the season with a .244 batting average in 20 games and under 200 at-bats. Due to his hitting struggles, Indians manager <a href="Lou%20Boudreau">Lou Boudreau</a> tried converting Tucker to a <a href="switch%20hitter">switch hitter</a> to start off the 1950 season. Tucker was again set to be a backup outfielder in 1950. His performances during the year included hitting a home run, the only one he hit that season, in an 8–5 victory over the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>; the teams raised $60,000 in that game to benefit <a href="sandlot%20ball">sandlot</a> teams in Cleveland. Tucker finished the season with a .178 batting average in 54 games, the lowest mark of his career.

Tucker and Allie Clark both attempted to make the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of <a href="Harry%20Simpson">Harry Simpson</a> and <a href="Minnie%20Mi%C3%B1oso">Minnie Miñoso</a> made it likely that one or both of them would be traded or released. Tucker played only one game for the Indians, on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat. In early May, the Indians sent him to their <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A minor league affiliate</a>, the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres%20%28PCL%29">San Diego Padres</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>; his last major league game was April 29.

After being sent to the Padres, Tucker completed the 1951 season with them. In 88 games, Tucker had two triples and a .222 batting average. In the offseason, Tucker operated his own taxicab in Texas, and he contemplated retirement from baseball during a contract dispute in February 1952. He eventually played 47 games for the now-unaffiliated Padres, hitting .225 in the process. In mid-June, the Padres sold his contract to the Oklahoma City Indians. Tucker played in 72 games for the Indians that season, hitting .263. He retired from baseball before the 1953 season, and did not play with any professional team during that time.

Tucker returned to baseball in 1954 to play for the <a href="Lubbock%20Hubbers">Lubbock Hubbers</a> of the <a href="West%20Texas%E2%80%93New%20Mexico%20League">West Texas–New Mexico League</a>. He played part-time for the team, serving as a replacement when players needed time off, whether through injury or to spend time with their families. He hit .360 in 25 games for the Hubbers. The following year, he served as player-manager for the <a href="Carlsbad%20Potashers">Carlsbad Potashers</a> of the <a href="Longhorn%20League">Longhorn League</a>. Tucker hit .275 in 114 games for the Potashers, including 25 doubles and eight home runs. He continued as player-manager for the Potashers in 1956, but the management considered firing him during a 14-game losing streak. He finished the year with a .306 batting average in 128 games. The following season, he was the player-manager of the Hobbs Sports, but only played in 16 games for them, hitting .273. In 1958, he ended his playing career, and became the general manager of the Hobbs team.

After retiring, Tucker became an insurance agent and lived in <a href="Oklahoma%20City">Oklahoma City</a>. He married and had four children; his son Ronald served in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. In 1962, he also became one of the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a>' first <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scouts</a>. Tucker died on May 7, 1993, in Oklahoma City and is buried at Gordon Cemetery in his hometown of Gordon, Texas.

Splendid fairywren

The splendid fairywren ("Malurus splendens") is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird in the <a href="Australasian%20wren">Australasian wren</a> family, Maluridae. It also known simply as the splendid wren or more colloquially in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> as the blue wren. The splendid fairywren is found across much of the Australian continent from central-western <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and southwestern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> over to coastal Western Australia. It inhabits predominantly <a href="arid">arid</a> and semi-arid regions. Exhibiting a high degree of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, the male in breeding plumage is a small, long-tailed bird of predominantly bright blue and black colouration. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. It comprises several similar all-blue and black subspecies that were originally considered separate species.

Like other fairywrens, the splendid fairywren is notable for several peculiar behavioural characteristics; birds are socially <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a> and sexually <a href="promiscuous">promiscuous</a>, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such trysts. Male wrens pluck pink or purple petals and display them to females as part of a courtship display.

The habitat of the splendid fairywren ranges from forest to dry scrub, generally with ample vegetation for shelter. Unlike the eastern <a href="superb%20fairywren">superb fairywren</a>, it has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas. The splendid fairywren mainly eats insects and supplements its diet with seeds.

The splendid fairywren is one of eleven species of the genus "<a href="Malurus">Malurus</a>", commonly known as fairywrens, found in Australia and lowland <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Within the genus it is most closely related to the <a href="superb%20fairywren">superb fairywren</a>. These two "blue wrens" are closely related to the <a href="purple-crowned%20fairywren">purple-crowned fairywren</a> of north-western Australia.

Specimens were initially collected at <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a>, and the splendid fairywren then described as "Saxicola splendens" by the French <a href="natural%20history">naturalists</a> <a href="Jean%20Ren%C3%A9%20Constant%20Quoy">Jean René Constant Quoy</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Paul%20Gaimard">Joseph Paul Gaimard</a> in 1830, three years before <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> gave it the scientific name of "Malurus pectoralis" and vernacular name of banded superb-warbler. Though he correctly placed it in the genus "Malurus", the specific name of the former authors took priority. The specific epithet is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "splendens", which means "shining".
Like other fairywrens, the splendid fairywren is unrelated to the true <a href="wren">wren</a>. It was first classified as a member of the Old World flycatcher family <a href="Muscicapidae">Muscicapidae</a> by <a href="Richard%20Bowdler%20Sharpe">Richard Bowdler Sharpe</a>, though it was later placed in the warbler family <a href="Sylviidae">Sylviidae</a> by the same author, before being placed in the newly recognised family Maluridae in 1975. More recently, <a href="DNA">DNA</a> analysis has shown the family Maluridae to be related to the family Meliphagidae (<a href="honeyeater">the honeyeater</a>s), and the family <a href="Pardalotidae">Pardalotidae</a> within a large superfamily, <a href="Meliphagoidea">Meliphagoidea</a>.

The splendid fairywren is also alternatively named the splendid blue wren.

Initially, three of the subspecies were considered separate species as they were each originally described far from their borders with the others. However, as the interior of Australia was explored, it became apparent there were areas of hybridisation where subspecies overlapped. Thus in 1975, they were then reclassified as subspecies of the splendid fairywren. There are four subspecies currently recognized:

In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist <a href="Richard%20Schodde">Richard Schodde</a> proposed a southern origin for the common ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At some time in the past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. These split into at least three enclaves which subsequently evolved in isolation in the following drier glacial periods until the current more favourable climate saw them expand once again and interbreed where they overlap. This suggests the original split was only very recent as the forms had insufficient time to speciate. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the <a href="white-shouldered%20fairywren">white-shouldered</a>, <a href="white-winged%20fairywren">white-winged</a> and <a href="red-backed%20fairywren">red-backed fairywren</a>s.

The splendid fairywren is a small, long-tailed bird long. Exhibiting a high degree of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, the breeding male is distinctive with a bright blue forehead and ear coverts, a violet throat and deeper rich blue back wings, chest and tail with a black bill, eye band and chest band. The blue breeding plumage of the male is often referred to as nuptial plumage. The non-breeding male is brown with blue in the wings and a bluish tail. The female resembles the non-breeding male but has a chestnut bill and eye-patch. Immature males will moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching, though this may be incomplete with residual brownish plumage and may take another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They will moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Some older males have remained blue all year, moulting directly from one year's nuptial plumage to the next. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly <a href="iridescent">iridescent</a> due to the flattened and twisted surface of the <a href="barbule">barbule</a>s. The blue plumage also reflects <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the <a href="Electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum</a>. The call is described as a gushing reel; this is harsher and louder than other fairywrens and varies from individual to individual. A soft single "trrt" serves as a contact call within a foraging group, while the alarm call is a "tsit". <a href="Cuckoo">Cuckoo</a>s and other intruders may be greeted with a threat posture and churring threat. Females emit a "purr" while brooding.

The splendid fairywren is widely distributed in the arid and semi-arid zones of Australia. Habitat is typically dry and shrubby; mulga and mallee in drier parts of the country and forested areas in the southwest. The western subspecies "splendens" and eastern black-backed fairywren (subspecies "melanotus") are largely <a href="sedentism">sedentary</a>, although the turquoise fairywren (subspecies "musgravei") is thought to be partially nomadic. Unlike the eastern <a href="superb%20fairywren">superb fairywren</a>, the splendid fairywren has not adapted well to human occupation of the landscape and has disappeared from some urbanised areas. Forestry plantations of pine ("<a href="Pinus">Pinus</a>" spp.) and eucalypts are also unsuitable as they lack undergrowth.

Like all fairywrens, the splendid fairywren is an active and restless feeder, particularly on open ground near shelter, but also through the lower foliage. Movement is a series of jaunty hops and bounces, with its balance assisted by a proportionally large tail, which is usually held upright and rarely still. The short, rounded wings provide good initial lift and are useful for short flights, though not for extended jaunts. However, splendid fairywrens are stronger fliers than most other fairywrens. During spring and summer, birds are active in bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during the heat of the day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.

Groups of two to eight splendid fairywrens remain in <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">their territory</a> and defend it year-round. Territories average in woodland-heath areas; size decreases with increasing density of vegetation and increases with the number of males in the group. The group consists of a socially <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a> pair with one or more male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. Splendid fairywrens are sexually <a href="promiscuous">promiscuous</a>, each partner mating with other individuals and even assisting in raising the young from such trysts. Over a third of offspring are the result of an 'extramarital' mating. Helper birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.

Major nest predators include <a href="Australian%20magpie">Australian magpie</a>s ("Gymnorhina tibicen"), <a href="butcherbird">butcherbird</a>s ("Cracticus" spp.), <a href="laughing%20kookaburra">laughing kookaburra</a> ("Dacelo novaeguineae"), <a href="currawong">currawong</a>s ("Strepera" spp.), <a href="crow">crow</a>s and <a href="raven">raven</a>s ("Corvus" spp.), <a href="shrike-thrush">shrike-thrush</a>es ("Colluricincla" spp.) as well as introduced mammals such as the <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a> ("Vulpes vulpes"), <a href="cat">cat</a> ("Felis catus") and <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"). Like other species of fairywrens, splendid fairywrens may use a 'rodent-run' display to distract predators from nests with young birds. While doing this, the head, neck and tail of the bird are lowered, the wings are held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.

Several <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a>s by splendid fairywren males have been recorded; the 'sea horse flight,' so named for the similarity of movements to those by a <a href="seahorse">seahorse</a>, is an exaggerated undulating flight where the male, with his neck extended and his head feathers erect, flies and tilts his body from horizontal to vertical and by rapidly beating wings is able to descend slowly and spring upwards after alighting on the ground. The 'face fan' display may be seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers.
Another interesting habit of males of this and other fairywren species during the reproductive season is to pluck petals (in this species, predominantly pink and purple ones which contrast with their plumage) and show them to female fairywrens. Petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Outside the breeding season males may sometimes still show petals to females in other territories, presumably to promote themselves. It is notable that fairywrens are socially <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> and sexually <a href="promiscuous">promiscuous</a>: pairs will bond for life, but regularly <a href="copulation">mate</a> with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting. Thus, petal-carrying might be a behaviour that strengthens the pair-bond. Petal carrying might also be a way for extra males to gain matings with the female. In either case, the data does not strongly link petal-carrying and presenting to a copulation soon thereafter.

Researchers at Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago published a paper in "<a href="Behavioral%20Ecology%20%28journal%29">Behavioral Ecology</a>" in 2010 showing that male splendid fairywrens sing display-like vocalizations (Type II song) in response to predator calls. The trills "hitchhike" on the predator's vocalization and the female splendid fairywrens, which have become more alert due to the predator calls, also respond more strongly to this type II song than when it's given without a predator call preceding it.

Breeding occurs from late August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. The nest is built by the female; it is a round or domed structure made of loosely woven grasses and <a href="spider%20web">spider web</a>s, with an entrance in one side close to the ground and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as "<a href="Acacia%20pulchella">Acacia pulchella</a>" or a species of "<a href="Hakea">Hakea</a>". One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season. A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 × 16 mm (½ × ⅝ in), are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks. The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15 days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their <a href="fecal%20sac">fecal sac</a>s removed by all group members for 10–13 days, by which time they are fledged. Young birds remain in the family group as helpers for a year or more before moving to another group, usually an adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods.

Splendid fairywrens also commonly play host to the brood parasite <a href="Horsfield%27s%20bronze%20cuckoo">Horsfield's bronze cuckoo</a> ("Chalcites basalis"), with the <a href="shining%20bronze%20cuckoo">shining bronze cuckoo</a> ("Chalcites lucidus") also recorded.

The splendid fairywren is predominantly <a href="insectivorous">insectivorous</a>; its diet includes a wide range of small creatures, mostly arthropods such as ants, grasshoppers, crickets, spiders and bugs. This is supplemented by small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit. They mostly forage on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres above the ground; this has been termed 'hop-searching'. Unusually for fairywrens, they may also occasionally forage in the canopy of flowering gums. Birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups as this foraging practice does render them vulnerable to a range of predators. Food can be scarce in winter and ants are an important 'last resort' option, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet. Adult fairywrens feed their young a different diet, conveying larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers to nestlings.

The bird was intended to be illustrated on an <a href="Australia%20Post">Australia Post</a> 45c pre-stamped envelope released on 12 August 1999; however, a <a href="superb%20fairywren">superb fairywren</a> was mistakenly illustrated instead.
