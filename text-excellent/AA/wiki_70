California State Route 94

State Route 94 (SR 94) is a highway in the U.S. state of <a href="California">California</a> that is long. The western portion, known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway, begins at <a href="Interstate%205%20%28California%29">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) in <a href="Downtown%20San%20Diego">Downtown San Diego</a> and continues to the end of the <a href="freeway">freeway</a> portion past <a href="California%20State%20Route%20125">SR 125</a> in <a href="Spring%20Valley%2C%20San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">Spring Valley</a>. The non-freeway segment of SR 94 that continues east through the mountains to <a href="Interstate%208">I-8</a> near <a href="Boulevard%2C%20California">Boulevard</a> is known as Campo Road.

The Campo road served as a <a href="wagon%20road">wagon road</a> providing access to eastern San Diego County as well as Imperial County. The road was added to the <a href="State%20highways%20in%20California">state highway system</a> in 1933, and signs for Route 94 were posted along local roads later that decade. Efforts to convert the western half of the route to a freeway got underway in the 1950s, and the freeway was complete by 1962 west of the road that became SR 125. Construction continued east to Avocado Road over the next few years. Various proposals for widening the highway have come from the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans), but local opposition resulted in the delay or cancellation of many of these proposals.

SR 94 is an east–west freeway that begins at the eastern end of the <a href="one-way%20couplet">one-way couplet</a> of F and G streets in southeast San Diego. The freeway continues through an <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchange</a> with <a href="I-5%20%28CA%29">I-5</a> just east of <a href="Downtown%20San%20Diego">downtown</a>. Following this, the route goes through the neighborhoods of <a href="Sherman%20Heights%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Sherman Heights</a>, <a href="Grant%20Hill%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Grant Hill</a>, <a href="Stockton%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Stockton</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Hope%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Mount Hope</a>, where there is an interchange with <a href="SR%2015%20%28CA%29">SR 15</a>. Shortly thereafter, SR 94 intersects <a href="I-805%20%28CA%29">I-805</a> in <a href="Chollas%20View%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Chollas View</a> before continuing east through <a href="Emerald%20Hills%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Emerald Hills</a> and <a href="Chollas%20Creek%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Chollas Creek</a> into the city of <a href="Lemon%20Grove%2C%20California">Lemon Grove</a>. Passing by the Marketplace at the Grove Mall, the freeway forms the boundary between Lemon Grove to the south and <a href="La%20Mesa%2C%20California">La Mesa</a> to the north, up to the <a href="SR%20125%20%28CA%29">SR 125</a> interchange where SR 94 turns east. At this point, SR 94 leaves both cities and enters unincorporated <a href="Spring%20Valley%2C%20San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">Spring Valley</a> and <a href="Casa%20de%20Oro">Casa de Oro</a>.

The freeway becomes an undivided highway at Via Mercado in <a href="Rancho%20San%20Diego">Rancho San Diego</a>. SR 94 continues through Rancho San Diego by turning southeast at the Jamacha Road and Campo Road intersection, where <a href="SR%2054%20%28CA%29">SR 54</a> and <a href="CR%20S17%20%28CA%29">CR S17</a> turn northeast. As Campo Road, SR 94 crosses the <a href="Sweetwater%20River%20%28California%29">Sweetwater River</a> before entering a less-developed area, winding through the communities of <a href="Jamul%2C%20California">Jamul</a>, <a href="Dulzura%2C%20California">Dulzura</a> and intersecting the north end of <a href="SR%20188%20%28CA%29">SR 188</a> north of <a href="Tecate%2C%20California">Tecate</a>. After passing through the communities of <a href="Potrero%2C%20California">Potrero</a>, <a href="Campo%2C%20California">Campo</a>, and the <a href="Campo%20Indian%20Reservation">Campo Indian Reservation</a>, SR 94 continues east onto old <a href="U.S.%20Route%2080%20%28California%29">U.S. Route 80</a> (US 80) briefly before turning north on Ribbonwood Road west of <a href="Boulevard%2C%20California">Boulevard</a>. The route ends by connecting to <a href="Interstate%208">I-8</a> near <a href="Manzanita%2C%20California">Manzanita</a>.
SR 94 is part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>; west of SR 188, it is part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. SR 94 is eligible for the <a href="State%20Scenic%20Highway%20System%20%28California%29">State Scenic Highway System</a>, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a>. In 2014, SR 94 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 440 vehicles at Live Oak Springs Road, and 179,000 vehicles between I-805 and 47th Street, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

SR 94 was built along the routing of an old <a href="stagecoach%20road">stagecoach road</a> that was part of the primary road from San Diego to <a href="Yuma%2C%20Arizona">Yuma, Arizona</a>. A trip to <a href="East%20County%2C%20San%20Diego">East County</a> in the 19th century along the road would last two days. James Pascoe surveyed the route through Campo for the county in 1869 that was shorter than the existing route through Warner's Pass. The road was known for its curves, climbs, and boulders, making travel difficult. The first automobile went on the road in 1904. By 1913, an unpaved automobile road extended to Campo from San Diego, and work took place to improve the condition of the road in 1916. A year later, the road continued east to join with the state highway leading into <a href="Imperial%20County%2C%20California">Imperial County</a>. In 1927, the Potrero bridge was replaced, after a storm washed it out. By 1928, the paving of the Campo road was about 43 percent complete. In February of the next year, the progress was at 74 percent; the total cost was $122,474 (about $ in dollars). The Sweetwater bridge was finished in March at a cost of $60,000 (about $ in dollars). The Campo road was the only road through the <a href="Peninsular%20Ranges">Peninsular Ranges</a> to stay open for the entirety of the next winter; other roads were closed due to snow, leading to increased traffic along this road. This was largely due to the lower elevation of the road, at only .

In 1931, the County Board of Supervisors agreed to submit the Campo road for consideration as a secondary state highway. The state considered the inclusion of the Campo road into the system in 1932. The <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a> defined Route 200 in 1933 as a route from San Diego to west of Jacumba, going through the town of Campo. The San Diego Chamber of Commerce sent a representative to ask the state for funding for paving the Campo highway in 1935, and the road was paved that year. The Chamber also asked for the war department to declare the road a military highway to receive federal assistance for its improvement. Signs were posted for SR 94 in 1937, and by 1938, SR 94 was signed along Broadway and Lemon Grove Boulevard (later Federal Boulevard) before continuing east to Campo.

The next year, the California Highway Commission declined to have the Campo road improved. However, the Highway 94 association, as well as the Campo-Potrero and Highway 80 chambers of commerce raised concerns about the safety of the children going to school in the buses along the road. In 1952, the Southern California committee of the state Chamber of Commerce recommended to the California Highway Commission that Route 94 be widened to four lanes from the <a href="SR%2015%20%28CA%29">Wabash Freeway</a> to Jamacha. In June 1953, the Commission approved an eight-lane freeway for Route 94 from Home Avenue in San Diego to Palm Avenue around La Mesa. The local Board of Education also gave their approval, which was required because the freeway would be built on land that was for a proposed school. But the next month, State Senator <a href="Fred%20Kraft">Fred Kraft</a> criticized the proposal because he believed that it would be too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long term. Approval extended to the junction with US 80 by October 1953; the part from 18th Street to Wabash Boulevard followed in November 1954. Later that year, a toll road that would have tunneled under the <a href="Laguna%20Mountains">Laguna Mountains</a> and bypassed Route 94 was proposed by the county Board of Supervisors. The state allocated $3.48 million (about $ in dollars) for making SR 94 a freeway from College Avenue to Campo Road in October 1954.

Construction began on the first part of the SR 94 freeway just west of Lemon Grove by May 1955. The contract for the College Avenue to Campo Road portion was given out in October, for $2.9 million (about $ in dollars). Preparation for bidding on the portion from the Wabash Freeway to near Euclid Avenue took place towards the end of the year; construction was underway by May 1956, as was planning for the portion west of there to the intersection of 18th and F streets and the future interchange with <a href="US%20101%20%28CA%29">US 101</a>. The San Diego City Council requested that an overpass be constructed at 22nd Street to provide improved access; an underpass for the road was eventually built. The freeway from Wabash Boulevard and 56th was completed on March 18, 1957; metal-weakened plane joints were used for the construction, which the California Division of Highways considered "experimental" at the time. East of College Avenue, some unwanted cracks developed in the roadway during the joint pouring process, and were repaired with <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a>. At one point in 1958, SR 94 was considered as a possible extension of <a href="US%2090">US 90</a>, a route proposed to run along the southern border of the United States to <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, by the South Bay Highway Association. By August, SR 94 from Palm Avenue to Jamacha was being planned.

The western end of SR 94 connecting to US 101 was put up for the bidding process in late 1958. Construction on the interchange with US 101 began in 1961. By January 1962, the freeway was mostly complete west of La Mesa and the freeway connection to US 80. The part of the freeway from 25th to 17th streets was completed in November. In the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>, SR 94 was officially designated from I-5 to I-8 near Jacumba, and SR 125 was designated from SR 94 near La Mesa north to <a href="SR%2056%20%28CA%29">SR 56</a>.

Land acquisition for the construction of the SR 94 freeway through Spring Valley had begun by 1965. The next year, a plan to reroute and widen portions of SR 94 from the Sweetwater River to I-8 was underway, with a Caltrans proposal to remove the "Frenchy's" or "Three Springs" curve. In March 1968, the San Diego Highway Development Association considered the construction of the freeway from SR 125 to Jamacha Junction a priority. The state announced in August that the Spring Valley widening project would be funded earlier than anticipated, due to the state of the economy. Meanwhile, a $1.8 million (about $ in dollars) contract to widen SR 94 to eight lanes from Wabash Boulevard to Waite Drive in Lemon Grove was awarded in October. The freeway from Kenwood Drive to Avocado Boulevard in Spring Valley was completed in July 1970.
An improved interchange with SR 125 was being planned in 1974, which would connect to the existing freeway extending to Avocado Boulevard. Construction began in October, and continued into late 1975, at a cost of $11 million (about $ in dollars); the road was predicted to reduce traffic at the intersection of Campo Road and Bancroft Drive, and interchanges at Spring Street and Lemon Grove Avenue were to be built. The Lemon Grove Avenue interchange was open by January 30, 1976, and parts of the interchange with Spring Street and SR 125 was open by July 20.

By 1977, much of the SR 94 freeway was congested, with 85,000 to 95,000 trips per day on the freeway according to Caltrans. It was hoped that the construction of <a href="SR%2054%20%28CA%29">SR 54</a> to the south and SR 125 would reduce traffic by 20,000 trips per day. <a href="Onramp%20meters">Onramp meters</a> were installed in 1978 to throttle traffic entering the freeway with a centralized computer system; this resulted in reduced congestion on the freeway, according to motorists. In 1987, the bridge over the Sweetwater River that had been used for 58 years was replaced by a new bridge, at a cost of $2.3 million (about $ in dollars); construction had been delayed by nine months due to concern over environmental harm to the <a href="least%20Bell%27s%20vireo">least Bell's vireo</a>.

The highway was designated the <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> Freeway by the California State Legislature in September 1989, after a two-year struggle to find a suitable tribute to King in the <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> area. Nevertheless, the measure did not include funding for the signs, and as a result, they were not installed until 1998, when they were funded by the San Diego Association of Governments with $1.4 million (about $ in dollars) from a local sales tax.

In 1995, a <a href="U.S.%20Border%20Patrol">U.S. Border Patrol</a> checkpoint was opened near Dulzura, to combat human and drug trafficking that used SR 94, as well as fatal traffic accidents resulting from such smuggling. Two years later, following a proposal to widen SR 94 from Otay Lakes Road to SR 188 to address the high rate of accidents, local residents raised concerns about this proposal. In July 1998, the Back Country Coalition sued Caltrans concerning the short length of the <a href="environmental%20impact%20report">environmental impact report</a> as well as not soliciting comments from the public; opponents pushed for a ban of all trucks on the highway. Caltrans agreed to hold another hearing in an out-of-court settlement, as well as to pay $20,000 for the attorneys. In March 1999, Caltrans agreed to delay the construction for several years to evaluate the environmental impact. During the early 2000s, the interchange with SR 125 was reconstructed to allow for the extension of the latter freeway south to SR 54, which was finished in 2003.

In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe prepared to construct a <a href="casino">casino</a>, but many expressed concerns about the amount of traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR 94 and to construct on the state <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a>. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a <a href="sovereign%20nation">sovereign nation</a> and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for <a href="environmental%20mitigation">environmental mitigation</a>.

Caltrans has plans to add a ramp from southbound SR 125 to SR 94 to improve the interchange; it is in the environmental planning stages, and is estimated to cost $71 million. Also in the planning stages are <a href="high-occupancy%20toll">high-occupancy toll</a> lanes between the I-5 and I-805 interchanges, and rerouting part of SR 94 east of the junction with Jamacha Boulevard while improving some interchanges.

2002 Pacific typhoon season

The 2002 Pacific typhoon season was an active season, with many <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a>s affecting <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="China">China</a>. Every month had tropical activity, with most storms forming from July through October. Overall, there were 44 tropical depressions declared officially or unofficially, of which 26 became <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storms</a>; of those, there were 15 <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a>s, which is the equivalent of a minimal <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales">hurricane</a>, while 8 of the 15 typhoon intensified into super typhoons unofficially by the JTWC.

The season began early with the first storm, Tapah, developing on January 10, east of the Philippines. Two months later, <a href="Typhoon%20Mitag%20%282002%29">Typhoon Mitag</a> became the first <a href="Super%20typhoons">super typhoon</a> ever to be recorded in March. In June, <a href="Typhoon%20Chataan">Typhoon Chataan</a> dropped heavy rainfall in the <a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a>, killing 48 people and becoming the deadliest natural disaster in the state of <a href="Chuuk%20State">Chuuk</a>. Chataan later left heavy damage in <a href="Guam">Guam</a> before striking Japan. In August, <a href="Typhoon%20Rusa">Typhoon Rusa</a> became the deadliest typhoon in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> in 43 years, causing 238 deaths and $4.2 billion in damage. <a href="Typhoon%20Higos%20%282002%29">Typhoon Higos</a> in October was the third strongest typhoon to strike <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The final typhoon of the season was <a href="Typhoon%20Pongsona">Typhoon Pongsona</a>, which was one of the costliest storms on record in Guam; it did damage worth $700 million on the island before dissipating on December 11.

The western Pacific basin covers the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a>. Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes; see <a href="2002%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season">2002 Pacific hurricane season</a>. Tropical Storms formed in the entire Northwest Pacific basin are assigned a name by the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA). Tropical depressions in this basin have the "W" suffix added to their number when classified by the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC). Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the <a href="Philippine%20Atmospheric%2C%20Geophysical%20and%20Astronomical%20Services%20Administration">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> (PAGASA), which can result in the same storm having two names; in these cases both storm names are given below, with the PAGASA name in parentheses.

On March 6, meteorologists from <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> at TropicalStormRisk.com issued a forecast for the season for above average activity, since <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s were expected to be slightly warmer than usual; the group used data by the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC), and compared the potential 28.6 storms to the 30-year average of 26.3. The group raised the number of predicted storms in April to 29.6, and again in early May to 30.5. They ultimately overestimated the number of storms that would form. The Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at the <a href="City%20University%20of%20Hong%20Kong">City University of Hong Kong</a> also issued a season forecast in April 2002, predicting 27 storms with a margin of error of 3, of which 11 would become typhoons, with a margin of error of 2. The agency noted a stronger than normal <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a> over the open Pacific Ocean, as well as ongoing <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o%20Southern%20Oscillation">El Niño</a> conditions that favored development, but expected below-normal development in the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>. These predictions proved to be largely accurate.

During the year, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a> to the <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>, and north of the <a href="equator">equator</a>, in its role as the official <a href="Regional%20Specialized%20Meteorological%20Center">Regional Specialized Meteorological Center</a>, as designated by the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> in 1989. The JMA issued forecasts and analyses every six hours starting at midnight UTC using <a href="numerical%20weather%20prediction">numerical weather prediction</a> (NWP) and a climatological <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model">tropical cyclone forecast model</a>. They used the <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak technique</a> and NWP to estimate 10-minute <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> and <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a>. The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin, operating from <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and supplying forecasts to the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The agency moved their backup facility from <a href="Yokosuka%2C%20Kanagawa">Yokosuka, Kanagawa</a> in Japan to <a href="Monterey%2C%20California">Monterey, California</a> in 2002. Several meteorologists left the agency near the beginning of the year, although the new forecasters compensated for their inexperience by relying on the consensus of various forecast models. In 2002, the JTWC began experimenting with five-day <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20forecasting">forecasts</a>.

During most of the year, sea surface temperatures were above normal near the equator, and were highest around 160° <a href="Longitude">E</a> from January to July, and in November. Areas of <a href="atmospheric%20convection">convection</a> developed farther east than usual, causing many storms to <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">develop</a> east of 150° E. The average point of formation was 145.9° E, the easternmost point since <a href="1951%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season">1951</a>. Partially as a result, no tropical storms made landfall in the Philippines for the first time since 1951, according to the JMA. Two storms – Ele and Huko – entered the basin from the <a href="Central%20Pacific%20Hurricane%20Center">Central Pacific</a>, east of the International Date Line. Overall, there were 26 <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storms</a> in the basin in 2002, which was slightly below the norm of 26.7. A total of 15 of the 26 storms became typhoons, a slightly higher than normal proportion.

The season began early, but did not become active until June, when six storms passed near or over Japan after a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> weakened. Nine storms developed in July, many of which influenced the monsoon trough over the Philippines to produce heavy rainfall and deadly flooding. The flooding was worst in Luzon, where 85 people were killed. The series of storms caused the widespread closure of schools and offices. Many roads were damaged, and the floods left about $1.8 million (₱94.2 million <a href="Philippine%20peso">PHP</a>) in crop damage, largely to rice and corn. Overall damage from the series of storms was estimated at $10.3 million (₱522 million PHP). From June to September, heavy rainfall affected large portions of China, resulting in devastating flooding that killed over 1,500 people and left $8.2 billion (¥68 billion <a href="Chinese%20yuan">CNY</a>) in damage. During this time, <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Kammuri%20%282002%29">Tropical Storm Kammuri</a> struck southern China with a large area of rainfall that damaged or destroyed 245,000 houses. There were 153 deaths related to the storm, mostly inland in <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a>, and damage totaled $322 million (¥2.665 billion CNY). Activity shifted farther to the east after September, with <a href="Typhoon%20Higos%20%282002%29">Typhoon Higos</a> striking Japan in October and <a href="Typhoon%20Pongsona">Typhoon Pongsona</a> hitting Guam in December.

All storms named by the JMA, as well as other notable tropical cyclones, have complete sections below. The track maps plot the track and intensity of the storms; light and dark blue indicate tropical depression and tropical storm status, respectively, and intensifying colors of yellow through red correspond to the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale</a> from 1 to 5.

The first storm of the season was Tropical Storm Tapah, which formed on January 9 near <a href="Palau">Palau</a>. It developed from the <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> and was first observed by the JTWC two days before its formation. The system initially consisted of an area of convection with a weak <a href="atmospheric%20circulation">circulation</a>, located in an area of weak <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>. On January 10, the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression, the same day that the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 01W and PAGASA classified it as "Agaton". The storm moved west-northwestward due to a ridge to the north, and the system gradually became better organized. On January 12, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Tapah, and later that day estimated peak winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). Around that time, Tapah developed an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a> beneath its convection, prompting both the JTWC and PAGASA to estimate peak winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). An approaching <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> weakened the ridge, which turned the storm to the northwest. Due to increasing wind shear, convection gradually weakened, and the JMA downgraded Tapah to a tropical depression on January 13; however, other agencies maintained the system as a tropical storm. The next day, Tapah dissipated along the eastern coast of <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> in the Philippines.
Typhoon Mitag developed from a trough near the equator on February 25 near the <a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">Federated States of Micronesia</a> (FSM). It moved westward through the archipelago and intensified into a typhoon, before passing near <a href="Yap">Yap</a> on March 2. High winds and heavy rainfall affected the state, causing an islandwide power outage and destroying hundreds of houses. Mitag severely damaged crops, resulting in food shortages. The rainfall and storm surge flooded much of the coastline as well as Yap's capital, <a href="Colonia%2C%20Yap">Colonia</a>. Damage totaled $150 million, mostly to crops. There was one death related to the storm's aftermath.

After affecting Yap, Mitag turned to the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed to the north of Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak 10-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on March 5. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) when the storm was about 610 km (380 mi) east of <a href="Catanduanes">Catanduanes</a> in the Philippines; this made Mitag a <a href="Super%20typhoons">super typhoon</a>, the first one on record in the month of March. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the <a href="westerlies">westerlies</a> caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated well to the east of the Philippines.

On March 15, the JTWC began monitoring a tropical disturbance, and four days later upgraded it to a tropical depression near Palau. The next day, both the JMA and PAGASA classified the system as a depression, and PAGASA named it "Caloy". Moving west-northwestward due to a ridge to the north, the depression moved across the Philippine island of <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> on March 21 and continued through the archipelago. Owing to strong wind shear, the system never intensified, and the JMA discontinued advisories on March 23 after the system reached the South China Sea. The JTWC maintained the system as a tropical depression until March 25, when a mid-latitude trough absorbed the system off the east coast of <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>.

Heavy rains from the depression affected the southern Philippines, causing flash flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 2,703 homes, including 215 that were destroyed. Damage totaled about $2.4 million (₱124 million PHP). There were 35 deaths in the Philippines, mostly in <a href="Surigao%20del%20Sur">Surigao del Sur</a> in Mindanao from drownings.

The monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance near the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> in the middle of May. By that time, the system was an area of convection with a weak circulation, although the system organized as outflow improved. It tracked northwestward within the monsoon trough, steered by a mid-level ridge. The system developed into a tropical depression on May 14 about southwest of <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Chuuk Lagoon</a>, and early the next day the JTWC initiated advisories. For several days the depression remained weak, until it intensified into Tropical Storm Hagibis on May 16 about southwest of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. The developing storm dropped rainfall on Guam that ended the island's wildfire season. The storm quickly intensified, developing an eye feature later that day. Early on May 18, the JMA upgraded Hagibis to a typhoon, and around that time, an approaching trough turned the storm to the northeast.

While accelerating northeastward, Hagibis developed a well-defined eye and underwent a period of <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapid deepening</a>. On May 19, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), and the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph); this made Hagibis a super typhoon, the second of the year. At the time of its peak, the typhoon was located about 305 km (190 mi) west-southwest of the northernmost Northern Marianas Islands. Hagibis only maintained its peak for about 12 hours, after which the eye began weakening. The trough that caused the typhoon's acceleration also caused the storm to lose tropical characteristics, and dry air gradually became entrained in the circulation. On May 21, Hagibis became extratropical to the east of Japan after having weakened below typhoon intensity. The remnants continued to the northeast and dissipated south of the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> on May 22.

In early June, a disturbance within the monsoon trough persisted in the South China Sea to the east of Vietnam. On June 4, a tropical depression developed just off the east coast of <a href="Hainan">Hainan</a>, with a broad circulation and scattered convection. The system tracked slowly eastward due to a ridge to the north, and conditions favored intensification, including favorable outflow and minimal wind shear. The JTWC initiated advisories on June 6, and despite the favorable conditions, the depression remained weak. On June 7, the system briefly entered the area of responsibility of PAGASA, and the agency named it Espada. Later that day, the JTWC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, and on June 8 the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Noguri halfway between Taiwan and Luzon. Increased outflow from an approaching trough allowed the storm to quickly intensify. The JTWC upgraded Noguri to a typhoon late on June 8, after an eye developed. By that time, the storm was moving to the northeast due to a building ridge to the southeast. The JMA only estimated peak 10-minute winds of 110 km/h (70 mph), making it a severe tropical storm. However, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 160 km/h (100 mph), after the eye became well-organized. Increasing wind shear weakened Noguri, and the storm passed just west of the <a href="Miyako-jima">Miyako-jima</a> on June 9. The convection diminished, and the JTWC declared Noguri extratropical while the storm was approaching Japan. The JMA continued tracking the storm until it dissipated over the <a href="Kii%20Peninsula">Kii Peninsula</a> on June 11.

While the storm passed south of Taiwan, it dropped heavy rainfall peaking at in <a href="Pingtung%20County">Pingtung County</a>. Rainfall in Japan peaked at at a station in <a href="Kagoshima%20Prefecture">Kagoshima Prefecture</a>. The threat of the storm prompted school closures and 20 airline flight cancellations. Noguri injured one person, damaged one house, and caused about $4 million (¥504 million <a href="Japanese%20yen">JPY</a>) in agricultural damage.
Typhoon Rammasun was the first of four typhoons to contribute to heavy rainfall and deadly flooding in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> in July 2002; there were 85 deaths related to the four storms, with 2,463 homes damaged or destroyed. Rammasun developed around the same time as <a href="Typhoon%20Chataan">Typhoon Chataan</a>, but farther to the west. The storm tracked northwestward toward Taiwan, and on July 2 it attained its peak intensity with winds of 160 km/h (100 mph). Rammasun turned northward, passing east of Taiwan and China. In Taiwan, the outer rainbands dropped rainfall that alleviated drought conditions. In contrast, rainfall in China followed previously wet conditions, resulting in additional flooding, although less damage than expected; there was about $85 million in crop and fishery damage in <a href="Zhejiang">Zhejiang</a>.

After affecting Taiwan and China, Rammasun began weakening due to an approaching trough, which turned the typhoon northeastward. It passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima and also produced strong winds in <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. About 10,000 houses lost power on the island, and high surf killed two sailors. On the Japanese mainland, there was light crop damage and one serious injury. After weakening to a tropical storm, Rammasun passed just west of the South Korean island of <a href="Jejudo">Jejudo</a>, where high waves killed one person. The storm crossed the country, killing three others and leaving $9.5 million in damage. High rains also affected North Korea and <a href="Primorsky%20Krai">Primorsky Krai</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a>.
Typhoon Chataan formed on June 28, 2002, near the FSM, and for several days it meandered while producing heavy rainfall across the region. In <a href="Chuuk%20State">Chuuk</a>, a state in the FSM, the highest 24-hour precipitation total was 506 mm (19.9 in), which was greater than the average monthly total. The rain produced floods up to deep, causing deadly landslides across the island that killed 47 people; this made Chataan the deadliest natural disaster in the island's history. There was also one death on nearby <a href="Pohnpei">Pohnpei</a>, and damage in the FSM totaled over $100 million.

After affecting the FSM, Chataan began a northwest track as an intensifying typhoon. Its eye passed just north of Guam on July 4, though the eyewall moved across the island and dropped heavy rainfall. Totals were highest in southern Guam, peaking at 536 mm (21.1 in). Flooding and landslides from the storm severely damaged or destroyed 1,994 houses. Damage on the island totaled $60.5 million, and there were 23 injuries. The typhoon also affected <a href="Rota%20%28island%29">Rota</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a> with gusty winds and light rainfall. Typhoon Chataan attained its peak intensity of 175 km/h (110 mph) on July 8. It weakened while turning to the north, and after diminishing to a tropical storm, Chataan struck eastern Japan on July 10. High rainfall, peaking at , flooded 10,270 houses. Damage in Japan totaled about $500 million (¥59 billion JPY).
The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on July 5 near the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>, near where Chataan originated. For much of its duration, Halong moved toward the northwest, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm. Early on July 10, Halong passed just south of Guam as a tropical storm, according to the JMA, although the JTWC assessed it as a typhoon near the island. It had threatened to strike the island less than a week after Chataan's damaging landfall, and although Halong remained south of Guam, it produced high waves and gusty winds on the island. The storm disrupted relief efforts following Chataan, causing additional power outages but little damage.

After affecting Guam, Halong quickly strengthened into a typhoon and reached its peak winds on July 12. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), while the JMA estimated 10-minute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). The typhoon weakened greatly while curving to the northeast, although its winds caused widespread power outages on Okinawa. Halong struck southeastern Japan, dropping heavy rainfall and producing strong winds that left $89.8 million (¥10.3 billion JPY) in damage. There was one death in the country and nine injuries. Halong became <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> on July 16 and dissipated the next day.

A circulation formed on July 7 in the South China Sea, with associated convection located to the south. Outflow increased as the system became better organized, and late on July 7 a tropical depression formed to the southwest of Taiwan. A ridge located over the Philippines caused the system to track northeastward. Early on July 9, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Nakri near western Taiwan. It was a small storm, and while moving along the northern portion of the island, Nakri weakened as its convection diminished. However, it intensified while moving away from Taiwan, reaching peak winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) on July 10. The monsoon trough turned Nakri to the east for two days, until a weakening ridge turned it to the north on July 12. That day, the storm passed just west of Okinawa, and shortly thereafter Nakri weakened to a tropical depression, after experiencing cooler waters and increasing shear. On July 13, Nakri dissipated west of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>.

While passing over Taiwan, Nakri dropped heavy rainfall that reached at <a href="Pengjia%20Islet">Pengjia Islet</a>. A total of fell in one day at the <a href="Feitsui%20Dam">Feitsui Dam</a>, representing the highest daily total at that point in the year. Taiwan had experienced drought conditions prior to earlier Typhoon Rammasun, and additional rainfall from Nakri eliminated all remaining water restrictions. Airline flights were canceled throughout the region due to the storm, and some schools and offices were closed. Nakri killed one fisherman and a shipworker during its passage. High rains also affected southeastern China, and later Okinawa. The storm induced heavy rainfall in the Philippines, as well as in Japan, where landslides and flooding were reported along a cold front.
The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on July 13, which quickly intensified due to its small size. By July 15, Fengshen attained typhoon status, and after initially moving to the north, it began a movement toward the northwest. On July 18, the typhoon reached peak 10-minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph), according to the JMA, making it the strongest storm of the season. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 270 km/h (165 mph), and the agency estimated that Fengshen was a super typhoon for five days. This broke the record for longest duration at that intensity, previously set by <a href="Typhoon%20Joan%20%281997%29">Typhoon Joan</a> in 1997, and later tied by <a href="Typhoon%20Ioke">Typhoon Ioke</a> in 2006.

While near peak intensity, Typhoon Fengshen underwent the <a href="Fujiwhara%20effect">Fujiwhara effect</a> with <a href="Typhoon%20Fung-wong%20%28Kaka%29">Typhoon Fung-wong</a>, causing the latter storm to loop to its south. Fengshen gradually weakened while approaching Japan, and it crossed over the country's <a href="%C5%8Csumi%20Islands">Ōsumi Islands</a> on July 25 as a <a href="Typhoon%20scales">severe tropical storm</a>. When the typhoon washed a freighter ashore, four people drowned and the remaining fifteen were rescued. In the country, Fengshen dropped heavy rainfall and produced heavy rains, causing mudslides, $4 million (¥475 million JPY) in crop damage, and one death. After affecting Japan, Fengshen weakened in the <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a> to a tropical depression, before moving across China's <a href="Shandong%20Peninsula">Shandong Peninsula</a> and dissipating on July 28.

On July 16, an area of convection increased northwest of Palau with a weak circulation. Moderate shear dispersed the thunderstorms, although the system gradually organized. It tracked northwestward due to a ridge to the north, becoming a tropical depression on July 18. PAGASA gave the system the local name "Juan", and the JTWC classified it as Tropical Depression 13W, although the JMA did not classify it as a tropical storm. Early on July 19, the depression struck <a href="Samar%20Island">Samar Island</a> in the Philippines, and continued northwestward through the archipelago. An increase in convection the next day prompted the JTWC to upgrade the system to a tropical storm before it moved over Luzon and the <a href="Metro%20Manila">Metro Manila</a> area. Increasing shear and disrupted outflow due to land interaction weakened the system, and the JTWC discontinued advisories on July 22. PAGASA continued tracking the system until the following day.

The depression dropped heavy rainfall in the Philippines during its passage, only weeks after several consecutive tropical systems caused deadly flooding in the country. The rains forced 2,400 people to evacuate. Storm-related tornadoes and landslides killed at least three people. Three people were electrocuted, and flash flooding killed at least two people. In all, Tropical Depression Juan killed 14 people and injured two others. There were 583 houses that were damaged or destroyed, and damage totaled about $240,000 (₱12.1 million PHP), mostly on Luzon.

A small circulation formed northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands on July 18. Later that day, the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression. Convection and outflow increased the next day, and the system moved slowly westward due to a ridge over Japan. After further organization, the JTWC initiated advisories on July 20 while the depression was just southwest of <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a>. Shortly thereafter, the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Fung-Wong. On July 22, the storm began undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with the larger Typhoon Fengshen to the east, causing Fung-wong to turn southwestward. Around that time, the storm entered PAGASA's region, earning it the local name "Kaka". Fung-wong quickly intensified after developing a small eye, becoming a typhoon on July 23, with peak winds of 130 km/h (80 mph). It turned to the south and later southeast while interacting with the larger Fengshen, which passed north of it. On July 25, the typhoon weakened to a severe tropical storm while at the southernmost point of its track. The storm turned to the north and completed a large loop between the Ryukyu and Northern Marianas Islands that day. The combination of cooler waters, wind shear, and dry air caused weakening, and the storm deteriorated into a tropical depression on July 27. Passing a short distance south of Kyushu, Fung-wong dissipated later that day.

The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Japan, reaching at a station in <a href="Miyazaki%20Prefecture">Miyazaki Prefecture</a>. The rains caused two landslides and resulted in delays to bus and train systems, as well as cancellations to ferry and airline routes. There was also minor crop damage.

A tropical disturbance developed on July 17 in the Central Pacific Ocean, near the International Date Line. Deep convection with outflow persisted around a circulation, and at 06:00 UTC on July 20 the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression, just east of the date line and about 980 km (610 mi) west-southwest of <a href="Johnston%20Atoll">Johnston Atoll</a>. The system crossed the line shortly thereafter and quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Kalmaegi. The JMA classified the system as a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained it as a tropical depression. Kalmaegi moved northwestward due to a ridge to the north, and initially a <a href="tropical%20upper%20tropospheric%20trough">tropical upper tropospheric trough</a> provided favorable conditions. However, the trough soon increased wind shear and restricted outflow, which caused quick weakening. The thunderstorms diminished from the circulation, and around 12:00 UTC on July 22, Kalmaegi dissipated about 30 hours after forming.
A large <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoonal system</a> persisted toward the end of July 2002 near the Philippines. On August 2, a tropical depression formed off the northwest coast of Luzon and moved west-northwestward. Late on August 3, it intensified into Tropical Storm Kammuri off the coast of <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. A weakening ridge turned the storm northward toward the coast of China. Tropical Storm Kammuri made landfall late on August 4, after reaching peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). The system dissipated over the mountainous coastline of eastern China and merged with a cold front on August 7.

High rainfall from Kammuri affected large portions of China, particularly in <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a> province where it moved ashore. In Hong Kong, the rains caused a landslide and damaged a road. Two dams were destroyed in Guangdong by the flooding, and 10 people were killed by a landslide. Throughout the province, over 100,000 people had to evacuate due to flooding, and after 6,810 houses were destroyed. The floods damaged roads, railroads, and tunnels, and left power and water outages across the region. Rainfall was beneficial in alleviating drought conditions in Guangdong, although further inland the rains occurred after months of deadly flooding. In Hunan Province, the storm's remnants merged with a cold front and destroyed 12,400 houses. Across its path, the floods damaged or destroyed 245,000 houses, and destroyed about 60 hectares (150 acres) of crop fields. Kammuri and its remnants killed 153 people, and damage was estimated at $509 million (¥4.219 billion CNY).

A tropical depression developed on August 10 east of the Philippines. Initially it was disorganized due to hostile conditions, and it failed to intensify significantly before crossing the Philippine island of Luzon. There, flooding forced 3,500 people to evacuate their homes. In the Philippines, the storm killed 35 people and caused $3.3 million in damage, with 13,178 houses damaged or destroyed. It was the final storm named by PAGASA during the season.

After affecting the Philippines, the tropical depression moved into the South China Sea and dissipated on August 14. During the next day, despite separate systems, the remnants of 18W formed another system which would later intensify into <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Vongfong%20%282002%29">Tropical Storm Vongfong</a>.

The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on August 11, just west of <a href="Ujelang%20Atoll">Ujelang Atoll</a>. It moved generally northwestward due to a ridge to the north, quickly intensifying into Tropical Storm Phanfone by August 12. With good outflow and developing rainbands, the storm continued to strengthen, becoming a typhoon on August 14. Phanfone developed a well-defined eye, surrounded by deep convection. On August 15, the JMA estimated 10-minute winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), and the JTWC estimated 1-minute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it a super typhoon. Diminished outflow and an <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a> caused weakening, and it passed near Iwo Jima on August 16. Phanfone turned to the northeast two days later due to a weakening ridge, and dry air caused rapid deterioration. Passing southeast of Japan, it fell to tropical storm status on August 19 before becoming extratropical the next day; the remnants continued to the northeast and crossed the International Date Line on August 25.

Wind gusts on Iwo Jima reached 168 km/h (105 mph). Rainfall in mainland Japan peaked at near <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, and the typhoon flooded 43 houses. High rains caused road damage and landslides, as well as some aquaculture damage. The storm caused 22 ferry routes and 10 flights to be canceled, and temporarily shut down refineries near Tokyo. On the offshore island of <a href="Hachij%C5%8D-jima">Hachijō-jima</a>, high winds caused a temporary power outage.
A tropical depression formed in the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> during August 15 from the remnants of 18W. It moved northwestward, strengthening into Tropical Storm Vongfong on August 18. It brushed eastern <a href="Hainan">Hainan</a> before making <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on August 19 in southern China near <a href="Wuchuan%2C%20Guangdong">Wuchuan, Guangdong</a>. Soon after the circulation dissipated, it dropped heavy rainfall across the region. One person died in a traffic accident in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, and landslides killed twelve people. The storm destroyed 6,000 houses, mostly in Guangdong, and damage in the country totaled at least $86 million.
Typhoon Rusa developed on August 22 from the monsoon trough in the open Pacific Ocean, well to the southeast of Japan. For several days, Rusa moved to the northwest, eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon. The JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), and the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 215 km/h (135 mph). On August 26, the storm moved across the <a href="Amami%20Islands">Amami Islands</a> of Japan, where Rusa left 20,000 people without power and caused two fatalities. Across Japan, the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at in <a href="Tokushima%20Prefecture">Tokushima Prefecture</a>.

After weakening slightly, Rusa made landfall on <a href="Goheung">Goheung</a>, South Korea with 10-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a>. Rusa weakened while moving through the country, dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at in <a href="Gangneung">Gangneung</a>. A 24-hour total of in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country; however, the heaviest rainfall was localized. Over 17,000 houses were damaged, and large areas of crop fields were flooded. In South Korea, Rusa killed at least 233 people, making it the deadliest typhoon in over 43 years, and caused $4.2 billion in damage. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea, leaving 26,000 people homeless and killing three. Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country, which was already affected by ongoing famine conditions. The typhoon became extratropical over eastern Russia on September 1, dissipating three days later.
Sinlaku formed on August 27 northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands. After initially moving to the north, it began a generally westward motion that it maintained for the rest of its duration. Sinlaku strengthened into a typhoon and attained its peak winds on August 31. Over the next few days, it fluctuated slightly in intensity while moving over or near several Japanese islands. On September 4, the typhoon's eye crossed over Okinawa. It dropped heavy rainfall and produced strong winds that left over 100,000 people without power. Damage on the island was estimated at $14.3 million, including $3.6 million in damage to <a href="Kadena%20Air%20Base">Kadena Air Base</a>.

After affecting Okinawa, Sinlaku threatened northern Taiwan, which had been affected by two deadly typhoons in the previous year. Damage ended up being minimal on the island, although two people were killed. Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near <a href="Wenzhou">Wenzhou</a> on September 7. The storm produced a record wind gust there of 204 km/h (127 mph), and just south of the city, high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat. High rainfall and winds from Sinlaku wrecked 58,000 houses, and large areas of crops were destroyed. Damage in China was estimated at $709 million, and there were 28 deaths there.

An eastern extension of the monsoon trough southwest of Hawaii organized into Tropical Depression Two-C on August 27 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Ele six hours later. Despite the nearby presence of Alika, Ele developed rapidly and strengthened into a hurricane on August 28. After contributing to the demise of Alika, Ele intensified to winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) before crossing the International Date Line on August 30.

Reclassified as a typhoon, Ele moved north-northwestward due to a weakness in the ridge to the north. Early on August 31, the JTWC estimated the storm's peak 1-minute winds at 165 km/h (105 mph). On September 2, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) while Ele was northeast of <a href="Wake%20Atoll">Wake Atoll</a>. The typhoon turned to the northeast due to an approaching trough, although Ele resumed its previous north-northwest motion after a ridge built behind the trough. It gradually weakened due to cooler waters and increasing wind shear, and on September 6 Ele deteriorated below typhoon status. The thunderstorms became detached from the circulation, causing Ele to weaken to a tropical depression late on September 9. By that time, it began moving to the northeast, and on September 10 it transitioned into an extratropical storm. The remnants of Ele continued to the northeast until moving back into the central Pacific as an extratropical storm on September 11 and dissipating on September 13.

An area of convection developed on September 8 to the northeast of Luzon. Moving to the west due to a ridge to the north, it slowly organized, forming into a tropical depression on September 9 in the South China Sea. As it approached southeastern China, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hagupit and reached peak winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). At around 19:00 UTC on September 11, the storm made landfall west of <a href="Macau">Macau</a> and quickly weakened into a tropical depression. The JTWC promptly discontinued advisories, although the JMA continued tracking Hagupit over land. The remnants executed a loop over Guangdong before moving offshore and dissipating on September 16 near Hong Kong.

Hagupit dropped heavy rainfall along the coast of China for several days, peaking at in Zhanjiang City. The rains flooded widespread areas of crop fields and resulted in landslides. In Guangdong, 330 houses were destroyed, and damage was estimated at $32.5 million. In Hong Kong, 32 people were injured due to the storm, and 41 flights were canceled. In <a href="Fuzhou">Fuzhou</a> in Fujian Province, thunderstorms related to Hagupit flooded hundreds of houses. Further west in Jiangxi, floods from the storm destroyed 3,800 houses, ruined 180 bridges, and killed 25. Offshore, a helicopter rescued the crew of 25 from a sunken boat during the storm.

An area of thunderstorms increased near the FSM on September 15 within the monsoon trough. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, its convection was intermittent around a weak circulation. On September 18, the JTWC issued a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a> (TCFA), and the JMA classified the system as a tropical depression; however, the two warning agencies were tracking different circulations within the same system, and by September 19 the circulation JMA was tracking became the dominant system. Shortly thereafter, the agency downgraded the system to a low pressure area after it weakened. The next day, JMA again upgraded the system to a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued a second TCFA when the system had a partially exposed circulation near an area of increasing convection. Late on September 21, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Changmi to the south of Japan. The next day, Changmi attained peak winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). However, the JTWC noted that the system was absorbing dry air and becoming extratropical, and thus did not issue warnings on the storm. Moving northeastward, Changmi became an extratropical cyclone on September 22, and gradually became more intense until crossing the International Date Line early on September 25.

An elongated trough with associated convection developed in the South China Sea by September 21. Light shear and increasing outflow allowed the system to become better organized, and it formed into a tropical depression on September 22 between Vietnam and Luzon. A ridge to the northeast allowed the system to track northwestward. For several days the depression failed to organize further, despite favorable conditions; however, late on September 24 the circulation developed rainbands and a weak eye feature. Early the next day, the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Mekkhala, which quickly intensified to a peak intensity of 85 km/h (50 mph). At around 12:00 UTC on September 25, Mekkhala made landfall on western Hainan near peak intensity. Soon after, it moved into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tonkin">Gulf of Tonkin</a> and weakened due to land interaction and increasing shear. Mekkhala remained a weak tropical storm until September 28, when it weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated soon after in the extreme northern portion of the Gulf of Tonkin.

Mekkhala dropped heavy rainfall along its path, peaking at in <a href="Sanya">Sanya</a>, Hainan. Along the island, high winds washed ashore or sank 20 boats, and 84 fishermen were rescued. Throughout Hainan, the high rains wrecked 2,500 houses and left $80.5 million in damage. High rains spread into southwestern China, particularly in Guangxi. In <a href="Beihai">Beihai</a>, the storm destroyed 335 houses, resulting in $22 million in damage.
Typhoon Higos developed on September 25 east of the Northern Marianas Islands. It tracked west-northwestward for its first few days, steadily intensifying into a powerful typhoon by September 29. Higos weakened and turned to the north-northeast toward Japan, making landfall in that country's <a href="Kanagawa%20Prefecture">Kanagawa Prefecture</a> on October 1. Shortly thereafter, it crossed over Tokyo, becoming the third strongest typhoon to do so since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It weakened while crossing <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a>, and shortly after striking <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a> on October 2, Higos became extratropical. The remnants passed over <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> and dissipated on October 4.

Before striking Japan, Higos produced strong winds in the Northern Marianas Islands while passing to their north. These winds damaged the food supply on two islands. Later, Higos moved across Japan with wind gusts as strong as 161 km/h (100 mph), including record gusts at several locations. A total of 608,130 buildings in the country were left without power, and two people were electrocuted in the storm's aftermath. The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 346 mm (13.6 in). The rains flooded houses across the country and caused mudslides. High waves washed 25 boats ashore and killed one person along the coast. Damage in the country totaled $2.14 billion (¥261 billion JPY), and there were five deaths. Later, the remnants of Higos affected the Russian Far East, killing seven people in two shipwrecks near Primorsky Krai.

A tropical disturbance organized within the monsoon trough in early October near the FSM. The convection gradually consolidated around a single circulation, developing into a tropical depression on October 8. Wind shear was weak and outflow was good, which allowed for slow strengthening; however, the system was elongated, with a separate circulation to the west. Around this time, the system produced gale-force winds on <a href="Kosrae">Kosrae</a> in the FSM. Late on October 9, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bavi to the east of Guam, although it was still a broad system at the time. After becoming a tropical storm, Bavi moved generally northward due to a ridge retreating to the northeast. By October 11, winds were fairly weak near the center and were stronger in outer rainbands. That day, the JMA estimated peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph). Despite the broad structure, with an exposed circulation at the peak, the JTWC estimated winds as high as 130 km/h (80 mph), making Bavi a typhoon. Shortly after reaching peak winds, the storm turned to the northeast and entered the westerlies. Increasing shear weakened the convection, and Bavi became extratropical on October 13. It continued to the northeast and crossed into the Central Pacific on October 16.

On October 25, an organized area of convection persisted southeast of <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a>. With minimal wind shear, it quickly developed a circulation, becoming a tropical depression on October 26. Due to a ridge to the east, it moved generally northwestward and slowly intensified. Late on October 27, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Maysak. Initially, the system absorbed nearby dry air, although the storm was able to continue developing deep convection. An approaching trough turned Maysak to the northeast, and on October 29 it reached peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph), according to the JMA. On two occasions, the JTWC assessed Maysak as briefly intensifying into a typhoon, based on an eye feature, although increased shear later caused weakening. Continuing to the northeast, Maysak moved into the central Pacific Ocean on October 30, by which time it had become extratropical.

In the central Pacific Ocean, a tropical depression developed in the monsoon trough on October 24 to the south of Hawaii. It moved generally west-northwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Huko on October 26. It became a hurricane two days later, and briefly weakened back to tropical storm status before becoming a hurricane again on October 31. On November 3, Huko crossed the International Date Line into the western Pacific. Despite favorable inflow patterns and warm sea surface temperatures, Huko only strengthened to reach peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). It moved quickly to the west-northwest due to a strong ridge to its north. Dry air caused Huko to weaken slightly, and on November 4 the typhoon passed about 95 km (60 mi) northeast of Wake Island. The typhoon brought heavy rains and winds gusts of to the island. Huko moved through a weakness in the ridge, resulting in a turn to the north and northeast. Late on November 5, Huko weakened below typhoon status, and increasing shear caused further weakening. On November 7, Huko became extratropical, and later that day its remnants crossed back into the central Pacific. Several days later, the remnants affected northern California.

In the middle of November, an area of thunderstorms developed southwest of Chuuk in the FSM within the monsoon trough. With weak shear and good outflow, it slowly organized, becoming a tropical depression on November 20. It moved quickly to the west-northwest, intensifying into Tropical Storm Haishen late on November 20 to the southeast of Guam. While passing south of the island, Haishen produced gale-force winds. The convection organized into a <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a> and developed an eye feature. Early on November 23, Haishen intensified into a typhoon; around that time, it began moving to the north due to an approaching trough. The typhoon quickly intensified to peak winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). Soon after, Haishen began weakening due to increasing shear, and the eye quickly dissipated. Late on November 24, it weakened below typhoon status, and early on November 25 Haishen became extratropical. The remnants continued to the northeast, dissipating on November 26.
Typhoon Pongsona was the last typhoon of the season, and was the second costliest disaster in 2002 in the United States and its territories. It formed on December 2, having originated as an area of convection to the east-southeast of Pohnpei in late November. With a ridge to the north, the depression tracked generally westward for several days, intensifying into Tropical Storm Pongsona on December 3. After an eye developed on December 5, the storm attained typhoon status to the north of Chuuk. Steady intensification continued, until it became more rapid on December 8 while approaching Guam. That day, the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph), and the JTWC estimated peak winds of 240 km/h (150 mph), making Pongsona a super typhoon. Around its peak intensity, the eye of the typhoon moved over Guam and Rota. After striking Guam, Pongsona began moving to the north and later to the northeast, quickly weakening due to the presence of dry air and interaction with an approaching mid-latitude storm. After the convection diminished over the center, Pongsona became extratropical early on December 11. Early the next day, it dissipated east of Japan.

On Guam, Pongsona was the third most intense typhoon on record to strike the island, with wind gusts reaching 278 km/h (173 mph). Damage totaled $700 million, making it one of the five costliest storms on Guam. The typhoon injured 193 people and killed one person. In addition to its strong winds, Pongsona dropped torrential rainfall that peaked at . A total of 1,751 houses were destroyed on Guam, and another 6,740 were damaged to some degree. Widespread areas lost water, and the road system was heavily damaged. On neighboring Rota, Pongsona damaged 460 houses and destroyed 114, causing an additional $30 million in damage. Both Guam and the Northern Marianas Islands were declared federal disaster areas, which made federal funding available for repairing storm damage. In Guam, the federal government provided about $125 million in funding for individuals and other programs.
On February 15, a weak tropical depression developed east of Mindanao, according to the JMA; by the next day, the system dissipated. In the beginning of April, a tropical disturbance developed along the southern end of a <a href="Shear%20line%20%28meteorology%29">stationary cold front</a> west of <a href="Enewetak%20Atoll">Enewetak Atoll</a>. While gradually organizing, the system produced gale-force wind gusts in the FSM. On April 5, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 04W. The system moved northwestward due to a nearby extratropical storm, which later caused the depression to also become extratropical about 650 km (405 mi) west-southwest of Wake Atoll. The JMA issued its last advisory on April 8.

A tropical depression formed in the South China Sea on May 28, given the name "Dagul" by PAGASA. The JTWC never anticipated significant strengthening, and the system largely consisted of convection displaced to the southeast of a broad circulation. A ridge to the southeast steered the depression to the northeast, and on May 30 the depression made landfall in southwestern Taiwan. The combination of land interaction and wind shear caused dissipation that day.

The JMA monitored a tropical depression east of Iwo Jima on July 25, although by the next day the agency was no longer tracking the system. On August 3, a small circulation was located just off the southeast coast of Japan, which later developed an area of convection over it. The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 17W at 06:00 UTC on August 5, describing the system as a "midget cyclone". A mid-level ridge to the southeast steered the depression eastward away from Japan. Unfavorable conditions caused weakening, and the JTWC discontinued advisories six hours after its first warning. Another tropical depression formed on September 21 to the northeast of the Marshall Islands, but dissipated by the next day.

Three non-developing depressions formed in October. The first was classified as a depression by the JMA on October 12 in the South China Sea. It quickly dissipated, although the system dropped heavy rainfall reaching at a station in the <a href="Paracel%20Islands">Paracel Islands</a>. The second, classified as Tropical Depression 27W by the JTWC, formed on October 17 about 1,220 km (760 mi) east-northeast of Saipan. It moved westward due to a ridge to the north, and failed to intensify due to weak outflow and dry air. It dissipated on October 19. The day before, another depression formed near the International Date Line. Classified as Tropical Depression 28W by the JTWC, it moved generally northward due to a break in the ridge. Wind shear dissipated the depression on October 20.

Within the western Pacific Ocean, both the JMA and PAGASA assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the basin, which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names. As part of its duty as a <a href="Regional%20Specialized%20Meteorological%20Center">Regional Specialized Meteorological Center</a> (RSMC), the JMA's Typhoon Center in Tokyo assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a>'s Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph). The PAGASA assigns names to all tropical cyclones that move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility, located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N, even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Philippine%20typhoon%20names">PAGASA</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Pacific%20typhoon%20names">Typhoon Committee</a>. PAGASA also has an auxiliary naming list, of which the first ten are published, should their list of names be exhausted.

During the season 24 named tropical cyclones developed in the Western Pacific and were named by the Japan Meteorological Agency, when it was determined that they had become tropical storms. These names were contributed to a list of a 140 names submitted by the fourteen members nations and territories of the <a href="ESCAP/WMO%20Typhoon%20Committee">ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee</a>.

Two central pacific storms, Hurricane Ele 02C and Hurricane Huko 03C, crossed into this basin. They became Typhoon Ele and Typhoon Huko, keeping their original name and "C" suffix in their warnings by JTWC.

The <a href="Philippine%20Atmospheric%2C%20Geophysical%20and%20Astronomical%20Services%20Administration">Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration</a> uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility. PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility, and the lists are reused every four years. Names that were not assigned are marked in .

The names "Chataan", "Rusa", and "Pongsona" were retired by the WMO's Typhoon Committee. The names "Matmo", "Nuri", and "Noul" were chosen to replace "Chataan", "Rusa" and "Pongsona" respectively.

The following table does not include unnamed storms, and PAGASA names are in parenthesis. Storms entering from the Central Pacific only include their information while in the western Pacific, and are noted with an asterisk *.

Capon Chapel

Capon Chapel ( ), also historically known as Capon Baptist Chapel and Capon Chapel Church, is a mid-19th century <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist</a> church located near to the town of <a href="Capon%20Bridge%2C%20West%20Virginia">Capon Bridge, West Virginia</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Capon Chapel is one of the oldest existing log churches in <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a>, along with <a href="Mount%20Bethel%20Church%20%28Three%20Churches%2C%20West%20Virginia%29">Mount Bethel Church</a> and <a href="Old%20Pine%20Church">Old Pine Church</a>.

A <a href="Baptists">Baptist</a> congregation was gathering at the site of the present-day church by at least 1756. <a href="Primitive%20Baptists">Primitive Baptist</a> minister John Monroe (1750–1824) is credited for establishing a place of worship at this site; he is <a href="burial">interred</a> in the church's cemetery. The land on which Capon Chapel was built originally belonged to William C. Nixon (1789–1869), a member of the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a>; later, it was transferred to the Pugh family. The first documented mention of a church at the Capon Chapel site was in March 1852, when Joseph Pugh allocated the land to three trustees for the construction of a church and cemetery.

During the early years of Capon Chapel, no <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> denomination was the exclusive owner or occupant, and the church was probably utilized as a "union church" for worship by any Christian denomination. Capon Chapel was used as a place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. In the 1890s, Capon Chapel was added as a place of worship on the Capon Bridge <a href="Governance%20of%20the%20British%20Methodist%20Church">Methodist circuit</a> of the <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%2C%20South">Southern Methodist Episcopal Church</a>. As of 2017, Capon Chapel remains a Methodist church, now a part of the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a>, holding Methodist services four Sundays per month at 1pm. Open table communion is held on the first Sunday of each month. Capon Chapel also maintains a daily devotion hotline.

Capon Chapel's cemetery is surrounded by a <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> fence made by <a href="Stewart%20Iron%20Works">Stewart Iron Works</a>, and contains the remains of John Monroe, William C. Nixon, <a href="West%20Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">West Virginia House of Delegates</a> member Captain David Pugh (1806–1899), <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> veterans from the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, and free and enslaved <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s. Capon Chapel, along with its cemetery, was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on December 12, 2012, in recognition of its representation of the rural religious architecture of the <a href="Potomac%20Highlands%20of%20West%20Virginia">Potomac Highlands</a> region, and for its service as an important rural church in Hampshire County.

Capon Chapel and its associated cemetery are located to the east Christian Church Road (West Virginia Secondary Route 13), approximately south of <a href="Capon%20Bridge%2C%20West%20Virginia">Capon Bridge</a> and northeast of the <a href="unincorporated%20community">unincorporated community</a> of <a href="Bubbling%20Spring%2C%20West%20Virginia">Bubbling Spring</a> in southeastern <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a>. Capon Chapel is east of the <a href="Cacapon%20River">Cacapon River</a>, from which the church derives its name. The church and cemetery are situated atop a grassy hill on a plot of land, at an elevation of , in a rural agricultural area within the Cacapon River Valley. <a href="Dillons%20Mountain">Dillons Mountain</a>, a forested and narrow <a href="Anticline">anticlinal</a> mountain ridge, rises to the west of the Cacapon River Valley, while the forested, rolling foothills of the anticlinal <a href="Timber%20Ridge">Timber Ridge</a> rise to the valley's east.

The church and cemetery are accessible through a gravel driveway to the north; to the west, a cluster of tall <a href="oak">oak</a> trees blocks access to the road. Capon Chapel is landscaped with <a href="Buxus">boxwoods</a> on its north and south sides, a single <a href="holly">holly</a> on its east side, and <a href="forsythia">forsythia</a>s along its west side. The Capon Chapel property consists of the church structure (c. 1852), and its associated cemetery, which is enclosed partly by the historic wrought iron fence and partly by a chain link fence. A flagpole stands at the center of the cemetery's eastern perimeter.

The land upon which Capon Chapel is located was originally part of the <a href="Northern%20Neck%20Proprietary">Northern Neck Proprietary</a>, a land grant that the exiled <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the <a href="Interregnum%20%28England%29">English Interregnum</a>. Following the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> in 1660, Charles II finally ascended to the English throne. Charles II renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantee <a href="Thomas%20Colepeper%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Colepeper">Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper</a> and <a href="Henry%20Bennet%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arlington">Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington</a> in 1672. In 1681, Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, and Lord Colepeper received a new charter for the entire land grant from <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%206th%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron">Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron</a> in 1719.

Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was predominantly inhabited by English-speaking settlers as early as the late 1730s. The majority of these settlers had come from <a href="Province%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, many of whom were either <a href="Quakers">Quakers</a> or former Quakers who were attracted to the <a href="Baptists">Baptist</a> and <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> denominations.

The <a href="List%20of%20Baptist%20denominations">Baptists</a> established the oldest extant churches in Hampshire County. After the end of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Baptist preachers continued their attempt to gain a foothold in what is now the <a href="Eastern%20Panhandle%20of%20West%20Virginia">Eastern Panhandle</a> region. During the Baptists' early growth in Hampshire County, the best known Baptist ministers were John Monroe (1750–1824) and Benjamin Stone (1743–1842). Monroe preached at the North River, Crooked Run, and Patterson's Creek churches during the early 19th century. According to historians <a href="Hu%20Maxwell">Hu Maxwell</a> and <a href="Howard%20Llewellyn%20Swisher">Howard Llewellyn Swisher</a> in "History of Hampshire County, West Virginia" (1897), Monroe was a minister for <a href="Primitive%20Baptists">Primitive Baptists</a>, who were adherent to a strict interpretation of the <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> theology of the Ketocton Association. Monroe probably established a Baptist church on the site of the present-day Capon Chapel, where he is buried in the church's cemetery. However, other sources claim that a Baptist congregation began gathering at the Capon Chapel site as early as 1756.

Increased settlement and the arrival of other religious denominations in the Cacapon River Valley were further facilitated following the completion of the <a href="Northwestern%20Turnpike">Northwestern Turnpike</a> in the 1830s, which connected <a href="Parkersburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Parkersburg</a> with <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">Winchester</a>. A small community began to develop near the turnpike's Cacapon River crossing, north of Capon Chapel's present-day location. The community later became the town of Capon Bridge.

The land on which Capon Chapel was built belonged to William C. Nixon (1789–1869), a member of the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a>. Nixon's mother-in-law, Elizabeth Caudy (1773–1816), was the first person to be buried in the church's cemetery. While various sources estimate that Capon Chapel was built around the 1750s, there is no physical or documentary evidence to support this claim. The first documented mention of a church at the Capon Chapel site was in March 1852, when Joseph Pugh allocated 88 and one-half poles, or approximately , to three trustees: David Pugh, another David Pugh, and Robert Pugh. The Pugh family, which was of Welsh descent, were early settlers in the Cacapon River Valley, and were one of the families that came from Wales through Pennsylvania in the late 17th century. The grant's deed told the trustees to conceive "a Graveyard and for a house for the Public Worship of Almighty God for the use of all orthodox Christians", and specified that the land was only to be used for religious worship and "for no other purpose". The deed further stipulated that inheritors of the land had to be Pugh's descendants.

During the church's early years, no <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> denomination was the exclusive owner or occupant of Capon Chapel, which indicates that the church was probably utilized as a "union church" for worship by any Christian denomination. Since no single denomination oversaw the church during this early period, few records of its early activities and construction exist. Later records suggest that Capon Chapel was used as a place of worship by Baptists until the late 19th or early 20th century. While it remains unclear why or how the church became associated with the Baptists, its use by the denomination is possibly associated with the <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a>, a Protestant revival movement during the early-to-mid 19th century that gained momentum throughout the United States. According to the December 1904 issue of "The Baptist Home Mission Monthly", the Baptist Little Cacapon Church contributed one dollar to the general fund of Capon Chapel, demonstrating that the Baptist community still continued to operate from or associate with the church in 1904.

In addition to the Baptist faith, Methodists started coming to the Cacapon River Valley during the latter half of the 18th century. <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a> <a href="Circuit%20rider%20%28religious%29">circuit rider</a> <a href="Francis%20Asbury">Francis Asbury</a> traveled through the Capon Bridge area in 1781. In 1890, the <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church%2C%20South">Southern Methodist Episcopal Church</a> established its presence in the Capon Bridge area under the leadership of G. O. Homan. According to Maxwell and Swisher, the Capon Bridge <a href="Governance%20of%20the%20British%20Methodist%20Church">Methodist circuit</a> consisted of the following places in 1897: Capon Bridge, <a href="North%20River%20Mills%2C%20West%20Virginia">North River Mills</a>, Green Mound, <a href="Augusta%2C%20West%20Virginia">Augusta</a>, <a href="Sedan%2C%20West%20Virginia">Sedan</a>, Park's Hollow, Sandy Ridge, and Capon Chapel. Capon Chapel was not commonly used as a Baptist place of worship by the early 20th century, and developed into a permanent stop along the Capon Bridge Methodist circuit, which later grew to include Central Church at <a href="Loom%2C%20West%20Virginia">Loom</a> and Bethel Church at <a href="Neals%20Run%2C%20West%20Virginia">Neals Run</a>. In 1976, the circuit's pastor was Thomas Malcolm.

Capon Chapel remains a Methodist church, now a part of the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a>. As of 2015, Capon Chapel's congregation numbers five. The church's Methodist circuit pastor is M. Christopher Duckworth; and it offers services four Sundays a month. A small group of committed congregants maintain the historic church and cemetery grounds. Brenda Hiett is the church's caretaker, as of 2015. Throughout its existence, Capon Chapel has been known by various names, including "Capon Baptist Chapel" and "Capon Chapel Church".

According to the church's caretaker, Brenda Hiett, the church's roof and siding were installed around 1900. A wrought iron fence, made by <a href="Stewart%20Iron%20Works">Stewart Iron Works</a> in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, was installed around the church's cemetery. <a href="Electrical%20conduit">Electrical conduit</a>s were added to the interior of the church when it was electrified around 1930, and further electrical updates were made in 2011. The church's perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s, and its wide, <a href="heart%20pine">heart pine</a> plank floors were sanded and re-lacquered. Around 1990, the Stewart Iron Works fence and gate were restored by <a href="White%E2%80%99s%20Ornamental%20Ironworks">White’s Ornamental Ironworks</a>.

In 2008, following surveys of historic properties throughout the county, the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission embarked upon an initiative to place structures and districts on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. The county received funding for the surveys from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History. Capon Chapel was one of the first of eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register. The other seven properties were <a href="Fort%20Kuykendall">Fort Kuykendall</a>, <a href="Hickory%20Grove%20%28Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia%29">Hickory Grove</a>, <a href="Hook%20Tavern">Hook Tavern</a>, <a href="North%20River%20Mills%20Historic%20District">North River Mills Historic District</a>, <a href="Old%20Pine%20Church">Old Pine Church</a>, <a href="Springfield%20Brick%20House">Springfield Brick House</a>, and <a href="Valley%20View%20%28Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia%29">Valley View</a>. According to the Hampshire County Commission's compliance officer, Charles Baker, places of worship were not typically selected for inclusion in the register; however, Capon Chapel and Old Pine Church were exceptions, because both "started out as meeting houses". Capon Chapel is among the earliest existing log churches in Hampshire County, along with <a href="Mount%20Bethel%20Church%20%28Three%20Churches%2C%20West%20Virginia%29">Mount Bethel Church</a> and Old Pine Church. Capon Chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, in recognition of its representation of the rural religious architecture of the <a href="Potomac%20Highlands%20of%20West%20Virginia">Potomac Highlands</a> region, and for its service as an important rural church in Hampshire County.

Capon Chapel is a single-story, rectangular, <a href="Gablefront%20house">front gable</a> <a href="log%20building">log building</a>, covered with white-painted wooden <a href="Clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a> siding, and topped with a green <a href="Metal%20roof">standing seam metal roof</a>, along with metal <a href="snow%20guard">snow guard</a>s.

The church's main façade is located on its east side, facing toward Timber Ridge, and away from the Cacapon River and Christian Church Road. The east side consists of a front gable façade of white-painted clapboard siding. The church has one entryway, which is a centrally-located, four-paneled wooden door, topped by wooden <a href="dentil">dentil</a> <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">molding</a> and a rectangular, four-light <a href="Transom%20%28architectural%29">transom</a> window. The transom is the only window on the church's east side. Unpainted wooden railings are on each side of the entryway. The clapboard siding on the church's east side is horizontal, and varies between in width. The overhanging <a href="eave">eave</a> of the church's roof is accentuated by a single wooden drop pendant at the top of the <a href="gable">gable</a>. The modern <a href="electricity%20meter">electricity meter</a> is located to the right of the main entrance. The non-loadbearing <a href="concrete%20masonry%20unit">concrete block</a> perimeter wall on this side is concealed by a <a href="stone%20veneer">stone veneer</a>.

The west elevation is covered with white-painted clapboarding and is undecorated, with the exception of an off-center concrete block chimney and a single drop pendant similar to the one located at the top of the gable. The concrete block perimeter foundation is visible on the south side of the church, as is the metal embankment doors that allow access to the church's basement.

The church's north and south sides consist of two symmetrically placed six-over-six <a href="Sash%20window">double-hung sash wooden windows</a>, along with operable green-painted <a href="louver">louver</a>ed wooden <a href="window%20shutter">window shutter</a>s. The clapboard sidings vary between in width. At the base of the church's north side, concrete blocks are visible under the foundation. On the church's south side, a small strip of the roof's eave confirms the original location of the chimney.

The interior of the church consists of a large, open floor plan, with wooden <a href="pew">pew</a>s lined perpendicular to the north and south sides, thus creating a central <a href="aisle">aisle</a>. The <a href="altar">altar</a> is a small wooden <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a>, which serves as a <a href="lectern">lectern</a> that is accessible by a small wooden step; the altar is accented by a large wooden backdrop of casing with dentil molding. Each of the church's interior walls is covered with <a href="pine">pine</a> <a href="Panelling">wainscot panelling</a> and wallpaper, and topped with wooden <a href="crown%20molding">crown molding</a>. Wooden <a href="Festoon">swag</a> moldings accentuate the four symmetrically-placed six-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows, the doorway's wooden casing, and the transom window. The wooden pews are simple, with cushions added for comfortable seating. The original ceiling is obscured by a <a href="dropped%20ceiling">dropped ceiling</a>, which also conceals the electrical conduits for the church's brass <a href="chandelier">chandelier</a>s. Prior to the church's electrification, <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a> lanterns were used for light, and the lanterns remain in the church for decorative purposes. The church's floor consists of the original heart pine planks. Concrete blocks and cut stone border the building's perimeter to prevent animals from entering the church's crawl space. Within the crawl space, log carrier beams support the building, on which the bark remains extant.

The cemetery is less than an acre in size and is located to the immediate east of the church, surrounded by a wrought iron fence manufactured by Stewart Iron Works. As of 2012, the cemetery contains approximately 270 <a href="burial">interments</a>, including John Monroe (1750–1824), Virginia House of Delegates member William C. Nixon (1789–1869), <a href="West%20Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">West Virginia House of Delegates</a> member Captain David Pugh (1806–1899), <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> veterans from the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, and free and enslaved <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s. Gertrude Ward (1896–1988), a local historian and orchardist, is also interred in the cemetery. Captain David Pugh was an elected representative Hampshire County, who voted to secede from the Union in 1861.

Older <a href="gravestone">gravestone</a>s in the cemetery are generally cut from <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, and the gravestones placed after 1900 are predominantly made of polished <a href="granite">granite</a>. Most of the gravestones have weathered significantly. The gravestones are generally rounded or rectangular in shape, and are placed on small stone foundations. The gravestones of prominent local leaders are more ornate in character, including that of Captain David Pugh and his family, who are buried under a large <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a> that lists the names of his three wives and their respective children. Nixon's gravestone is deteriorating due to advanced weathering; it is made of limestone and contains a carving of an open book. Following the purchase of a rectangular land tract around 1990, the cemetery was expanded on the east side. This section of the cemetery is excluded from the church's historically-recognized boundaries, as it was not associated with the church during the period of its greatest significance.

The cemetery perimeter is lined on three sides by a cast wrought iron fence, accessible by a gate in width at its western entryway. The wrought iron fence is in height, and has approximately diameter tubular fence posts, which are supported by three horizontal metal rails. The fence posts are capped with white-painted stylized arrows, with a ball at the tip. A shield with the emblem reading, "The Stewart Iron Works, Cincinnati, Ohio", is emblazoned on the fence's gate. The cemetery's eastern extension is surrounded by <a href="chain-link%20fencing">chain-link fencing</a>.

Kappa Kappa Psi

Kappa Kappa Psi, National Honorary Band Fraternity (ΚΚΨ, colloquially referred to as KKPsi), is a <a href="Fraternities%20and%20sororities">fraternity</a> for <a href="school%20band">college and university band</a> members in the United States. It was founded on November 27, 1919, on Thanksgiving Day, at Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, now known as <a href="Oklahoma%20State%20University">Oklahoma State University</a>, in <a href="Stillwater%2C%20Oklahoma">Stillwater, Oklahoma</a>.

Kappa Kappa Psi primarily operates as a recognition society providing service, leadership opportunities, and social programming for band members. <a href="Tau%20Beta%20Sigma">Tau Beta Sigma</a>, National Honorary Band Sorority, has been recognized as a sister organization since 1947, and the two organizations share National Headquarters in Stillwater Station, a converted historical <a href="Santa%20Fe%20Railroad">Santa Fe</a> rail depot that was purchased by the fraternity and sorority in 1991.

Since 1919, more than 66,000 men and women have been initiated into Kappa Kappa Psi, with nearly 6,000 collegiate members active today. Members of Kappa Kappa Psi include President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>; chancellor and eleventh president of <a href="Indiana%20University">Indiana University</a>, <a href="Herman%20B%20Wells">Herman B Wells</a>; composers <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a> and <a href="John%20Philip%20Sousa">John Philip Sousa</a>; conductor <a href="William%20Revelli">William Revelli</a>; and jazz pianist and bandleader <a href="Count%20Basie">Count Basie</a>.

<a href="William%20A.%20Scroggs">William A. Scroggs</a>, a student at Oklahoma A&M College, sought to establish an organization that would "bind [dear] friendship together indefinitely" and unite members across colleges and universities. After some initial planning, he consulted band president <a href="A.%20Frank%20Martin">A. Frank Martin</a> and <a href="Bohumil%20Makovsky">Bohumil Makovsky</a>, director of bands at Oklahoma A&M, both of whom agreed to help with the creation of the fraternity. From Makovsky's band, 10 members were selected as the first members of Kappa Kappa Psi: William Alexander Scroggs, Andrew Franklin Martin, Raymond David Shannon, Clyde DeWitt Haston, Clayton Everett Soule, Carl Anderson Stevens, William Houston Coppedge, Dick Hurst, George Asher Hendrickson, and Iron Hawthorne Nelson. The founders accepted chemistry professor Hilton Ira Jones' suggestion to name the fraternity "Kappa Kappa Psi." It was organized on November 27, 1919, and Scroggs was unanimously elected to serve as the President. Legal organization was completed on March 5, 1920, when the fraternity received its charter from the state of Oklahoma. The formal organization of the fraternity was celebrated on either March 23 or 25, 1920, with the initiation of the first membership class and a banquet.

The fraternity grew rapidly in its first years. Within ten years, there were 27 chapters spanning from the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> in the west to <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a> in the east. Only 14 were installed during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, while <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> put a further damper on fraternal activities.

At the 1939 National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, plans were set into action to make Kappa Kappa Psi an international fraternity. Invitations were sent to colleges and universities in Canada and South America, but no chapters were ever installed at those institutions.

Before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, most college bands were <a href="Military%20band">military-style</a> and exclusively male. When the war began, most band members left to serve in the armed forces, which greatly strained the fraternity—to the point that 90 percent of chapters were forced to suspend activities. The Grand Council granted those chapters that were forced to suspend their activities "war furlough" so that instead of treating the chapter as inactive, their service would be honored. War furlough enabled a chapter to seal its records and keep its materials in safekeeping for the duration of the war. Petitions for war furlough required the signatures of all active members, the director of bands or other faculty member who was an honorary member of the fraternity, as well as the signature of the college or university president. Only five chapters remained active during the war: the Alpha chapter at Oklahoma A&M College, Alpha Beta at <a href="Butler%20University">Butler University</a>, Alpha Iota at the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>, Alpha Omicron at <a href="Texas%20Tech%20University">Texas Technological College</a>, and Alpha Pi at the <a href="University%20of%20Tulsa">University of Tulsa</a>. With so many members serving overseas, including members of the Grand Council, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were canceled.

Because of the number of men serving in the military, many band programs opened up to women during this time. At Texas Tech, a local sorority for women in the band was established as Tau Beta Sigma. The women of Tau Beta Sigma petitioned Kappa Kappa Psi to be chartered as an auxiliary chapter of the fraternity, which was supported by founder A. Frank Martin, who was serving as National Executive Secretary, and Max Mitchell, Grand Second Vice President. On January 25, 1944, Martin wrote to fellow founder, William Scroggs, "If we do not meet this new situation and give recognition to the girls who are coming into the bands or make it possible to give aid or assistance to the many universities and colleges that have bands composed of both boys and girls, we will be playing second fiddle within the next five years to some band fraternity that will grant membership to boys and girls and their chapters will open up in the smaller schools where ours have died." The fraternity was unable to decide whether or not to accept Tau Beta Sigma's petition due to the severely reduced number of members and the cancelation of the 1943 and 1945 national conventions.

Ultimately, Tau Beta Sigma decided not to become an auxiliary chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi and chartered as a national organization on March 26, 1946. They were officially recognized and accepted as a sister organization of the fraternity at the first national convention following the war in 1947.

After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi began an ambitious expansion program to reactivate old chapters and install new ones. The fraternity had been divided into 11 districts since 1941, which were led by a Grand Counselor (now called Governors). With the revitalization of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history. District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful—in the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 by the end of 1957.

May 1957 saw the first chapters at <a href="Historically%20black%20colleges%20and%20universities">historically black universities</a>: On May 19, at <a href="Langston%20University">Langston University</a>, Kappa Kappa Psi chartered its 97th chapter, Delta Alpha, on the campus of <a href="Langston%20University">Langston University</a>. On May 22, the 96th chapter, Gamma Omega, was established at <a href="Texas%20Southern%20University">Texas Southern University</a>.

On September 1, 1967, the 11 districts were consolidated into nine. These districts would again be consolidated in 1987, to six districts with regional names: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, North Central, Midwest, and Western.

On June 23, 1972, <a href="Title%20IX">Title IX</a> was enacted and had tremendous repercussions for the women's rights movement. Title IX prevented organizations from excluding members based on sex. Although social fraternities were exempt from the law, Kappa Kappa Psi, as a recognition society, fell under its purview. <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers University</a>'s board of trustees decided that Rutgers should serve as a model for the rest of the United States in Title IX implementation and mandated that all organizations on campus become coeducational or face disciplinary actions. The men of the Alpha Phi chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi regarded this issue as minor given the ongoing Vietnam War. With dwindling numbers, Alpha Phi looked to the new women members of the Rutgers band as potential members. The national constitution of Kappa Kappa Psi prohibited women from holding membership, so the Alpha Phi chapter explored the possibility of establishing a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. This was unrealistic, as the undergraduate college for women prohibited the formation of or membership in any sorority.

On October 8, 1972, the men of Alpha Phi voted to admit women into their chapter. They alerted National Headquarters, and National Secretary Robert H. Rubin replied telling Alpha Phi not to administer any degree of ritual until the issue could be discussed in person. When Rubin arrived at Rutgers on November 11, 1972, he learned that the first degree of ritual had been administered, which began formal probationary membership. Alpha Phi's charter was immediately revoked and their chapter was placed on suspension. On November 13, the former Alpha Phi chapter formally reorganized as Mu Upsilon Alpha. On October 7, 2007, Mu Upsilon Alpha became a chapter of <a href="Mu%20Beta%20Psi">Mu Beta Psi</a>.

At the national convention of 1973, the issues presented by Title IX were discussed by the Grand Chapter. The jurisdiction committee considered several options that would bring the fraternity into compliance, but were not receptive of the general idea. At the insistence of committee chair Richard Adler, from the Nu chapter at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, the jurisdiction committee presented the Grand Chapter with an amendment "without prejudice"—that is, without recommendation for or against the amendment—that would strike the section of the constitution that read, "All members of the Fraternity shall be of the male sex." The committee simultaneously recommended that the delegation take no action to change the constitution or consider a merger with Tau Beta Sigma. The amendment was defeated, and a separate amendment was proposed and approved that changed the wording to say, "All active, alumni, inactive, and life members of the Fraternity be of the male sex." This amendment was approved, allowing the fraternity to initiate women as honorary members.

During the 1973–1975 biennium, pressure was put on Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of an equal number of members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. With the idea of a merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.

The first women to join the fraternity were sisters of the Sigma chapter of Tau Beta Sigma at <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a>, who merged with the Beta Omicron chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi after a unanimous vote of both organizations. These women were Patricia A. Childress, Lydia L. Lennon, Leslie A. Anderson, Mary L. Duffala, Mary M. Ketterer, Kristina M. Zipsnis, Clara M. Bertilson, and Toni Ryon, who were initiated into Beta Omicron on August 26, 1977. On August 27, Lea F. Fuller was initiated. The first woman to participate in the formal probationary membership process and become a member of Kappa Kappa Psi was Darragh Hill Young, who was initiated into the Beta Tau chapter at <a href="Wichita%20State%20University">Wichita State University</a> on September 1, 1977.

Beginning with the installation of the Kappa Pi chapter at <a href="Claflin%20University">Claflin University</a> on February 24, 2001, 57 new chapters have been installed in the 21st century.

In 2006, Kappa Kappa Psi celebrated its inaugural National Month of Musicianship during the month of November, the month in which the fraternity was founded. The annual month-long event is intended to promote music and university bands. Local chapters celebrate the National Month of Musicianship in various ways, such as creating lab bands for student conductors, organizing reading bands, and hosting master classes.

Also in 2008, Kappa Kappa Psi joined other Greek organizations in sponsoring <a href="hazingprevention.org">hazingprevention.org</a>, a national anti-hazing organization. Dr. Malinda Matney, past National President and current member of the Kappa Kappa Psi Board of Trustees, has served on the hazingprevention.org Board of Directors since 2009.

On December 1, 2011, following the death of <a href="Florida%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Florida A&M University</a> drum major <a href="List%20of%20hazing%20deaths%20in%20the%20United%20States%232010%27s">Robert Champion</a>, the Delta Iota chapter was placed on investigative hold pending an investigation by the national fraternity. In January 2012, the "<a href="Tallahassee%20Democrat">Tallahassee Democrat</a>" reported alleged hazing by the FAMU chapter in spring 2010. According to the allegations, two members of the FAMU band faculty were involved in a hazing incident at a professor's home in which prospective members were struck on the back and neck and forced to recite information. The fraternity's investigation was postponed at the request of FAMU due to the ongoing police investigation. The investigations cleared Delta Iota of any connection to Champion's death; Champion was not a member or prospective member of the fraternity. After the conclusion of both the police and fraternity investigations, the national council closed down the chapter because of its violations of fraternity policy and the uncertainty of the future of the FAMU band program. As part of the chapter's termination, 28 members, including all active and prospective members in spring 2010, were expelled from the fraternity. Alumni members of the chapter who were present at the hazing were also expelled. Furthermore, the Delta Iota chapter may not return to FAMU before May 2017. Members who joined the fraternity after spring 2010 were transferred to alumni status but cannot participate in any fraternity events due to the shutdown of the chapter. No criminal charges were filed due to the delay in reporting and investigation.

In 1922, plans were made to hold the first national intercollegiate band contest. A brief dispatch in the 1922 "Baton" explained, "Sometime within the next two years the Kappa Kappa Psi Fraternity will hold a National Intercollegiate Band Contest. This enterprise will be the first of its kind ever attempted. As Music is becoming the foremost Art in America, our Fraternity aims to assist in so spreading the good work." Nothing came of these early plans, however, and the idea of a national intercollegiate band was not revisited until the 1940s.

Beginning in 1933, the first intercollegiate band was established, with musicians from the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado">University of Colorado</a> (home of the Alpha Iota chapter), the <a href="University%20of%20Denver">University of Denver</a> (Alpha Lambda), <a href="Colorado%20State%20University">Colorado State College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts</a> (Kappa), <a href="University%20of%20Northern%20Colorado">Colorado State College of Education</a> (Alpha Theta), the <a href="Colorado%20School%20of%20Mines">Colorado School of Mines</a> (Xi), and the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a> participating. In 1934, the University of Utah left the intercollegiate band and the <a href="University%20of%20Wyoming">University of Wyoming</a> (Alpha Nu) took its place. The concerts held by this intercollegiate band were sponsored by the local chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and many members of the fraternity were involved with the ensemble, including F. Lee Bowling, who served as the band's manager.

F. Lee Bowling was elected Grand President of the fraternity in 1941 and presented a plan to hold a national intercollegiate band concert, modeled after the Rocky Mountain intercollegiate bands. The plan was endorsed by the delegation to be executed at the next national convention in 1943. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and so the first National Intercollegiate Band was formed and gave a concert on the evening of Friday, March 7, 1947. Today, participation in the National Intercollegiate Band is open to any college band member who auditions—membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma is not required.

In June and July 2002, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma sponsored the first National Intercollegiate Marching Band, which traveled to the <a href="French%20Riviera">French Riviera</a>, including the cities of <a href="Nice">Nice</a>, <a href="Grasse">Grasse</a>, <a href="Aix-en-Provence">Aix-en-Provence</a>, <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>, <a href="Antibes">Antibes</a>, and the <a href="Monaco">Principality of Monaco</a>. The thirty-five member band performed at <a href="Le%20Suquet">Le Suquet</a> in Cannes, in Nice, and in front of the <a href="Prince%27s%20Palace%20of%20Monaco">Prince's Palace of Monaco</a>. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which was believed to be caused by a fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.

The success of the National Intercollegiate Band led to districts creating their own bands. One such group was the Atlantic Coast Intercollegiate Band, formed in 1958 at the convention of Districts X and XI. The Atlantic Coast band comprised around one hundred musicians and was conducted by <a href="Paul%20V.%20Yoder">Paul V. Yoder</a>. The convention was hosted by the Beta Chi chapter at the University of Virginia, and the convention and concert were co-sponsored by the Universities of <a href="Rutgers%20University">Rutgers</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">Maryland</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>. In 2009, the North Central District organized the first North Central District Intercollegiate Band. The North Central District Intercollegiate Band is the only currently functioning district intercollegiate band and has performed at every North Central District convention since its inaugural.

Since 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have commissioned a new work for wind band to be premiered at almost every National Intercollegiate Band concert. This program was begun to add to the wind repertoire under the direction of Grand President Hugh McMillen, and is the longest-running commissioning project in the United States. A number of these commissioned compositions have garnered national acclaim, including <a href="Robert%20Russell%20Bennett">Robert Russell Bennett</a>'s "<a href="Symphonic%20Songs%20for%20Band">Symphonic Songs for Band</a>" and <a href="Karel%20Husa">Karel Husa</a>'s Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra. In the years following the start of the national commissioning program, local chapters have begun to commission new band works themselves, such as <a href="Frank%20Ticheli">Frank Ticheli</a>'s "An American Elegy", commissioned by the Alpha Iota chapter in memory of the Columbine High School massacre.

The Stillwater Santa Fe Depot is a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">historic building</a> originally built in March 1900. In 1915, a brick depot was added. The depot was used as a passenger rail station until 1953. The depot was purchased at auction by five Stillwater residents, including three Alpha chapter alumni, in November 1991. Stillwater Station replaced Oklahoma State University's Seretean Center for the Performing Arts as the National Headquarters of the two organizations. The fraternity and sorority share office space, a conference room, and storage space in the converted station, which also hosts the organizations' archives. The brick path leading to the building's entrance has become a "Walk of Fame" with engraved bricks purchased by individuals or chapters.

In 2006, Kappa Kappa Psi purchased a retired <a href="Detroit%2C%20Toledo%20and%20Ironton%20Railroad">Detroit, Toledo and Ironton</a> caboose to provide additional space for the fraternity's history and archives program. After it was purchased, the caboose was placed on newly laid tracks outside the headquarters and wired for electricity, phone, and internet. The caboose is intended to host archives, artifacts, and chapter histories, as well as displays of historical items.

The mission statement and five purposes of Kappa Kappa Psi shape the activities of local chapters. Chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi provide service and support to the bands at its hosting institutions, from major projects like undertaking major renovations of rehearsal spaces used by the institution's bands to relatively minor support such as providing apples and water to athletic bands or cleaning practice rooms. Some chapters also include general community service in their activities, such as sponsoring blood drives and other activities.

The fifth purpose of the fraternity charges chapters and members is to "provide a pleasant and helpful social experience for all engaged in college band work," and chapters fulfill this charge through social programming such as hosting receptions after band concerts, sponsoring dances and socials for band members or their campus community in general, or by hosting concerts and providing food. Some chapters, especially southern chapters, also take part in <a href="Stepping%20%28African-American%29">step</a> shows.

The Crown Pearl Badge is considered the "official means of identifying oneself with the Fraternity." The fraternity badge is in the shape of an ancient Venetian harp, with a musical staff of gold lines on black enamel in the center of the badge, with the Greek letters "Kappa Kappa Psi" in gold across the staff. Five pearls adorn the bar across the top of the badge, and ten gems are set in the harp's semicircle. In the upper left corner, the Greek letters "Alpha Epsilon Alpha" appear in gold on black enamel. A golden baton penetrates the badge diagonally from right to left. Unlike other Greek organizations, however, purchase of the badge is optional for members of Kappa Kappa Psi. Many brothers instead wear the recognition pin, which is a gold lapel pin in the shape of the fraternity's coat of arms.

Membership Candidates may wear a lapel pin that has a musical staff and bass clef of silver on a background of blue enamel. The notes A, E, and A are placed on the staff in silver." This is the only piece of regalia that Membership Candidates are allowed to wear—all other jewelry is restricted to initiated members, and even the coat of arms and letters (usually worn in the form of embroidered or ironed-on blocked letters) are restricted unless there is a clear indication that the wearer is a Membership Candidate or <a href="Colony%20%28fraternity%20or%20sorority%29">colony</a> member.

The Fraternity Flag was created by G. R. Schaag, a member of the Eta Sigma chapter at the <a href="University%20of%20Central%20Florida">University of Central Florida</a>. The idea of a national flag was raised with the History and Traditions committee by Schaag at the 1987 national convention, but the committee ultimately decided not to take the idea to the national delegation. Schaag quickly drafted a motion to consider a national flag, which was presented by the chapter's delegate and passed. In 1989, Schaag presented a design for a flag, which won the committee's recommendation over other submissions and was accepted by the national chapter. The upper half of the flag consists of a white field with the Greek letters "Kappa Kappa Psi" inscribed in an arc. On the lower half, three alternating stars of white, blue, and white appear on a blue field, with the top point of the lower white star extending into the white field above it.

The Fraternity Hymn was written by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. when he was a prospective member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to <a href="rush%20week">rush</a>, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, "We know that you play [piano] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there and come up with a hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." Heckstall recalled the hymn "Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go)" by <a href="Charles%20Albert%20Tindley">Charles Albert Tindley</a> and changed a few words—for example, "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" became "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.

A member of a college or university band who has completed one term in such a band may be offered membership in the fraternity. First-term freshmen may only join if an exception is made by that chapter's sponsor or director of bands. There were almost 6,000 members active across the country in 2011, and more than 66,000 have joined the organization since 1919.
A member of Kappa Kappa Psi may not be initiated as an active member of Tau Beta Sigma and vice versa—if a member of Kappa Kappa Psi transfers to a school with a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma and no Kappa Kappa Psi, he or she may instead join the sorority chapter as an "associate member" after going through a short orientation process acclimating the member to the sorority.

Brothers of Kappa Kappa Psi are not restricted from joining <a href="Phi%20Mu%20Alpha%20Sinfonia">Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia</a> or <a href="Sigma%20Alpha%20Iota">Sigma Alpha Iota</a>, except by the gender restrictions or other eligibility requirements of either organization. Joint statements between Kappa Kappa Psi and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia have affirmed this since at least 1973, and have been reaffirmed as recently as 2005, when the organizations released a joint statement saying, "there are equally important roles for Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Sigma Alpha Iota, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma to fulfill on any campus where our chapters mutually exist, now or in the future. Each organization possesses a distinct mission and, as a result, fulfills a unique and vital role in the musical environment of a college campus." Indeed, founder Raymond Shannon went on to join Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia after starting Kappa Kappa Psi.

By 2011 there were 210 active chapters out of 314 chapters chartered since 1919, and 7 colonies. <a href="Colony%20%28fraternity%20or%20sorority%29">Colonies</a> are probationary chapters at universities that have not historically had a chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi or whose chapter has gone inactive. Chapters and colonies of Kappa Kappa Psi are organized into seven districts, six of which are named for the geographical region of the United States that they represent. These are the North Central, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest, and Western Districts. Although an International District is provided for, it has no chapters.

Every two years in odd-numbered years, Kappa Kappa Psi holds a national convention. The first such convention was held in 1922 in Stillwater, and only three conventions since then have not been held: 1931, and the 1943 and 1945 conventions which were canceled due to World War II. The assembly of chapters in these conventions is called the National Chapter, which is the governing body of the fraternity and has the power to elect members of the National Council and Board of Trustees. The location of the National Convention rotates among the districts.

Body Count (album)

Body Count is the eponymous debut <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="crossover%20thrash">crossover thrash</a> band <a href="Body%20Count%20%28band%29">Body Count</a>, released on March 31, 1992 by <a href="Sire%20Records">Sire Records</a>. The album's material focuses on various social and political issues ranging from <a href="police%20brutality">police brutality</a> to drug abuse. It also presents a turning point in the career of <a href="Ice-T">Ice-T</a>, who co-wrote the album's songs with lead guitarist <a href="Ernie%20C">Ernie C</a> and performed as the band's lead singer. Previously known only as a rapper, Ice-T's work with the band helped establish a <a href="Crossover%20%28music%29">crossover</a> audience with rock music fans. The album produced the single "<a href="There%20Goes%20the%20Neighborhood%20%28Body%20Count%20song%29">There Goes the Neighborhood</a>".

"Body Count" is well known for the inclusion of the controversial song "<a href="Cop%20Killer%20%28song%29">Cop Killer</a>", which was the subject of much criticism from various political figures, although many defended the song on the basis of the group's right to <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>. Ice-T eventually chose to remove the song from the album, although it continues to be performed live. It was voted the 31st best album of the year in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics poll, and is believed to have helped pave the way for the mainstream success of the <a href="rap%20metal">rap metal</a> genre, although the album itself does not feature <a href="rapping">rapping</a> in any of its songs.

<a href="Ice-T">Ice-T</a> formed Body Count out of this interest. The band comprised musicians Ice-T had known from <a href="Crenshaw%20High%20School">Crenshaw High School</a>. Ice-T states that "I knew we didn't want to form an R&B group. [...] Where am I gonna get the rage and the anger to attack something with that? [...] We knew Body Count had to be a rock band. The name alone negates the band from being R&B."

Ice-T co-wrote the band's music and lyrics with lead guitarist <a href="Ernie%20C">Ernie C</a>, and took on the duties of lead vocalist. Ice-T states that "I knew I couldn't sing, but then I thought, 'Who "can" sing in rock 'n' roll?'" Aside from Ice-T and Ernie C, the original line-up consisted of Mooseman on bass, <a href="Beatmaster%20V">Beatmaster V</a> on drums and <a href="D-Roc%20The%20Executioner">D-Roc</a> on rhythm guitar. According to Ice-T, "We named the group Body Count because every Sunday night in L.A., I'd watch the news, and the newscasters would tally up the youths killed in gang homicides that week and then just segue to sports. 'Is that all I am,' I thought, 'a body count?'"

Ice-T introduced the band at <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> in 1991, devoting half of his set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be the highlight of the tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album "<a href="O.G.%20Original%20Gangster">O.G. Original Gangster</a>". The song "Body Count" was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a "black <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore</a> band," stating that "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and I happen to like rock 'n' roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music."

Recording sessions for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album was released on March 31, 1992, on compact disc, <a href="LP%20album">vinyl</a>, and <a href="audio%20cassette">audio cassette</a>. Ice-T states that "Body Count" was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that "An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance. Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But "Body Count" was intended to reflect straight anger. It was supposed to be the voice of the angry brother, without answers. [...] If you took a kid and you put him in jail with a microphone and asked him how he feels, you'd get "Body Count": 'Fuck that. Fuck school. Fuck the police.' You wouldn't get intelligence or compassion. You'd get raw anger." From the album, "There Goes The Neighborhood" was released as a single, while "Body Count's in the House" was featured in the film "<a href="Universal%20Soldier%20%281992%20film%29">Universal Soldier</a>".

Ernie C and Ice-T conceived the album with the dark, ominous tone and <a href="Satan">Satan</a>ic lyrical themes of <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a> in mind. However, Ice-T felt that basing his lyrics in reality would be scarier than the fantasy basis in Black Sabbath's lyrics; the inner artwork depicts a man with a gun pointed at the viewer's face. Ice-T states, "To us "that" was the devil [...] what's more scary than [...] some gangster with a gun pointed at you?" Ice-T defined the resulting mix of heavy metal and reality-based lyrics as "a rock album with a rap mentality." The album's musical style is primarily described as <a href="speed%20metal">speed metal</a>, <a href="thrash%20metal">thrash metal</a> and <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>. <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that with "Body Count", Ice-T "has recognized a kinship between his gangster raps and post-punk, hard-core rock, both of which break taboos to titillate fans. But where rap's core audience is presumably in the inner city, hard-core appeals mostly to suburbanites seeking more gritty thrills than they can get from Nintendo or the local mall."

Despite Ice-T's attempts to differentiate "Body Count" from his work in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song "<a href="Cop%20Killer%20%28song%29">Cop Killer</a>" as rap to provoke negative criticism. "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word "rap" they can get a lot of people who think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word "rock", people say, 'Oh, but I like <a href="Jefferson%20Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>, I like <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a> — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." "Body Count" has since been credited for pioneering the <a href="rap%20metal">rap metal</a> genre popularized by groups such as <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a> and <a href="Limp%20Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] [We] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed."

Like Ice-T's gangsta rap albums, "Body Count"'s material focused on various social and political issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a> sing about the beach, we sing about the way we grew up." Ice-T states that ""Body Count" was an angry record. It was meant to be a protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." The spoken introduction, "Smoked Pork" features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.

In the lyrics of "KKK Bitch," Ice-T describes a sexual encounter with a woman who he soon learns is the daughter of the <a href="Grand%20Wizard">Grand Wizard</a> of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count "crash" a Klan meeting to "get buck wild with the white freaks". Ice-T makes humorous reference to "[falling] in love with <a href="Tipper%20Gore">Tipper Gore</a>'s two 12-year-old nieces", and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him "when his grandson's named little Ice-T." In "The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?", Ice-T wrote that "'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a> and the girls would always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn't like black folks. [...] We knew that 'KKK Bitch' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan. There's humor in the song, but it fucks with them. It's on a punk tip."

"Voodoo" describes a fictional encounter between Ice-T and an old woman with a <a href="voodoo%20doll">voodoo doll</a>. "The Winner Loses" describes the downfall of a <a href="crack%20cocaine">crack cocaine</a> user. "There Goes the Neighborhood" is a sarcastic response to critics of Body Count, sung from the point of view of a racist white rocker who wonders "Don't they know rock's just for whites? / Don't they know the rules? / Those niggers are too hardcore / This shit ain't cool." For the song's music video, the word "<a href="nigger">nigger</a>" was replaced with the phrase "black boys". The music video ends with a black musician implanting an electric guitar into the ground and setting it on fire. The final image is similar to that of a <a href="cross%20burning">burning cross</a>.

"Evil Dick" focuses on <a href="male%20promiscuity">male promiscuity</a>. Its lyrics describe a married man who is led to seek strange women after his "evil <a href="Penis">dick</a>" tells him "Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone." "Momma's Gotta Die Tonight" follows the account of a black teenager who murders and <a href="dismemberment">dismember</a>s his racist mother after she reacts negatively when he brings a <a href="white%20people">white</a> girl home. In "The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?", Ice-T wrote that the song's lyrics are metaphorical, explaining that "Whoever is still perpetuating racism has got to die, not necessarily physically, but they have to kill off that part of their brain. From now on, consider it dead. The entire attitude is dead."

Ice-T referred to the album's final track, "Cop Killer" as a protest song, stating that the song is "[sung] in the first person as a character who is fed up with police brutality." The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief <a href="Daryl%20Gates">Daryl Gates</a> and the black motorist <a href="Rodney%20King">Rodney King</a>, whose beating by <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">LAPD</a> officers was recorded on videotape. In "The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?", Ice-T wrote that the song "[is] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings. Treat us accordingly.'" In an interview for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", Ice-T stated that "We just celebrated the <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">fourth of July</a>, which is really just national Fuck the Police Day [...] I bet that during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, there were songs similar to mine."

Initial copies of the album were shipped out in black <a href="body%20bag">body bag</a>s, a promotional device that drew minor criticism. The album debuted at No. 32 on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"'s Top 50 albums, peaking at No. 26 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. By January 29, 1993, the album sold 480,000 copies, according to "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>". However, according to the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>, "Body Count" was certified gold for sale shipments in excess of 500,000 copies, with a certification date back to August 4, 1992.

In a positive review for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", music critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> said Ice-T "takes rap's art-ain't-life defense over the top" on a heavy metal album which utilizes and parodies "the style's whiteskin privilege". He wrote that the music is "flat-out hard rock, short on soloistic intricacy and fancy structures", but that it is set apart from other metal by Ice-T, who "describes racism in language metalheads can understand, kills several policemen, and cuts his mama into little pieces because she tells him to hate white people. This can be a very funny record." <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a>, writing in the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", felt the lyrics on some songs are pathologically flawed and off-putting, but the band's take on metal styles is impressive and, "on the stereotype-bashing 'There Goes the Neighborhood,' the humor, message and music coalesce brilliantly". Don Kaye of "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" called "Body Count" a "noisy, relentless musical attack".

In a less enthusiastic review for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="J.%20D.%20Considine">J. D. Considine</a> wrote that "messages" are less important here than "the sort of sonic intensity parental groups fear even more than four-letter words," while <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> called the album "a surprisingly tepid affair" partly because "all of Ice-T's half-sung/half-shouted lyrics fall far short of the standard he established on his hip-hop albums." In the <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of prominent critics published by "The Village Voice", "Body Count" was voted the 31st best album of 1992. Christgau, the poll's supervisor, ranked it 22nd on his own year-end list.

In 2017, "Rolling Stone" listed the album at No. 90 on its list of the 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time.

The album was originally set to be distributed under the title "Cop Killer", named for the song of the same name, which criticizes violent police officers. During the production of the album, Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause, but supported it. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a> stood and read lyrics from the song "KKK Bitch" to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. Sire responded by changing the title to "Body Count", but did not remove the song. In an article for the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>", Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs like "Cop Killer," writing that "Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message [...] <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>'s <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a> sold in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. That didn't make it right." The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> to withdraw the album. CLEAT called for a boycott of all products by Time-Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Ice-T asserted that the song was written from the point of view of a fictional character, and told reporters that "I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. But I never did it. If you believe that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut," in reference to Bowie's song "<a href="Space%20Oddity">Space Oddity</a>".

The <a href="National%20Black%20Police%20Association%20%28United%20States%29">National Black Police Association</a> opposed the boycott of <a href="Time-Warner">Time-Warner</a> and the attacks on "Cop Killer," identifying police brutality as the cause of much anti-police sentiment and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others." Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Others defended the album on the basis of the group's right to <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film "<a href="New%20Jack%20City">New Jack City</a>". Ice-T is quoted as saying that "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people. So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the fact that I have the right to make it."

Over the next month, controversy against the band grew. Vice President <a href="Dan%20Quayle">Dan Quayle</a> branded "Cop Killer" as being "obscene," and President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product. "Body Count" was removed from the shelves of a retail store in <a href="Greensboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a> after local police had told the management that they would no longer respond to any emergency calls at the store if they continued to sell the album. In July 1992, the New Zealand Police Commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to prevent an Ice-T concert in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, arguing that "Anyone who comes to this country preaching in obscene terms the killing of police, should not be welcome here," before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the <a href="Indecent%20Publications%20Tribunal">Indecent Publications Tribunal</a>, in an effort to get it banned under New Zealand's Indecent Publications Act. This was the first time in 20 years that a sound recording had come before the censorship body, and the first ever case involving popular music. After reviewing the various submissions, and listening carefully to the album, the Tribunal found the song "Cop Killer" to be "not exhortatory," saw the album as displaying "an honest purpose," and found Body Count not indecent.

The controversy escalated to the point where death threats were sent to Time-Warner executives, and <a href="stockholder">stockholder</a>s threatened to pull out of the company. Finally, Ice-T decided to remove "Cop Killer" from the album of his own volition, a decision which was met by criticism from other artists who derided Ice-T for "caving in to external pressure." In an interview, Ice-T stated that "I didn't want my band to get pigeon-holed as that's the only reason that record sold. It just got outta hand and I was just tired of hearing it. I said, 'fuck it,' I mean they're saying we did it for money, and we didn't. I'd gave the record away, ya know, let's move on, let's get back to real issues, not a record, but the cops that are out there killing people."

"Cop Killer" was replaced by a new version of "Freedom of Speech," a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album "<a href="The%20Iceberg/Freedom%20of%20Speech...Just%20Watch%20What%20You%20Say">The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say</a>". The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> song "<a href="Foxy%20Lady">Foxy Lady</a>." Alongside the album's reissue, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> issued "Cop Killer" as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album "<a href="Home%20Invasion%20%28album%29">Home Invasion</a>", taking Body Count with him. The studio version of "Cop Killer" has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release "Live in L.A." According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song "still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it, too, and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on "Law & Order SVU"."

In Australia, the track listings on copies of the new version of the album sold there ended at track 16, omitting "Freedom of Speech" (or "Cop Killer" and its spoken word intro, "Out in the Parking Lot"). This was likely because the track "Freedom of Speech" refers to the speech protections of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which Australia does not have an equivalent to in its own Constitution, thus the track is not as relevant to Australian audiences.

James Rowland (RAAF officer)

<a href="Air%20Marshal%20%28Australia%29">Air Marshal</a> Sir James Anthony (Jim) Rowland, (1 November 1922 – 27 May 1999) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), serving as <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) from 1975 to 1979. He later held office as <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a> from 1981 to 1989, and was <a href="List%20of%20University%20of%20Sydney%20people%23Administration">Chancellor of the University of Sydney</a> from 1990 to 1991. Born in rural <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Rowland cut short his <a href="Aerospace%20engineering">aeronautical engineering</a> studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> to join the RAAF in 1942. He was posted to Britain and served as a bomber pilot with the <a href="Pathfinder%20Force">Pathfinders</a> in the <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command%23Strategic%20Bombing%201943-45">air war over Europe</a>, earning the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> in 1944. The following year he was forced to bail out over Germany following a collision with another Allied aircraft, and spent the rest of the war as a <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war%23Western%20Allies%27%20POWs">prisoner</a>.

After <a href="repatriation">repatriation</a> and <a href="demobilisation">demobilisation</a>, Rowland gained his engineering degree and rejoined the RAAF. He became a <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a>, serving with and later commanding the <a href="Aircraft%20Research%20and%20Development%20Unit%20RAAF">Aircraft Research and Development Unit</a> in the 1950s, and also a senior engineering officer, being closely involved in preparations for delivery to Australia of the <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III">Dassault Mirage III</a> supersonic fighter in the 1960s. In 1972 he was promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> and became Air Member for Technical Services, holding this post until his elevation to air marshal and appointment as CAS in March 1975. He was the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and the first man to personally command it in a legal sense, following abolition of the Australian Air Board in 1976. <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knighted</a> in 1977, Rowland retired from the Air Force in 1979 and became Governor of New South Wales in January 1981. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Companion of the Order of Australia</a> in 1987. Retiring from the Governorship in 1989, he held a place on several boards as well as the Chancellorship of the University of Sydney.

Rowland was born in <a href="Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Armidale</a>, New South Wales, on 1 November 1922. He was the son of Louis Rowland, a <a href="commander">commander</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>, and his wife Elsie. Jim evinced a fascination with aviation from an early age, carving model aeroplanes out of wood. Growing up with his three brothers on the family's rural property, he was schooled via correspondence before completing his secondary education at <a href="Cranbrook%20School%2C%20Sydney">Cranbrook, Sydney</a>. Rowland entered the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> to study <a href="Aerospace%20engineering">aeronautical engineering</a>, but left in May 1942 to enlist in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) as a pilot under the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>. In early 1943 he underwent service flying training in Canada. He was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in July and posted to Britain, where he converted to <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Handley Page Halifax</a> and <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bombers.

Rowland was assigned to the <a href="Pathfinder%20%28RAF%29">Pathfinder Force</a> that marked targets for other aircraft on <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command%23Strategic%20Bombing%201943-45">strategic bombing missions over Europe</a>. Considered an exceptional pilot, he became a master bomber with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B635%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 635 Squadron RAF</a> in 1944. As a master bomber, his role was to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. No. 635 Squadron operated Lancasters, a type that, Rowland recalled, "would forgive sprog pilots doing the most outrageous things to it, and would even bring them home with quite large bits shot off it".

Having been promoted to acting <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, Rowland was on a <a href="sortie">sortie</a> to attack <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a> in December 1944 when he lost one of his engines. He nevertheless continued on to the target where, owing to his lower-than-normal altitude, his aircraft was seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire before and after he dropped his bombs. Nursing his plane back to base, he was recommended for the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> in recognition of his "great determination and devotion to duty"; the award was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 16 February 1945. In January 1945, Rowland's Lancaster collided with a Canadian bomber over <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, and he had to bail out with his surviving crew. Captured and held by the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> in solitary confinement, he was scheduled to be executed but was saved by two <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> officers who had learned of his situation. They took him to a prisoner-of-war camp, where he remained until being repatriated at the end of hostilities. None of Rowland's crew survived the war and, though he believed he had done all he could to save them, he suffered <a href="survivor%20guilt">survivor guilt</a>.

Rowland's commission was terminated in November 1945. Returning to Australia, he resumed his studies at the University of Sydney and completed his degree, before rejoining the RAAF as a member of its newly formed Technical Branch in 1947. He was posted to Britain in 1949 to attend the <a href="Empire%20Test%20Pilots%27%20School">Empire Test Pilots' School</a>. In 1952, he was appointed chief <a href="test%20pilot">test pilot</a> with the <a href="Aircraft%20Research%20and%20Development%20Unit%20RAAF">Aircraft Research and Development Unit</a> (ARDU) at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Base Laverton</a>, Victoria. Rowland led trial programs that involved many of the Air Force's early jets such as the <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>, <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a>, <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a>, and <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>. Promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, he earned the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> for his test flying achievements; the award was gazetted on 1 January 1955. He married Faye Doughton on 20 April 1955; the couple had a daughter, Anni.

Rowland attended <a href="RAAF%20Staff%20College">RAAF Staff College</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Point Cook</a>, in 1956. Promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, he took charge of ARDU from November 1956 until June 1959. In 1957, he raised concerns that the supersonic <a href="Lockheed%20F-104%20Starfighter">Lockheed F-104 Starfighter</a>, touted as a multi-role replacement for the Sabre, was ill-suited for any purpose except <a href="Interceptor%20aircraft">interception</a>. The <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Defence Minister</a>, <a href="Philip%20McBride">Sir Philip McBride</a>, had reached a similar conclusion and kept the Sabre in frontline service until a more suitable aircraft could be chosen, namely the <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Dassault Mirage III</a> delta-wing fighter. From 1961 to 1964 Rowland was based in Paris, as Technical Staff Officer on the RAAF team preparing for the Mirage's acceptance into Australian service. In contrast to most of the team members, he displayed a talent for language and by his second year was chairing meetings in French with Dassault engineers. After returning to Australia, he was posted to the Directorate of Aircraft Engineering at the <a href="Department%20of%20Air%20%28Australia%29">Department of Air</a>, Canberra, responsible for ongoing technical oversight of the Mirage.
In December 1966, Rowland became commanding officer of <a href="No.%203%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 3 Aircraft Depot</a> (No. 3 AD) at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, with the acting rank of <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>; his promotion was made substantive in November 1967. After completing his tenure at No. 3 AD in January 1969, Rowland was appointed Senior Engineering Staff Officer at <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Headquarters Operational Command</a> in <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Glenbrook">Glenbrook</a>, New South Wales. In 1971 he was posted to Britain to attend the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Royal College of Defence Studies</a>, London. Returning to Australia, he was Director-General of Aircraft Engineering before being promoted to <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> to serve as Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS), the RAAF's senior engineering position, in November 1972. The AMTS occupied a seat on the Australian Air Board, the service's controlling body that was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS).

In March 1975, Rowland was raised to <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> and took over from Air Marshal <a href="Charles%20Read%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Read</a> as CAS, becoming the first appointee to the position who had joined the RAAF after the commencement of World War II. He was also the first engineering officer to lead the RAAF, and was selected over a more senior air vice marshal through the personal influence of the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Defence Secretary</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Tange">Sir Arthur Tange</a>. The CAS was nevertheless required to be a member of the Air Force's aircrew stream so Rowland, still a qualified pilot, had to transfer from the Technical Branch to the General Duties Branch. Soon afterwards, the stipulation for the CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.
In 1976, Rowland became the first CAS to personally command the RAAF in a legal sense, following dissolution of the Air Board, a consequence of defence reorganisation in the wake of the 1973 "<a href="Arthur%20Tange">Tange report</a>" that recommended departmental rationalisation. A new Chief of the Air Staff Advisory Committee (CASAC) was set up, but there was no requirement for the CAS to accept its advice. According to historian Alan Stephens, Rowland considered that the "collective wisdom" engendered by the Air Board had been generally beneficial to the RAAF, and believed the new arrangements led to paralysis and arrogation of decision making', and empire building in the Public Service component". Though known as a strong committee member who enjoyed a good argument, he "found that the sheer time involved in attending meetings made it very difficult for him to run the Air Force 'the way [he] wanted to. To facilitate the cross-fertilisation of ideas on air power between senior officers, he inaugurated an annual CAS Symposium. During his term as CAS, Rowland reoriented the RAAF's priorities in line with the <a href="Defence%20of%20Australia%20policy">Defence of Australia policy</a>, which had been adopted by the government in the early 1970s. As a result, he placed the strongest emphasis on protecting Australia from air attack, followed by conducting air strikes on targets in other countries, and supporting the <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> and Navy.

On 11 June 1977, Rowland was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the military division. In July the same year, he was awarded the <a href="National%20Medal%20%28Australia%29">National Medal</a> with First Clasp, given "for diligent long service to the community". Rowland's original three-year tenure as CAS was extended by a year. He retired from the Air Force in March 1979, and was succeeded by his <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">deputy</a> and former classmate at RAAF Staff College, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Neville%20McNamara">Neville McNamara</a>.

After leaving the Air Force, Rowland continued to live in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, consulting part-time for French arms concern Ofema. In late 1980 he was recommended by the government of <a href="Premier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Premier</a> <a href="Neville%20Wran">Neville Wran</a> to serve as the next <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>, replacing <a href="Roden%20Cutler">Sir Roden Cutler</a>. Rowland admitted that he did not have "the faintest idea" why he was chosen, and thought that "there must be a lot of people who could do it a lot better than I could". He saw the role as the monarch's representative in New South Wales as helping to provide "a valuable link with an older part of the world". Wran, for his part, was understood to have chosen Rowland largely on the basis of his engaging personality; it was also said that the Premier preferred military men for <a href="Viceroy">vice-regal</a> office because "they knew how to take orders". Rowland was duly appointed by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on 20 January 1981. Upon taking office, he declared that he wished to be seen as a "man of the people". To this end, he opened <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Sydney">Government House</a> to the public on a more frequent basis, and also extended invitations for official functions to a broader range of society than was previously the case.

As Governor of New South Wales and therefore the senior state governor, Rowland held a <a href="dormant%20commission">dormant commission</a> to serve as <a href="Administrator%20%28Australia%29">Administrator of the Commonwealth</a> and Commander-in-Chief of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> during absences by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor General</a>, and did so six times while in office. On one such occasion he was required to dismiss an old colleague, Air Vice Marshal James Flemming, from his position as director of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, Canberra, after the Government lost faith in Flemming's ability to properly manage the Memorial. Rowland had served as one of Flemming's referees when he applied to head the Memorial in 1982. The journalist and public servant Evan Williams also credited Rowland with being "the first Viceregal whistleblower" for alerting the Wran government to an unusual number of early release requests for prisoners that he was being asked to sign by <a href="Corrective%20Services%20NSW">Corrective Services Minister</a> <a href="Rex%20Jackson">Rex Jackson</a>. The inquiries set in motion by Rowland's queries revealed that Jackson was receiving money from criminals for misusing the early release scheme. Forced to resign, Jackson was later charged with corruption and imprisoned.

Rowland was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Engineering by the University of Sydney in 1983, and also appointed a <a href="Knight%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20John">Knight of the Order of St John</a>. He was <a href="Honorary%20Air%20Commodore">Honorary Air Commodore</a> of <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 Squadron</a> from 1981 to 1989, and <a href="Honorary%20Colonel">Honorary Colonel</a> of the <a href="Royal%20New%20South%20Wales%20Regiment">Royal New South Wales Regiment</a> from 1985 to 1989. On 26 January 1987, he was invested as a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Companion of the Order of Australia</a> for "service to the Crown and to the people of New South Wales". At <a href="Sydney%20Town%20Hall">Sydney Town Hall</a> on 3 October that year, he took the salute of <a href="Vietnam%20veteran">Vietnam veteran</a>s during their official "Welcome Home March". His governorship coincided with <a href="Australian%20Bicentenary">Australian Bicentenary</a> celebrations in 1988. A popular Governor, Rowland was considered by his <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Branch%29">Labor</a> premiers to be "a safe pair of hands". His original four-year term was extended twice, each time for two years, by the Wran and <a href="Barry%20Unsworth">Unsworth</a> administrations. On 27 April 1988, Rowland opened the Forty-Ninth New South Wales Parliament with a new premier, <a href="Nick%20Greiner">Nick Greiner</a>, whose <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Division%29">Liberal Party</a> had defeated Labor in the March elections. That November, he took a turn at flying one of the RAAF's recently acquired <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornets</a> piloted by Wing Commander (later Air Vice Marshal) John Kindler. He was succeeded on 20 January 1989 by Rear Admiral <a href="David%20Martin%20%28governor%29">Sir David Martin</a>. After retiring from the Governorship, Rowland served as President of the <a href="Royal%20Humane%20Society">Royal Humane Society</a>, <a href="List%20of%20University%20of%20Sydney%20people%23Administration">Chancellor of the University of Sydney</a> from 1990 to 1991, and as a member of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Force">Police Board</a> from 1989 to 1992. He was also a member of the boards of several private companies, including <a href="Angus%20%26amp%3B%20Coote">Angus & Coote</a> and <a href="Thomson-CSF">Thomson-CSF Pacific Holdings</a>, and Chairman of the Aerospace Foundation of Australia from 1992 until his death in Sydney on 27 May 1999. Sir James Rowland was survived by his wife and daughter, and accorded a state funeral.

In 2016, the RAAF Air Power Development Centre and the Australian Centre for the Study of Armed Conflict and Society at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a> jointly established the Sir James Rowland Air Power Seminar to further "a broadened understanding of the origins, evolution, application and depiction of air power in the national interest".

The Million Dollar Homepage

The Million Dollar Homepage is a <a href="website">website</a> conceived in 2005 by Alex Tew, a student from <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>, England, to raise money for his <a href="university%20education">university education</a>. The <a href="home%20page">home page</a> consisted of a <a href="million">million</a> <a href="pixel">pixel</a>s arranged in a pixel grid; the image-based links on it were sold for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1 per pixel in blocks. The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them, a <a href="Uniform%20Resource%20Locator">URL</a> to which the images were linked, and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a <a href="cursor%20%28computers%29">cursor</a> over the link. The aim of the website was to sell all of the pixels in the image, thus generating a million dollars of income for the creator. "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" has commented that the site inspired other websites that sell pixels.

Launched on 26 August 2005, the website became an <a href="Internet%20phenomenon">Internet phenomenon</a>. The <a href="Alexa%20Internet">Alexa</a> ranking of <a href="web%20traffic">web traffic</a> peaked at around 127; , it was 40,044. On 1 January 2006, the final 1,000 pixels were put up for auction on <a href="eBay">eBay</a>. The auction closed on 11 January with a winning bid of $38,100 that brought the final tally to $1,037,100 in gross.

During the January 2006 auction, the website was subject to a <a href="distributed%20denial-of-service%20attack">distributed denial-of-service attack</a> (DDoS) and ransom demand, which left it inaccessible to visitors for a week while its security system was upgraded. The <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> and <a href="Wiltshire%20Constabulary">Wiltshire Constabulary</a> investigated the attack and extortion attempt.

By July 2017, approximately 37% of the site's links were suffering from <a href="link%20rot">link rot</a>.

Alex Tew, a student from <a href="Cricklade">Cricklade</a> in Wiltshire, England, conceived The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old. He was about to begin a three-year Business Management course at the <a href="University%20of%20Nottingham">University of Nottingham</a>, and was concerned that he would be left with a <a href="student%20loans%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">student loan</a> that could take years to repay. As a money-raising idea, Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1 each; purchasers would add their own image, <a href="logo">logo</a> or advertisement, and have the option of including a <a href="hyperlink">hyperlink</a> to their website. Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than <a href="Pound%20sterling">UK pounds</a>; the US has a larger online population than the UK, and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency. In 2005, the pound was <a href="hard%20currency">strong</a> against the dollar: £1 was worth approximately $1.80, and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers. Tew's setup costs were <a href="Euro">€</a>50, which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web-hosting package. The website went live on 26 August 2005.

The <a href="homepage">homepage</a> featured a <a href="Web%20banner">Web banner</a> with the site's name and a pixel counter displaying the number of pixels sold, a <a href="navigation%20bar">navigation bar</a> containing nine small links to the site's internal <a href="web%20page">web page</a>s, and an empty square grid of 1,000,000 pixels divided into 10,000 100-pixel blocks. Tew promised customers that the site would remain online for at least five years – that is, until at least 26 August 2010.

Because individual pixels are too small to be seen easily, Pixels were sold in 100-pixel "blocks" measuring pixels; the minimum price was thus $100. The first sale, three days after the site began operating, was to an online music website operated by a friend of Tew's. He bought 400 pixels in a block. After two weeks, Tew's friends and family members had purchased a total of 4,700 pixels. The site was initially marketed only through <a href="Word%20of%20mouth%20marketing">word of mouth</a>; however, after the site had made $1,000, a <a href="press%20release">press release</a> was sent out that was picked up by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. The technology news website <a href="The%20Register">The Register</a> featured two articles on The Million Dollar Homepage in September. By the end of the month, The Million Dollar Homepage had received $250,000 and was ranked Number 3 on <a href="Alexa%20Internet">Alexa Internet</a>'s list of "Movers and Shakers" behind the websites for <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> and "<a href="Photo%20District%20News">Photo District News</a>". On 6 October, Tew reported the site received 65,000 unique visitors; it received 1465 <a href="Digg">Digg</a>s, becoming one of the most Dugg links that week. Eleven days later, the number had increased to 100,000 unique visitors. On 26 October, two months after the Million Dollar Homepage was launched, more than 500,900 pixels had been sold to 1,400 customers. By New Year's Eve, Tew reported that the site was receiving hits from 25,000 unique visitors every hour and had an <a href="Alexa%20Internet">Alexa</a> Rank of 127, and that 999,000 of the 1,000,000 pixels had been sold.

On 1 January 2006, Tew announced that because the demand was so great for the last 1,000 pixels, "the most fair and logical thing" to do was auction them on <a href="eBay">eBay</a> rather than lose "the integrity and degree of exclusivity intrinsic to the million-pixel concept" by launching a second Million Dollar Homepage. The auction lasted ten days and received 99 legitimate bids. Although bids were received for amounts as high as $160,109.99, many were either retracted by the bidders or cancelled as hoaxes. "I actually contacted the people by phone and turns out they weren't serious, which is fairly frustrating, so I removed those bidders at the last minute", said Tew. The winning bid was $38,100, placed by MillionDollarWeightLoss.com, an online store selling diet-related products. Tew remarked that he had expected the final bid amount to be higher due to the media attention. The Million Dollar Homepage made a <a href="gross%20%28economics%29">gross</a> total of $1,037,100 in five months. After costs, taxes and a donation to <a href="The%20Prince%27s%20Trust">The Prince's Trust</a>, a charity for young people, Tew expected his <a href="net%20%28economics%29">net</a> income to be $650,000–$700,000.

Pixel purchasers included <a href="Bonanza%20Gift%20Shop">Bonanza Gift Shop</a>, <a href="Panda%20Security">Panda Software</a>, the producers of "", <a href="British%20Schools%20Karting%20Championship">British Schools Karting Championship</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Cool">Book of Cool</a>, <a href="Orange%20United%20Kingdom">Orange</a>, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", <a href="Cheapflights.com">Cheapflights.com</a>, <a href="Schiffer%20Publishing">Schiffer Publishing</a>, <a href="Rhapsody%20%28online%20music%20service%29">Rhapsody</a>, <a href="Tenacious%20D">Tenacious D</a>, <a href="GoldenPalace.com">GoldenPalace.com</a>, <a href="888.com">888.com</a> and other <a href="online%20casino">online casino</a>s, <a href="Independiente%20Records">Independiente Records</a>, <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo!</a>, small privately owned businesses, and companies offering <a href="get-rich-quick%20schemes">get-rich-quick schemes</a>, <a href="online%20dating%20service">online dating service</a>s, <a href="personal%20loan">personal loan</a>s, <a href="free%20sample">free sample</a>s, <a href="website%20design">website design</a>s and holidays.

Following the September press release that first brought attention to the site, The Million Dollar Homepage was featured in articles on <a href="BBC%20Online">BBC Online</a>, <a href="The%20Register">The Register</a>, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", and "<a href="PC%20Pro">PC Pro</a>". Tew also appeared on the national <a href="breakfast%20television">breakfast television</a> programmes "<a href="Sky%20News%20Sunrise">Sky News Sunrise</a>" and "<a href="BBC%20Breakfast">BBC Breakfast</a>" to discuss the website.

By November the website was becoming popular around the world, receiving attention from "<a href="Financial%20Times%20Deutschland">Financial Times Deutschland</a>" in Germany, <a href="Television%20New%20Zealand">TVNZ</a> in New Zealand, <a href="Terra%20Networks">Terra Networks</a> in Latin America, the "<a href="China%20Daily">China Daily</a>", and especially in the United States where it was covered in "<a href="Adweek">Adweek</a>", "<a href="Florida%20Today">Florida Today</a>", and "<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>". Tew hired a US-based publicist to help with the attention from the American media and made a week-long trip to the US, where he was interviewed on <a href="ABC%20News%20Radio">ABC News Radio</a>, the <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News Channel</a>, "<a href="Attack%20of%20the%20Show%21">Attack of the Show!</a>", and local news programmes.

The concept was described as "simple and brilliant", "clever", "ingenious", and "a unique platform [for advertising] which is also a bit of fun". Professor Martin Binks, director of the Nottingham University Institute for Entrepreneurial Innovation, said, "It is brilliant in its simplicity ... advertisers have been attracted to it by its novelty ... the site has become a phenomenon." "<a href="Popular%20Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a>" said, "There's no content. No cool graphics, giveaways or steamy Paris Hilton videos for viewers to salivate over. Imagine a TV channel that shows nothing but commercials, a magazine with nothing but ads. That's The Million Dollar Homepage. An astonishing example of the power of <a href="viral%20marketing">viral marketing</a>". Don Oldenburg of the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" was one of the few without praise for the site, calling it a "cheap, mind-bogglingly lucrative marketing monstrosity, an advertising badlands of spam, banner ads and pop-ups." Oldenburg continues, "it looks like a bulletin board on designer steroids, an advertising train wreck you can't "not" look at. It's like getting every pop-up ad you ever got in your life, at once. It's the Internet equivalent of suddenly feeling like you want to take a shower."

As the final pixels were being auctioned, Tew was interviewed on "<a href="Richard%20%26amp%3B%20Judy">Richard & Judy</a>", and profiled in the online <a href="BBC%20News%20Magazine">BBC News Magazine</a>. "The Wall Street Journal" wrote about The Million Dollar Homepage and its impact on the Internet community. "Mr. Tew himself has taken on celebrity status in the Internet community ... the creative juice ... paints an interesting picture of online entrepreneurship".

Tew dropped out of the business degree the site was set up to fund after one term. In 2008, Tew founded Popjam, an Internet aggregation and <a href="social%20networking">social networking</a> business.

In 2016 Tew was working as an entrepreneur in San Francisco.

On 7 January 2006, three days before the auction of the final 1,000 pixels was due to end, Tew received an e-mail from an organisation called "The Dark Group", and was told The Million Dollar Homepage would become the victim of a <a href="distributed%20denial-of-service%20attack">distributed denial-of-service attack</a> (DDoS) if a ransom of $5,000 was not paid by 10 January. Believing the threat to be a hoax, he ignored it, but a week later received a second e-mail threat: "Hello u website is under us atack to stop the DDoS send us 50000$." Again, he ignored the threat, and the website was flooded with extra traffic and e-mails, causing it to <a href="crash%20%28computing%29">crash</a>. "I haven't replied to any of them as I don't want to give them the satisfaction and I certainly don't intend to pay them any money. What is happening to my website is like terrorism. If you pay them, new attacks will start," Tew said.

The website was inaccessible to visitors for a week until the host server upgraded the security system, and filtered traffic through anti-DDoS software. <a href="Wiltshire%20Constabulary">Wiltshire Constabulary</a>'s Hi-Tech Crime Unit and the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> were called to investigate the extortion and attack; they believed it originated in Russia.

As of August 2015 only the main page is available, with all sub pages returning a not-found status code.

A 2017 study by <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> found that the still-live page demonstrated a considerable degree of <a href="link%20rot">link rot</a>. Of the 2,816 original links, 547 (342,000 pixels, sold for $342,000) were dead, and 489 (145,000 pixels, sold for $145,000) redirected to a different domain. The report also noted, of the remaining links, that "the majority do not seem to reflect their original purpose".

Many other sites sell advertising by pixels. Tew said of the sites, "[they] popped up almost immediately; now there are hundreds of Web sites selling pixels. The copycats are all competing with each other." "...they have very little ads, therefore I guess it’s not going too well for them. The idea only works once and relies on novelty ... any copy-cat sites will only have pure comedy value, whereas mine possibly has a bit of comedy PLUS some actual pull in advertising dollars ... so I say good luck to the imitators!"

Ellis Paul

Ellis Paul (born Paul Plissey; January 14, 1965) is an American <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> and <a href="folk%20music">folk</a> musician. Born in <a href="Aroostook%20County%2C%20Maine">Aroostook County, Maine</a>, Paul is a key figure in what has become known as the <a href="Boston">Boston</a> school of songwriting, a literate, provocative, and urbanely romantic <a href="Folk%20music">folk-pop</a> style that helped ignite the folk revival of the 1990s. His <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a> songs have appeared in movies and on television, bridging the gap between the modern folk sound and the <a href="populism">populist</a> traditions of <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> and <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>.

Paul grew up in a small Maine town. He attended <a href="Boston%20College">Boston College</a> on a track scholarship, majoring in English. Injured during his junior year, Paul began playing guitar to help fill his free time and soon began writing songs. After graduating college Paul played at <a href="open%20mike">open mic</a> nights in the Boston area while working with inner-city school children. He won a Boston Acoustic Underground songwriter competition and gained national exposure on a <a href="Windham%20Hill%20Records">Windham Hill Records</a> compilation which helped him choose music as a career.

Paul had released 19 albums by the end of 2014 and received 14 <a href="Boston%20Music%20Awards">Boston Music Awards</a>, considered the pinnacle of contemporary acoustic music success by some. He has published a book of original lyrics, poems, and drawings and released a DVD that includes a live performance, guitar instruction, and a road-trip documentary. In 2014, his children's CD "Hero in You" was published as a book by Albert Whitman & Company. Paul plays almost 200 live shows a year.

Ellis Paul was born in <a href="Fort%20Kent%2C%20Maine">Fort Kent, Maine</a>, a small, rural potato-farming town near the Canada–US border. Paul's family had strong connections to the potato industry — his father, Ed Plissey, was Executive Director of the Maine Potato Commission and his grandfather owned a potato farm. Schools in the area closed for three weeks each year so that school children could help with the potato harvest. Paul spent many hours working on his grandfather's farm. Paul's mother, the former Marilyn Bonney of <a href="Buckfield%2C%20Maine">Buckfield, Maine</a>, is a <a href="University%20of%20Maine">University of Maine</a> graduate and was an <a href="extension%20agent">extension agent</a> for northern Aroostook County. She and her husband often worked together on special projects for the service. In the 1960s, Mrs. Plissey produced her own television show "The Aroostook Homemaker" which aired every third week on <a href="Presque%20Isle%2C%20Maine">Presque Isle</a> television station <a href="WAGM-TV">WAGM-TV</a>.

While attending high school in <a href="Presque%20Isle%2C%20Maine">Presque Isle, Maine</a>, Paul listened to <a href="Top%2040%20%28radio%20format%29">Top-40 radio</a> and participated in <a href="Track%20and%20field">track</a>. He played <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a> in the school's stage band where he was introduced to the <a href="big%20band">big band</a> <a href="jazz">jazz</a> music of <a href="Stan%20Kenton">Stan Kenton</a> and <a href="Maynard%20Ferguson">Maynard Ferguson</a>. He excelled in track, becoming the Maine State champion in <a href="5000%20meters">five-kilometer distance running</a>, a feat that garnered several <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a> offers, including an offer from Boston College. Having graduated high school with the class of 1983, Paul relocated to <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, leaving small-town rural life behind. In an interview with Daniel Gewertz of the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" Paul stated, "It wasn't until I went to Boston College on a track scholarship that I first heard folk." Paul was particularly moved when he heard <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> singing "<a href="The%20House%20of%20the%20Rising%20Sun">The House of the Rising Sun</a>". It was then that he began to take folk music seriously.

Paul was inducted into the Presque Isle High School Athletic Hall of Fame (under his birth name, Paul Plissey) on Jan. 11, 2013.

Paul majored in English at Boston College where he continued to participate in track. His best time in the 10,000 meters (30:18:50) remains the fourth best men's outdoor record in Boston College history. When a knee injury in his junior year sidelined him from athletics, Paul picked up an <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a> to pass the time. He taught himself to play guitar with the help of a "Hits of the 70s" songbook, and began to write songs. Boston radio included a classic hits station that played the music of Bob Dylan, <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a> and <a href="James%20Taylor">James Taylor</a>; artists who were mostly unfamiliar to Paul. Within a few years they became major influences. Having a career in music was the furthest thing from Paul's mind at that point, but as his playing and writing improved it became a bigger focus in his life. In an interview with "FolkWax" journalist Arthur Wood, Paul stated:
"I started playing and learned a few songs by other writers to begin with. I started writing originals within a few months. My songs were pretty horrendous to begin with. They kept getting better and better. When I graduated, I started playing at open mics in bars in Boston. Eventually discovered that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played. I got involved in that circuit. I think that's why I've become so lyric conscious — because of those listening rooms, where you really have to rely on words in those situations."

The open mic circuit in the Boston area included The <a href="Nameless%20Coffeehouse">Nameless Coffeehouse</a> in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, <a href="Westborough%2C%20Massachusetts">Westborough</a>'s Old Vienna Kaffeehouse and The Naked City Coffeehouse in <a href="Allston%2C%20Massachusetts">Allston</a>. Paul became a regular face at those clubs along with other young folk musicians such as <a href="Shawn%20Colvin">Shawn Colvin</a>, <a href="Patty%20Griffin">Patty Griffin</a>, <a href="Dar%20Williams">Dar Williams</a> and <a href="Vance%20Gilbert">Vance Gilbert</a>. In 1989 he won the Nameless Coffeehouse's New Songwriter Award. Paul played Cambridge's <a href="Club%20Passim">Club Passim</a>, a venue that would become his "home" venue, for the first time when he opened for <a href="John%20Gorka">John Gorka</a> in October 1989. Less than four years later he performed his first shows at Passim as a headliner. The three consecutive nights of shows took place on February 19–21, 1993.

It was at the Old Vienna that Paul met Jon Svetkey, Brian Doser and <a href="Jim%20Infantino">Jim Infantino</a>, all struggling young local musicians. In 1989 the four young men formed a collective called "End Construction" and in 1990 released a compilation of songs titled "Resume Speed: New Artist Compilation" on the End Construction Productions label. The four songwriters each performed four of his own original songs on the CD release. The "Resume Speed" liner notes stated that End Construction Productions was a small independent production, promotion and recording company run by songwriters and musicians "hellbent on getting the good music out there." In the interview with Wood, Paul stated that the four songwriters started doing group shows together and collaborated on each other's material. Although he goes on to say that the collaboration "was a good thing" and that the four musicians learned a lot from each other, eventually the foursome "burned out on the competitiveness". The collaboration lasted three years.

Following his graduation from Boston College in 1987, Paul worked a day-job at the COMPASS school as a teacher and <a href="social%20worker">social worker</a> with inner city school children performing at open mics three or four nights a week. It was not until the fall of 1992 that he quit his day-job to pursue music as a full-time career. During this period Paul met his manager, Ralph Jaccodine, and together they founded Black Wolf Records. In 1989 the label released Paul's first two albums of original material: "Am I Home" and "Urban Folksongs" and Paul began touring outside the Boston area. Although originally released on cassette, the two albums were re-released on CD in 2001.

Winning the Boston Acoustic Underground Award in 1991 resulted in Paul playing to the largest crowd of his career to that point – 300. He continued to play in and around the New England area. Around this time, Windham Hill Records, which had previously released the "" songwriter compilation, put a call out to the music industry asking for songwriter submissions to be considered for the follow-up "" compilation. After the Old Vienna Kaffeehouse sent one of Paul's tapes to Windham Hill, Paul's "Ashes to Dust" from "Urban Folksongs" was chosen to be on the compilation. In the interview with Wood, Paul stated that he felt very excited to be on the Windham Hill release because it served as a calling card that every DJ and folk promoter in the country would recognize. "Legacy II" was released in 1992 and included songs performed by <a href="Patty%20Larkin">Patty Larkin</a>, <a href="Patty%20Griffin">Patty Griffin</a>, <a href="Greg%20Brown%20%28folk%20musician%29">Greg Brown</a>, <a href="Cheryl%20Wheeler">Cheryl Wheeler</a> and several others. "Legacy II" was Paul's first national exposure.

After Paul opened for <a href="Bill%20Morrissey">Bill Morrissey</a> several times, Morrissey became one of Paul's earliest mentors. Morrissey introduced Paul to the traditional songwriting of Woody Guthrie and <a href="Mississippi%20John%20Hurt">Mississippi John Hurt</a>, as well as songwriters of the 60s, such as <a href="Randy%20Newman">Randy Newman</a>. In a 2001 interview with Scott Alarik, Morrissey said that Paul jumped into listening to traditional songwriters "bigtime" and as a result is a much better writer and performer.

Paul asked Morrissey to produce his first album "Say Something", which was released in 1993 on Black Wolf records. Fiddler <a href="Johnny%20Cunningham">Johnny Cunningham</a> and guitarist Duke Levine, both friends of Morrissey's, can be heard on the recording along with the background vocals of Patty Griffin. Scott Alarik wrote: "As his lovely, demanding and brilliant debut album "Say Something" attests, there is a precocious credibility and emotional truth to his real-life ballads."

Levine would co-produce Paul's follow-up release "Stories", which was released on Black Wolf in 1994 and re-released on Rounder Records the following year. It was also in 1994 that Paul was first invited to play the <a href="Kerrville%20Folk%20Festival">Kerrville Folk Festival</a>, winning the Kerrville New Folk award.

Paul became a follower of the music of Woody Guthrie during the early 1990s. In a 1998 "Boston Globe" article, Paul refers to a tattoo of Woody Guthrie on his right shoulder saying that Woody's image was the only thing he could put on his body that would be "like a badge of who he was." Paul's tattoo of Woody Guthrie resulted in a chance meeting with Nora Guthrie, Woody Guthrie's daughter, at a <a href="Folk%20Alliance">Folk Alliance</a> Conference when Nora asked to see Paul's tattoo. That chance meeting resulted in Paul being invited to perform at a Woody Guthrie tribute show at the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in Cleveland, Ohio. The 10-day celebration, held in September 1996, included other notable musicians such as <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>, <a href="Billy%20Bragg">Billy Bragg</a>, <a href="Indigo%20Girls">The Indigo Girls</a> and <a href="Ani%20DiFranco">Ani DiFranco</a>. DiFranco's record label, <a href="Righteous%20Babe%20Records">Righteous Babe</a>, released a compilation of the event, "Til We Outnumber 'Em", in 2000.

<a href="Jerry%20Marotta">Jerry Marotta</a>, a drummer who had worked with <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>, produced Paul's third CD release "A Carnival of Voices" which was released on Rounder in 1996. Marotta brought in bassist <a href="Tony%20Levin">Tony Levin</a>, guitarist Bill Dillon, and once again Duke Levine. Paul stated that "A Carnival of Voices" comprised character sketches of different people in different towns tied to "the carnival mentality of traveling." "A Carnival of Voices" hit #3 on The CMJ New Music Report Triple chart and <a href="World%20Caf%C3%A9">World Café</a> voted it the #1 album of the year. By 1997 Paul's mailing list passed 7,000 names as his fan-base continued to grow.

As Paul's reputation and popularity grew, he was asked to return to folk venues and festivals around the country including the <a href="Falcon%20Ridge%20Folk%20Festival">Falcon Ridge Folk Festival</a>, the <a href="Kerrville%20Folk%20Festival">Kerrville Folk Festival</a> and the <a href="Newport%20Folk%20Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a>. The number of shows he performed annually increased to more than 200. Although Paul performed mostly self-penned songs, he would often include a Woody Guthrie song into his set. Woody's "Hard Travelin'" was always a crowd pleaser, especially in Oklahoma, Woody's birthplace. In July 1998, the 1st <a href="Woody%20Guthrie%20Folk%20Festival">Woody Guthrie Folk Festival</a> was held in Woody's hometown of <a href="Okemah%2C%20Oklahoma">Okemah, Oklahoma</a>. Not only did Paul headline the festival along with Billy Bragg, but the city of Okemah made him an <a href="honorary%20citizen">honorary citizen</a>. Paul stated that when he made the pilgrimage to Okemah he felt that he was walking in Woody's footsteps and that the experience was "like going to the <a href="Mount%20of%20Olives">mount</a>". Paul's sixth CD, "Translucent Soul", was released later that year in October. Again produced by Jerry Marotta, the title track is a song about his relationship with good friend Vance Gilbert and tackles the issue of <a href="racism">racism</a>.

At the end of the decade, Paul was invited to perform at Club Passim's 40th anniversary show. The event took place on January 16, 1999, at the <a href="Sanders%20Theater">Sanders Theater</a> in Cambridge. The four-hour sold-out concert also included Patty Larkin, <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a>, <a href="The%20Nields">The Nields</a>, and others. Joan Anderman, covering the event for the "Boston Globe", reported that Paul's "thinking-person's poetry" at the Sanders theater was "embellished with the bite of an electric guitarist and the earthy cool of a percussionist", and that his set was "a model of modern organic grace".

Paul released his first live recording, simply titled "Live", on March 14, 2000. The double-disk included recordings from several shows, as well as previously unreleased studio tracks. Highlights of the year 2000 included Paul singing the National Anthem at <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, and having his song "The World Ain't Slowing Down" chosen for the theme song in the <a href="Farrelly%20brothers">Farrelly brothers</a> movie "<a href="Me%2C%20Myself%20and%20Irene">Me, Myself and Irene</a>" starring <a href="Jim%20Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> and <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Zellweger">Renée Zellweger</a>. Both events took place on the same June weekend. In November 2001, Paul was again successful in having a song in a movie when "Sweet Mistakes" was featured in "<a href="Shallow%20Hal">Shallow Hal</a>" starring <a href="Gwyneth%20Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and <a href="Jack%20Black">Jack Black</a>. Paul released his 8th CD, "Sweet Mistakes", a collection of audience-favorites not yet recorded, on November 15, 2001. In January 2002, Paul was named the "FolkWax" Artist of the Year for 2001.
Paul often recites original poetry for his audiences. Some of those poems can be found in "Notes from the Road", a collection of Paul's original poems, lyrics, and journal entries published by Black Wolf Press in May 2002. In her review for "Performing Songwriter", Abby White said, "The book has an intimate, conversational tone, and Paul's childlike drawings, song lyrics and poetry provide commercial breaks to his personal journal entries and vivid recollections of significant events he encounters while touring". As the 21st century began Paul recited his "Millennium Poem", regularly at shows.

In 2002 Paul became friends with Nora Guthrie. Nora Guthrie is <a href="executive%20director">executive director</a> of the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives in New York City where hundreds of Woody Guthrie's handwritten lyrics — many without music — are housed. She invited Paul to visit the Archives and choose one set of lyrics to put to song. Referring to the huge undertaking of finding songwriters to write music for hundreds of her father's lyrics, Nora Guthrie stated that there was a "job description" that her father left behind that "Ellis took on". Paul chose "God's Promise", lyrics that Woody had adapted in 1955 from "What God Hath Promised", a hymn of the day and recorded it for his 2002 release "Speed of Trees". Paul said that visiting the Woody Guthrie Archives was like going through a time capsule of his biggest hero and that the posthumous collaboration with Woody Guthrie was one of the "coolest things" he'd ever done. The of the TV series "<a href="Ed%20%28TV%20series%29">Ed</a>" featured Paul's "If You Break Down".
Paul's connection to Woody Guthrie continued into 2003 when he was invited to perform in the Ribbon of Highway, Endless Skyway tribute show to honor Woody Guthrie. The ensemble show, which was the brainchild of Texas singer-songwriter <a href="Jimmy%20Lafave">Jimmy LaFave</a>, toured around the country and included a rotating cast of singer-songwriters individually performing Guthrie's songs. Interspersed between songs were Guthrie's philosophical writings read by a narrator. In addition to LaFave and Paul, members of the rotating cast included <a href="Slaid%20Cleaves">Slaid Cleaves</a>, <a href="Eliza%20Gilkyson">Eliza Gilkyson</a>, <a href="Joel%20Rafael">Joel Rafael</a>, husband-wife duo <a href="Sarah%20Lee%20Guthrie%20%26amp%3B%20Johnny%20Irion">Sarah Lee Guthrie</a> (Woody Guthrie's granddaughter) and <a href="Sarah%20Lee%20Guthrie%20%26amp%3B%20Johnny%20Irion">Johnny Irion</a>, <a href="Michael%20Fracasso">Michael Fracasso</a>, and <a href="The%20Burns%20Sisters">The Burns Sisters</a>. Oklahoma songwriter Bob Childers, sometimes called "the Dylan of the Dust," served as narrator. When word spread about the tour, performers began contacting LaFave whose only prerequisite was to have an inspirational connection to Guthrie. Each artist chose the Guthrie songs that he or she would perform as part of the tribute. One of the songs Gilkyson chose was "Pastures of Plenty", while Cleaves chose "This Morning I Am Born Again" - a song he wrote using Guthrie's lyrics. One of the songs Paul chose was a song he wrote using Guthrie's lyrics - "God's Promise". LaFave said, "It works because all the performers are Guthrie enthusiasts in some form". The Ribbon of Highway tour kicked off on February 5, 2003, at the <a href="Ryman%20Auditorium">Ryman Auditorium</a> in Nashville. The abbreviated show was a featured segment of "Nashville Sings Woody", yet another tribute concert to commemorate the music of Woody Guthrie held during the Folk Alliance Conference. The cast of "Nashville Sings Woody", a benefit for the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives, also included <a href="Arlo%20Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>, <a href="Marty%20Stuart">Marty Stuart</a>, <a href="Nanci%20Griffith">Nanci Griffith</a>, <a href="Guy%20Clark">Guy Clark</a>, <a href="Ramblin%27%20Jack%20Elliott">Ramblin' Jack Elliott</a>, <a href="Janis%20Ian">Janis Ian</a>, and others.

Paul's "3000 Miles" <a href="DVD">DVD</a> was released in February 2003. Divided into four segments, the DVD begins with a live show recorded on October 3, 2001, at Boston's Somerville Theater - a show that was the final date of a six-week tour with <a href="Susan%20Werner">Susan Werner</a>. The second segment is a 39-minute road movie filmed in 1995 by Matt Linde, an independent filmmaker who accompanied Paul on a cross-country tour. Individual vignettes chronicle shows, conversations and events in Paul's daily life as a traveling musician. A third segment shows Paul demonstrating the <a href="open%20tuning">open tuning</a>s he uses in many of his songs, while the final segment is a discussion of songwriting with fellow songwriters Christopher Williams and Vance Gilbert. In her review for "<a href="Dirty%20Linen">Dirty Linen</a>", Annette C. Eshleman said, "In just under three hours, viewers are able to watch as Paul evolves from a young, inexperienced folk singer wearing a backwards baseball cap to the highly respected, confident, seasoned performer that he is today".

On May 1, 2004 Paul was the recipient of the 2nd annual Boston College Arts Council Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. The award was presented as part of the sixth annual Boston College Arts Festival. His appearances at the festival also included an "Inside the BC Studio" interview with music writer Scott Alarik, a master class on songwriting, and a concert. In 2004 Paul was also awarded his 13th Boston Music Award in the category of Outstanding Singer/Songwriter. At the time Paul was writing what he called "country tunes" when he teamed up with an Irish musician, producer, and studio expert named Flynn. This resulted in "American Jukebox Fables", released April 5, 2005, a recording produced by Flynn that surprised some fans by melding folk, pop and <a href="electronica">electronica</a>. Paul said that his collaboration with Flynn formed a partnership where he brought banjos and accordions and Flynn brought a laptop and keyboard. Although Paul knew that the end result would fall outside the comfort zone of some fans who expected another acoustic folk album, experimenting with Flynn's musical chemistry set injected excitement and fun into the recording project.

Since approximately 1995 (no one seems to know for certain), Paul has annually played Club Passim over New Year's, performing two shows on December 30 and two shows on New Year's Eve. In early 2006 Black Wolf Records released "Live at Club Passim", a recording compiled from Paul's 2005 New Year's Eve shows. In May 2006, Paul toured Europe and England playing to sold-out shows in <a href="Paris%2C%20France">Paris, France</a>; <a href="Twickenham">Twickenham</a>, <a href="England">England</a>; <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, England and <a href="Wasserburg%20am%20Inn">Wasserburg</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. The tour also included two BBC radio interviews and a radio interview in Paris. Paul was included on the Woody Guthrie Coalition's DVD "Woody Sez: a Tribute to Woody Guthrie" released in 2006. The tribute show, recorded July 13, 2005 at the Crystal Theater in <a href="Okemah%2C%20Oklahoma">Okemah, Oklahoma</a>, included Paul performing a duet with The Burns Sisters on "God's Promise". Also released in 2006 was Paul's "best of" album, released as "Ellis Paul Essentials", on October 10. The two-disk retrospective of Paul's 15-year career contained some songs that were absolutes and others that were included based on polls held on his <a href="website">website</a> and <a href="discussion%20board">discussion board</a>. In his "Folkwax" review of Ellis Paul "Essentials", Arthur Wood stated: "If you've never visited "musically" with Mr. Ellis Paul, "Essentials" is a stunning place to start." In his review for "The Washington Post", Mike Joyce said "
"Essentials", a career-spanning double CD from veteran singer-songwriter Ellis Paul, has a few newly produced, <a href="John%20Jennings%20%28musician%29">John Jennings</a>-helmed tracks of previously recorded tunes that help set this compilation apart from most retrospectives." In her review for <a href="Sing%20Out%21">Sing Out!</a>, Kari Estren said "Paul's "Essentials" is just that and a must for your folk collection."

In January 2008, Paul released a children's and family record entitled "The Dragonfly Races". Inspired after the birth of his second daughter, Paul said that he wanted to teach his children about the world through the use of music. The songs are meant to be enjoyed by both children and adults, and Paul said "I wanted my kids to hear music with social commentary and some fantasy involved." Scott Alarik said "Paul sings movingly about what really worries new parents, and turns lazy dragonflies, gentle monsters, and resilient roses into useful metaphors for world peace, the power of faith, and the delights of a sleepy day." In April 2008 the Parents' Choice Foundation awarded "The Dragonfly Races" a Silver Medallion. The <a href="Parents%27%20Choice%20Award">Parents' Choice Award</a>s program honors the best material for children in these categories: books, toys, music and storytelling, magazines, software, videogames, television and websites.

In 2009, country musician <a href="Jack%20Ingram">Jack Ingram</a> chose to record a song written by Paul. According to <a href="Country%20Music%20Television">CMT</a>, Paul's "The World Ain't Slowing Down", may be the song that takes Ingram to the "next level". Ingram says "It'll be fun for me to expose people to a fantastic song from an artist who's had a 20-year career of being a very successful folk artist."

Paul's sixteenth CD, "The Day After Everything Changed", was released on January 12, 2010. Rather than work with a record label, Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation. Although Paul wasn't sure what to expect when the United States economy collapsed, the fan-funding initiative resulted in more than $100,000 being collected - more, according to Paul, - than any label had ever spent on him. Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by <a href="Kristian%20Bush">Kristian Bush</a> that includes a duet on the track, "Paper Dolls", Paul says the fan support inspired him to make "the best record I could". One reviewer wrote: "This is such a tuneful, beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music—storytellers with empathy, fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless, indifferent world our music doesn't have to reflect our culture." In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is "a masterwork filled with the best music and lyrics of his career."

Five concerts commemorating Paul's 20th anniversary in the music business took place at Boston's Club Passim the weekend of July 9–10, 2010. Paul performed his eight solo albums in chronological order over four shows. In addition, he also performed a children's concert. The Mayor of Boston, Thomas M. Menino, proclaimed July 9, 2010 as Ellis Paul Day in the City of Boston.

<a href="WUMB">WUMB</a> announced that its listeners voted "The Day After Everything Changed" one of the Top 10 CDs of 2010.

Paul's second children's album, "The Hero in You", was released on January 1, 2012. The songs on the album are all written about persons who Paul considers to be American heroes including <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, <a href="Georgia%20O%27Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, and <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a>. The album is Paul's attempt to teach children about some of America's most famous heroes. "I was a big fan of <a href="Schoolhouse%20Rock">Schoolhouse Rock</a> in the 70s. There was always a really great charm about the music. The main reason I can still remember the <a href="Preamble%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Preamble of the Constitution</a> is because of those little songs", Paul said. The illustrations in the accompanying lyrics booklet were all created by Paul.

In a review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said that "The Hero in You" contains some of the best melodies and most moving lyrics of Paul's career. She goes on to cite "<a href="Chief%20Joseph">Chief Joseph</a>" as an example - a song that incorporates one of the most famous quotes in <a href="Native%20American%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> history: "I will fight no more forever".

"The Hero in You" received a Gold Medal from the Parents' Choice Foundation.

Paul's first Christmas album, "City of Silver Dreams", was released on December 1, 2012. Produced by Flynn, the album consists of nine original songs - several co-written with Kristian Bush - and one cover song, the classic "Have Yourself a Very Merry Christmas" written by <a href="Hugh%20Martin">Hugh Martin</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Blane">Ralph Blane</a>. In her review for "No Depression", Holley Dey wrote: "It's a collection with multifaceted personality, offering both melodic romanticism and a folk styled humor that twinkles with good natured fun."

On July 12, 2014, Paul was one of four performers inducted into the Maine Music Awards Hall of Fame. The awards ceremony took place in the Portland (Maine) Civic Center. Paul performed along with other members of the inaugural class which included <a href="Don%20McLean">Don McLean</a>, <a href="Howie%20Day">Howie Day</a>, and <a href="David%20Mallett">David Mallett</a>.

Paul's 19th and second fan-funded album, "Chasing Beauty", was released on September 9, 2014. The 14-track CD was produced by <a href="Kristian%20Bush">Kristian Bush</a> <a href="Sugarland%20%28band%29">(Sugarland)</a> and Brandon Bush <a href="Train%20%28band%29">(Train)</a> and recorded primarily in Decatur, Georgia. Paul is supported by Kristian Bush (acoustic/electric guitar, mandolin, banjo, bass), Brandon Bush (keyboards), Sugarland’s Travis McNabb (drums), Gray Griggs (bass), Megan Lovell (lap steel), Tim Smith (bass), Ben Torres (trombone), Michael Snell (trumpet) and Brandyn Taylor (baritone sax). <a href="Rebecca%20Loebe">Rebecca Loebe</a> and <a href="Red%20Molly">Red Molly</a> make guest appearances.

Paul was invited to present the keynote address at the 2015 NERFA (Northeast Regional Folk Alliance) conference held Nov. 12-15, 2015 at the Hudson Valley Resort in Kerhonkson, New York. The 26-minute address presented on Nov. 13, 2015 was later published on his website and on YouTube.

In late 2015, an announcement was made that Paul's song "Nelly Bly" from the album "Hero in You" would appear in the movie 
<a href="10%20Days%20in%20a%20Madhouse">10 Days in a Madhouse</a> being released in the fall of 2015.

In September 2003 Paul released "Side of the Road", a duo album recorded with good friend Vance Gilbert. The two songwriters, who have often shared the stage, each chose four cover songs to record - individual favorites - plus one song of their own. Although the album did not start out as a "9/11" project, the inclusion of <a href="Mark%20Erelli">Mark Erelli</a>'s "The Only Way" set a theme. A review in "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28magazine%29">No Depression</a>" magazine said this about Paul and Gilbert's choice of songs:

"Thematically they're mostly about individuals — indeed, an entire planet — in desperate need of healing. To that end, Paul's original tune "Citizen of the World" is a wonderful balm, as he and Gilbert trade lyrics about the crossed bloodlines, attitudes and experiences that make us all brothers and sisters. Their version of Van Morrison's "Comfort You" works magic of a similar sort."

<a href="Sugarland">Sugarland</a>'s first holiday album, "<a href="Gold%20and%20Green">Gold and Green</a>" released on October 13, 2009 includes "City of Silver Dreams" and "Little Wood Guitar", co-written by Paul and <a href="Kristian%20Bush">Kristian Bush</a>. In his review of the album, Matt Bjorke wrote, "City of Silver Dreams" could actually find itself a seminal holiday song like Joni Mitchell's <a href="River%20%28Joni%20Mitchell%20song%29">"River"</a> as it tells a wonderfully soft and melodic story of New York City and the beauty of a new romance within the context of Christmas."

"Boston-style" songwriting refers to the introspective and literate breed of singer-songwriter so prevalent in the modern folk music landscape. According to Paul, Boston-style songwriting grew out of Boston's thriving folk scene with its dense collection of colleges, college radio stations and listening rooms. Boston radio includes the University of Massachusetts' <a href="WUMB-FM">WUMB</a>, the country's foremost radio station for folk and acoustic music 24-hours a day. Paul said the Boston songwriters tend to be more thoughtful and soft because in an intimate listening room, "all you've got is you and your words." Boston-style songwriting tends to be more about lyric than <a href="melody">melody</a>, is intimate and thoughtful but also relevant, often addressing <a href="social%20issues">social issues</a>. Boston-style songwriting does not only refer to Boston musicians, but includes national artists such as Shawn Colvin, John Gorka, Susan Werner, Bill Morrissey, and Dar Williams. In an interview with Paul Freeman for the "East Bay Daily News", Paul commented on how he hopes audience members relate to his songs, "Each song is supposed to be like a little three-dimensional world. I'm hoping to invite them in, have them make out the details and the reasons for being there, and apply them to their own lives. But I'm also hoping to entertain them."

After graduating from Boston College, Paul worked as a case worker at an inner city school in the <a href="Jamaica%20Plain">Jamaica Plain</a> section of Boston, working with children with behavioral problems and also worked as a <a href="social%20worker">social worker</a> in Boston with clients who were drug dealers, rapists, and other kinds of criminal offenders. His work experiences opened his eyes to see the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write. Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well. In her review of "Ellis Paul Live" for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels. His is a poet's heart, and a romantic's soul. He is an optimist who believes in people and possibilities."
In her 1993 review of Paul's "Say Something", Debbie Catalano wrote, "Ellis Paul draws a picture with his words then draws you into the world he's painting." Like a <a href="Norman%20Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> painting, Paul's songs are replete with crucial details and careful observations that tell a story with a minimum or words. In a 2002 article, Thomas Conner dissected a verse from Paul's "Conversation with a Ghost" from "Say Something". "Instead of bluntly saying, "I ran into an old flame in <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>", Paul writes around it, avoiding the clichés, painting the picture, showing us everything—the motives, the setting, the serendipity—except what we expect."

When teaching songwriting classes, Paul often introduces aspiring songwriters to his "six-step program to effective songwriting" which is based on the premise that songwriters should show and not tell. Paul teaches this six-step method to develop a character in a song:


The most important advice he gives aspiring songwriters is to write what you know or what you've experienced. "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. "The journalist looks out the window and writes about what is really happening." "I make sure it's real. I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with."

When asked to describe the difference between writing songs for children and song for adults, Paul said: "The difference between writing a kids' song and an adult song is that in the kids' songs you tend to use primary colors and the words are brighter and the tempos are always upbeat. There's a nuance to the adult songs that is different. It's still the story telling, but its different shades and angles. You read between the lines more."

Paul continues playing close to 200 dates annually on the folk circuit. His songs have appeared on more than 50 <a href="compilation%20CD">compilation CD</a>s, and he has made nearly 40 guest appearances on the albums of artists including <a href="Lori%20McKenna">Lori McKenna</a>, <a href="David%20Wilcox%20%28American%20musician%29">David Wilcox</a> and Mark Erelli. When asked if he would rather play the 19,600-seat Fleet Theater or the 900-seat Somerville Theater – both in Boston, Paul replied, "I prefer to keep it intimate. That way people can see the whites of your eyes. I'd love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like "American Pie" or something, but I'm just gonna do what I do and take what I can and run with it, because it's a hard business to have even what I have. So I don't have <a href="wikt%3Apie%20in%20the%20sky">pie-in-the-sky</a> Springsteen-esque hopes. I just want to write great songs."

In a review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, "Ellis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation. And for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music—few are as smart, as literate and as poetic as Paul. He has spun his story songs for nearly twenty years now, and has eleven studio recordings (with an additional two early recordings on cassette—now available on CD) to his credit. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene who is better-loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries."

On September 1, 2014, Paul's children's CD "Hero in You" was published as a book by Albert Whitman & Company. Illustrated by Angela Padron, the book of American biographies includes a copy of the CD with exclusive introductory tracks by Paul. The accompanying CD allows young readers to listen to each song while discovering additional facts about Paul's heroes on each page.

Paul's second children's book was published - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015. Based on his Christmas poem "The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas", the book, illustrated by Scott Brundage, is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness. The poem originally appeared on Paul's "City of Silver Dreams" Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book.

In September 2012, <a href="Presque%20Isle%20High%20School">Presque Isle High School</a> announced that Paul would be one of four high school graduates inducted into its Athletic Hall of Fame at the third annual ceremony on January 11, 2013. During his high school career, Paul - a member of the class of 1983 - starred in <a href="Cross%20country%20running">cross-country</a> and <a href="Track%20and%20field">track</a>. He won a cross-country state championship as a senior as well as three Eastern Maine titles and a 5,000-meter state crown in track. He also finished second in the 15-16 age division of the 1981 AAU national cross-country championships and later during his career placed seventh in the 17-18 age group at the <a href="AAU%20Junior%20Olympic%20Games">AAU Junior Olympic</a> national championships.

Coinciding with the Athletic Hall of Fame induction ceremony were two performances to benefit the Wintergreen Arts Center, one at The Whole Potato Cafe and Commons and one at the <a href="University%20of%20Maine%20at%20Presque%20Isle">University of Maine at Presque Isle's</a> Wieden Auditorium.

On May 17, 2014 Paul was the commencement address speaker at the <a href="University%20of%20Maine%20at%20Presque%20Isle">University of Maine at Presque Isle's</a> 105th commencement. Paul was also awarded an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Humane%20Letters">Doctor of Humane Letters</a> degree during the commencement ceremony. At the conclusion of his commencement address, Paul performed his composition "Rise Up, Presque Isle" which has been adopted as the school's new Alma Mater.

Aitraaz

Aitraaz () is a 2004 Indian <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>-language <a href="romantic%20thriller">romantic thriller</a> film directed by <a href="Abbas%E2%80%93Mustan">Abbas–Mustan</a>. Produced by <a href="Subhash%20Ghai">Subhash Ghai</a>, it stars <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> and <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a>, and features <a href="Amrish%20Puri">Amrish Puri</a>, <a href="Paresh%20Rawal">Paresh Rawal</a> and <a href="Annu%20Kapoor">Annu Kapoor</a> in supporting roles. The screenplay was written by <a href="Shyam%20Goel">Shyam Goel</a> and Shiraz Ahmed, and <a href="Himesh%20Reshammiya">Himesh Reshammiya</a> composed the soundtrack.

The film tells the story of a man accused of <a href="sexual%20harassment">sexual harassment</a> by his female superior. It was released on 12 November 2004 to positive reviews, Chopra receiving widespread critical acclaim for her performance as Sonia Roy. "Aitraaz" was a commercial success, grossing over 260 million at the box office against a budget of 110 million. It has been noted for its bold subject of sexual harassment.

"Aitraaz" received several accolades, particularly for Chopra. At the <a href="50th%20Filmfare%20Awards">50th Filmfare Awards</a>, she received two nominations: <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> and <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20in%20a%20Negative%20Role">Best Performance in a Negative Role</a>, winning the latter and thus becoming the second (and final) actress to win the award. Chopra also won the <a href="Bengal%20Film%20Journalists%27%20Association%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%28Hindi%29">Bengal Film Journalists' Association Award for Best Actress</a> and the <a href="Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Negative%20Role">Screen Award for Best Actor in a Negative Role</a>. The film received ten nominations at the <a href="6th%20IIFA%20Awards">2005 IIFA Awards</a>, winning three.

Raj Malhotra (<a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>) is a product engineer for a telecommunications company, Air Voice. Priya Saxena (<a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a>), a junior lawyer goes to Raj's house for an interview, mistaking him for barrister Ram Chautrani (<a href="Annu%20Kapoor">Annu Kapoor</a>), a neighbour and Raj's friend. They fall in love, marry and are soon expecting a child. Raj expects to be promoted to CEO when the company's chairman (<a href="Amrish%20Puri">Amrish Puri</a>) arrives with his new wife, Sonia Roy (<a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a>) to announce the promotions. Sonia Roy is named the company's new Chairperson; and after a discussion with her husband, she announces the promotions. The CEO position instead goes to Raj's friend Rakesh (<a href="Vivek%20Shauq">Vivek Shauq</a>), while Raj is placed on the Board of Directors. At a party, Raj, accompanied by Priya, learns about his new boss, Sonia Roy. Priya is surprised that Sonia is the wife of the much older Mr Roy. Raj and his colleagues talk about Sonia being very attractive and the age difference between her and her husband, and Raj jokes that his magnetic personality was responsible for his massive promotion. It is implied that Raj may have encountered Sonia previously.

A flashback explores Raj's previous relationship with Sonia. Five years earlier, Raj and Sonia (then a model) meet at a beach in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>. They fall in love and move in together; Sonia becomes pregnant with Raj's child, which makes him happy, but Sonia refuses Raj's marriage proposal and says she is going to terminate the pregnancy as her child would stand in the way of wealth, fame, power and status and their relationship ends.

The next day, Rakesh tells Raj about a defect in the company's new mobile handset: a call goes to two people simultaneously—the intended recipient and another random person on the phone's contact list. Raj needs Sonia's permission to stop production, and she invites him to her house to discuss the matter. Sonia makes provocative and sexually explicit statements to Raj, who ignores her. She then aggressively tries to pursue Raj, who resists. Although he repeatedly rejects her advances, Sonia continues trying to seduce him. As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has told her husband that he sexually harassed her. Since he has admitted finding Sonia attractive, his claim of innocence is not believed, and the company pressures him into resignation.

Raj asks Chauthrani to take his case; Chauthrani tells him not to resign, and to keep going to work. This case goes to court; Sonia and Roy engage a lawyer (<a href="Paresh%20Rawal">Paresh Rawal</a>). Initially, the bulk of the evidence is against Raj and the case gains widespread media attention. Raj's bank manager returns from Bangkok and gives him a tape that recorded Raj's encounter at Sonia's house. After the tape is proven genuine, Chauthrani is struck by a car driven by a goon hired by Sonia and the tape is destroyed. When Priya asks Raj why he called their bank manager from Sonia's house, he replies that he had called Rakesh, and the call went through to the bank manager as well due to the defect in the company handset. Priya continues the case after Chauthrani's injury. She exposes Sonia's earlier relationship with Raj in Cape Town and finally plays Rakesh's voice mail to the court - revealing what really occurred between Raj and Sonia. It is revealed that Sonia married Roy for money, power, and status, but when he could not satisfy her sexually, she tried to resume her relationship with Raj. Priya wins the case and Roy leaves Sonia. Guilt-stricken and humiliated, Sonia commits suicide by jumping from a building. The end credit scene shows Raj and Priya walking their child.

The cast is listed below:

The director duo <a href="Abbas%E2%80%93Mustan">Abbas–Mustan</a> took inspiration from <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> player <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, who was accused of rape by a fan; they began developing the film when they read about <a href="Kobe%20Bryant%20sexual%20assault%20case">his sexual-assault case</a> in the newspapers. About the film's unusual title, they said the word ""aitraaz"" was colloquial and suited the subject. <a href="Shyam%20Goel">Shyam Goel</a> and Shiraz Ahmed wrote the screenplay. Hussain A. Burmawala and <a href="R.%20Verman">R. Verman</a> were responsible for film editing and <a href="Art%20director">art direction</a>, respectively.

The film was announced in October 2003 by producer <a href="Subhash%20Ghai">Subhash Ghai</a>, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company <a href="Mukta%20Arts">Mukta Arts</a>. The media reported that <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a> and <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between Kumar and Chopra after the highly successful "<a href="Andaaz">Andaaz</a>" (2003) and "<a href="Mujhse%20Shaadi%20Karogi">Mujhse Shaadi Karogi</a>" (2004). Kumar was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, Kumar was cast <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">against type</a>; he generally played <a href="action%20hero">action hero</a>es, and they wanted him to underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by <a href="Amrish%20Puri">Amrish Puri</a>), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (Kumar) of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of <a href="sexual%20harassment">sexual harassment</a>, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller "<a href="Humraaz">Humraaz</a>", which she could not do.

Kumar described his character as "realistic" and a "new-age <a href="metrosexual">metrosexual</a>" man. The actor revealed that he enjoyed the strengths and weaknesses of his character, adding "[he] is not afraid to show his feelings and does not feel emasculated by his situation." Kumar further stated: "There's a quiet dignity and heroism associated with my character. He doesn't fight for applause. He fights for his convictions." In an interview with "<a href="Tribune%20India">Tribune India</a>", Kapoor remarked that Indian women would identify with her character. She said her character "stand[s] by [Raj] in his moment of distress and helplessness, like every Indian woman would." Chopra described her character Sonia as "charming and focused", commenting that her "philosophy is that she has to achieve her goals at any cost. She knows one thing: that nothing can come in between her desires and herself." Owing to her conservative upbringing, Chopra found it difficult to identify with her "man-eater role". Playing an "extremely negative character" proved a challenge, and she had to mentally prepare herself for an hour before each scene.

<a href="Manish%20Malhotra">Manish Malhotra</a> and Vikram Phadnis designed the costumes and the cinematography was handled by <a href="Ravi%20Yadav">Ravi Yadav</a>. The film was mainly shot in Cape Town, <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, <a href="Pune">Pune</a> and <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>. Chopra, who was simultaneously filming four other productions, revealed that because of her busy schedule the producers of her other films had to move their sets to the <a href="Filmistan%20Studio">Filmistan Studio</a>, where "Aitraaz" was being made. She wept during filming of the sexual-harassment scene; it took the directors several hours to remind her she was only playing a character, and further filming was postponed. The music video of the title track "Aitraaz – I Want to Make Love to You" with Kumar and Chopra was shot in one take with a <a href="Steadicam">Steadicam</a>. <a href="Salim%E2%80%93Sulaiman">Salim–Sulaiman</a> composed the background score for the film.

"Aitraaz"s soundtrack was composed by <a href="Himesh%20Reshammiya">Himesh Reshammiya</a>, with lyrics by <a href="Sameer%20%28lyricist%29">Sameer</a>. The album contains fifteen songs: seven original, and eight remixes. The vocals were performed by <a href="Udit%20Narayan">Udit Narayan</a>, <a href="Alka%20Yagnik">Alka Yagnik</a>, <a href="Sunidhi%20Chauhan">Sunidhi Chauhan</a>, <a href="Adnan%20Sami">Adnan Sami</a>, <a href="KK%20%28singer%29">K.K.</a>, and <a href="Alisha%20Chinai">Alisha Chinai</a>. It was released on 24 September 2004 by <a href="Sony%20Music">Sony Music</a>.

The soundtrack was generally well received by music critics, who praised its lyrics and vocals. Planet Bollywood gave a rating of 7 out of 10, calling it a "good album". Joginder Tuteja of <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> rated the album 3 out of 5, praising "I Want To Make Love To You" (all three versions): "Sunidhi Chauhan is excellent in this wonderfully-composed track that shocks everyone with the intensity of the lyrics and the music". He concluded, "Except for two or three average songs here and there, the majority of songs in Aitraaz do keep you engaged".

The music topped charts on a number of platforms in India. The soundtrack was one of the best-selling Bollywood soundtracks of the year, with 1.5 million units sold according to <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a>.

The first-look poster of the film, with the tagline "In the world of women, you either play by their rules or else ...", was received positively by critics; the film's trailers were also well received. In October 2004, exclusive footage from the film was screened to the trade experts and critics, creating a positive buzz. The film's trailers and the film's music aided its marketing.

Made on a budget of 110 million, "Aitraaz" was released on 375 screens on 12 November 2004 during the festive <a href="Diwali">Diwali</a> weekend. It clashed with three other major releases: "<a href="Veer-Zaara">Veer-Zaara</a>", the coloured version of "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>", and "<a href="Naach%20%282004%20film%29">Naach</a>". The film opened to excellent occupancy in metros and decent at other places. It was the second best playing release of the week after <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a>'s "Veer-Zaara". According to Box Office India, the film grossed approximately 45 million on its opening weekend and 76 million in its first week at the domestic box office. After its run, "Aitraaz" grossed over 260 million at the box office, becoming the eleventh-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year. The film was deemed a commercial success.

The DVD of the film was released on 6 December 2004 across all regions in a PAL-format single disc. Distributed by <a href="Shemaroo%20Entertainment">Shemaroo Entertainment</a>, it included a making-of-the-film segment and a photo gallery. The VCD version was released at the same time, and <a href="Zee%20Network">Zee Network</a> bought the exclusive broadcast rights. "Aitraaz" made its Indian television premiere on 30 October 2005 on <a href="Zee%20Cinema">Zee Cinema</a>. The film was remade in <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> as "<a href="Shrimathi">Shrimathi</a>" (2011), starring <a href="Upendra%20%28actor%29">Upendra</a>, <a href="Priyanka%20Trivedi">Priyanka Trivedi</a> and <a href="Celina%20Jaitley">Celina Jaitley</a>.

"Aitraaz" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its direction, music and performances, particularly Chopra's. It was noted for its bold subject of sexual harassment. Several critics observed that the premise was similar to the American film "<a href="Disclosure%20%28film%29">Disclosure</a>" (1994). Writing for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, critic Jay Mamtora praised the film's theme, music and performances, and remarked that "Abbas-Mustaan have done a good job in 'Indianising' the whole concept". He went on to describe it as "a gripping edge of the seat drama that keeps viewers glued to their seats". <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> of <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> rated the film 3.5 out of 5, calling it "a well-crafted thriller" and complimenting the directors' opting for "a theme that has been untouched on the Indian screen so far" and the film's "dramatic moments".

Like Mamtora, Adarsh believed that the film belonged entirely to Priyanka Chopra, and was impressed with her understanding of the character, writing that "She sneaks her way through the role like an expert, drawing audience hatred the way a magnet collects iron filings." He also complimented the performances by Kapoor and Kumar. Patcy N of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> noted the film's appeal to the general public, finding its subject matter "something different from the standard fare on offer". She also praised the music and choreography. Writing for "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>", film critic <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> lauded Chopra's "impressive" performance, and deemed the film "good timepass".

<a href="Sudhish%20Kamath">Sudhish Kamath</a> of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" commented that "though the first half of the movie is well-paced, the second half sags with the songs and twists forced into the plot to buy time", but stated that it was "passable with its slick production, a few funny lines, glam quotient and star appeal." <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> criticised the film's "dishy digressions" and "peripheral sub-plots", rating it 2 out of 5 overall, but was impressed with the court scene, which he considered "splendid". He also found Chopra's performance to be a triumph, remarking: "A star is born! As the predatory social-climbing seductress who can go to any length to satiate her lust for life, Priyanka Chopra rocks the scene like never before." Jha believed that Kareena was miscast and seemed a little awkward in a non-glamorous role, but "comes into her own in the climactic courtroom sequence", a sentiment echoed by Jitesh Pillai in his review for "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>". Pillai gave a rating of 3 out of 5 and noted that "it isn't drama that directors were striving for, yet the film works."

Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies

Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies, published from 1757 to 1795, was an annual directory of <a href="prostitutes">prostitutes</a> then working in <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian</a> <a href="London">London</a>. A small pocketbook, it was printed and published in <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>, and sold for two <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a> and <a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">sixpence</a>. A contemporary report of 1791 estimates its circulation at about 8,000 copies annually.

Each edition contains entries describing the physical appearance and sexual specialities of about  prostitutes who worked in and around Covent Garden. Through their erotic prose, the list's entries review some of these women in lurid detail. While most compliment their subjects, some are critical of bad habits, and a few women are even treated as pariahs, perhaps having fallen out of favour with the list's authors, who are never revealed.

<a href="Samuel%20Derrick">Samuel Derrick</a> is the man normally credited for the design of "Harris's List", possibly having been inspired by the activities of a Covent Garden pimp, Jack Harris. A <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a> <a href="Hack%20writer">hack</a>, Derrick may have written the lists from 1757 until his death in 1769; thereafter, the annual's authors are unknown. Throughout its print run it was published pseudonymously by H. Ranger, although from the late 1780s it was printed by three men: John and James Roach, and John Aitkin.

As the public's opinion began to turn against London's sex trade, and with reformers petitioning the authorities to take action, those involved in the release of "Harris's List" were in 1795 fined and imprisoned. That year's edition was the last to be published; by then its content was cruder, lacking the originality of earlier editions. Modern writers tend to view "Harris's List" as erotica; in the words of one author, it was designed for "solitary sexual enjoyment".

The earliest printed editions of "Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies" appeared after Christmas 1756. Published by "H. Ranger", the annual was advertised on the front pages of newspapers, and sold in <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a> and at booksellers' stalls. Each edition comprises an attractive pocketbook, "beautifully packaged ... in the modish style of the twelves". They usually contained no more than 150 pages of relatively thin paper, on which are printed the details of between 120 and 190 <a href="prostitutes">prostitutes</a> then working in Covent Garden. Priced in 1788 at two <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a> and <a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">sixpence</a>, "Harris's List" was affordable for the middle classes but expensive for a working class man.

It was not the first directory of prostitutes to be circulated in London. The "Wandering Whore" ran for five issues between 1660 and 1661, in the early (and newly liberal) years of the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a>. Allegedly an exposé of the capital's sex trade and usually attributed to John Garfield, it lists streets in which prostitutes might have been found, and the locations of brothels in areas like Fleet Lane, <a href="Long%20Acre%20%28street%29">Long Acre</a> and <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn%20Fields">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a>. The "Wandering Whore" incorporates dialogue between "Magdalena, a Crafty Whore, Julietta, an Exquisite Whore, Francion, a Lascivious Gallant, and Gusman, a Pimping Hector", with the caveat that it was disseminated only so that law-abiding folk might avoid such people. Another publication was "A Catalogue of Jilts, Cracks & Prostitutes, Nightwalkers, Whores, She-friends, Kind Women and other of the Linnen-lifting Tribe", printed in 1691. This catalogues the physical attributes of 21 women who could be found about <a href="St%20Bartholomew-the-Great">St Bartholomew-the-Great Church</a> during <a href="Bartholomew%20Fair">Bartholomew Fair</a>, in <a href="Smithfield%2C%20London">Smithfield</a>. Mary Holland was apparently "tall, graceful and comely, shy of her favours", but could be mollified "at a cost of £20". Her sister Elizabeth was less expensive, being "indifferent to Money but a Supper and Two Guineas will tempt her".

Each edition of "Harris's List" opens with a <a href="Book%20frontispiece">frontispiece</a> showing a mildly erotic stock image opposite the title page, which, from the 1760s to 1780s, is followed by a lengthy commentary on prostitution. This preamble argues that the prostitute is of benefit to the public, able to relieve man's natural inclination towards violence. It describes the customer as a patron supportive of a good cause: "be your purse strings never closed; nor let the name of prostitute deter you from your pious resolve!" Prostitutes were generally scorned by 18th-century society, and the 1789 edition's preface complains "Why should the victims of this natural propensity ... be hunted like outcasts from society, perpetually gripped by the hand of petty tyranny", continuing: "Is not the minister of state who sacrifices his country's honour to his private interest ... more guilty than her?"
At a basic level, the entries in "Harris's List" detail each woman's age, her physical appearance (including the size of her breasts), her sexual specialities, and sometimes a description of her genitals. Additional information such as how long she had been active as a prostitute, or if she sang, danced or conversed well, is also included. Addresses and prices, which range from five shillings to five <a href="Pound%20sterling">pounds</a>, are provided. The types of prostitute the lists present vary from "low-born errant drabs", to prominent courtesans like <a href="Kitty%20Fisher">Kitty Fisher</a> and <a href="Fanny%20Murray">Fanny Murray</a>; later editions contain only "genteel mannered prostitutes worthy of praise". The charms of a Mrs Dodd, who lived at number six Hind Court in <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a>, were listed in 1788 as "reared on two pillars of monumental alabaster", continuing: "the symmetry of its parts, its "borders" enriched with "wavering tendrils", its "ruby portals", and the "tufted grove", that crowns the summit of the mount, all join to invite the guest to enter." In the same edition, a similarly lurid description precedes the latter part of Miss Davenport's entry, which concludes: "Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is tall, and so well proportioned (when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you to do, if you perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest) that she might be taken for a fourth Grace, or a breathing animated Venus de Medicis ... she has a keeper (a Mr. Hannah) both kind and liberal; notwithstanding which, she has no objection to two supernumerary guineas." Miss Clicamp, of number two York Street near <a href="Middlesex%20Hospital">Middlesex Hospital</a>, is described as "one of the finest, fattest figures as fully finished for fun and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed ... fortunate for the true lovers of fat, should fate throw them into the possession of such full grown beauties." More characteristic of "Harris's List" though, is the 1764 entry for Miss Wilmot, which tells of an amorous encounter with King <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>'s brother, the <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20York%20and%20Albany">Duke of York</a>:

The Duke of York was only one of many famous men to have been mentioned in the lists; others included <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%2C%20King%20of%20Hanover">Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover</a>, the clergyman <a href="William%20Dodd%20%28clergyman%29">William Dodd</a>, <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a>, <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a>, <a href="William%20Hickey%20%28memoirist%29">William Hickey</a>, <a href="Francis%20Needham%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kilmorey">Francis Needham, 1st Earl of Kilmorey</a>, <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a> and many others.

The women's route into the sex trade, as described by the lists, is usually ascribed to youthful innocence, with tales of young girls leaving their homes for the promises of men, only to be abandoned once in London. Some entries mention <a href="rape">rape</a>, euphemistically described as women being "seduced against their will". Lenora Norton was apparently "seduced" in such fashion, her entry elucidating on her experience, which occurred while she was still a child. The "old urban legend" of young girls being apprehended from the crowd by devious bawds is illustrated by <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>'s "<a href="A%20Harlot%27s%20Progress">A Harlot's Progress</a>", but although in reality such stories were not unheard of, women entered into prostitution for a variety of reasons, often mundane. Rural immigrants in search of work could sometimes find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous employers, or manipulated into the sex trade by underhand means. Some entries in "Harris's List" illustrate how some women managed to lift themselves out of penury. Becky LeFevre, once a <a href="streetwalker">streetwalker</a>, used her business sense to amass considerable wealth, as did a Miss Marshall and Miss Becky Child, who are each mentioned in several editions. Many of these women had rich keepers, and some married wealthy aristocrats; Harriet Powell married <a href="Kenneth%20Mackenzie%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Seaforth">Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth</a>, and <a href="Elizabeth%20Armistead">Elizabeth Armistead</a> married <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a>.
Elements of politicisation appear in some entries. The famed prostitute Betsy Cox's 1773 listing describes how, when refused entry to a gathering of polite society at the newly opened <a href="Pantheon%2C%20London">Pantheon</a>, she was helped by, among others, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Fife">Duke of Fife</a>, who drew his sword to enforce her entry. Some lists also contain defences of prostitution; earlier editions claim that the trade guarded against the seduction of young women, provided an outlet for frustrated married men, and kept other young men from ""le péche "" que la Nature désavoue" [the sin that Nature repudiates]", or <a href="sodomy">sodomy</a>. However, no such views were expressed with regard to <a href="lesbianism">lesbianism</a>, which in England, unlike sexual acts between men, has never been illegal. Miss Wilson of <a href="Cavendish%20Square">Cavendish Square</a> thought that "a female bed-fellow can give more real joys than ever she experienced with the male part of the sex", and Anne and Elanor Redshawe provided a discreet service in <a href="Tavistock%20Street">Tavistock Street</a>, catering for "Ladies in the Highest Keeping" and other women who preferred to keep their activities private.

A common complaint regarding street prostitution was the foul language used, and while generally most entries in the lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of "Harris's List" tend towards equivocation. Mrs Cornish's genteel nature was, on occasion, interrupted by "a volley of small shot", and Miss Johnson's proclivity towards "vulgarity of expression and a coarseness of manner" apparently suffered no shortage of admirers. Mrs Russell, attractive to "a number of clients among the youth, who are fond of beholding that mouth of the devil from whence all corruption issueth", was admired for her "vulgarity more than any thing else, she being extremely expert at uncommon oaths". Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home "so intoxicated so as not to be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a "violent attachment to drinking". Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, "often toss off a sparkling bumper," while remaining "a lady of great sensibility ... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited "great indifference" while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was "acting his joys". Others are scorned for wearing too much <a href="makeup">makeup</a>, and some for being "lazy bedfellows". A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.

The identity of the lists' authors is uncertain. Some editions may have been written by Samuel Derrick, a <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a> <a href="Hack%20writer">hack</a> born in 1724 in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, who had moved to London to become an actor. With little success there, he had turned instead to writing, publishing works including "The dramatic censor; being remarks upon the conduct, characters, and catastrophe of our most celebrated plays" (1752), "A Voyage to the Moon" (1753) (a translation of <a href="Cyrano%20de%20Bergerac%20%28writer%29">Cyrano de Bergerac</a>'s "L'Autre Monde: ou les États et Empires de la Lune"), and "The Battle of Lora" (1762). Derrick, who lived with the actress <a href="Jane%20Lessingham">Jane Lessingham</a>, was an acquaintance of <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> and <a href="James%20Boswell">James Boswell</a>. The latter viewed him as "but a poor writer", while Johnson admitted that "if Derrick's letters had been written by one of a more established name, they would have been thought very pretty letters."
<a href="Hallie%20Rubenhold">Hallie Rubenhold</a>'s 2005 book "The Covent Garden Ladies" sets out her interpretation of the story behind "Harris's List". She claims that John Harrison—otherwise known as Jack Harris, a savvy businessman and pimp who worked at the Shakespear's Head Tavern in Covent Garden—was the list's originator. Born perhaps around 1720–1730, Harris apparently had expert knowledge of prostitutes working in Covent Garden and beyond, as well as access to rented rooms and premises for his clients' use. He kept a record of the women he pimped and the properties he had access to, possibly in the form of a small ledger or notebook. Derrick, having previously authored "The Memoirs of the Shakespear's Head", and possibly also its companion piece, "The Memoirs of the Bedford Coffee House", was probably familiar with the Shakespear's Head. The former book details "Jack, a waiter ... who presides over the Venereal Pleasures of this Dome", and its author likely studied Harris as he went about his business. Which of the two men first thought to produce "Harris's List" is unknown, but probably for a one-off payment Harris allowed his name to be attached to it. With his detailed knowledge of Covent Garden, and with help from various associates, Derrick was therefore able to write the first edition of "Harris's List" in 1757. As an aspiring author and social climber he preferred not to associate himself publicly with such questionable material, and his name therefore does not appear on any editions.

Printed and published by the pseudonymous H. Ranger, responsible for such works as "Love Feasts; or the different methods of courtship in every country, throughout the known world", the proceeds from the hugely successful first edition enabled Derrick to repay his debts, thereby freeing himself from a <a href="Sponging-house">spunging house</a>. His fortunes changed for the better when he became <a href="master%20of%20ceremonies">master of ceremonies</a> at <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> and <a href="Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a> in 1763. His death on 28 March 1769 followed a protracted illness, but despite a significant income, he died penniless. He left no official will, but on his deathbed he bequeathed the 1769 edition of "Harris's List" to <a href="Charlotte%20Hayes">Charlotte Hayes</a>, his former friend and mistress, and a madam in her own right. Hayes died in 1813.

As the self-declared "Pimp General of All England", the swaggering Harris amassed a considerable fortune, but his indiscretion proved to be his undoing. Prompted by reformers, in April 1758 the authorities began to hunt down and close "houses of ill fame". Covent Garden was not spared, and the Shakespear's Head Tavern was raided. Harris was caught, locked up in the local <a href="compter">compter</a>, and then imprisoned in <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate</a>. He was released in 1761 and had some interests in publishing from 1765 to 1766, printing <a href="Edward%20Thompson%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Edward Thompson</a>'s "The Courtesan", and later "The Fruit-Shop" and "Kitty's Atlantis", but he seems to have given this up late in 1766. He became the proprietor of the Rose Tavern, not far from the Shakespear's Head, but by the 1780s had delegated its running to an employee. The Rose was demolished about 1790, and for a few years Harris ran another tavern, the Bedford Head, with his son and daughter-in-law. He died sometime in 1792. The Shakespear's Head closed for business in 1804, and four years later the empty premises were badly damaged in the same fire that consumed the <a href="Covent%20Garden%20Theatre">Covent Garden Theatre</a>. What remained was subsumed by the neighbouring Bedford Coffee House.

<a href="Johann%20Wilhelm%20von%20Archenholz">Johann Wilhelm von Archenholz</a> claimed in 1791 that the lists were published by "a tavern-keeper, in Drury lane", and that "eight thousand copies are sold annually." There is nothing to suggest that Hayes had any involvement with any edition other than that of 1769, and the list's authors following Derrick's death have not been identified. From the 1770s "Harris's List" changes focus, moving away from the women of Covent Garden, to their stories. Its prose becomes more genteel, lacking the euphemisms which had helped make it so popular. These changes are echoed by the front cover, whose frontispiece becomes more gentrified. Material from earlier editions is recycled, and little attention is paid to accuracy. The responsibility for some of these changes can be attributed to John and James Roach, and John Aitkin, who from the late 1780s were the lists' publishers.

In 1795 the <a href="Proclamation%20Society">Proclamation Society</a>, created several years earlier to help enforce King <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>'s proclamation against "loose and licentious Prints, Books, and Publications, dispersing Poison to the minds of the Young and Unwary", and "to Punish the Publishers and Vendors thereof", brought Roach up on libel charges. In court he highlighted the list's longevity, and claimed that "nobody had ever been prosecuted for publishing it; and, therefore, he was ignorant it was a libel." When <a href="Lloyd%20Kenyon%2C%201st%20Baron%20Kenyon">Lord Chief Justice Kenyon</a> mentioned that a John Roach had previously been convicted for selling "Harris's List", Roach "assured his Lordship, that he had never been indicted before for this offence." He was nevertheless sentenced to one year in <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a>, with sureties of £150 for three years, to ensure his good behaviour. <a href="William%20Henry%20Ashurst%20%28judge%29">Lord Justice Ashurst</a> called the List "a most indecent and immoral publication", and of Roach's crime said "an offence of greater enormity could hardly be committed." Aitkin, indicted as John Aitken, may have been fined £200 for selling the same edition, although Rubenhold contends that by then he had died. After these trials, the list was no longer published. Only nine editions are extant: those for 1761, 1764, 1773, 1774, 1779, 1788, 1789, 1790 and 1793.

"Harris's List" was published for a city rife with prostitution. London's <a href="bawdy%20house">bawdy house</a>s had, by the 1770s, disappeared from the poorer areas outside the <a href="London%20Wall">city wall</a>, and in the <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End</a> were found in four areas: <a href="Westminster%20St%20Margaret%20and%20St%20John">St Margaret's</a> in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>; <a href="St%20Anne%27s%20Church%2C%20Soho">St Anne's in Soho</a> and <a href="St%20James%27s">St James's</a>; and most especially, with more than two thirds of London's "Disorderly Houses", around Covent Garden and the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a>. The area was noted for its "great numbers of female votaries to Venus of all ranks and conditions", while another author distinguished Covent Garden as "the chief scene of action for promiscuous amours." The Scottish statistician <a href="Patrick%20Colquhoun">Patrick Colquhoun</a> estimated in 1806 that of Greater London's approximately 1,000,000 citizens, perhaps 50,000 women, across all walks of life, were engaged in some form of prostitution.

Whether any of these women could confirm their addresses for publication in "Harris's List" is something that author Sophie Carter doubts. She views the annual as "primarily a work of erotica", calling it "nothing so much as a shopping list ... textually arrayed for the delectation of the male consumer", continuing "they [the women] await his intervention to institute an exchange", epitomising the traditional male role in pornography. Elizabeth Denlinger includes a similar sentiment in her essay, "The Garment and the Man": "This varied display of women to satisfy the 'great itch' ... is a fundamental aspect of the sphere to which "Harris's List" offered British men a "carte d'entrée"". Rubenhold writes that the variability in the descriptions of prostitutes over the years the list was published defy "all attempts to categorise it as either exclusively up-market or simply middle of the road." She suggests that the annual's purpose was to "conduct the desirous to the embrace of a prostitute", and that its prose was designed for "solitary sexual enjoyment" (H. Ranger also sold back-issues of "Harris's List"). Sold to a London public which was mostly <a href="patriarchal">patriarchal</a>, its listings reflect the prejudices of the men who authored them. They were therefore not representative of women generally, and as she concludes, "it is likely that their stories would have differed quite significantly from those recounted by their customers for the benefit of the "List's" publishers."

Not every commentator agreed with Colquhoun's estimate, which became "the most widely quoted sum", but in the opinion of Cindy McCreery the fact that most people agreed there were far too many prostitutes in London is indicative of widespread concern about the trade. Attitudes towards prostitution hardened at the end of the 18th century, with many viewing prostitutes as indecent and immoral, and it was in this atmosphere that "Harris's List" met its demise. Books such as the "Wandering Whore" and <a href="Edmund%20Curll">Edmund Curll</a>'s "Venus in the Cloyster" (1728) are often mentioned alongside "Harris's" as examples of erotic literature. Along with the anonymously written "Fifteen Plagues of a Maidenhead" (1707), Garfield and Curll's works were involved in cases that helped form the 18th-century legal concept of "obscene libel"—which was a marked change from the previous emphasis on controlling sedition, blasphemy and heresy, traditionally the ecclesiastical courts' province. No laws existed to forbid the publication of pornography; therefore, when Curll was arrested and imprisoned in 1725 (the first such prosecution in nearly 20 years), it was under threat of a libel charge. He was released a few months later, only to be locked up again for publishing other materials deemed offensive by the authorities. Curll's experience with the censors was uncommon, though, and prosecutions based on obscene publications remained a rarity. Although their court action spelled the end for "Harris's List", despite the best efforts of the Proclamation Society (later the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">Society for the Suppression of Vice</a>), the publication of pornography continued apace; more pornographic material was published during the Victorian era than at any time previously.

Lycoperdon perlatum

Lycoperdon perlatum, popularly known as the common <a href="puffball">puffball</a>, warted puffball, gem-studded puffball, or the devil's snuff-box, is a species of <a href="puffball">puffball</a> fungus in the family <a href="Agaricaceae">Agaricaceae</a>. A widespread species with a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>, it is a medium-sized puffball with a round <a href="ascocarp%20%28fungus%29">fruit body</a> tapering to a wide stalk, and dimensions of wide by tall. It is off-white with a top covered in short spiny bumps or "jewels", which are easily rubbed off to leave a netlike pattern on the surface. When mature it becomes brown, and a hole in the top opens to release <a href="spores">spores</a> in a burst when the body is compressed by touch or falling raindrops.

The puffball grows in fields, gardens, and along roadsides, as well as in grassy clearings in woods. It is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> when young and the <a href="gleba">internal flesh</a> is completely white, although care must be taken to avoid confusion with immature fruit bodies of <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a> "<a href="Amanita">Amanita</a>" species. "L. perlatum" can usually be distinguished from other similar puffballs by differences in surface texture. Several chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of "L. perlatum", including <a href="sterol">sterol</a> derivatives, <a href="volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> compounds that give the puffball its flavor and odor, and the unusual <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> lycoperdic acid. <a href="Extract">Extract</a>s of the puffball have <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> and <a href="Antifungal%20medication">antifungal</a> activities.

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a>. <a href="Synonym%20%28biology%29">Synonyms</a> include "Lycoperdon gemmatum" (as described by <a href="August%20Batsch">August Batsch</a> in 1783); the <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "Lycoperdon gemmatum" var. "perlatum" (published by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in 1829); "Lycoperdon bonordenii" (<a href="George%20Edward%20Massee">George Edward Massee</a>, 1887); and "Lycoperdon perlatum" var. "bonordenii" (A.C. Perdeck, 1950).

"L. perlatum" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "Lycoperdon". <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> analyses suggest a close <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationship with "<a href="Lycoperdon%20marginatum">L. marginatum</a>".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "perlatum" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "widespread". It is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the common puffball, the gem-studded puffball (or gemmed puffball), the warted puffball, or the devil's snuff-box; <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> called it the pearly puff-ball in his 1821 work "A Natural Arrangement of British Plants". Because some <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a> believed that the spores caused blindness, the puffball has some local names such as "blindman's bellows" and "no-eyes".

The fruit body ranges in shape from pear-like with a flattened top, to nearly spherical, and reaches dimensions of wide by tall. It has a stem-like base. The outer surface of the fruit body (the <a href="peridium">exoperidium</a>) is covered in short cone-shaped spines that are interspersed with granular warts. The spines, which are whitish, gray, or brown, can be easily rubbed off, and leave <a href="wikt%3Areticulate">reticulate</a> pock marks or scars after they are removed. The base of the puffball is thick, and has internal chambers. It is initially white, but turns yellow, olive, or brownish in age. The reticulate pattern resulting from the rubbed-off spines is less evident on the base.

In maturity, the exoperidium at the top of the puffball sloughs away, revealing a pre-formed hole (<a href="ostiole">ostiole</a>) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape. In young puffballs, the internal contents, the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the <a href="spore">spore</a>s mature. The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in "L. pyriforme" using high-speed <a href="schlieren%20photography">schlieren photography</a> determined that raindrops of 1 mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100 cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores.
The spores are spherical, thick-walled, covered with minute spines, and measure 3.5–4.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> in diameter. The <a href="capillitia">capillitia</a> (threadlike filaments in the gleba in which spores are embedded) are yellow-brown to brownish in color, lack <a href="septum">septae</a>, and measure 3–7.5 μm in diameter. The <a href="basidium">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 7–9 by 4–5 μm. The basidia bear four slender <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> of unequal length ranging from 5–10 μm long. The surface spines are made of chains of pseudoparenchymatous <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e (resembling the <a href="parenchyma">parenchyma</a> of higher plants), in which the individual hyphal cells are spherical to elliptical in shape, thick-walled (up to 1 μm), and measure 13–40 by 9–35 μm. These hyphae do not have <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s.

"Lycoperdon perlatum" is considered to be a good <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a> when young, when the gleba is still homogeneous and white. They have been referred to as "poor man's sweetbread" due to their texture and flavor. The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs, or used in soups as a substitute for <a href="dumpling">dumpling</a>s. As early as 1861, Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt, pepper, and oil. The puffballs become inedible as they mature: the gleba becomes yellow-tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive-green spores. "L. perlatum" is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a> and <a href="Tlaxcala">Tlaxcala</a>. The fruit bodies are appealing to other animals as well: the <a href="northern%20flying%20squirrel">northern flying squirrel</a> ("Glaucomys sabrinus") includes the puffball in their diet of non-<a href="truffle">truffle</a> fungi, while the "puffball beetle" "<a href="Caenocara%20subglobosum">Caenocara subglobosum</a>" uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding. <a href="Nutrition%20analysis">Nutritional analysis</a> indicates that the puffballs are a good source of <a href="dietary%20protein">protein</a>, <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, <a href="fat">fat</a>s, and several <a href="micronutrient">micronutrient</a>s. The predominant <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s in the puffball are <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic acid</a> (37% of the total fatty acids), <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic acid</a> (24%), <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic acid</a> (14.5%), and <a href="stearic%20acid">stearic acid</a> (6.4%).

The immature 'buttons' or 'eggs' of deadly "<a href="Amanita">Amanita</a>" species can be confused with puffballs. This can be avoided by slicing fruit bodies vertically and inspecting them for the internal developing structures of a mushroom, which would indicate the poisonous "Amanita". Additionally, amanitas will generally not have "jewels" or a bumpy external surface.

The spores are ornamented with many sharp microscopic spines and can cause severe irritation of the lung (<a href="lycoperdonosis">lycoperdonosis</a>) when inhaled. This condition has been reported to afflict dogs that play or run where puffballs are present.

There are several other puffball species with which "L. perlatum" might be confused. "<a href="Lycoperdon%20nettyanum">L. nettyanum</a>", found in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of the United States, is covered in granular patches, but these granules adhere more strongly to the surface than those of "L. perlatum". "<a href="Lycoperdon%20pyriforme">L. pyriforme</a>" lacks prominent spines on the surface, and grows on rotting wood—although if growing on buried wood, it may appear to be terrestrial. The widely distributed and common "<a href="Lycoperdon%20umbrinum">L. umbrinum</a>" has spines that do not leave scars when rubbed off, a gleba that varies in color from dark brown to purple-brown at maturity, and a purple-tinged base. The small and rare species "<a href="Lycoperdon%20muscorum">L. muscorum</a>" grows in deep moss. "<a href="Lycoperdon%20peckii">L. peckii</a>" can be distinguished from "L. pyriforme" by the lavender-tinged spines it has when young. "<a href="Lycoperdon%20rimulatum">L. rimulatum</a>" has purplish spores, and an almost completely smooth exoperidium. "<a href="Lycoperdon%20excipuliforme">L. excipuliforme</a>" is larger and grayer, and, in mature individuals, the upper portion of its fruit body breaks down completely to release its spores. In the field, "<a href="Lycoperdon%20marginatum">L. marginatum</a>" is distinguished from "L. perlatum" by the way in which the spines are shed from the exoperidium in irregular sheets.

A <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> species, "Lycoperdon perlatum" grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups or clusters on the ground. It can also grow in <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s. Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It has been reported from "<a href="Pinus%20patula">Pinus patula</a>" plantations in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball when viewed from a distance.

A widespread species with an almost <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>, it has been reported from Africa (<a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>), Asia (China, Himalayas, Japan, southern India), Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and South America (Brazil). It has been collected from <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> areas of <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, and <a href="subalpine%20zone">subalpine</a> regions in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> to Mexico, although it is less common in Central America. The species is popular on postage stamps, and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea, Paraguay, Romania, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.

The puffball <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulates</a> <a href="Heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metal</a>s present in the soil, and can be used as a <a href="bioindicator">bioindicator</a> of <a href="soil%20pollution">soil pollution</a> by heavy metals and <a href="selenium">selenium</a>. In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an <a href="interstate%20highway">interstate highway</a> in <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> were shown to have high concentrations of <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> and <a href="lead">lead</a>. "L. perlatum" <a href="biomass">biomass</a> has been shown experimentally to remove <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a> ions from <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a>s, and is being investigated for potential use as a low-cost, <a href="renewable%20resource">renewable</a>, <a href="biosorption">biosorptive</a> material in the <a href="Sewage%20treatment">treatment</a> of water and <a href="wastewater">wastewater</a> containing mercury.

Several <a href="steroid">steroid</a> derivatives have been isolated and identified from fruit bodies of "L. perlatum", including ("S")-23-hydroxylanostrol, <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a> α-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23"E")-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds <a href="3-Octanone">3-octanone</a>, <a href="1-octen-3-ol">1-octen-3-ol</a>, and ("Z")-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant components of the <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> activity against laboratory cultures of the human <a href="pathogenic%20bacteria">pathogenic</a> bacteria "<a href="Bacillus%20subtilis">Bacillus subtilis</a>", "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>", "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>", and "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>", with activity comparable to that of the antibiotic <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a>. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against <a href="Salmonella%20enterica%20enterica">"Salmonella enterica" serovar Typhimurium</a>, "<a href="Streptococcus%20pyogenes">Streptococcus pyogenes</a>", and "<a href="Mycobacterium%20smegmatis">Mycobacterium smegmatis</a>". Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have <a href="Antifungal%20medication">antifungal</a> activity against "<a href="Candida%20albicans">Candida albicans</a>", "<a href="Candida%20tropicalis">C. tropicalis</a>", "<a href="Aspergillus%20fumigatus">Aspergillus fumigatus</a>", "<a href="Alternaria%20solani">Alternaria solani</a>", "<a href="Botrytis%20cinerea">Botrytis cinerea</a>", and "<a href="Verticillium%20dahliae">Verticillium dahliae</a>". A 2009 study found "L. perlatum" puffballs to contain <a href="cinnamic%20acid">cinnamic acid</a> at a concentration of about 14 milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment <a href="melanin">melanin</a>.

The <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> lycoperdic acid (chemical name 3-(5("S")-carboxy-2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5("S")-yl)-2("S")-alanine) was isolated from the puffball, and reported in a 1978 publication. Based on the structural similarity of the new amino acid with ("S")-<a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamic acid</a>, ("S")-(+)-lycoperdic acid is expected to have <a href="Receptor%20antagonist">antagonistic</a> or <a href="agonistic">agonistic</a> activity for the <a href="glutamate%20receptor">glutamate receptor</a> in the mammalian <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>. Methods to <a href="Organic%20synthesis">synthesize</a> the compounds were reported in 1992, 1995, and 2002.

Anbe Sivam

Anbe Sivam () is a 2003 Indian <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil-language</a> <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> film directed and co-produced by <a href="Sundar%20C.">Sundar C.</a> with K. Muralitharan, V. Swaminathan and G. Venugopal under the banner of <a href="Lakshmi%20Movie%20Makers">Lakshmi Movie Makers</a>. The film was written by <a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a>, and <a href="Madhan%20%28writer%29">Madhan</a> provided the dialogues. "Anbe Sivam" features Haasan, <a href="R.%20Madhavan">R. Madhavan</a> and <a href="Kiran%20Rathod">Kiran Rathod</a> in the lead roles, with <a href="Nassar">Nassar</a>, <a href="Santhana%20Bharathi">Santhana Bharathi</a>, <a href="Seema%20%28actress%29">Seema</a> and <a href="Uma%20Riyaz%20Khan">Uma Riyaz Khan</a> playing supporting characters.

The film tells the story of an unexpected journey from <a href="Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> to <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a> undertaken by two men of contrasting personalities, Nallasivam and Anbarasu. The musical score was composed by <a href="Vidyasagar%20%28composer%29">Vidyasagar</a>. <a href="Arthur%20A.%20Wilson">Arthur A. Wilson</a> and <a href="M.%20Prabhaharan">M. Prabhaharan</a> undertook responsibility for the film's cinematography and art direction, respectively.

Produced on a budget of <a href="Indian%20rupee%20sign"></a>120 million, "Anbe Sivam" takes on several themes, including <a href="communism">communism</a>, <a href="atheism">atheism</a>, and <a href="altruism">altruism</a>, and depicts Haasan's views as a <a href="Humanism">humanist</a>. The film was released on 15 January 2003 to positive reviews from critics, but <a href="Box%20office%20bomb">underperformed</a> at the box office. Despite its failure, it gained recognition over the years through re-runs on television channels and is now regarded as a classic and a <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a> in <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil cinema</a>.

"Anbe Sivam" was screened as part of the Indian Panorama section of the <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20of%20India">International Film Festival of India</a> in 2003. At the <a href="51st%20Filmfare%20Awards%20South">51st Filmfare Awards South</a>, it received a <a href="Filmfare%20Special%20Award%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20South">Special Jury Award</a> and received nominations in the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Tamil">Best Film</a> and <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Tamil">Best Actor</a> (Haasan) categories. Madhavan was awarded <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20State%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> at the 2003 <a href="Tamil%20Nadu%20State%20Film%20Awards">Tamil Nadu State Film Awards</a>.

Two men waiting for a flight to <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a> at the <a href="Biju%20Patnaik%20International%20Airport">Biju Patnaik International Airport</a> in <a href="Bhubaneswar">Bhubaneswar</a> engage in conversation. One is a <a href="commercial%20director">commercial director</a>, Anbarasu, who prefers the abbreviated name A.Aras, and the other is a scarred and deformed socialist, Nallasivam, alias Nalla. When the flight is cancelled due to heavy rain, Aras initially suspects Nalla is a terrorist and informs the authorities, only to discover that he was mistaken. With the rain flooding the city, the two men are forced to share a room for the night. Both need to return to Chennai: Aras to be present at his wedding, and Nalla has to deliver a 3,200,000 cheque, recently awarded to him after he won a court case, to a group of union workers. After a traumatic night, and no hope for a flight, the two men take a bus to board the <a href="Coromandel%20Express">Coromandel Express</a> train. Aras' bag gets stolen on the way leaving him with only his credit card, which no one accepts. Using his presence of mind, Nalla repeatedly bails Aras out of trouble while Aras tries escaping from him at every juncture, only to end up with him again. While waiting for the train at the <a href="Ichchapuram">Ichchapuram</a> railway station, Nalla begins to tell Aras his story.

A few years earlier, a healthy Nalla took part in various <a href="street%20theatre">street theatre</a> performances protesting against <a href="Foreign%20direct%20investment">multinational corporation-driven industrialisation</a>, that resulted in the marginalisation of the <a href="Workforce">labour force</a>. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi, a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi alias Bala, fell in love with each other. To avoid a potential conflict with Padayatchi, the two decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.

Upon their arrival at Chennai, Aras delivers Nalla's cheque to the union workers. He invites Nalla to his wedding, where, to his utter astonishment, Nalla sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Nalla and asks him why he is at the wedding. He tells Padayatchi that he was invited by Aras, and later persuades him to sign the papers which will help the workers get a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Nalla's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant to eliminate Nalla. However, his assistant has a change of heart as he is about to kill him. Padayatchi's assistant believes that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of the assistant's daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Nalla to stay as far away from his boss as possible; Nalla assents and walks away.



After completing the draft for a film's script in early 2002, Kamal Haasan approached the <a href="Malayalam%20cinema">Malayalam</a> filmmaker <a href="Priyadarshan">Priyadarshan</a> to direct it. The two men were keen to work together since the late 1990s, and upon reading the script, Priyadarshan believed that it had the potential to be an "emotional love story". The film's title "Anbe Sivam" was derived from the <a href="Shaivism">Shaivite</a> saint <a href="Tirumular">Tirumular</a>'s poem "<a href="Tirumantiram">Tirumantiram</a>".

In June 2002, Priyadarshan opted out of the project. Regarding the director's exit, Haasan said Priyadarshan wanted to collaborate with him on a bigger project than "Anbe Sivam". He was replaced by <a href="Sundar%20C.">Sundar C.</a>, who agreed to produce the film as well. "Anbe Sivam" was co-produced and distributed by Swaminathan, K.Muralitharan and G.Venugopal under the production banner of <a href="Lakshmi%20Movie%20Makers">Lakshmi Movie Makers</a>.

In addition to being the film's writer, Haasan also played the central character. R. Madhavan was selected to play the film's second lead in January 2002. According to Kiran Rathod, she received a phone call from Haasan's office informing her that she was offered the role of Balasaraswathi, which she accepted. Rathod's voice in the film was dubbed by the singer <a href="Anuradha%20Sriram">Anuradha Sriram</a>. Uma Riyaz Khan played the role of Kamal's friend and professional colleague, Mehrunissa.

The actors Nassar and Santhana Bharathi played the roles of Kandasamy Padaiyatchi and his assistant, respectively, while cartoonist <a href="Madhan%20%28writer%29">Madhan</a> featured in a cameo appearance as himself in addition to writing the film's dialogues. In an interview with S.R. Ashok Kumar of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" in 2006, Bharathi considered both "Anbe Sivam" and "<a href="Michael%20Madana%20Kama%20Rajan">Michael Madana Kama Rajan</a>" (1990) to be the favourite roles of his career.

<a href="Arthur%20A.%20Wilson">Arthur A. Wilson</a>, <a href="M.%20Prabhaharan">M. Prabhaharan</a> and <a href="P.%20Sai%20Suresh">P. Sai Suresh</a> handled the film's cinematography, art direction and editing, respectively. <a href="Brinda%20%28choreographer%29">Brinda</a>, <a href="Chinni%20Prakash">Chinni Prakash</a> and <a href="Dinesh%20Kumar%20%28choreographer%29">Dinesh Kumar</a> were in charge of the choreography while the stunt sequences were co-ordinated by <a href="Vikram%20Dharma">Vikram Dharma</a>. Muthulakshmi Varadhan, Bharathi's sister-in-law, worked as an assistant editor in the film. The make-up for Haasan's scars was designed by <a href="Michael%20Westmore">Michael Westmore</a> and Anil Premkarikar. In May 2002, Haasan completed the makeup for his character Nallasivam in Los Angeles after filming the song sequences for "<a href="Panchathantiram">Panchathantiram</a>" (2002).

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> for "Anbe Sivam" commenced in July 2002. The first scene featuring the lead actors was shot at <a href="Pollachi%20Junction%20railway%20station">Pollachi Junction railway station</a>. Haasan and Madhavan interacted closely during the initial stages of the shoot to ensure that the on-screen chemistry between the pair was apparent.

"Anbe Sivam" was shot on a restricted budget of 120 million, with the train and bus disaster sequences involving the use of settings and <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a>. Madhavan, who began shooting his portions in September 2002, stated the film was shot in relatively empty locations. The flood scenes set in <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a> were re-created with outdoor sets consisting of city roads submerged under water erected in the Odisha-<a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> border. Filming also took place in Chennai, <a href="Visakhapatnam">Visakhapatnam</a> and on the <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>-<a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> border. The pre-climax scenes were filmed in what was then known as the <a href="Campa%20Cola">Campa Cola</a> compound in Guindy.

"Anbe Sivam" follows the events of a journey from Bhubaneswar to Chennai undertaken by two men of contrasting personalities, Nallasivam (Haasan), a physically challenged and witty socialist, and Anbarasu (Madhavan), an arrogant commercial director who supports <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> and <a href="Globalization">globalisation</a>. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the two are forced to undertake the journey together. Throughout the narrative, a series of themes pertaining to <a href="communism">communism</a>, compassion, globalisation, <a href="atheism">atheism</a>, and <a href="altruism">altruism</a> are addressed; the film also showcases Haasan's views as a <a href="Humanism">humanist</a>. According to Haasan, the characterisation of Nallasivam was inspired by the life of Communist playwright, actor, director, lyricist and theorist <a href="Safdar%20Hashmi">Safdar Hashmi</a>, who was chiefly associated with his work on <a href="street%20theatre">street theatre</a> in India. Hashmi died on 2 January 1989 after being attacked by members of the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a> while staging a play, "Halla Bol". S.Anand of "<a href="Outlook%20%28magazine%29">Outlook</a>" magazine notes that Haasan's views on humanism in the film were also inspired by those of <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>. M. Kalyanaraman and Abdullah Nurullah of "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" opined that Nallasivam shared similar characteristics with street theatre artist Pralayan.

According to Kalyanaraman, "Anbe Sivam" proposes that man can make morally superior choices when he comes face to face with death. As a result, Haasan indicates that the belief of "<a href="Shiva">Siva</a> is love" is the "final stage of evolution of man into God". The film features a Tamil proverb from <a href="Manikkavacakar">Manikkavacakar</a>'s "<a href="Tiruvacakam">Tiruvacakam</a>", "Tennāṭuṭaiya Śivanē pöṛṛi" ("Praise Śiva who resides in the ancient land and who belongs to all of humanity"). Padayatchi utters this every time before he murders or assaults a person. Kalavai Venkat of "<a href="Swarajya%20%28magazine%29">Swarajya</a>" magazine opined that Haasan had "inappropriately used this harmonious sacred chant to demonize Hinduism."

The film critic <a href="Baradwaj%20Rangan">Baradwaj Rangan</a>, in his review of another Haasan film, "<a href="Vishwaroopam">Vishwaroopam</a>" (2013), found the ethnicity of the characters in the film to be a continuation of Haasan's inclusion of non-Tamil characters in his films. Rangan considered this to be Haasan's acknowledgement of the "interconnectedness of the nation" and "the world beyond India". He pointed out in his article that Haasan had experimented with the concept before by including the usage of <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali language</a> and meeting <a href="Bengalis">Bengalis</a> in "<a href="Mahanadi%20%28film%29">Mahanadi</a>" (1994), a <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu-speaking</a> love interest in "<a href="Nammavar">Nammavar</a>" (1994), marrying a Bengali woman in "<a href="Hey%20Ram">Hey Ram</a>" (2000), conducting investigations with an <a href="Americans">American</a> associate in "<a href="Vettaiyaadu%20Vilaiyaadu%20%282006%20film%29">Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu</a>" (2006), and marriage to a <a href="French%20people">Frenchwoman</a> in "<a href="Manmadan%20Ambu">Manmadan Ambu</a>" (2010). Rangan notes that in "Anbe Sivam", the inclusion of and interaction with the <a href="Odia%20people">Odia people</a> was another example of including non-Tamil characters in his films. Rangan also compared Haasan's fight sequence with the use of an umbrella to the way he used a book and stool in "<a href="Thoongathey%20Thambi%20Thoongathey">Thoongathey Thambi Thoongathey</a>" (1983).

According to a critic from <a href="Sify">Sify</a>, the basic plot of "Anbe Sivam" bears resemblance to the 1987 <a href="Road%20movie">road film</a>, "<a href="Planes%2C%20Trains%20and%20Automobiles">Planes, Trains and Automobiles</a>" directed by <a href="John%20Hughes%20%28filmmaker%29">John Hughes</a>, which starred <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a> and <a href="John%20Candy">John Candy</a> in the lead roles. The critic noted Haasan and Madhavan's character share similar traits to that of the roles played by Candy and Martin in that film, respectively. The portrait painted by Nallasivam on the walls of Padayatchi's house is inspired by the Mexican painter <a href="Diego%20Rivera">Diego Rivera</a>'s <a href="fresco">fresco</a>, "<a href="Man%20at%20the%20Crossroads">Man at the Crossroads</a>". The painting shows Nallasivam posing as Padayatchi's deity Shiva, the number 910 indicating the salary Padayatchi pays to his factory's workers, and the <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> communism symbol. Aravindan Neelakandan from "Swarajya" commented on the influence of <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> in the painting, believing it to be "an empty vehicle to convey his ideology and is bereft of any intrinsic value in itself." Srinivasa Ramanujam, writing for "The Times of India" in 2008, noted that the religious undertone in the film was similar to that of <a href="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a>'s "<a href="Baba%20%282002%20film%29">Baba</a>" (2002).

The soundtrack album and background score for "Anbe Sivam" were composed by <a href="Vidyasagar%20%28composer%29">Vidyasagar</a>, and the lyrics for the songs were written by <a href="Vairamuthu">Vairamuthu</a> and <a href="P.%20Vijay">P. Vijay</a>. After composing the tune for the title song, Vidyasagar explained the situation of the song to Haasan, who wanted the song to be performed in such a way that the protagonist is singing according to the situation he finds himself in. Vidyasagar suggested that Haasan should sing the song himself to achieve the desired result, which the latter accepted. The song "Mouname Paarvayai" was not included in the film. The song "Poovaasam" is based on the "Shuddh Sarang" <a href="raga">raga</a>. The male portions for the reprise of "Poovaasam" were sung by <a href="Sriram%20Parthasarathy">Sriram Parthasarathy</a>, while the original version was sung by <a href="Vijay%20Prakash">Vijay Prakash</a>. <a href="Sadhana%20Sargam">Sadhana Sargam</a> sang her portion of both versions of the song.

Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" wrote, "Vidyasagar is scaling great heights as a composer. The theme song and the melodious are pointers. Vairamuthu's lyrics deserve special mention here." Singer <a href="Charulatha%20Mani">Charulatha Mani</a>, in her column for "The Hindu", "A Raga's Journey", noted, "Poovaasam" possessed "a charm that is born out of classicism incorporated in a populist piece". Arkay of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> found the songs to be "at best, okay". M. Suganth of "The Times of India", in his review for the music album, "Lovers Special – Vol. 2-4", included "Poovaasam" among the "Hot Picks" of the album.

According to S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu", the producers were confident that "Anbe Sivam" would be a strong competitor at the <a href="50th%20National%20Film%20Awards">50th National Film Awards</a> that they had the film reviewed by the <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Central Board of Film Certification</a> before the end of 2002 so that they could enter the film into the annual awards list. The film was released on 15 January 2003, which coincided with the <a href="Thai%20Pongal">Thai Pongal</a> festival. It opened alongside five other films, including <a href="Vikram%20%28actor%29">Vikram</a>'s "<a href="Dhool">Dhool</a>", <a href="Vijayakanth">Vijayakanth</a>'s "<a href="Chokka%20Thangam">Chokka Thangam</a>", and "<a href="Vaseegara%20%28film%29">Vaseegara</a>", which featured <a href="Vijay%20%28actor%29">Vijay</a>.

"Anbe Sivam" was screened as a part of the Indian Panorama section of the <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20of%20India">International Film Festival of India</a> in 2003. As a tribute to Safdar Hashmi, a special preview of the film was organised by Haasan in association with Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust (SAHMAT) on 9 January 2003 at <a href="Siri%20Fort%20Auditorium">Siri Fort Auditorium</a>. The film was dubbed into Telugu as "Sathyame Sivam" and released on 28 February 2003. It was dubbed into Hindi as "Shivam" two years later in 2005. After the release of the original Tamil version, the dubbing rights for the Hindi version were sold at a low price, much to the irritation of the lead actors as they were not able to dub for themselves in Hindi.

Baradwaj Rangan described the film as "Kamal's latest solo attempt to bend, twist, shape-shift Tamil cinema into forms never-before seen." In his review of the film's DVD, M. Suganth, writing for "The Times of India", called it "one of the finest movies of the decade" and praised the story, screenplay and dialogues before terming the film as "a modern classic". Reviewing the Telugu dubbed version, "Sathyame Sivam", Jeevi of <a href="Idlebrain.com">Idlebrain.com</a> said that "this art-kind-of film does entertain the people who love Kamal Hassan flicks" while concluding that it "would remain as one of the good films made in the recent times".

Malathi Rangarajan of "The Hindu" believed that "well-defined characters, a strong storyline and intelligent screenplay" were the film's "vital ingredients". She further complimented Haasan's treatment of the story, and that his "diligence that has gone into the chiselling of the story and screenplay is only too evident", while calling the film "a laudable effort". P.Devarajan of "<a href="Business%20Line">Business Line</a>" appreciated Haasan's performance and facial expressions and concluded his review by stating, "This man has intrigued me and will always." Another critic from "The Hindu", Gudipoodi Srihari, appreciated the pair of Haasan and Madhavan, noting that the duo "make a fine combination of pals each with different mental make up, but goodness overflowing." Sujatha Narayanan, in a retrospective review for "<a href="The%20New%20Indian%20Express">The New Indian Express</a>" commended Haasan's writing and Madhan's dialogue, finding them to be "peppered with sharp wit, trivia and emotional depth."

A reviewer from <a href="Sify">Sify</a>, in comparison, labelled the film as "average", stating that it was "another predictable and corny film which is neither a comedy caper nor a class act." Similarly, Arkay of Rediff.com praised the performances of the lead cast but wrote the film "tries to do too many things, and ends up failing at most, if not all, of them." S.Anand of "Outlook" felt the film's thematic ideas of communism were presented in a "cliched" manner, and summarised by saying, "If Rajnikant staked claim to divinity on a right-wing plank with "Baba", Kamal does it with pretensions to rationalist-left rhetoric."

During the first week of its theatrical run, an analysis by <a href="Sudhish%20Kamath">Sudhish Kamath</a> of "The Hindu" showed the film to have grossed 13.1 million in Chennai alone. Despite this, the film <a href="Box%20office%20bomb">underperformed</a> at the box office and incurred heavy losses for Lakshmi Movie Makers, effectively stopping them from investing in other ventures for the year 2003. An estimate by D.Govardan of "<a href="The%20Economic%20Times">The Economic Times</a>" places the losses at 65 million, while Arun Ram of "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" states the losses incurred to be 50 million. Srinivasa Ramanujam of "The Times of India" compared the film's failure at the box office to that of "Baba". Both K. Muralitharan and Haasan defended the film's failure by blaming <a href="copyright%20infringement">video piracy</a>, with the latter stating that "lots of people saw it, but they didn't pay".

Following its release, "Anbe Sivam" has attained <a href="cult%20film">cult status</a> in Tamil cinema and receives re-runs on television channels. When the film was in post-production, Haasan revealed to film critic and journalist <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> that he was impressed with Madhavan's enthusiasm and performance during the making of the film, subsequently signing him to appear in his production venture, "<a href="Nala%20Damayanthi">Nala Damayanthi</a>" (2003).

Baradwaj Rangan wrote that "Anbe Sivam" was "leagues ahead of the average Tamilwhy, even Indianfilm", though he felt that "the masses were unwilling to accept the experimental nature of the film", while talking about the film's box office failure. During his acceptance speech after winning the <a href="Vijay%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Vijay Award for Best Director</a> in 2010 for "<a href="Naan%20Kadavul">Naan Kadavul</a>" (2009), director <a href="Bala%20%28director%29">Bala</a> revealed that a scene in "Anbe Sivam" where Haasan says to Madhavan, "when we love others unconditionally without any expectation, we become Gods", inspired him to make his film. Bala also made a reference to "Anbe Sivam" in his 2003 film, "<a href="Pithamagan">Pithamagan</a>", in a scene where <a href="Suriya">Suriya</a>'s character goes for a screening of the film with his friends. A dialogue told by Haasan to Madhavan, "Do you what a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> is? "Periya alai illa...malai"." (It's not just a big wave...it's a mountain) also attained popularity.

In 2008, S.R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" listed "Anbe Sivam" among the "top five directorial ventures of SundarC." In a 2008 interview with "The Times of India", SundarC. stated that "Anbe Sivam" "changed [him] personally and professionally", making him a more confident person and altering his outlook towards life. He later contradicted his statement after revealing that the film's failure led him to become almost bankrupt and he remained unpaid for his work. The <a href="Income%20Tax%20Department">Income Tax Department</a> froze his bank accounts for a year as he was not able to pay his taxes. He admitted that while he received praises for the film after its theatrical run, he would not make a film similar to "Anbe Sivam" anymore and that he chose to continue making commercial cinema, which he felt better matched his interests. In 2013, Haricharan Pudipeddi of the <a href="Indo-Asian%20News%20Service">Indo-Asian News Service</a> agency, included "Anbe Sivam" in his list of "Kamal's most underrated films". He believed the reason for the film's commercial failure was that audiences misunderstood the "sarcastic undertones associated with atheism". On Haasan's birthday, 7 November 2015, Latha Srinivasan of "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" considered "Anbe Sivam" to be one of the "films you must watch to grasp the breadth of Kamal Haasan's repertoire". The character of Nallasivam was ranked fourth in "The Times of India"'s list of "Kamal Haasan's top 10 mind-blowing avatars".

In "<a href="Vasool%20Raja%20MBBS">Vasool Raja MBBS</a>" (2004), the character Vasool Raja (Haasan), while attending a class asks whether being a doctor is equivalent to being God, and in doing so says "Anbe Venkatachalam", to which one of his classmates gently asks him, "isn't it Anbe Sivam?". Haasan retorts: "Let it be. Let's try something different for a change." The street theatre sequence featuring Kamal's character, Nallasivam, and his friends performing to make people aware of the atrocities committed by Nassar's character, Kanadasamy Padayatchi, was re-created at <a href="Tiruchirappalli">Tiruchirappalli</a> in 2008 by Pralayan and his troupe from "Chennai Kalai Kuzhu" under the title "Nammal Mudiyum". In contrast, Pralayan's play explored gender inequality and domestic violence instead of unemployment. Kannada actor <a href="Vishnuvardhan%20%28actor%29">Vishnuvardhan</a> noted in 2010 that fellow actor <a href="Sudeep">Sudeep</a>'s film "<a href="Just%20Maath%20Maathalli">Just Maath Maathalli</a>" (2010) bears resemblance to "Anbe Sivam". Hari Narayan, writing for "The Hindu" in 2014, mentions in his article on the Indian <a href="Rationalism">rationalist</a> and author <a href="Narendra%20Dabholkar">Narendra Dabholkar</a> that <a href="Umesh%20Shukla">Umesh Shukla</a>'s "<a href="OMG%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Oh%20My%20God%21">OMG – Oh My God!</a>" (2012) was "a toned down version of "Anbe Sivam" where rationality propels humans to find God in themselves, with flaws, which extols the virtue of becoming as much as that of being". In 2015 Uthiran of "<a href="The%20Hindu%20%28Tamil%29">The Hindu</a>" in <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>, mentions in his review of "<a href="Orange%20Mittai">Orange Mittai</a>" (2015) that the film's plot "might remind viewers of "Anbe Sivam"". In 2017, Ashok, who directed the comedy film "<a href="Peechankai">Peechankai</a>", mentions he was inspired by "Anbe Sivam" to become a director.

Maurice Leyland

Maurice Leyland (20 July 1900 – 1 January 1967) was an <a href="England%20cricket%20team">English</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played 41 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> between 1928 and 1938. In <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>, he represented <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> between 1920 and 1946, scoring over 1,000 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> in 17 consecutive seasons. A left-handed <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">middle-order</a> batsman and occasional <a href="Left-arm%20orthodox%20spin">left-arm spinner</a>, Leyland was a <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketer of the Year</a> in 1929.

Born in <a href="Harrogate">Harrogate</a>, Leyland came from a cricketing family. After playing locally, he made his Yorkshire debut in 1920, and appeared intermittently in the following two seasons. Although not statistically successful, he impressed judges at the club, and was a regular member of the team from 1923. He steadily improved over the following seasons to reach the fringes of the England team and made his Test debut in 1928 against West Indies. That winter, he <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201928%E2%80%9329">toured Australia</a>—a controversial decision as he replaced the famous batsman <a href="Frank%20Woolley">Frank Woolley</a>—and scored a century in his only Test of the series. He remained in the side until 1930, but a loss of form in the next two seasons called his place into question. He recovered by scoring 1,000 runs in August 1932 to secure his inclusion in the team to <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201932%E2%80%9333">tour Australia in 1932–33</a>.

During that series, Leyland scored runs several times under pressure and by the time <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201934">Australia toured England in 1934</a>, he was a leading batsman in the team. He held his place until 1938 when he was replaced in the team by younger batsmen for <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">the series against Australia</a>. Recalled for the final match, he scored 187, his highest Test score in what became his last match. After military service in the Second World War, Leyland returned to the Yorkshire team for one season before announcing his retirement from regular first-class cricket. He maintained his connection with Yorkshire, and served as the county coach between 1950 and 1963. He died in 1967.

Although he was neither aesthetically nor technically among the best batsmen, Leyland had a reputation for batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and had it not been for the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl <a href="Left-arm%20unorthodox%20spin">left-arm wrist-spin</a>, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.

Leyland was born in <a href="Bilton%2C%20Harrogate">Bilton</a>, an area of <a href="Harrogate">Harrogate</a>, to Mercy (née Lambert) and Edward (Ted) Leyland. He was registered at birth as Morris Leyland but his name was usually spelt "Maurice". His father was a stonemason and a well-respected professional cricketer for <a href="Moorside%2C%20Oldham">Moorside</a> in Lancashire. Leyland senior also acted as Moorside's groundsman, and in later years continued that role at Harrogate, <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley Cricket Ground</a> and <a href="Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground">Edgbaston</a>. Leyland junior joined his father in the Moorside team in 1912, and by the age of fourteen had graduated to the <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire League</a>. After military service in the First World War, he became a professional cricketer for Harrogate between 1918 and 1920. From there he made appearances for the Yorkshire Council, and <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>'s second team, for whom he bowled regularly; when he reached the first team, he bowled infrequently in his first seasons. Around this time, he also played football for Harrogate.

During the early 1920s, the Yorkshire committee was attempting to find players to replace those whose careers had ended with the First World War. Late in the 1920 season, Leyland made his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut for Yorkshire, having played several times in the second team that summer. He played once, against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>, scoring ten runs in his only <a href="Innings%23Cricket">innings</a>, but this was his sole appearance that year. He had never previously attended a <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> game. The following year, Leyland played in five first-team matches, scoring 52 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>, <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">averaging</a> just over 19 for the season. In the latter part of the 1922 season he played more regularly, replacing <a href="Norman%20Kilner">Norman Kilner</a> in the team. Although Leyland's batting figures were unimpressive, the summary of Yorkshire's season in "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" stated that he "gave signs of promise as a forcing batsman and fielded very finely". His highest score in 14 matches was 29, but he was awarded his <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29%23Cricket">county cap</a>, and critics within Yorkshire judged him to have great potential.

Leyland played regularly in the 1923 season and reached 1,000 runs in first-class cricket, a total he exceeded in each of the seventeen seasons between 1923 and the outbreak of war in 1939. In 1923, he scored seven fifties and averaged 27.89; "Wisden" suggested that he would become a leading left-handed batsman and that "his future seems assured". In his history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Anthony Woodhouse states that Leyland gained valuable experience as part of a successful batting side. During this period, Yorkshire won the County Championship in four successive seasons from 1922 to 1925. A later review of Leyland's career in "Wisden" suggested that this team was one of Yorkshire's strongest, but sometimes became over-competitive and aggressive. The review stated that this environment "was a hard school for a young cricketer, but Leyland thrived on such discipline, and he has never lost his laugh."

By the beginning of the 1924 season, Leyland was recognised in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as one of the most promising young professional batsmen in England; the newspaper's cricket correspondent noted that Leyland "is fully expected, in Yorkshire, to develop into a first-rate left-handed batsman." He continued to improve that season, scoring 1,259 runs at 30.70. In August, he scored his first century in first-class cricket, hitting 133 not out in a drawn game against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>; later in the month, he scored another century. Leyland further improved his record in 1925, hitting 1,572 runs at 40.30. "Wisden" commented: "Leyland still further increased the big reputation he had made in the previous summer and ought, if all goes well with him, to attain the highest distinction." By the end of the 1926 season, in which he scored 1,561 runs at 39.02 and hit five centuries, Leyland had established himself as one of the most reliable batsmen in the Yorkshire team.

Following the example of <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a>, several Yorkshire cricketers in the 1920s spent English winters coaching in India for the <a href="Bhupinder%20Singh%20of%20Patiala">Maharaja of Patiala</a>. Leyland coached in the winter of 1926–27, along with <a href="Arthur%20Dolphin">Arthur Dolphin</a>, the Yorkshire wicketkeeper. That same winter, a <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) team toured India; although not chosen in the touring party, both Leyland and Dolphin played a handful of matches for the MCC. During the 1927 season Leyland scored 1,625 runs at 41.66, and, against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>, scored his first double-century. "Wisden" suggested that he "was not so dependable as could have been desired", but batted in an entertaining fashion. In August, he was selected in a trial game to assess players who might represent England in <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a>—he played against the England team for a side named "The Rest"—and scored 102. In the winter of 1927–28, Leyland once more coached in India for the Maharajah of Patiala.

Shortly after returning from India, Leyland married Constance (Connie) Russell in Harrogate on 29 March 1928. In later years, Connie looked after the children of <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> during Yorkshire matches at Harrogate when their behaviour became too much for their own mother. Sutcliffe's daughter later recalled Connie as "very stern and cross", and the only person who could control her and her brother: "I was frightened to death."

Like Leyland, the Yorkshire bowler <a href="Roy%20Kilner">Roy Kilner</a> coached in India during 1927–28. However, in doing so Kilner contracted a fever and died shortly after returning to England. With a weakened bowling attack, and affected by injuries and loss of form, Yorkshire pressed Leyland into service as an occasional bowler in the 1928 season. He had done little bowling for Yorkshire at this point; the team possessed two <a href="Left-arm%20orthodox%20spin">slow left-arm spinners</a> in Kilner and Rhodes, leaving Leyland with little opportunity. Having never bowled 50 first-class <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> in a previous season, nor taken more than four <a href="Wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wickets</a>, he bowled over 500 overs in 1928 and took 35 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 34.20. At this stage, the Yorkshire authorities thought that he might fully take on Kilner's bowling workload, or succeed Rhodes in the senior spinner's position.
Leyland also had his most effective season with the bat. He scored 1,783 runs at an average of 54.03, and scored another double century. At the end of the season, "Wisden" commented: "[Leyland] can play both the games—the dogged defence when a bad position must be saved and a fine forcing game when it is necessary to make runs quickly. In the ordinary way his preference is for attack and he is a delightful batsman to watch."

During June 1928, Leyland was selected for another Test trial, playing for "The Rest" against England; then in mid-July he played for the <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Players against the Gentlemen</a> at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a>. At the end of July, the MCC named the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201928%E2%80%9329">team to tour Australia</a> for the 1928–29 <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes</a> series. Leyland was included in the team; according to "The Times", it would have been difficult to leave him out and his presence lifted the fielding ability of the side. His selection was controversial in the south of England, and particularly in Kent, as he took the place that the veteran Kent batsman <a href="Frank%20Woolley">Frank Woolley</a> was expected to fill. One Kent supporter wrote that Leyland was a "cross bat village-greener". <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, a selector at the time, claimed that Leyland's superior fielding influenced the decision, but the cricket writer <a href="Alan%20Gibson">Alan Gibson</a> suggests that the real choice was between Woolley and <a href="Phil%20Mead">Phil Mead</a>, two batsmen of similar age. In 1928, the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> toured England, playing their first Test matches. The team did not perform well, but the England selectors picked strong teams to provide practice for the players. Leyland was selected for the last of the three Test matches. Making his debut on 11 August 1928, he was dismissed for 0 by <a href="Herman%20Griffith">Herman Griffith</a> in his only innings.

The MCC team which toured Australia was extremely strong in batting, and Leyland served as back-up to the main batsmen. The English batting line-up was settled for most of the series, leaving little opportunity for the back-ups; although Mead played in the first Test, he was subsequently left out to strengthen the bowling. Playing in other first-class matches on the tour, Leyland scored centuries against <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a> and <a href="Queensland%20cricket%20team">Queensland</a>. With England 4–0 ahead in the series, Chapman stood down from the final Test; although it is not clear why he did so, one possibility is that he wished to give as many members of the team as possible a chance to appear in the Tests. Alternatively, he may have felt that his batting form did not warrant a place in the team. Whatever the reason, Leyland took his place. England lost the match, but Leyland was successful. He scored 137, his first Test century, and 53 not out. The report in "Wisden" stated: "[He] distinguished himself by two really delightful displays ... His exhibition of powerful, well-timed driving past cover-point will long be remembered by those who saw it." Overall, in first-class matches on the tour, he scored 614 runs at 43.85, but his bowling was ineffective on the hard pitches. Following his success in the last Test, Leyland was expected to become one of the leading English batsmen, and before the 1929 season he was named one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketers of the Year</a> for his performances in the 1928 season.

Leyland scored 1,931 runs at 42.91 in 1929, and took 50 first-class wickets in the season at an average of 30.26. In the match against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a> he took eight wickets and against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a> he took <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">five wickets in an innings</a> for the first time in his career. Against Lancashire, in a match which Rhodes missed with injury, Leyland took the role of the main spinner and returned figures of seven wickets for 52 runs. After watching this performance, the cricket writer <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> judged that Leyland had bowled well and with spirit on a wet pitch which favoured spin bowling, but that he lacked the accuracy and <a href="Flight%20%28cricket%29">flight</a> required in left-arm spin bowlers and exemplified by Rhodes. In another game, Cardus observed that Leyland seemed to be attempting left-handed <a href="googly">googly</a> bowling. Following success in a trial game, Leyland kept his place in the Test team, playing all <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201929">five matches</a> against South Africa that summer to score 294 runs at an average of 42.00. In the Second Test, played at Lord's, he scored 73 and 102.

Leyland did not play in the first two matches of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201930">1930 Ashes series</a>; Woolley replaced him in the team but was unsuccessful and Leyland came in for the final three games. Leyland was little more effective, and his highest score in the series was 44; England lost 2–1. More successful for Yorkshire, he scored five centuries for the county, and hit his highest score of the season against Lancashire—the eventual County Champions for 1930. At the time, Yorkshire v Lancashire matches were mainly dour, slow-scoring affairs, but Leyland played freely to score 211 not out in around 270 minutes. He hit two sixes in one over, and, according to Cardus, played "great and beautiful cricket". Leyland's best bowling performance that year came for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's, when he took seven for 94 in the first innings and nine wickets in the match. In all first-class matches in 1930, he scored 2,175 runs at an average of 50.58, the first time he reached 2,000 runs in a season, and took 53 wickets at 27.92. During the 1930–31 English winter, he toured South Africa with an MCC team. Owing to the absence of a regular opening batsman, Leyland opened the batting on several occasions and performed consistently during the tour. In first-class matches, he scored 774 runs at 36.85 and took nine wickets; in the Test series, he scored 300 runs at 42.85, twice passing fifty. In the second game, he took three for 91, his best bowling performance in Test matches.

Leyland struggled in the following two seasons. In 1931, he scored just one century as his aggregate and average—1,228 runs at 38.37—both fell, although his increasing habit of succeeding against the best opposition continued when he scored 96 for Yorkshire against the Rest of England. With the ball, he took 12 wickets at an average over 40. Despite his loss of form, Yorkshire won the County Championship for the first time since 1925; the team were also champions in the next two seasons and went on to win seven out of nine championships before the Second World War. Leyland played for the Players against the Gentlemen, but was not selected for any of the Tests in the <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201931">three-match series between England and New Zealand</a>. "Wisden" later suggested that he was "stale"; at the time, in reviewing candidates to tour Australia in 1932–33, the "Wisden" editor believed that "no reason exists why Leyland should not regain his best form".
At the beginning of the 1932 season, Leyland continued to struggle. Although he was chosen in two Test trial matches and scored 189 against Middlesex, he was left out of the England team for the only Test of the summer, and had little success in the first three months of the season. However, in August he made 1,013 runs at 84.14, scoring four centuries and two innings over 90. During this spell, Leyland shared a partnership of 149 runs in 55 minutes with Herbert Sutcliffe against Essex. That county had chosen two fast bowlers in an attempt to intimidate the Yorkshire batsmen. <a href="Ken%20Farnes">Ken Farnes</a> and <a href="Morris%20Nichols">Morris Nichols</a> bowled a succession of <a href="Bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncers</a>; Farnes attempted fast <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a> bowling, a tactic which developed into <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> during the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201932%E2%80%9333">MCC tour of Australia in 1932–33</a>. Eventually, Sutcliffe began to <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook</a> the short ball and in six successive overs, he and Leyland added 102 runs, an unusually fast rate of scoring. Leyland faced little of the bowling, later remembering that he received only four deliveries in this period, hitting each for four. In total, he contributed only 45 runs to the partnership. Farnes was reduced to tears by the assault on his bowling, and these events possibly persuaded the MCC selectors to leave him out of the team for the 1932–33 tour. Leyland, on the other hand, was among the last names added to the touring party in mid-August. At the end of the season, he scored 105 against the Rest of England for Yorkshire, his team playing as County Champions. In total, he scored 1,980 runs at 52.10 and took 23 wickets at 20.86.

England won the 1932–33 Ashes series 4–1, but the cricket was overshadowed by controversy over the team's use of Bodyline tactics. Leyland was not particularly successful in statistical terms. However, assessing the tour in "Wisden", Sydney Southerton wrote that Leyland "fared on the whole extremely well ... he had batted finely in the Test matches at Adelaide and Brisbane". He scored 306 runs in the five Test matches at an average of 34.00; he began and ended the series with scores of 0, but played innings of 83 and 86 in the decisive third and fourth Test matches, with his team under pressure when he batted. Gibson points out that both of his <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">ducks</a> came when England were in dominant positions. In all first-class matches on the tour, Leyland scored 880 runs at 44.00, including two centuries against state teams. The former Australian batsmen <a href="Charlie%20Macartney">Charlie Macartney</a> suggested that, although "a useful player", Leyland was hindered by his defensive approach. Going against his naturally aggressive approach made him seem "awkward", and never allowed him to play at his best. Other Australian commentators had a more favourable opinion.

Returning from Australia, Leyland scored 2,317 first-class runs in the 1933 season, the highest seasonal aggregate of his career. Averaging 50.36, he scored seven centuries. With the ball, he took 37 wickets at 28.13. In a game against Leicestershire in August, he took ten wickets for 94 runs, the only time in his career he took ten wickets in a match. The West Indies team toured England that season, but Leyland played only in the first Test; he scored one run in his single innings. Leyland also scored over 2,000 first-class runs in 1934, at an average of 53.55. Playing all five Test matches of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201934">series against the touring Australian team</a>, he scored 478 runs at an average of 68.28. His three centuries were scored when England were in difficult situations. A "Wisden" review of his career written in 1943 stated: "In 1934 Leyland reached the height of his powers. Ripe in technique, rich in experience, like granite in battle, he was in this season England's greatest batsman."

England lost the series 2–1. The Australians were heavily dependent on the bowling of <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a> and <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a>. At the time, O'Reilly was regarded as the best bowler in the world, and among the greatest of all time, but Leyland began a spell of relative dominance over him. In the second Test, Leyland scored 109 and shared a partnership of 129 with <a href="Les%20Ames">Les Ames</a>; in the next match, he hit 153 runs, sharing large partnerships with <a href="Patsy%20Hendren">Patsy Hendren</a> and Ames, and in the final Test, he played an innings of 110. However, the rest of the England batting was unreliable; reviewing the season, the "Wisden" editor Sydney Southerton wrote: "In nearly every match either Hendren, Leyland or Ames, instead of being able to go in and play a free, confident game, had to save or remedy a position seriously damaged by the quick fall of two or three wickets." In addition to his batting successes, Leyland was generally the best <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">outfielder</a> in the England team. He also scored three centuries for Yorkshire, another for the Rest of England against Lancashire, the Champion County, and 80 for the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. With the ball, he took 33 first-class wickets. He was given a <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit match</a> against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>; his benefit eventually raised £3,648, at the time the third highest amount raised for a Yorkshire player.

During the winter of 1934–35, Leyland toured the West Indies with an MCC team which lost the four-Test series 2–1. The English batsmen were overwhelmed by the pace bowlers of the West Indies team, and some MCC players complained that <a href="Learie%20Constantine">Learie Constantine</a>, <a href="Manny%20Martindale">Manny Martindale</a> and <a href="Leslie%20Hylton">Leslie Hylton</a> intimidated the visiting batsmen with <a href="Bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short-pitched bowling</a>. Leyland played three Tests but scored only 36 runs in six innings. More successful in other first-class games, he scored 347 runs at 21.68 overall, and took 11 wickets. He scored 1,815 runs at an average of 38.61 in 1935 and took 32 wickets at 25.46. He played in <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201935">four of the five Tests</a> against South Africa—he missed the third with lumbago—to score 342 runs at 57.00. In the first and fourth Tests, he hit fifties, and in the final match scored 161 runs in 130 minutes, batting quickly throughout. However, England could not force a win, and having lost the second Test, were beaten 1–0 in the series.

After taking part in a tour of Jamaica by the Yorkshire team, on which he scored 115 and 75 in successive games, Leyland scored 1,790 runs at 45.89 in 1936. He hit seven centuries, including an innings of 263 runs against Essex in the season, the highest first-class score of his career. He played in two of the three Tests against India that season—he missed the second with injury—but only batted twice. In the first Test, he scored 60 runs against a strong bowling attack when England were in a difficult position. The home side won the series 2–0. During the season, Leyland was among the first players chosen to tour Australia with the MCC in the forthcoming winter.

The MCC team was captained by <a href="Gubby%20Allen">G. O. B. Allen</a> who added Leyland to the team selection committee during the tour. The team won the first two Tests, but lost the next three to lose the series 3–2, and "Wisden" blamed a weakness in batting for the defeat. Leyland was one of the few batsmen excused: "Leyland, though very restrained, was one of the mainstays of the batting". Before the series, England were expected to struggle severely against the bowling of O'Reilly. According to Cardus, Leyland told O'Reilly before the first Test: "Ah can tell thi one thing now for certain ... Ah's got thee where Ah wants thi, Bill—and Ah thinks tha knows it."

In the first Test, Leyland scored 126 after the team lost the first three wickets for 20 runs; many critics judged this to be his greatest innings. At this point, he had scored four centuries in seven Test innings against Australia. He played an effective defensive innings in the second innings, and another in the second Test, when he was criticised for slow scoring. Then in the third Test, on a pitch made exceptionally difficult for batsmen by rain, England could only score 76 for nine; Leyland scored 17 of those runs and according to "Wisden", "was the one real success for England ... [He] never seemed in difficulties". In the second innings, he scored a century In total, in five Test matches, he scored 441 runs at an average of 55.12. Australian critics viewed Leyland as one of England's best batsmen, and gave him credit for England's strong showing early in the series. In all first-class games on the tour, he scored 902 runs at 50.11; he was unsuccessful in three games the team played in New Zealand on completion of the main tour.

Leyland missed a substantial amount of cricket in 1937 with a broken finger, barely playing in July, and missing the Test series against New Zealand. He scored 1,306 runs at 36.27 and took 19 wickets. Injuries continued to trouble him in 1938. He scored 1,884 first-class runs at 43.81, but a shoulder strain early in the season adversely affected his form. He was not selected for the first three <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">Tests against Australia</a>, not least as the England side contained several promising batsmen. However, he had his best season with the ball. A succession of hard, dry wickets gave fewer opportunities to orthodox spinners and Leyland took 63 wickets at 19.32. Early in the season, he took eight for 63 against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>, the best figures of his career. Just as his batting form returned, and when he was likely to be recalled to the England side, Leyland broke his thumb in a match against Middlesex. However, he recovered in time to play in the final Test of the series. Australia's victory in the fourth Test had given the team a 1–0 lead.

"Wisden" commented: "The inclusion once again of Leyland was a move which yielded splendid results." Coming in to bat at number three, Leyland shared a partnership of 382 with <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>, at the time a record English Test partnership for any wicket; as of 2013, it remains England's highest partnership for the second wicket, and the highest for any wicket against Australia. As there was no time limit on the match, Leyland batted very cautiously and scored 187 in around six-and-a-half hours before he was <a href="run%20out">run out</a>. Hutton went on to score 364, at the time the highest score in Tests. England had batted deliberately slowly to frustrate the bowlers, and Cardus expressed his frustration to Leyland during an interval in play. Cardus wrote: "'And even you, Maurice,' I complained, in sorrow not anger, 'even you won't hit the ball and give us some cricket.' 'Hey, wait a minute, Mr Cardus,' expostulated Leyland, as though pained at my protest, 'wait a minute—tha must remember that Ah'm playing for me place in team. England went on to win the match and level the series. Leyland's innings was his highest in Tests, but this was his final match for England. In 41 Tests, he scored 2,764 runs at 46.06 and took six wickets.

In 1939, the last season before the Second World War, Leyland scored 1,238 runs at 39.93 and took 23 wickets. He served in the army during the war: first as a <a href="Sergeant%23Royal%20Marines%20and%20Army">sergeant instructor</a>, and was later commissioned as lieutenant. Between his army duties, he played cricket in the Bradford League, and played for various wartime teams, including ones representing the army. In 1945, he played some non-first-class games for teams representing Yorkshire and a first-class game for Yorkshire against Lancashire. Choosing to continue his career after the war to help the Yorkshire team become re-established, Leyland played a last full season in 1946 when he scored 632 runs at 21.06, with a highest score of 88, and took 16 wickets at 14.70; against Warwickshire, he took seven for 36. During August 1946, he announced his retirement, but in the following two seasons, he appeared in some end-of-season first-class games. He ended his first-class career in 1948 with 33,660 runs at 40.50 and 466 wickets at 29.31.

After his retirement from the Yorkshire team, Leyland returned to play for Harrogate until 1950, when he became chief coach, along with <a href="Arthur%20Mitchell%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Mitchell</a>, at Yorkshire. Mitchell was a dour, serious man but the contrast with the cheerier Leyland made an effective partnership. Leyland also served as a representative of the paper manufacturers Thomas Owen. In 1949, he was among the first group of former professional cricketers to be awarded honorary membership of the MCC. He continued as a respected coach of Yorkshire until illness forced his retirement in 1963. Suffering from <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, he maintained some connections with Yorkshire cricket and always tried to attend matches played at Harrogate. In recognition of his achievements, the Harrogate grounds erected new gates which were named in his honour. Leyland died in a hospital at <a href="Knaresborough">Knaresborough</a> on 1 January 1967.

As a batsman, Leyland generally batted in the middle order or occasionally opened the batting. Early in his career, commentators suggested that his batting technique was faulty, even when he was statistically successful. His use of the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut shot</a> was mistrusted by some Yorkshire critics, and they suspected that his preference for attacking play would be unsuccessful; he was a faster scorer and more aggressive batsman than most of his Yorkshire contemporaries. Cardus suggested that, instead, he was in the line of "humorous Yorkshiremen which the broad nature of his county produces from time to time as a contrast to and leavening of the generally dour lump. There was a twinkle in his eye and there was a twinkle in his bat, no matter how grimly and straight it may occasionally be obliged to defend a difficult situation in Yorkshire." The cricket writer <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a> observed that Leyland's bat was often not straight when he played his shots—contrary to orthodox technique—but the speed of his footwork and his ability to watch the ball closely made up for any lapses. Opposing bowlers suggested that the impression was an illusion and that his bat was straight when he hit the ball.

Although Leyland was not a stylish batsman, he was effective. Cardus described him as "a sturdy cricketer, not tall, but his sloping bottle-neck shoulders seemed to add inches to him and he had long arms of impressive thickness, veined with strength at the wrist; also he was broad in the beam, with a rubicund smile on his cheerful open countenance." He was a good <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">driver of the ball</a>, with a high <a href="backlift">backlift</a>, and moved quickly and economically to reach the pitch of the ball. Cardus thought that his style of batting was representative of his character: "He put his nature into every stroke, and as soon as he had 'got bowling where he wanted it,' he didn't merely hit or drive it—he walloped it." At times, Leyland's desire to score quickly brought about his <a href="Dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissal</a>. However, when necessary, he defended strongly and used his pads as a second line of defence if he missed the ball with his bat.

Critics judged Leyland a better Test than county batsman. His first-class batting figures were not exceptional compared to other cricketers who played far fewer Test matches, but in Tests, his average is six runs an innings higher; against Australia, the strongest of England's opponents during his career, he averaged 56, a further increase of ten runs. Gibson suggests that he rose to the big occasions, and that he performed best against the toughest opponents. According to Leyland's obituary in "The Times", "He was essentially a man for the big occasion, a batsman at his best in a crisis, and his favourite game was a Roses match or an Australian Test. England's supporters often breathed a sigh of relief to see his burly figure purposefully striding to the wicket." The writer <a href="R.%20C.%20Robertson-Glasgow">R. C. Robertson-Glasgow</a> suggested that Leyland in a Test match was like the "four-squarers of ancient or romantic times. He was Horatius on the tottering bridge; Hector, who alone stood between Troy and destruction. He was born to rescue. But he is more dangerous than those who are stubborn or grim. He has something of D'Artagnan in him; there is a gaiety besides the simplicity and strength; seen in the slight list of the cap, and in a certain jauntiness and optimism of gait."

Although he did not have to face top-class fast bowling in Test matches, he was successful against English fast bowlers such as <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> in county cricket, and he established his ascendancy over O'Reilly, the world's best bowler at the time. On one occasion, O'Reilly held his head in his hands when he saw Leyland come out to bat, and was heard to say: "Oh, it's that bloody Yorkshireman again!" In later years, O'Reilly vigorously denied that Leyland held the upper hand, responding to such suggestions by saying "You just check how many times I got him out!" The cricket historian David Frith points out that "the answer is nine times in 16 Tests, but with decreasing frequency. In their Test encounters Leyland made 1,412 runs at an average of 56." Robertson-Glasgow noted that Leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure; he came to life in more difficult circumstances: "His element was foul weather. He would disappear into the haze of Bramall Lane, where a sterner sort of game was being played under the name of cricket, and entrench himself among the sawdust and smoke and off-breaks and appeals, and do his raw, tough work in silence."

Leyland was regarded by critics as a good fielder in almost any position. He bowled left-arm spin, but contrary to the orthodox practice for a left-arm spinner to use his fingers to spin the ball, usually bowled the ball from the back of his hand—the delivery known as the <a href="Left-arm%20unorthodox%20spin">chinaman</a>. He did not take bowling seriously, but enjoyed it. In this role, he was effective at times, but other players were used in the main spinner's role for Yorkshire in preference to him, and he was generally used as back-up, for example when the other bowlers had failed to dismiss well-set batsmen. His "Wisden" obituary suggests that, had he played for another county, he might have developed into a world-class all-rounder. His lack of opportunity prompted him to experiment with <a href="wrist%20spin">wrist spin</a>, and he later claimed that he originated the term "chinaman" to describe the delivery. "Wisden" suggests: "Whenever two batsmen were difficult to shift or something different was wanted someone in the Yorkshire team would say, 'Put on Maurice to bowl some of those Chinese things.' Roy Kilner explained, 'It's foreign stuff and you can't call it anything else. Another version was the Leyland believed that the particular delivery was only good enough "to get the Chinese out". However, there are several theories over how the delivery came to be named.

Leyland was noted as a humorist in his playing days; many stories are associated with him, although some are probably apocryphal. He told stories against himself. One story concerned his dismissal during a wartime match, in which he was out to a terrible delivery from a bowler who was badly out of practice. Leyland hit the ball in the air and was caught. He ruefully commented: "You know, I don't get much practice against that stuff". Another time, he described how he faced an over from O'Reilly, as related in his obituary in "<a href="The%20Cricketer">The Cricketer</a>": "'First he bowled me an off-break, then he bowled me a leg-break; then his googly, then a bumper, then one that went with his arm ...' 'But that's only five, Maurice. What about the last one?' 'Oh, that,' said Maurice deprecatingly. 'That was a straight 'un and it bowled me. Among his team-mates, Leyland was known as "Tonnip", or "Turnip", possibly a reference to his country upbringing. Robertson-Glasgow and Cardus wrote prolifically on Leyland; Gibson suggests that these pieces are among their best work. Leyland was popular with team-mates, opponents and spectators around the world. Swanton concluded his obituary of Leyland: "No more courageous or determined cricketer ever buckled on pads for England."

Maryland Route 36

Maryland Route 36 (also known as MD 36 or Route 36) is a <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> located in <a href="Allegany%20County%2C%20Maryland">Allegany County</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. MD 36's southern terminus is at the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%2046">West Virginia Route 46</a> (WV 46) bridge in <a href="Westernport%2C%20Maryland">Westernport</a> and its northern terminus at <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20Alternate%20%28Keyser%27s%20Ridge-Cumberland%29">U.S. Route 40 Alternate</a> near <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a>. Between Westernport and <a href="Frostburg%2C%20Maryland">Frostburg</a>, it is known as Georges Creek Road, and from Frostburg to Cumberland it is known as Mount Savage Road. Like the majority of Maryland state highways, MD 36 is maintained by the <a href="Maryland%20State%20Highway%20Administration">Maryland State Highway Administration</a> (MDSHA).

MD 36 serves as the main road through the <a href="Georges%20Creek%20Valley">Georges Creek Valley</a>, a region which is historically known for <a href="coal%20mining">coal mining</a>, and has been designated by MDSHA as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. MD 36 is the main road connecting the towns of Westernport, <a href="Lonaconing%2C%20Maryland">Lonaconing</a>, and <a href="Midland%2C%20Maryland">Midland</a> in southwestern Allegany County, as well as Frostburg, <a href="Mount%20Savage%2C%20Maryland">Mount Savage</a>, and <a href="Corriganville%2C%20Maryland">Corriganville</a> in northwestern Allegany County.

MD 36 has two main sections: Georges Creek Road, which runs along the <a href="Georges%20Creek%20Valley">Georges Creek Valley</a>, from <a href="Westernport%2C%20Maryland">Westernport</a> to <a href="Frostburg%2C%20Maryland">Frostburg</a> in southwestern Allegany County, and Mount Savage Road, which runs eastward from Frostburg to <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a> in northwestern Allegany County. MD 36 is a part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> as a principal arterial from I-68 to US 40 Alternate in Frostburg and from MD 35 at Corriganville to US 40 Alternate in Cumberland.
MD 36 begins at the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%2046">WV 46</a> bridge in Westernport and runs northeast across western <a href="Allegany%20County%2C%20Maryland">Allegany County</a> as a two-lane road named Georges Creek Road, named for <a href="Georges%20Creek%20%28Potomac%20River%29">Georges Creek</a>, a <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> tributary which the road parallels. The speed limit for most of the length between Westernport and <a href="Lonaconing%2C%20Maryland">Lonaconing</a> is . A short distance outside Westernport city limits, MD 36 intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20937">MD 937</a>, an old alignment of MD 36. Near <a href="Barton%2C%20Maryland">Barton</a>, MD 36 intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20935">MD 935</a>, which is the old alignment of MD 36 through Barton. MD 36 bypasses Barton, climbing the hillside above the Georges Creek Valley before descending back into the valley as it approaches Lonaconing. MD 935 returns to MD 36 south of Lonaconing, with its northern terminus at MD 36.

As the road enters Lonaconing, it narrows and the speed limit drops to , increasing to after it travels through Lonaconing. MD 36 passes through Lonaconing as Main Street, and it intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%20657">MD 657</a> near the center of Lonaconing. Along Main Street in Lonaconing is the <a href="Lonaconing%2C%20Maryland%23The%20Lonaconing%20Furnace%20%281836%E2%80%931855%29">Lonaconing Iron Furnace</a>, a historic <a href="blast%20furnace">blast furnace</a> which operated in the early 19th century.
MD 36 then continues toward <a href="Midland%2C%20Maryland">Midland</a>. At Midland, there is a sharp curve in the road, and the speed limit drops to . Along this curve, MD 36 intersects Church Street, which connects to <a href="Maryland%20Route%20936">MD 936</a>, the old alignment of MD 36 between Midland and Frostburg. The new alignment of MD 36 proceeds northeast, passing near <a href="Vale%20Summit%2C%20Maryland">Vale Summit</a>, where it intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%2055">MD 55</a>.

North of the MD 55 intersection, MD 36 passes west of a <a href="park%20and%20ride">park and ride</a> lot before it meets <a href="Interstate%2068">Interstate 68</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Maryland">U.S. Route 40</a> at a <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a> at exit 34. Near this interchange is <a href="God%27s%20Ark%20of%20Safety">God's Ark of Safety</a>, a church famous for its attempt to build a replica of <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Noah's Ark</a>. Between Midland and Frostburg, the speed limit is again , and there is a short section near the Interstate 68/U.S. Route 40 interchange where MD 36 expands to four lanes. Upon entering Frostburg, MD 36 joins <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20Alternate%20%28Keyser%27s%20Ridge-Cumberland%29"></a> as Main Street. MD 36 follows Main Street westward through Frostburg, meeting the northern terminus of MD 936 at Grant Street. At Depot Street, near the center of Frostburg, MD 36 connects to the western depot of the <a href="Western%20Maryland%20Scenic%20Railroad">Western Maryland Scenic Railroad</a>. At the intersection with Water Street, MD 36 leaves , and upon leaving Frostburg city limits its name changes to Mount Savage Road.

After leaving Frostburg, MD 36 is known as Mount Savage Road, as it travels eastward, perpendicular to its signed direction, toward <a href="Mount%20Savage%2C%20Maryland">Mount Savage</a>. North of <a href="Eckhart%20Mines%2C%20Maryland">Eckhart Mines</a>, MD 36 meets <a href="Maryland%20Route%20638">MD 638</a>, which connects MD 36 to in Eckhart Mines. The road between Frostburg and Mount Savage is particularly curvy, and includes several <a href="hairpin%20turn">hairpin turn</a>s near Frostburg. The speed limit on this section of the road is .

As the road enters Mount Savage, it passes by the <a href="Mount%20Savage%20Castle">Mount Savage Castle</a>, a Scottish-style castle built in 1840, which currently operates as a <a href="bed-and-breakfast">bed-and-breakfast</a>. In Mount Savage, the route narrows as it follows Main Street, and the road is frequently obstructed by parked cars, making it difficult for two cars to pass by each other. East of Mount Savage, the route widens and its speed limit gradually increases to .

In <a href="Barrelville%2C%20Maryland">Barrelville</a>, MD 36 intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%2047">MD 47</a>, which connects it with <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20160">PA 160</a> in <a href="Somerset%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Somerset County</a>. From its intersection with MD 47 to its terminus at <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a>, MD 36 follows newer alignments, with the old alignments being designated <a href="Maryland%20Route%20831">MD 831</a>. At <a href="Corriganville%2C%20Maryland">Corriganville</a>, MD 36 intersects <a href="Maryland%20Route%2035">MD 35</a>, which connects it with <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%2096">PA 96</a> in <a href="Bedford%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bedford County</a>. MD 36 ends at U.S. Route 40 Alternate at the <a href="Cumberland%20Narrows">Narrows</a> near Cumberland.

MD 36 passes through the <a href="Georges%20Creek%20Valley">Georges Creek Valley</a>, which has a long history of <a href="coal%20mining">coal mining</a>. In recognition of this, the <a href="Maryland%20State%20Highway%20Administration">MDSHA</a> has designated MD 36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley. <a href="Underground%20mining%20%28soft%20rock%29">Deep mining</a>, which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>, replaced primarily by <a href="surface%20mining">surface mining</a>. Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production, coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the <a href="AES%20Corporation">AES</a> <a href="Warrior%20Run%20Generating%20Station">Warrior Run</a> power plant in Cumberland.

MD 36 was assigned a route number before 1927, earlier than most of the other Maryland state highways. The original alignment of MD 36 in southern Allegany County closely paralleled the <a href="Georges%20Creek%20Railroad">Georges Creek Railroad</a>. Later realignments have shifted MD 36 away from the railroad in several locations, but three crossings remain: one north of Lonaconing, one south of Lonaconing near the <a href="Maryland%20Route%20935">MD 935</a> intersection, and a third crossing near Westernport.

Over the years, multiple new alignments of MD 36 have been built for various reasons, such as to smooth out curves in the road. Several of the old alignments have been assigned route numbers of their own. The southernmost of these is <a href="Maryland%20Route%20937">MD 937</a>, which consists of the old alignment through Westernport. Prior to the construction of the bridge connecting MD 36 to <a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%2046">WV 46</a>, MD 937 was the alignment of MD 36 through Westernport, ending at <a href="Maryland%20Route%20135">MD 135</a>. In <a href="Barton%2C%20Maryland">Barton</a>, <a href="Maryland%20Route%20935">MD 935</a> carries the old alignment of MD 36. The longest of the old alignment sections is <a href="Maryland%20Route%20936">MD 936</a>, which runs from Midland to Frostburg, and was bypassed in the 1970s with a new alignment of MD 36 following part of <a href="Maryland%20Route%2055">MD 55</a> and connecting to . Prior to this change, MD 55 ended in Midland; it has since been truncated to its current terminus at Vale Summit.

North of Frostburg, several old alignments are designated as <a href="Maryland%20Route%20831">MD 831</a>, though these segments of road are not signed. Among these segments of road are Kriegbaum Road (designated as <a href="Maryland%20Route%20831">MD 831C</a>), and Old Mount Savage Road (designated as <a href="Maryland%20Route%20831">MD 831A</a>). Kriegbaum Road splits from MD 36 west of <a href="Corriganville%2C%20Maryland">Corriganville</a> and runs through Corriganville, returning to MD 36 east of the town. Old Mount Savage Road intersects MD 36 west of the <a href="Cumberland%20Narrows">Cumberland Narrows</a>, and runs southward to intersect near its current intersection with MD 36.

Smallville (season 1)

Season one of "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>", an American <a href="television%20series">television series</a> developed by <a href="Alfred%20Gough">Alfred Gough</a> and <a href="Miles%20Millar">Miles Millar</a>, began airing on October 16, 2001, on <a href="The%20WB%20Television%20Network">The WB</a> television network. The series recounts the early adventures of <a href="Krypton%20%28comics%29">Kryptonian</a> <a href="Clark%20Kent%20%28Smallville%29">Clark Kent</a> as he adjusts to his developing superpowers in the fictional town of <a href="Smallville%20%28comics%29">Smallville</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, during the years before he becomes <a href="Superman">Superman</a>. The first season comprises 21 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 21, 2002. Regular cast members during season one include <a href="Tom%20Welling">Tom Welling</a>, <a href="Kristin%20Kreuk">Kristin Kreuk</a>, <a href="Michael%20Rosenbaum">Michael Rosenbaum</a>, <a href="Eric%20Johnson%20%28actor%29">Eric Johnson</a>, <a href="Sam%20Jones%20III">Sam Jones III</a>, <a href="Allison%20Mack">Allison Mack</a>, <a href="Annette%20O%27Toole">Annette O'Toole</a>, and <a href="John%20Schneider%20%28screen%20actor%29">John Schneider</a>.

The season's stories focus on <a href="Characters%20of%20Smallville%23Martha%20Kent">Martha</a> and <a href="Characters%20of%20Smallville%23Jonathan%20Kent">Jonathan Kent</a>'s (O'Toole and Schneider) attempts to help their adopted son Clark (Welling) cope with his <a href="Fictional%20extraterrestrials">alien</a> origin and control his developing <a href="superhuman">superhuman</a> abilities. Clark must deal with the meteor-infected individuals that begin appearing in Smallville, his love for <a href="Lana%20Lang%20%28Smallville%29">Lana Lang</a> (Kreuk), and not being able to tell his two best friends, <a href="Characters%20of%20Smallville%23Pete%20Ross">Pete Ross</a> (Jones III) and <a href="Chloe%20Sullivan">Chloe Sullivan</a> (Mack), about his abilities or his origins. Clark also befriends <a href="Lex%20Luthor%20%28Smallville%29">Lex Luthor</a> (Rosenbaum) after saving Lex's life. The season also follows Lex, as he tries to assert his independence from his father, <a href="Lionel%20Luthor">Lionel Luthor</a> (<a href="John%20Glover%20%28actor%29">John Glover</a>).

The episodes were filmed primarily in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and <a href="post-production">post-production</a> work took place in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Gough and Millar assisted the writing staff with week-to-week story development. "<a href="Villain%20of%20the%20week">Villain of the week</a>" storylines were predominant during the first season; physical effects, make-up effects, and <a href="computer%20generated%20imagery">computer generated imagery</a> became important components as well. Limited filming schedules sometimes forced guest actors to perform physical stunts, and the series regulars were more than willing to do stunt work. Episode budgets ultimately became strictly regulated, as the show frequently ran over budget during the first half of the season. The <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot</a> broke The WB's viewership record for a debut series, and was nominated for various awards. Although the villain of the week storylines became a concern for producers, critical reception was generally favorable, and the series was noted as having a promising start. The first season was released on DVD on September 23, 2003, and included various special features that focused on individual episodes and the series as a whole. It has also been released on home media in regions 2 and 4 in the international markets.

<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>

Ground rules for story development were established at the outset. Part of the marketing pitch, "no flights, no tights" dictated that Clark would not wear the Superman costume, nor would he fly. After initial discussion of possible storylines, a second rule decreed that Clark could never directly kill anyone. This created a dilemma since Clark must be able to defeat the "bad guys" from week to week. A solution developed in later episodes with the introduction of the <a href="Belle%20Reve%23Smallville">Belle Reve</a> sanitarium (Belle Reve is a Federal <a href="prison">prison</a> for <a href="metahuman">metahuman</a>s and other supervillains in the comics).

After setting the ground rules, Gough and Millar conceived ideas that facilitated week-to-week story development. For example, kryptonite's role was expanded to include enhancement of the sins of the antagonist: instead of creating physical monsters, exposure to kryptonite would amplify their personal demons. This was not treated as literally in the pilot and "Metamorphosis" as it was in later episodes. In "Cool", it was "the 'cool' kid literally [becoming] cool, needing human body heat to stay alive". After several episodes, the writers developed a story that would help establish the show as more than a "villain of the week" series. The ninth episode ("Rogue"), which took longer than usual to develop due to its divergence from the standard formula, became their first "true crime story" and demonstrated that "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>" could include more than kryptonite-powered villains.

"What if" episodes were another Millar-Gough concept used to generate first season storylines. These episodes posed underlying questions about Clark. Episodes would evolve from basic questions, including: "what if someone had a crush on Lana, and acted on that obsession"; "what if someone found out Clark's secret"; "what if someone else had Clark's powers?" These three questions developed into the episodes "Metamorphosis", "Rogue", and "Leech", respectively. "Stray", episode 16, answered the question, "what if Clark had been adopted by the wrong parents and his powers were exploited?" "X-Ray" director Mark Verheiden and the rest of the crew realized divergent, unrelated storylines were not the best way to create episodes for "Smallville". Verheiden believes "X-Ray" was the first episode that managed to bring all the side-stories together so that they affected characters other than Clark and Lana.
"Hourglass" was one of the stories included in Millar and Gough's initial pitch to the network (at the time it was referred to as "Cassandra"). "Hourglass" was the first episode to present two, distinct stories: the vengeful <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> and the <a href="second%20sight">second sight</a>ed Cassandra. Two significant storylines in the same episode forced the writers to spend more time developing the episode. Cassandra's "visceral vision" (as it was referred to in the script) of Lex's future was developed into color <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>s to better illustrate to the filmmakers the "blood rain" described in the text.

When the filmmakers were dissatisfied with the initial drafts of episodes, specifically with the evolution of characters, they would rewrite events, or add scenes to re-establish the original vision. The character of Earl Jenkins (<a href="Tony%20Todd">Tony Todd</a>), intended to be a sympathetic villain, came across as "completely unlikable" in the original draft of "Jitters". The character suffers from over-exposure to kryptonite, causing massive <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s; if Jenkins happened to grab someone, they could be shaken to death. Originally, the character is first seen banging on the door of LuthorCorp and killing a security guard during one of his seizures. To present a more favorable aspect to the audience, a scene in which Earl visits his infant child was added to show that he was not a "raving maniac". Similar rewrites occurred with the characters Ryan James (<a href="Ryan%20Kelley">Ryan Kelley</a>) in "Stray" and Tyler Randall (<a href="Reynaldo%20Rosales">Reynaldo Rosales</a>) in "Reaper". In the original draft of "Stray", Ryan developed his telepathic abilities from exposure to kryptonite.; to emphasize the show was not always about kryptonite-infected villains, the story was revised so that Ryan had his ability from birth. The network also expressed dissatisfaction with Ryan as a murderer, so the character was rewritten to be the "nice kid". The character of Tyler Randall shared Earl Jenkins's issue: he was not sympathetic enough in the filmmakers' eyes; intended to be an escaped prisoner, he was rewritten to be "the world's deadliest nice guy".

Production was set up in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada, because the creators were looking for a "Middle America landscape", and Vancouver was a good substitute for Kansas. David Nutter, the director of the pilot, was given 16 days for main unit filming, twice that of the normal timeframe. Despite the extended schedule, it was still a short amount of time, and he shot the pilot primarily from storyboards created by Adrien Van Viersen.

Millar developed most of the look for "Smallville" with the idea that Smallville should be the epitome of "Smalltown, USA". Millar's design required existing buildings to be painted, built, and remodeled. The Kent farm is the home of the Andalini family, and their barn was used for the pilot before a new barn was built. The new barn was one of the major additions to the sets of the episode "Metamorphosis". Production designer Doug Higgins and his crew built a fully functioning, three-story barn for the Kent farm on a converted <a href="soundstage">soundstage</a> in <a href="Burnaby">Burnaby</a>. For the pilot, the crew built only a loft, with a set of stairs leading up to it, inside the existing barn on the Andalinis' property. To resemble the Andalinis' barn as closely as possible, Higgins had his crew locate 100-year-old wood to match the look of the Andalinis' barn. The episode "Hourglass" called for several scenes to take place at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. Instead of building their own set, the "Smallville" producers called <a href="John%20Wells%20%28TV%20producer%29">John Wells</a>, producer of the political drama television series "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>", and obtained permission to use the "West Wing" set to film the vision of Lex's future.

When the "Smallville" crew was not filming on one of the constructed sets, or on a <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a>, they were shooting <a href="Filming%20location">on location</a> at the surrounding Vancouver sites. During the filming of "Metamorphosis", Vancouver was holding a <a href="farmers%27%20market">farmers' market</a>, which proved beneficial to the "Smallville" crew, as "Metamorphosis" called for a similar event to take place in the episode. The market was on the verge of ending, so the filmmakers shot what wide-angle scenes they could at the time, and filmed a close up conversation between Whitney and Clark at the Andalini's farm, weeks after the initial market shooting. Other filming locations include Vancouver's <a href="Pacific%20National%20Exhibition">Pacific National Exhibition</a> and <a href="Burnaby">Burnaby's</a> <a href="Swangard%20Stadium">Swangard Stadium</a>. The Pacific National Exhibit provided a storage silo for a scene in "Hourglass", which involved Harry Bollston (<a href="Eric%20Christian%20Olsen">Eric Christian Olsen</a>) attacking Martha Kent (O'Toole) in the Kents' corn silo. "Hothead" director Greg Beeman, who had previously worked with Gough and Millar on "<a href="The%20Strip%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Strip</a>" and "<a href="Martial%20Law%20%28TV%20series%29">Martial Law</a>", used Swangard Stadium, as a substitution for Smallville High Stadium, for the opening football scene that took place at night.

When filming fell behind schedule, another director came in to assist the main unit director in finishing the episode. Greg Beeman assisted director Chris Long for the two "visceral visions of the future" that appeared in the episode "Hourglass". "Jitters" was an episode with so many changes that its initial scheduling as the second episode of the season was pushed back to the eighth spot. By the time filming for "Jitters" was completed, three directors had worked on the project: Greg Beeman, Phil Sgriccia, and Michael Watkins; however, Watkins was given sole directing credit for the episode.

A big part of the "Smallville" series relies on the effects it delivers, whether <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">digital</a>, <a href="Stunt%23Practical%20effects">physical</a>, or special <a href="Make-up%20artist">make-up</a> <a href="Special%20effect">effects</a>. The effects shots, part of the <a href="post-production">post-production</a> work, are developed and added in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. David Nutter hired Thomas Special Effects to create digital cornfields for the pilot episode. After attempting to grow ten thousand stalks of corn in a greenhouse, which only grew two feet tall, Nutter was forced to rely primarily on digital corn. Faux corn was also flown in from <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. CGI supervisor Bill Millar created digital butterflies for a scene in Lana's bedroom, and all the insects Greg Arkin (<a href="Chad%20Donella">Chad Donella</a>) collected in the episode "Metamorphosis". Greg's insects had to be created digitally, because a green hue was needed to illustrate the kryptonite radiation in the insects. After the opening credits, the <a href="first-person%20narrative">first person</a> view of someone, later revealed to be Clark, flying through Lana's open window and into her bedroom was created digitally. The effect was accomplished with stock footage, a sound stage and computer generated imagery. Stock footage shot from a helicopter, as it flew over several farms during the day, was used for the first person point of view. It was altered from day to night, and a CGI house was created in an empty field. Lana's bedroom as built on a soundstage, and CGI was used to create the illusion of someone traveling through her open window and stopping above her bed.

It was decided the effects of kryptonite poisoning on Clark, "Clark time", and the appearance of kryptonite when in the proximity of Clark would need to be illustrated in a way the audience could understand if they were not familiar with the character. Gough and Millar, after doing some research, learned the female audience was not aware of what was happening when Clark was exposed to kryptonite. Beginning with "Metamorphosis", whenever Clark was exposed to kryptonite, his veins would rise up and develop a green hue to illustrate the effect it was having. Close-up shots of Clark's hand were used for these scenes, and it was all created with digital animation. Gough and Millar developed the idea that kryptonite would only glow when it was around Clark, as it was meant to demonstrate the draining of his powers. "Clark time", the same idea behind <a href="bullet%20time">bullet time</a>, was created because previous incarnations had not explained the idea of what the world appears like to Clark when he is using his powers. The first instance of "Clark time" was used in the "Metamorphosis" scene where Greg Arkin attacks Clark and Jonathan in their barn. Jonathan is pushed over a banister and falls in the direction of some dangerous farm equipment. The effect involved slowing time down for everything except Clark, who would be moving at normal pace. When tackling Clark's emerging power of <a href="X-ray%20vision">X-ray vision</a>, Gough and Millar wanted to be able to see skeletons and bones, as opposed to previous incarnations that treated the ability like "see-through" vision. The recent advances in computer imagery helped them complete that task.

The digital effects costs for each episode could stretch the budget thin. In "Shimmer", Bill Millar, special effects supervisor, planned to create an artificial sunset for the closing scene involving Clark and Lana. The effects shot was supposed to last only a couple of seconds. James Marshall, the <a href="second%20unit%20director">second unit director</a> for the episode, decided to shoot the entire scene over the shoulders of Clark and Lana, looking at the sunset. The scene called for two <a href="Chroma%20key">greenscreen</a> shots, but when Marshall was finished he had created seventeen greenscreen shots. The seventeen shots, which produced the artificial sunset, cost $50,000 to produce. By comparison, the entire effects budget costs between $65,000 and $100,000.

Over-spending of that nature became a regular occurrence on the "Smallville" set. The regularity of over-spending came to an end with "Kinetic", as the studio decided to be stricter. With the budget on a stiffer guideline, the filmmakers were forced to cut scenes from "Kinetic", an episode that was caught in the push for more budget-friendly scripts. One of the scenes that was cut involved one of the thieves phasing through a safe wall, and acting as a portal for the merchandise to be passed through. When digital effects were not an option, Mike Walls, the physical effects supervisor who began his "Smallville" career with "Leech", still tried to provide big effects. For instance, Walls used 75 cars for the final action scene of "Kinetic", which were cabled off to protect the actors. <a href="Stunt%20coordinator">Stunt coordinator</a> Lauro Chartrand attempts to make sure the actors are used as much as possible when performing fight scenes, unless the scenes are particularly dangerous. The fast shooting schedule forces Chartrand to rely on guest stars who can perform their own stunts, because of the limited time to find a "good double" for the actor.

Physical effects were not an issue for the series regulars. Allison Mack performed her own stunts for the scene in "Hothead" where her character's office is set on fire, and again in "Kinetic", when she was cabled off and dangled above the ground. For "Nicodemus", the stunt coordinator received twice the help. Kristin Kreuk was expected to go to the tenth rung of a <a href="water%20tower">water tower</a>, in a scene which involved her character climbing to the top and falling off. As filming progressed, Kreuk climbed to the top, so the crew cabled her off and dropped her to the bottom. John Schneider's experience from "The Dukes of Hazzard" led to him performing the <a href="Stunt%23Vehicular%20stunts">stunt driving</a> for his character. The scene required Schneider to <a href="Drifting%20%28motorsport%29">slide</a> his truck around a corner, while yelling at some pedestrians on the sidewalk. The previous scene had established the driver side window as closed, so Schneider improvised and opened the driver's door as he slid 90° around a corner.

The series' pilot broke <a href="the%20WB%20Television%20Network">The WB</a>'s record for highest-rated debut with 8.35 million viewers, 3.8/9 in the 18-49 demographic, 4.5/12 in the 18-34 demographic and beat its lead-in <a href="Gilmore%20Girls">Gilmore Girls</a>, which was viewed by 5.99 million viewers, 2.4/6 in the 18-49 demographic, 2.8/8 in the 18-34 demographic by 39.4%, 58.3%, 60.7% respectively. In the 18-34 male demographic, it's 5.0 rating nearly tripled its lead-in (1.7). After airing the first two episodes, which averaged 7.8 million viewers, the WB placed an order for a full season of 21 episodes. The first season averaged 5.9 million viewers weekly, placing #115 in the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> alongside "<a href="Futurama">Futurama</a>", "<a href="The%20Ellen%20Show">The Ellen Show</a>", and "". The pilot and "Tempest" were selected in <a href="The%20Futon%20Critic">The Futon Critic</a>'s 50 best episodes of 2001 and 2002, respectively. The pilot placed 31st, while "Tempest" placed 15th.

Often, the show would beat its lead-in, "Gilmore Girls" (which saw a 60% surge in its new timeslot) in the ratings. Towards the end of the season, it was #1 with viewers under 35 in the ratings, which beat <a href="Frasier">Frasier</a>, <a href="Scrubs%20%28TV%20Series%29">Scrubs</a>, and "<a href="24%20%28TV%20series%29">24</a>". 

The season received mostly favorable reviews. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Jeremy Conrad, who was initially against the idea of "reimagining" the Superman mythology, gave the first season a 7/10 rating. After reviewing the entire season, Conrad stated the first season of "Smallville" was "a solid start to what will be a great Superman TV series". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" Bruce Fretts believes the series might appear "corny" on the surface, but actually shows "subversively witty spin on the comic-book myths". <a href="Clint%20Morris">Clint Morris</a>, founder of Moviehole.net, stated the series was "still finding its feet in season one"; although, he commended the acting, citing specifically Michael Rosenbaum's "uncontrollably likeable Lex Luthor". "The Free-Lance Star"'s Rob Hedelt commended the casting as well, comparing Welling's portrayal of a teenage Clark Kent to that of <a href="Christopher%20Reeve">Christopher Reeve</a>'s portrayal in the films. Hedelt considered John Schneider and Annette O'Toole to be ideal picks for Jonathan and Martha Kent, but felt Allison Mack and Sam Jones III, important characters, were the weakest part of the ensemble. Judge Byun, of <a href="DVD%20Verdict">DVD Verdict</a>, felt having Clark Kent and Lex Luthor start their relationship as best friends was a "brilliant concept" that moved the show past a ""<a href="Dawson%27s%20Creek">Dawson's Creek</a>" with super powers" tone the premise of the show suggested. Byun believes the first season had "solid writing and excellent performances", but is weakened by the freak of the week storylines that plagued the early episodes of the season; the season works best when the episodes focus on character development and not super powers.

Other critics were less enthusiastic about the season. Peter Bowes of <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> felt the season was simply a "<a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a>" with "pretty young people". Bowes believes the season suffered from the "sentimental boy-girl storyline", but that die-hard Superman fans would still be taken in by this incarnation of the character's early years. A common criticism for the first season was the use of "<a href="villain%20of%20the%20week">villain of the week</a>" storylines. By the time the first seven episodes aired, at least one journalist had had enough of the villain of the week format. "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>"'s <a href="Rob%20Owen%20%28journalist%29">Rob Owen</a> stated the series works best with its "character interaction and a nice performance by John Schneider as Pa Kent", but that the show needs more than the "'monster of the week' stories seen so far". Jordan Levin, president of The WB's Entertainment division, recognized the concerns that the show had become a villain of the week series. Levin announced that season two would see more "smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes, to get away from some of the formulaic storytelling structure" the series has fallen into.

By 2003, the first season had been nominated for and won various awards. It won an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for "Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series", and the pilot episode was nominated for "Outstanding Visual Effects for a Series". The pilot was recognized by other award organizations, receiving a <a href="Leo%20Awards">Leo Award</a> for "Best Visual Effects" in 2002. Peter Wunstorf was recognized for his work on the pilot with a nomination by the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Cinematographers">American Society of Cinematographers</a>. Casting directors Deedee Bradley, Coreen Mayrs, and Barbara Miller were nominated for an <a href="Casting%20Society%20of%20America">Artios Award</a> for their work on the pilot. Chris McGeary was nominated for Golden Reel's "Best Sound Editing in Television" award for his music editing on the pilot. The season one finale, "Tempest", was nominated for Golden Reel's "Best Sound Editing in Television Episodic" in 2003. In 2002, The <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%2C%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers</a> honored the band <a href="Remy%20Zero">Remy Zero</a> (which provided the opening theme song for "Smallville") and composer <a href="Mark%20Snow">Mark Snow</a> for their contributions to the show; the award recognized the composers of the theme or underscore of the highest rated television series during January 1 – December 31, 2001.

Several members of the regular cast were nominated for awards. In 2001, Rosenbaum, Kreuk, and Welling were nominated for <a href="Saturn%20Awards">Saturn Awards</a> for <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor%20on%20Television">Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series</a>, <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20on%20Television">Best Actress</a>, and <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20on%20Television">Best Actor</a>, respectively. Rosenbaum and Kreuk received additional nominations for male and female Cinescape Genre Face of the Future awards, and the entire season was nominated for <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Network%20Television%20Series">Best Network Television Series</a>. Rosenbaum was the only one to win an award (Best Supporting Actor). Tom Welling won the <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Awards">Teen Choice Award</a> for Choice Breakout TV Star—Male in 2002. "Smallville's" first season placed sixth on the <a href="Parents%20Television%20Council">Parents Television Council</a>'s list of the "best shows for families".

The complete first season of "Smallville" was released on September 23, 2003 in North America. Additional released in region 2 and region 4 took place on October 13, 2003 and December 3, 2003, respectively. The DVD box set included various special features, including episode commentary, an interactive tour of Smallville, and storyboards from select episodes.

Love, Inc. (TV series)

Love, Inc. is an American television <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> created by Andrew Secunda, which originally aired for one season on <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) from September 22, 2005 to May 11, 2006. With an <a href="ensemble%20cast">ensemble cast</a> led by <a href="Busy%20Philipps">Busy Philipps</a>, <a href="Vince%20Vieluf">Vince Vieluf</a>, <a href="Reagan%20Gomez-Preston">Reagan Gomez-Preston</a>, <a href="Ion%20Overman">Ion Overman</a> and <a href="Holly%20Robinson%20Peete">Holly Robinson Peete</a>, the show revolves around five <a href="matchmaking">matchmakers</a> working at a <a href="Dating%23Matchmaking%20systems%20and%20services">dating agency</a>. The series was produced by Chase TV, the Littlefield Company, Burg/Koules Television, and <a href="Paramount%20Television">Paramount Television</a>. It was distributed by UPN in its original run and later by <a href="LivingTV">LivingTV</a> and <a href="Nelonen">Nelonen</a> in the United Kingdom and Finland respectively. The executive producers were <a href="Adam%20Chase%20%28writer%29">Adam Chase</a>, <a href="Warren%20Littlefield">Warren Littlefield</a>, <a href="Mark%20Burg">Mark Burg</a> and <a href="Oren%20Koules">Oren Koules</a>.

The series was originally developed as a <a href="star%20vehicle">vehicle</a> and sitcom debut for <a href="Shannen%20Doherty">Shannen Doherty</a> under the working title "Wingwoman". Though picked up by UPN, Doherty was removed from the project at the request of the network due to her poor reception by preview audiences; she was replaced by Philipps. The show was set in New York City, but filming took place at <a href="Paramount%20Studios">Paramount Studios</a> in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, Los Angeles and other locations in California. It included contemporary hip hop music and was promoted heavily by UPN to attract an urban audience, and to that end it was paired with "<a href="Everybody%20Hates%20Chris">Everybody Hates Chris</a>" as its <a href="block%20programming">lead-in</a> on <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">Thursday nights</a>.

"Love, Inc." suffered from low viewership despite its high ratings among young Hispanic women; it was canceled following UPN's merger with <a href="the%20WB">the WB</a> to launch <a href="the%20CW">the CW</a> in 2006. The series' cancellation, along with that of other <a href="black%20sitcom">black sitcom</a>s, was criticized by media outlets for reducing representation of African American characters and the amount of roles for African American actors on television. Critical response to "Love, Inc." was mixed; some critics praised its multi-ethnic cast, while others felt that the storylines and characters were unoriginal and Philipps' portrayal of her character was unsympathetic. It has not been made available on Blu-ray or DVD.

Set in New York City, the dating agency Love, Inc. features a staff of single friends desperately looking for love. Newly divorced Clea Lavoy, the founder and owner of the company, seeks out the help of her friend and employee Denise Johnson to reignite her romantic life. She struggles continually to find love despite Denise's best attempts. The future of the agency is jeopardized since its success relied on advertising Clea's "successful", nearly decade-long marriage. Love, Inc. also includes the receptionist Viviana, the style expert Francine, and the technician and photographer Barry.

Episodes typically depict the inner workings of the agency, such as their first experience with a lesbian client, a consultation with a former priest, and marketing strategies to appeal to geeks and <a href="Agoraphobia">agoraphobes</a>. Hired as <a href="wingman%20%28social%29">wingmen</a> for their clients, the employees act as "guardian angels for the conversationally challenged". Each of the characters has various comedic and romantic adventures outside the agency, like Viviana's search for an eligible United States citizen to marry to secure a <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">green card</a> and Denise's inability to find true love despite her talent in matching her clients with their "seemingly unattainable soulmates".

The series features the following five main characters throughout its run:


"Love, Inc." was developed with the working title "Wing Woman" and promoted as a new '<a href="Hitch%20%28film%29">Hitch</a>'-esque comedy". The show's concept was based on an article in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that discussed dating services. Production was handled by Chase TV, the Littlefield Company, Burg/Koules Television, and <a href="Paramount%20Television">Paramount Television</a>. The Littlefield Company suggested that the show's creator, Andrew Secunda, collaborate with executive producer <a href="Adam%20Chase%20%28writer%29">Adam Chase</a>, who had previously worked on "<a href="Friends">Friends</a>". The series was Secunda's first experience creating a television <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a>. <a href="Marta%20Kauffman">Marta Kauffman</a>, Liz Tuccillo, Mark Burg and Oren Koules also contributed to the series as executive producers. On April 12, 2005, <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) announced that Doherty was in talks for the lead role while Reagan Gomez-Preston was being considered for the role of the lead character's "longtime friend, co-worker and roommate" and Ion Overman for an unspecified part. Overman said that she was attracted to the part since she was searching for a job and viewed the series as a "very cool concept". On April 18, Holly Robinson Peete was confirmed to have joined the cast as Doherty's character's boss.

The series was originally designed as a <a href="star%20vehicle">star vehicle</a> for Doherty, who portrayed Denise Johnson in the unaired pilot. Denise was Doherty's first role in a television sitcom. Doherty said that she loved the script for the <a href="television%20pilot">pilot</a> immediately, describing it as "hysterical", but felt intimidated by the role given her inexperience with comedy. The series was marketed initially as featuring Doherty and Peete, before UPN announced that it would pick up the show on the condition that Doherty was removed and the character was recast. According to "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>", Doherty was poorly received by preview audiences. When queried by an interviewer about Doherty's removal from the show, executive producer Warren Littlefield said the actress was "fabulous" in the role. According to him, Doherty wanted to change her negative reputation after leaving "<a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%2090210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a>" and "<a href="Charmed">Charmed</a>" by acting on the show. Peete praised her performance saying "we had so much fun and such a great vibe". UPN Entertainment's president cited the rationale behind Doherty's departure using the "standard going-in-a-different-direction reason". Rachel Cericola of TV Fodder listed "Love, Inc." as one the "four promising sitcoms for the upcoming TV season" as a result of the behind the scenes drama involving Doherty's replacement.

UPN announced that Busy Philipps was cast as Denise on July 25, and was later billed as the show's star. According to Vince Vieluf, the casting change from Doherty to Philipps led to the series being retooled as an <a href="Ensemble%20cast">ensemble</a> show featuring all the members of the agency rather than focusing on Denise. Vieluf said the alterations in the series' premise were due to concerns that "people would get tired of a show that was only about the mishaps of one person's love life". <a href="Page%20Kennedy">Page Kennedy</a> reported that he was considered for a part on the show, but rejected it for the role of Caleb Applewhite on the <a href="Desperate%20Housewives%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> of the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> drama "<a href="Desperate%20Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a>". Retired <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> player <a href="Rick%20Fox">Rick Fox</a> <a href="Guest%20appearance">guest-starred</a> in three episodes as David, one of Clea's love interests. <a href="Meghan%20Markle">Meghan Markle</a> appeared in the episode "One on One" as a subway station worker. The casting of racially diverse actors was identified with UPN's position as "the only network to actively program for an African American audience". Tim Good of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" pointed to the show's casting as the only way in which it acts as a "positive reference". 

Even though the show was set in New York City, filming took place in the Bluhdorn Building at <a href="Paramount%20Studios">Paramount Studios</a> in Hollywood, and used the <a href="Multiple-camera%20setup">multiple-camera</a> format. <a href="Aaron%20Korsh">Aaron Korsh</a> wrote the nineteenth episode as freelance work. Each episode title, with the exception of the pilot, was taken from the names of past sitcoms. Transitions between scenes feature images of New York City set to contemporary music, such as <a href="The%20Black%20Eyed%20Peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a>' single "<a href="Don%27t%20Phunk%20with%20My%20Heart">Don't Phunk with My Heart</a>" and <a href="Kelis">Kelis</a>' single "<a href="Milkshake%20%28song%29">Milkshake</a>". Todd R. Ramlow of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" described the music as a further attempt to appeal to "an 'urban', black-white audience," and praised it as a "nice try at crossover for a network whose shows usually target a black demographic".

On August 6, 2005, UPN officially ordered thirteen episodes of the series. The network later ordered a full season of twenty-two episodes of the show on November 7, 2005, amid speculation that it would be canceled. In 2006, <a href="LivingTV">LivingTV</a> broadcast the series in the United Kingdom, and it was broadcast by <a href="Nelonen">Nelonen</a> in Sweden in 2008. UPN paired the series with "<a href="Everybody%20Hates%20Chris">Everybody Hates Chris</a>", "<a href="Eve%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Eve</a>", and "<a href="Cuts">Cuts</a>" to attract an "urban" audience. The network moved "<a href="WWE%20SmackDown">WWE SmackDown</a>" to Fridays in favor of scheduling Thursdays as focused on sitcoms. This decision was made to establish a "night of scripted programming" and to attract more advertising from film studios to promote upcoming releases. <a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">"Today"</a> questioned the network's belief that "Love, Inc." and "Everybody Hates Chris" would appeal to the same viewership, and noted the difference in quality between the two, with "Love, Inc." cited as the inferior show. While the series retained 59% of the audience from "Everybody Hates Chris" initially, this marketing strategy proved unsuccessful when it lost a majority of the viewership in later episodes.

Cericola reported that "Love, Inc." earned an average of 3.6 million viewers per episode and an article in "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" stated that the series garnered an average of 1.0/3 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers">Nielsen rating/share</a> in the 18–49 demographic. It ranked 141st among <a href="Terrestrial%20television">broadcast</a> <a href="television%20network">television network</a>s in the 2005–2006 television season. According to the <a href="Nielsen%20Company">Nielsen Company</a>, the show achieved high ratings among "Latina adolescents Ages 12–17" and earned 3.4 million viewers in that demographic in 2005. It ranked above two other UPN sitcoms: "<a href="One%20on%20One%20%28TV%20series%29">One on One</a>" and "<a href="Half%20%26amp%3B%20Half">Half & Half</a>" for Latin women in the 12–17 age demographic, and in "the top half of all UPN series" for total viewership. The series premiere saw a 6% increase in the 18–49 age range, 53% in women between 18 and 34, and 118% in women between 18 and 49 from the show that aired in the same time period during the previous television season.

The show, as well as a majority of UPN's programs, were officially canceled as a result of the network's merger with <a href="The%20WB">the WB Television Network</a> (the WB) to form <a href="the%20CW">the CW</a> in 2006. Fern Gillespie of "<a href="The%20Crisis">The Crisis</a>" was critical of UPN's decision to cancel the series given how the network "in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African American comedies" for the creation of the CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the <a href="Big%20Three%20television%20networks">three major networks</a> saying: "Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact." Critic Tim Goodman identified "Love, Inc". as one of six shows "geared for an African American audience" and featuring "an African American lead actress" that were canceled during the merger. He equated these cancellations as a sign of networks "eliminat[ing] niche programming". The series has not been made available on Blu-ray or DVD.

"Love, Inc." received mixed critical feedback when it was first broadcast. "<a href="Ebony%20%28magazine%29">Ebony</a>"'s Zondra Hughes included the show in its list of promising prime-time television shows featuring African-American actors, and identified Peete and Overman as its primary "star appeal". While reviewing its broadcast on <a href="LivingTV">LivingTV</a>, a reviewer from "<a href="Daily%20Record%20%28Scotland%29">Daily Record</a>" listed the show as its "pick of the day" and suggested it for viewers who "fancy a giggle". Diane Werts of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" found the characters to be "vibrantly well-defined" and the writing "smart, with a light touch". Peete received a nomination for the <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Actress%20in%20a%20Comedy%20Series">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series</a> in the <a href="37th%20NAACP%20Image%20Awards">37th NAACP Image Awards</a>, but lost to <a href="Tichina%20Arnold">Tichina Arnold</a> who starred in "Everybody Hates Chris".

<a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> assigned a score of 28 out of 100 based on aggregate of 17 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". <a href="The%20Futon%20Critic">The Futon Critic</a>'s Brian Ford Sullivan praised Vieluf as the standout despite his limited role, but felt the execution of the matchmaking premise was inferior to that done in the 2005 film "Hitch". The series was described as having "a quirky vibe, personable cast and snappy writing" by "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"'s Laura Fries, but she felt the storylines and characters required more original material. Although they commended the show for its multi-ethnic cast, Jon Bonné and Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of "Today" wrote that it "struggles to salvage some screechingly bad jokes". Paul Brownfield of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" criticized the series for being "unintentionally unfunny", comparing it to the fictional sitcom "Room and Bored" featured in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> "<a href="The%20Comeback%20%28TV%20series%29">The Comeback</a>". The "Chicago Tribune"'s Maureen Ryan called the series a "grating comedy ... destined to be a footnote in history as the show that premiered after "Everybody Hates Chris", and most likely faded shortly thereafter".

Critics responded negatively to the character of Denise and Philipps' performance, citing both as annoying and unsympathetic. Heffernan found that Denise lacked the charm and charisma of <a href="Cher%20Horowitz">Cher Horowitz</a> from the 1995 film "<a href="Clueless%20%28film%29">Clueless</a>". "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"'s Robert Bianco gave the series a half of a point out of four, and summarized Philipps' performance as "constant motion; her face contorting, body twitching, voice braying" that transformed the show into something "truly unbearable". Citing the series as a "one-joke affair", Matthew GIlbert of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote that the premise behind Denise had the "same irony that failed to make <a href="Alicia%20Silverstone">Alicia Silverstone</a>'s "<a href="Miss%20Match">Miss Match</a>" very interesting". The "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>"'s Rob Owen favored Doherty's portrayal of the character, which he described as "brimming with self-confidence," and characterized Philipps' Denise as a "dizzyingly neurotic nutcase". Ramlow asserted that the show's female characters were "needy and desperate" and "one-shtick ponies" in comparison to those from "<a href="Sex%20and%20the%20City">Sex and the City</a>".

Some Thoughts Concerning Education

Some Thoughts Concerning Education is a 1693 treatise on the education of gentlemen written by the English philosopher <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>. For over a century, it was the most important philosophical work on <a href="education%20in%20England">education in England</a>. It was translated into almost all of the major written European languages during the eighteenth century, and nearly every European writer on education after Locke, including <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, acknowledged its influence.

In his "<a href="An%20Essay%20Concerning%20Human%20Understanding">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a>" (1690), Locke outlined a new <a href="philosophy%20of%20mind">theory of mind</a>, contending that the gentleman's mind was a "<a href="tabula%20rasa">tabula rasa</a>" or "blank slate"; that is, it did not contain any <a href="innate%20idea">innate idea</a>s. "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" explains how to educate that mind using three distinct methods: the development of a healthy body; the formation of a virtuous character; and the choice of an appropriate academic curriculum.

Locke wrote the letters that would eventually become "Some Thoughts" for an aristocratic friend, but his advice had a broader appeal since his educational principles suggested anyone could acquire the same kind of character as the aristocrats for whom Locke originally intended the work.

Rather than writing a wholly original philosophy of education, Locke, it seems, deliberately attempted to popularise several strands of seventeenth-century educational reform at the same time as introducing his own ideas. English writers such as <a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a>, <a href="John%20Aubrey">John Aubrey</a>, <a href="John%20Eachard">John Eachard</a>, and <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a> had previously advocated "similar reforms in curriculum and teaching methods," but they had not succeeded in reaching a wide audience. Curiously, though, Locke proclaims throughout his text that his is a revolutionary work; as Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on "Some Thoughts", has pointed out, "Locke frequently explicitly opposes his recommendations to the 'usual,' 'common,' 'ordinary,' or 'general' education."

As England became increasingly <a href="mercantilism">mercantilist</a> and <a href="secularism">secularist</a>, the <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanist</a> educational values of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, which had enshrined <a href="scholasticism">scholasticism</a>, came to be regarded by many as irrelevant. Following in the intellectual tradition of <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, who had challenged the cultural authority of the <a href="classics">classics</a>, reformers such as Locke, and later <a href="Philip%20Doddridge">Philip Doddridge</a>, argued against <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge</a> and <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a>'s decree that "all Bachelor and Undergraduates in their Disputations should lay aside their various Authors, such that caused many dissensions and strives in the Schools, and only follow <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and those that defend him, and take their Questions from him, and that they exclude from the Schools all steril and inane Questions, disagreeing from the ancient and true Philosophy [sic]." Instead of demanding that their sons spend all of their time studying <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> texts, an increasing number of families began to demand a practical education for their sons; by exposing them to the <a href="scientific%20revolution">emerging sciences</a>, <a href="history%20of%20mathematics">mathematics</a>, and the modern languages, these parents hoped to prepare their sons for the changing economy and, indeed, for the new world they saw forming around them.

In 1684 Edward Clarke asked his friend, John Locke, for advice on raising his son and heir, Edward, Jr.; Locke responded with a series of letters that eventually served as the basis of "Some Thoughts Concerning Education". But it was not until 1693, encouraged by the Clarkes and another friend, <a href="William%20Molyneux">William Molyneux</a>, that Locke actually published the treatise; Locke, "timid" when it came to public exposure, decided to publish the text anonymously.

Although Locke revised and expanded the text five times before he died, he never substantially altered the "familiar and friendly style of the work." The "Preface" alerted the reader to its humble origins as a series of letters and, according to Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on "Some Thoughts", advice that otherwise might have appeared "meddlesome" became welcome. Tarcov claims Locke treated his readers as his friends and they responded in kind.

Of Locke's major claims in the "<a href="Essay%20Concerning%20Human%20Understanding">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a>" and "Some Thoughts Concerning Education", two played a defining role in eighteenth-century educational theory. The first is that education makes the man; as Locke writes at the opening of his treatise, "I think I may say that of all the men we meet with, nine parts of ten are what they are, good or evil, useful or not, by their education." In making this claim, Locke was arguing against both the <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustinian</a> view of man, which grounds its conception of humanity in <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>, and the <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">Cartesian</a> position, which holds that man innately knows basic logical propositions. In his "Essay" Locke posits an "empty" mind—a "<a href="tabula%20rasa">tabula rasa</a>"—that is "filled" by experience. In describing the mind in these terms, Locke was drawing on <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s "<a href="Theaetetus%20%28dialogue%29">Theatetus</a>", which suggests that the mind is like a "wax tablet". Although Locke argued strenuously for the "tabula rasa" theory of mind, he nevertheless did believe in innate talents and interests. For example, he advises parents to watch their children carefully to discover their "aptitudes," and to nurture their children's own interests rather than force them to participate in activities which they dislike—"he, therefore, that is about children should well study their natures and aptitudes and see, by often trials, what turn they easily take and what becomes them, observe what their native stock is, how it may be improved, and what it is fit for."

Locke also discusses a theory of the self. He writes: "the little and almost insensible impressions on our tender infancies have very important and lasting consequences." That is, the "<a href="Association%20of%20Ideas">associations of ideas</a>" made when young are more significant than those made when mature because they are the foundation of the self—they mark the "tabula rasa". In the "Essay", in which he first introduces the theory of the association of ideas, Locke warns against letting "a foolish maid" convince a child that "goblins and sprites" are associated with the darkness, for "darkness shall ever afterwards bring with it those frightful ideas, and they shall be so joined, that he can no more bear the one than the other."

Locke's emphasis on the role of experience in the formation of the mind and his concern with false associations of ideas has led many to characterise his theory of mind as passive rather than active, but as Nicholas Jolley, in his introduction to Locke's philosophical theory, points out, this is "one of the most curious misconceptions about Locke." As both he and Tarcov highlight, Locke's writings are full of directives to seek out knowledge actively and reflect on received opinion; in fact, this was the essence of Locke's challenge to innatism.

Locke advises parents to carefully nurture their children's physical "habits" before pursuing their academic education. As many scholars have remarked, it is unsurprising that a trained physician, as Locke was, would begin "Some Thoughts" with a discussion of children's physical needs, yet this seemingly simple generic innovation has proven to be one of Locke's most enduring legacies—Western child-rearing manuals are still dominated by the topics of food and sleep. To convince parents that they must attend to the health of their children above all, Locke quotes from <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a>'s "Satires"—"a sound mind in a sound body." Locke firmly believed that children should be exposed to harsh conditions while young to inure them to, for example, cold temperatures when they were older: "Children [should] be not too "warmly clad or covered", winter or summer" (Locke's emphasis), he argues, because "bodies will endure anything that from the beginning they are accustomed to." Furthermore, to prevent a child from catching chills and colds, Locke suggests that "his "feet to be washed" every day in cold water, and to have his "shoes" so thin that they might leak and "let in water" whenever he comes near it" (Locke's emphasis). Locke posited that if children were accustomed to having sodden feet, a sudden shower that wet their feet would not cause them to catch a cold. Such advice (whether followed or not) was quite popular; it appears throughout <a href="John%20Newbery">John Newbery</a>'s children's books in the middle of the eighteenth century, for example, the first best-selling children's books in England. Locke also offers specific advice on topics ranging from bed linens to diet to sleeping regimens.

Locke dedicates the bulk of "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" to explaining how to instill virtue in children. He defines virtue as a combination of self-denial and rationality: "that a man is able to "deny himself" his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way" (Locke's emphasis). Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self-denial but also to see the rational path. Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings. Moreover, he argues that parents should, above all, attempt to create a "habit" of thinking rationally in their children. Locke continually emphasises habit over rule—children should internalise the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions. This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke's concerns in the "<a href="Essay%20Concerning%20Human%20Understanding">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a>". Throughout the "Essay", Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability, because of the authority of custom, to change or forfeit long-held beliefs. His attempt to solve this problem is not only to treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments. For Locke, rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists; such sensations arouse passions rather than reason. He argues that "such a sort of "slavish discipline" makes a "slavish temper"" (Locke's emphasis).

What is important to understand is what exactly Locke means when he advises parents to treat their children as reasoning beings. Locke first highlights that children "love to be treated as Rational Creatures," thus parents should treat them as such. Tarcov argues that this suggests children can be considered rational only in that they respond to the desire to be treated as reasoning creatures and that they are "motivated only [by] rewards and punishments" to achieve that goal.

Ultimately, Locke wants children to become adults as quickly as possible. As he argues in "Some Thoughts," "the only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it, into which a young gentleman should be entered by degrees as he can bear it, and the earlier the better." In the "<a href="Second%20Treatise%20on%20Government">Second Treatise on Government</a>" (1689), he contends that it is the parents' duty to educate their children and to act for them because children, though they have the ability to reason when young, do not do so consistently and are therefore usually irrational; it is the parents' obligation to teach their children to become rational adults so that they will not always be fettered by parental ties.

Locke does not dedicate much space in "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" to outlining a specific curriculum; he is more concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children "how" to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [the child] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself." But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending "<a href="Aesop%27s%20Fables">Aesop's Fables</a>". Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because it would be useful to them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the <a href="scientific%20revolution">scientific revolution</a> and advocated the teaching of <a href="geography">geography</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, and <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a>. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from <a href="scholasticism">scholastic</a> <a href="humanism">humanism</a> and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a> ethos that would come to define <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a> in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

When Locke began writing the letters that would eventually become "Some Thoughts on Education", he was addressing an aristocrat, but the final text appeals to a much wider audience. For example, Locke writes: "I place "Vertue" [sic] as the first and most necessary of those Endowments, that belong to a Man or a Gentleman." James Axtell, who edited the most comprehensive edition of Locke's educational writings, has explained that although "he was writing for this small class, this does not preclude the possibility that many of the things he said about education, especially its main principles, were equally applicable to "all" children" (Axtell's emphasis). This was a contemporary view as well; Pierre Coste, in his introduction in the first French edition in 1695, wrote, "it is certain that this Work was particularly designed for the education of Gentlemen: but this does not prevent its serving also for the education of all sorts of Children, of whatever class they are."

While it is possible to apply Locke's general principles of education to all children, and contemporaries such as Coste certainly did so, Locke himself, despite statements that may imply the contrary, believed that "Some Thoughts" applied only to the wealthy and the <a href="middle%20class">middle-class</a> (or as they would have been referred to at the time, the "middling sorts"). One of Locke's conclusions in "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" is that he "think[s] a Prince, a Nobleman, and an ordinary Gentleman's Son, should have different Ways of Breeding." As Peter Gay writes, "[i]t never occurred to him that every child should be educated or that all those to be educated should be educated alike. Locke believed that until the school system was reformed, a gentleman ought to have his son trained at home by a tutor. As for the poor, they do not appear in Locke's little book at all."

In his "Essay on the Poor Law," Locke turns to the education of the poor; he laments that "the children of labouring people are an ordinary burden to the parish, and are usually maintained in idleness, so that their labour also is generally lost to the public till they are 12 or 14 years old." He suggests, therefore, that "working schools" be set up in each parish in England for poor children so that they will be "from infancy [three years old] inured to work." He goes on to outline the economics of these schools, arguing not only that they will be profitable for the parish, but also that they will instill a good work ethic in the children.

Locke wrote "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" in response to his friend Samuel Clarke's query on how to educate his son, so the text's "principal aim", as Locke states at the beginning, "is how a young gentleman should be brought up from his infancy." This education "will not so perfectly suit the education of "daughters"; though where the difference of sex requires different treatment, it will be no hard matter to distinguish" (Locke's emphasis). This passage suggests that, for Locke, education was fundamentally the same for men and women—there were only small, obvious differences for women. This interpretation is supported by a letter he wrote to Mrs. Clarke in 1685 stating that "since therefore I acknowledge no difference of sex in your mind relating ... to truth, virtue and obedience, I think well to have no thing altered in it from what is [writ for the son]." Martin Simons states that Locke "suggested, both by implication and explicitly, that a boy's education should be along the lines already followed by some girls of the intelligent genteel classes." Rather than sending boys to schools which would ignore their individual needs and teach them little of value, Locke argues that they should be taught at home as girls already were and "should learn useful and necessary crafts of the house and estate." Like his contemporary <a href="Mary%20Astell">Mary Astell</a>, Locke believed that women could and should be taught to be rational and virtuous.

But Locke does recommend several minor "restrictions" relating to the treatment of the female body. The most significant is his reining in of female physical activity for the sake of physical appearance: "But since in your girls care is to be taken too of their beauty as much as health will permit, this in them must have some restriction ... 'tis fit their tender skins should be fenced against the busy sunbeams, especially when they are very hot and piercing." Although Locke's statement indicates that he places a greater value on female than male beauty, the fact that these opinions were never published allowed contemporary readers to draw their own conclusions regarding the "different treatments" required for girls and boys, if any. Moreover, compared to other pedagogical theories, such as those in the best-selling conduct book "The Whole Duty of a Woman" (1696), the female companion to "<a href="The%20Whole%20Duty%20of%20Man">The Whole Duty of Man</a>" (1657), and Rousseau's "" (1762), which both proposed entirely separate educational programs for women, Locke's "Some Thoughts" appears far more egalitarian.

Along with Rousseau's "" (1762), Locke's "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" was one of the foundational eighteenth-century texts on educational theory. In Britain, it was considered the standard treatment of the topic for over a century. For this reason, some critics have maintained that "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" vies with the "<a href="Essay%20Concerning%20Human%20Understanding">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a>" for the title of Locke's most influential work. Some of Locke's contemporaries, such as seventeenth-century German philosopher and mathematician <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a>, believed this as well; Leibniz argued that "Some Thoughts" superseded even the "Essay" in its impact on European society.

Locke's "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" was a runaway best-seller. During the eighteenth century alone, "Some Thoughts" was published in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, and one <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a>. It was also excerpted in novels such as <a href="Samuel%20Richardson">Samuel Richardson</a>'s "<a href="Pamela%2C%20or%20Virtue%20Rewarded">Pamela</a>" (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, <a href="John%20Newbery">John Newbery</a>. According to <a href="James%20A.%20Secord">James A. Secord</a>, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.

By the end of the eighteenth century, Locke's influence on educational thought was widely acknowledged. In 1772 James Whitchurch wrote in his "Essay Upon Education" that Locke was "an Author, to whom the Learned must ever acknowledge themselves highly indebted, and whose Name can never be mentioned without a secret Veneration, and Respect; his Assertions being the result of intense Thought, strict Enquiry, a clear and penetrating Judgment." Writers as politically dissimilar as <a href="Sarah%20Trimmer">Sarah Trimmer</a>, in her periodical "<a href="The%20Guardian%20of%20Education">The Guardian of Education</a>" (1802–06), and <a href="Maria%20Edgeworth">Maria Edgeworth</a>, in the educational treatise she penned with her father, "<a href="Practical%20Education">Practical Education</a>" (1798), invoked Locke's ideas. Even Rousseau, while disputing Locke's central claim that parents should treat their children as rational beings, acknowledged his debt to Locke.

John Cleverley and D. C. Phillips place Locke's "Some Thoughts Concerning Education" at the beginning of a tradition of educational theory which they label "environmentalism". In the years following the publication of Locke's work, <a href="Etienne%20Bonnot%20de%20Condillac">Etienne Bonnot de Condillac</a> and <a href="Claude%20Adrien%20Helv%C3%A9tius">Claude Adrien Helvétius</a> eagerly adopted the idea that people's minds were shaped through their experiences and thus through their education. Systems of teaching children through their senses proliferated throughout Europe. In Switzerland, <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Pestalozzi">Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi</a>, relying on Locke's theories, developed the concept of the "object lesson." These lessons focused pupils' attention on a particular thing and encouraged them to use all of their senses to explore it and urged them to use precise words to describe it. Used throughout Europe and America during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, these object lessons, according to one of their practitioners "if well-managed, cultivate Sense-Perception, or Observation, accustom children to express their thoughts in words, increase their available stock of words and of ideas, and by thus storing material for thinking, also prepare the way for more difficult and advanced study."

Such techniques were also integral to <a href="Montessori%20method">Maria Montessori's</a> methods in the twentieth century. According to Cleverley and Phillips, the television show <a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a> is also "based on Lockean assumptions—its aim has been to give underprivileged children, especially in the inner cities, the simple ideas and basic experiences that their environment normally does not provide." In many ways, despite Locke's continuing influence, as these authors point out, the twentieth century has been dominated by the "<a href="Nature%20versus%20nurture">nature vs. nurture</a>" debate in a way that Locke's century was not. Locke's optimistic "environmentalism," though qualified in his text, is now no longer just a moral issue – it is also a scientific issue.

Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches

Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches is a book composed by the American folklorist <a href="Charles%20Godfrey%20Leland">Charles Godfrey Leland</a> that was published in 1899. It contains what he believed was the religious text of a group of <a href="paganism">pagan</a> <a href="Witch-cult%20hypothesis">witches</a> in <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, Italy that documented their beliefs and rituals, although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group. In the 20th century, the book was very influential in the development of the <a href="Paganism%20%28contemporary%20religions%29">contemporary Pagan</a> religion of <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>.

The text is a composite. Some of it is Leland's translation into English of an original Italian <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>, the "Vangelo" (gospel). Leland reported receiving the manuscript from his primary informant on Italian witchcraft beliefs, a woman Leland referred to as "Maddalena" and whom he called his "witch informant" in Italy. The rest of the material comes from Leland's research on <a href="Culture%20of%20Italy%23Folklore">Italian folklore</a> and traditions, including other related material from Maddalena. Leland had been informed of the "Vangelo"s existence in 1886, but it took Maddalena eleven years to provide him with a copy. After translating and editing the material, it took another two years for the book to be published. Its fifteen chapters portray the origins, beliefs, rituals, and spells of an <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> <a href="paganism">pagan</a> witchcraft tradition. The central figure of that religion is the <a href="goddess">goddess</a> <a href="Aradia%20%28goddess%29">Aradia</a>, who came to Earth to teach the practice of witchcraft to peasants in order for them to oppose their <a href="feudalism">feudal</a> oppressors and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.

Leland's work remained obscure until the 1950s, when other theories about, and claims of, "pagan witchcraft" survivals began to be widely discussed. "Aradia" began to be examined within the wider context of such claims. Scholars are divided, with some dismissing Leland's assertion regarding the origins of the manuscript, and others arguing for its authenticity as a unique documentation of folk beliefs. Along with increased scholarly attention, "Aradia" came to play a special role in the history of <a href="Gardnerian%20Wicca">Gardnerian Wicca</a> and its offshoots, being used as evidence that pagan witchcraft survivals existed in Europe, and because a passage from the book's first chapter was used as a part of the religion's <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a>. After the increase in interest in the text, it became widely available through numerous reprints from a variety of publishers, including a 1999 critical edition with a new translation by Mario and Dina Pazzaglini.

<a href="Charles%20Godfrey%20Leland">Charles Godfrey Leland</a> was an American author and <a href="folkloristics">folklorist</a>, and spent much of the 1890s in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> researching Italian <a href="folklore">folklore</a>. "Aradia" was one of the products of Leland's research. While Leland's name is the one principally associated with "Aradia", the manuscript that makes up the bulk of it is attributed to the research of an Italian woman whom Leland and Leland's biographer, his niece <a href="Elizabeth%20Robins%20Pennell">Elizabeth Robins Pennell</a>, referred to as "Maddalena". According to folklorist <a href="Roma%20Lister">Roma Lister</a>, a contemporary and friend of Leland's, Maddalena's real name was Margherita, and she was a "<a href="witch">witch</a>" from Florence who claimed a family lineage from the <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscans</a> and knowledge of ancient rituals. Professor Robert Mathiesen, as a contributor to the Pazzaglini translation of Aradia, mentions a letter from Maddalena to Leland, which he states is signed "Maddalena Talenti" (the last name being a guess, as the handwriting is difficult to decipher).

Leland reports meeting Maddalena in 1886, and she became the primary source for his Italian folklore collecting for several years. Leland describes her as belonging to a vanishing tradition of <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">sorcery</a>. He writes that "by long practice [she] has perfectly learned ... just what I want, and how to extract it from those of her kind." He received several hundred pages worth of material from her, which was incorporated into his books "Etruscan Roman Remains in Popular Tradition", "Legends of Florence Collected From the People", and eventually "Aradia". Leland wrote that he had "learned that there was in existence a manuscript setting forth the doctrines of Italian witchcraft" in 1886, and had urged Maddalena to find it. Eleven years later, on 1 January 1897, Leland received the "Vangelo" by post. The manuscript was written in Maddalena's handwriting. Leland understood it to be an authentic document of the "Old Religion" of the witches, but explains that he did not know if the text came from written or oral sources.

Leland's translation and editing was completed in early 1897 and submitted to David Nutt for publication. Two years passed, until Leland wrote requesting the return of the manuscript in order to submit it to a different publishing house. This request spurred Nutt to accept the book, and it was published in July 1899 in a small print run. Wiccan author <a href="Raymond%20Buckland">Raymond Buckland</a> claims to have been the first to reprint the book in 1968 through his "Buckland Museum of Witchcraft" press, but a British reprint was made by "Wiccens" Charles "Rex Nemorensis" and Mary Cardell in the early 1960s. Since then the text has been repeatedly reprinted by a variety of different publishers, including as a 1998 retranslation by Mario and Dina Pazzaglini with essays and commentary.

After the eleven-year search, Leland writes that he was unsurprised by the contents of the "Vangelo". It was largely what he was expecting, with the exception that he did not predict passages in "prose-poetry". "I also believe that in this Gospel of the Witches", comments Leland in the appendix, "we have a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at [the <a href="sabbath%20%28witchcraft%29">witches' Sabbat</a>]. They adored forbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds, inspired as much by <a href="rebellion">rebellion</a> against Society as by their own passions."

Leland's final draft was a slim volume. He organised the material to be included into fifteen chapters, and added a brief preface and an appendix. The published version also included footnotes and, in many places, the original Italian that Leland had translated. Most of the content of Leland's "Aradia" is made up of <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">spells</a>, blessings, and rituals, but the text also contains stories and <a href="mythology">myths</a> which suggest influences from both the ancient <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman religion</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a>. Major characters in the myths include <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">the Roman goddess Diana</a>, a <a href="solar%20deity">sun god</a> called <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, the Biblical <a href="Cain">Cain</a> as a <a href="lunar%20deity">lunar figure</a>, and the <a href="messiah">messianic</a> <a href="Aradia%20%28goddess%29">Aradia</a>. The witchcraft of "The Gospel of the Witches" is both a method for casting spells and an anti-hierarchical "counter-religion" to the Catholic church.

Entire chapters of Aradia are devoted to rituals and magic spells. These include enchantments to win love (Chapter VI), a conjuration to perform when finding a stone with a hole or a round stone in order to turn it into an <a href="amulet">amulet</a> for Diana's favour (Chapter IV), and the consecration of a ritual feast for Diana, Aradia, and Cain (Chapter II). The narrative material makes up less of the text, and is composed of short stories and legends about the birth of the witchcraft religion and the actions of their gods. Leland summarises the mythic material in the book in its appendix, writing "Diana is Queen of the Witches; an associate of <a href="Herodias">Herodias</a> (Aradia) in her relations to sorcery; that she bore a child to <a href="solar%20deity">her brother the Sun</a> (here Lucifer); that as a <a href="lunar%20deity">moon-goddess</a> she is in some relation to Cain, who dwells as prisoner in the moon, and that the witches of old were people oppressed by <a href="feudalism">feudal</a> lands, the former revenging themselves in every way, and holding <a href="orgy">orgies</a> to Diana which the Church represented as being the worship of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>". Diana is not only the witches' goddess, but is presented as the <a href="creator%20deity">primordial creatrix</a> in Chapter III, dividing herself into darkness and light. After giving birth to Lucifer, Diana seduces him while in the form of a cat, eventually giving birth to Aradia, their daughter. Diana demonstrates the power of her witchcraft by creating "the heavens, the stars and the rain", becoming "Queen of the Witches". Chapter I presents the original witches as slaves that escaped from their masters, beginning new lives as "thieves and evil folk". Diana sends her daughter Aradia to them to teach these former serfs witchcraft, the power of which they can use to "destroy the evil race (of oppressors)". Aradia's students thus became the first witches, who would then continue the worship of Diana. Leland was struck by this <a href="cosmogony">cosmogony</a>: "In all other Scriptures of all races, it is the male ... who creates the universe; in Witch Sorcery it is the female who is the primitive principle".

"Aradia" is composed of fifteen chapters, the first ten of which are presented as being Leland's translation of the "Vangelo" <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a> given to him by Maddalena. This section, while predominantly made up of spells and rituals, is also the source of most of the myths and folktales contained in the text. At the end of Chapter I is the text in which Aradia gives instructions to her followers on how to practice witchcraft.

The first ten chapters are not entirely a direct translation of the "Vangelo"; Leland offers his own commentary and notes on a number of passages, and Chapter VII is Leland's incorporation of other Italian folklore material. <a href="Medievalism">Medievalist</a> Robert Mathiesen contends that the "Vangelo" manuscript actually represents even less of "Aradia", arguing that only Chapters I, II, and the first half of Chapter IV match Leland's description of the manuscript's contents, and suggests that the other material came from different texts collected by Leland through Maddalena.

The remaining five chapters are clearly identified in the text as representing other material Leland believed to be relevant to the "Vangelo", acquired during his research into Italian witchcraft, and especially while working on his "Etruscan Roman Remains" and "Legends of Florence". The themes in these additional chapters vary in some details from the first ten, and Leland included them partly to "[confirm] the fact that the worship of Diana existed for a long time contemporary with <a href="Early%20Christianity">Christianity</a>". Chapter XV, for example, gives an <a href="incantation">incantation</a> to <a href="Laverna">Laverna</a>, through the use of a deck of <a href="playing%20card">playing card</a>s. Leland explains its inclusion by a note that Diana, as portrayed in "Aradia", is worshipped by outlaws, and Laverna was the Roman goddess of thievery. Other examples of Leland's thoughts about the text are given in the book's preface, appendix, and numerous footnotes.

In several places Leland provides the Italian he was translating. According to Mario Pazzaglini, author of the 1999 translation, the Italian contains misspellings, missing words, and grammatical errors, and is in a standardised Italian rather than the <a href="Regional%20Italian">local dialect</a> one might expect. Pazzaglini concludes that "Aradia" represents material translated from dialect to basic Italian and then into English, creating a summary of texts, some of which were mis-recorded. Leland himself called the text a "collection of ceremonies, 'cantrips,' incantations, and traditions" and described it as an attempt to gather material, "valuable and curious remains of <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Latin</a> or Etruscan lore" that he feared would be lost. There is no cohesive narrative even in the sections that Leland attributes to the "Vangelo". This lack of cohesion, or "inconsistency", is an argument for the text's authenticity, according to religious scholar <a href="Chas%20S.%20Clifton">Chas S. Clifton</a>, since the text shows no signs of being "massaged ... for future book buyers."

Leland wrote that "the witches even yet form a fragmentary secret society or sect, that they call it that of the Old Religion, and that there are in the <a href="Romagna">Romagna</a> entire villages in which the people are completely heathen". Accepting this, Leland supposed that "the existence of a religion supposes a Scripture, and in this case it may be admitted, almost without severe verification, that the Evangel of the Witches is really a very old work ... in all probability the translation of some early or later <a href="Latin">Latin</a> work."

Leland's claim that the manuscript was genuine, and even his assertion that he received such a manuscript, have been called into question. After the 1921 publication of <a href="Margaret%20Murray">Margaret Murray</a>'s "The Witch-cult in Western Europe", which hypothesised that the European <a href="witch-hunt">witch trials</a> were actually a persecution of a pagan religious survival, American sensationalist author Theda Kenyon's 1929 book "Witches Still Live" connected Murray's thesis with the witchcraft religion in "Aradia". Arguments against Murray's thesis would eventually include arguments against Leland. Witchcraft scholar <a href="Jeffrey%20Burton%20Russell">Jeffrey Russell</a> devoted some of his 1980 book "A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans" to arguing against the claims in "Aradia", Murray's thesis, and <a href="Jules%20Michelet">Jules Michelet</a>'s 1862 "La Sorcière", which also theorised that witchcraft represented an underground religion. Historian Elliot Rose's "A Razor for a Goat" dismissed "Aradia" as a collection of incantations unsuccessfully attempting to portray a religion. In his "Triumph of the Moon", historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> summarises the controversy as having three possible extremes:


Hutton himself is a sceptic, not only of the existence of the religion that "Aradia" claims to represent, but also of the existence of Maddalena, arguing that it is more likely that Leland created the entire story than that Leland could be so easily "duped" by an Italian fortune-teller. Clifton takes exception to Hutton's position, writing that it amounts to an accusation of "serious literary fraud" made by an "<a href="argument%20from%20ignorance">argument from absence</a>"; one of Hutton's main objections is that "Aradia" is unlike anything found in <a href="medieval%20literature">medieval literature</a>.

Mathiesen also dismisses this "option three", arguing that while Leland's English drafts for the book were heavily edited and revised in the process of writing, the Italian sections, in contrast, were almost untouched except for corrections of "precisely the sort that a proofreader would make as he compared his copy to the original". This leads Mathiesen to conclude that Leland was working from an extant Italian-language original that he describes as "authentic, but not representative" of any larger folk tradition. <a href="Anthropology">Anthropologist</a> <a href="Sabina%20Magliocco">Sabina Magliocco</a> examines the "option one" possibility, that Leland's manuscript represented a folk tradition involving Diana and the <a href="Cult%20of%20Herodias">Cult of Herodias</a>, in her article "Who Was Aradia? The History and Development of a Legend". Magliocco writes that "Aradia" "may represent a 19th-century version of [the legend of the Cult of Herodias] that incorporated later materials influenced by medieval <a href="Satanism">diabolism</a>: the presence of 'Lucifero,' the Christian devil; the practice of sorcery; the naked dances under the full moon."

Magliocco calls "Aradia" "the first real text of the 20th century Witchcraft revival", and it is repeatedly cited as being profoundly influential on the development of <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>. The text apparently corroborates the thesis of Margaret Murray that <a href="Early%20modern%20Europe">early modern</a> and <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> witchcraft represented a survival of ancient pagan beliefs, and after <a href="Gerald%20Gardner%20%28Wiccan%29">Gerald Gardner</a>'s claim to have encountered religious witchcraft in 20th-century England, the works of Michelet, Murray, and Leland helped support at least the possibility that such a survival could exist.

The <a href="Charge%20of%20the%20Goddess">Charge of the Goddess</a>, an important piece of liturgy used in Wiccan rituals, was inspired by Aradia's speech in the first chapter of the book. Parts of the speech appeared in an early version of Gardnerian Wicca ritual. According to <a href="Doreen%20Valiente">Doreen Valiente</a>, one of Gardner's priestesses, Gardner was surprised by Valiente's recognising the material as having come from Leland's book. Valiente subsequently rewrote the passage in both prose and verse, retaining the "traditional" "Aradia" lines. Some <a href="Wicca%23Wiccan%20traditions">Wiccan traditions</a> use the name "Aradia", or "Diana", to refer to the Goddess or Queen of the Witches, and Hutton writes that the earliest Gardnerian rituals used the name "Airdia", a "garbled" form of "Aradia". Hutton further suggests that the reason that Wicca includes <a href="Skyclad%20%28neopaganism%29">skyclad</a> practice, or ritual nudity, is because of a line spoken by Aradia:

Accepting "Aradia" as the source of this practice, Robert Chartowich points to the 1998 Pazzaglini translation of these lines, which read "Men and Women / You will all be naked, until / Yet he shall be dead, the last / Of your oppressors is dead." Chartowich argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland's mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause "in your rites". There are, however, earlier mentions of ritual nudity among Italian witches. Historian Ruth Martin states that it was a common practice for witches of Italy to be "naked with their hair loose around their shoulders" while reciting conjurations. <a href="Jeffrey%20Burton%20Russell">Jeffrey Burton Russell</a> notes that "A woman named Marta was tortured in Florence about 1375: she was alleged to have placed candles round a dish and to have taken off her clothes and stood above the dish in the nude, making magical signs". Historian Franco Mormando refers to an Italian witch: "Lo and behold: in the first hours of sleep, this woman opens the door to her vegetable garden and comes out completely naked and her hair all undone, and she begins to do and say her various signs and conjurations ...".

The reception of "Aradia" amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of <a href="Leo%20Martello">Leo Martello</a> and <a href="Raven%20Grimassi">Raven Grimassi</a>, must be "match[ed] against", and compared with the claims in "Aradia". He further suggests that a lack of comfort with "Aradia" may be due to an "insecurity" within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival. Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> as the God of the witches in "Aradia" was "too strong meat" for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and <a href="Satanism">Satanism</a>.

Clifton writes that "Aradia" was especially influential for leaders of the Wiccan religious movement in the 1950s and 1960s, but that the book no longer appears on the "reading lists" given by members to newcomers, nor is it extensively cited in more recent Neopagan books. The new translation of the book released in 1998 was introduced by Wiccan author <a href="Stewart%20Farrar">Stewart Farrar</a>, who affirms the importance of "Aradia", writing that "Leland's gifted research into a 'dying' tradition has made a significant contribution to a living and growing one."

Author <a href="Raven%20Grimassi">Raven Grimassi</a> has written extensively about Aradia in his popularization of <a href="Stregheria">Stregheria</a>, presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering of her story. He differs from Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than a goddess.
In response to Clifton, he states that similarity or dissimilarity to Leland's Aradia material cannot be a measure of authenticity, since Leland's material itself is disputed.

Therefore it cannot effectively be used to discredit other writings or views on Italian witchcraft, nor is it a representative ethnographic foundation against which other writings or views "must" be compared. The Aradia material is, unfortunately, a disputed text with problems of its own when compared to the usually accepted folklore, folk traditions, and folk magic practices of Italy.

He agrees with Valiente that the major objection of Neopagans to this material is its "inclusion of negative stereotypes related to witches and witchcraft", and suggests that comparisons between this material and religious witchcraft are "regarded as an insult by many neo-pagans".

The Norwegian classical <a href="composer">composer</a> <a href="Martin%20Romberg">Martin Romberg</a> wrote a <a href="Mass%20%28music%29">Mass</a> for <a href="mixed%20choir">mixed choir</a> in seven parts after a selection of poems from Leland's text. This "Witch Mass" was premiered at the Vestfold International Festival in 2012 with <a href="Grex%20Vocalis">Grex Vocalis</a>. In order to create the right atmosphere for the music, the festival blocked off an entire road tunnel in <a href="T%C3%B8nsberg">Tønsberg</a> to use it as a venue. The work was released on CD through Lawo Classics in 2014.

Albert Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield

Albert Henry Stanley, 1st Baron Ashfield, (8 August 1874 – 4 November 1948), born Albert Henry Knattriess, was a British-American businessman who was managing director, then chairman of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a> (UERL) from 1910 to 1933 and chairman of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB) from 1933 to 1947.

Although born in Britain, his early career was in the United States, where at a young age, he held senior positions in the developing <a href="Tram">tramway systems</a> of Detroit and New Jersey. In 1898, he served in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during the short <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>.

In 1907, his management skills led to his recruitment by the UERL, which was struggling through a financial crisis that threatened its existence. He quickly integrated the company's management and used advertising and <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> to improve profits. As managing director of the UERL from 1910, he led the take-over of competing underground railway companies and bus and tram operations to form an integrated transport operation known as the Combine.

He was Member of Parliament for <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Ashton-under-Lyne</a> from December 1916 to January 1920 and was <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a> between December 1916 and May 1919, reorganising the board and establishing specialist departments for various industries. He returned to the UERL and then chaired it and its successor the LPTB during the organisation's greatest period of expansion between the two World Wars, making it a world-respected organisation considered an exemplar of the best form of public administration.

Stanley was born on 8 August 1874, in <a href="Normanton%2C%20Derbyshire">New Normanton</a>, <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>, England, the son of Henry and Elizabeth Knattriess (née Twigg). His father worked as a <a href="coachbuilder">coachbuilder</a> for the <a href="Pullman%20Company">Pullman Company</a>. In 1880, the family emigrated to <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> in the United States, where he worked at Pullman's main factory. During the 1890s, the family changed its name to "Stanley".

In 1888, at the age of 14, Stanley left school and went to work as an office boy at the <a href="Detroit%20United%20Railway">Detroit Street Railways Company</a>, which ran a <a href="Horsecar">horse-drawn tram</a> system. He continued to study at evening school and worked long hours, often from 7.30 am to 10.00 pm. His abilities were recognised early and Stanley was given responsibility for scheduling the services and preparing the timetables when he was 17. Following the expansion and <a href="electrification">electrification</a> of the tramway, he became General Superintendent of the company in 1894.

Stanley was a naval <a href="reservist">reservist</a> and, during the brief <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> of 1898, he served in the United States Navy as a <a href="Landman%20%28rank%29">landsman</a> in the crew of alongside many others from Detroit. In 1903, Stanley moved to New Jersey to become assistant general manager of the street railway department of the <a href="Public%20Service%20Railway">Public Service Corporation of New Jersey</a>. The company had been struggling, but Stanley quickly improved its organisation and was promoted to general manager of the department in January 1904. In January 1907, he became general manager of the whole corporation, running a network of almost 1,000 route miles and 25,000 employees.

In 1904, Stanley married Grace Lowrey (1878–1962) of New York. The couple had two daughters: Marian Stanley (born 1906) and Grace Stanley (born 1907).

On 20 February 1907, Sir <a href="George%20Gibb">George Gibb</a>, managing director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Electric Railways Company of London</a> (UERL), appointed Stanley as its general manager. The UERL was the <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a> of four underground railways in central London. Three of these (the <a href="District%20Railway">District Railway</a>, the <a href="Baker%20Street%20and%20Waterloo%20Railway">Baker Street and Waterloo Railway</a> and the <a href="Great%20Northern%2C%20Piccadilly%20and%20Brompton%20Railway">Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway</a>) were already in operation and the fourth (the <a href="Charing%20Cross%2C%20Euston%20and%20Hampstead%20Railway">Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway</a>) was about to open. The UERL had been established by American financier <a href="Charles%20Yerkes">Charles Yerkes</a> and much of the finance and equipment had been brought from the United States, so Stanley's experience of managing urban transit systems in that country made him an ideal candidate for the position. The cost of constructing three new lines in just a few years had put the company in a precarious monetary position and income was not sufficient to pay the interest on its loans. Stanley's responsibility was to restore its finances.

Only recently promoted to general manager of the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America at the end of the year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, <a href="Edgar%20Speyer">Sir Edgar Speyer</a>, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the <a href="managing%20director">managing director</a>.

With Commercial Manager <a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Stanley devised a plan to increase passenger numbers: developing the "UNDERGROUND" brand and establishing a joint booking system and co-ordinated fares throughout all of London's underground railways, including those not controlled by the UERL. In July 1910, Stanley took the integration of the group further, when he persuaded previously reluctant American investors to approve the merger of the three tube railways into a single company. Further consolidation came with the UERL's take-over of <a href="London%20General%20Omnibus%20Company">London General Omnibus Company</a> (LGOC) in 1912 and the <a href="Central%20London%20Railway">Central London Railway</a> and the <a href="City%20and%20South%20London%20Railway">City and South London Railway</a> on 1 January 1913. Of London's underground railways, only the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (and its subsidiaries the <a href="Great%20Northern%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Great Northern & City Railway</a> and the <a href="East%20London%20Railway">East London Railway</a>) and the <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a> remained outside of the Underground Group's control. The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (it paid dividends of 18 per cent compared with Underground Group companies' dividends of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the rest of the group. Stanley further expanded the group through shareholdings in <a href="London%20United%20Tramways">London United Tramways</a> and <a href="Metropolitan%20Electric%20Tramways">Metropolitan Electric Tramways</a> and the foundation of bus builder <a href="Associated%20Equipment%20Company">AEC</a>. The much enlarged group became known as the Combine. On 29 July 1914, Stanley was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in recognition of his services to transport.

Stanley also planned extensions of the existing Underground Group's lines into new, undeveloped districts beyond the central area to encourage the development of new suburbs and new commuter traffic. The first of the extensions, the <a href="Bakerloo%20line">Bakerloo line</a> to <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20%28London%29%20station">Queen's Park</a> and <a href="Watford%20Junction%20railway%20station">Watford Junction</a>, opened between 1915 and 1917. The other expansion plans were postponed during World War I.
In 1915, Stanley was given a wartime role as Director-General of Mechanical Transport at the <a href="Minister%20of%20Munitions">Ministry of Munitions</a>. In 1916, he was selected by Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> to become <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Trade%20and%20Industry">President of the Board of Trade</a>. Lloyd George had previously promised this role to <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%20Lord%20Beaverbrook">Sir Max Aitken</a> (later Lord Beaverbrook), Member of Parliament for <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Ashton-under-Lyne</a>. At that time, a member of parliament taking a cabinet post for the first time had to resign and stand for re-election in a by-election. Aitken had made arrangements to do this before Lloyd George decided to appoint Stanley to the position instead. Aitken, a friend of Stanley, was persuaded to continue with the resignation in exchange for a peerage so that Stanley could take his seat. Stanley became President of the Board of Trade and was made a <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">Privy Counsellor</a> on 13 December 1916. He was <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20by-election%2C%201916">elected to parliament</a> unopposed on 23 December 1916 as a <a href="Conservative%20Unionist">Conservative Unionist</a>. At 42 years old he was the youngest member of Lloyd George's <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a>.

At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">1918 general election</a>, Stanley was opposed by <a href="Frederick%20Lister">Frederick Lister</a>, the President of the <a href="National%20Federation%20of%20Discharged%20and%20Demobilized%20Sailors%20and%20Soldiers">National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers</a>, in a challenge over the government's policy on war pensions. With the backing of Beaverbrook, who visited his former constituency to speak on his behalf, Stanley won the election.

Stanley's achievements in office were mixed. He established various specialist departments to manage output in numerous industries and reorganised the structure of the Board. However, despite previous successes with unions, his negotiations were ineffective. Writing to <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons">Leader of the House of Commons</a> and future Prime Minister <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a> in January 1919, Lloyd George described Stanley as having "all the glibness of <a href="Walter%20Runciman%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Runciman%20of%20Doxford">Runciman</a> and that is apt to take in innocent persons like you and me ... Stanley, to put it quite bluntly, is a funk, and there is no room for funks in the modern world." Stanley left the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> and the government in May 1919 and returned to the UERL.

Back at the Underground Group, Stanley returned to his role as managing director and also became its chairman, replacing <a href="Lord%20George%20Hamilton">Lord George Hamilton</a>. In the 1920 New Year Honours, he was created Baron Ashfield, of Southwell in the County of Nottingham, ending his term as an MP. He and Pick reactivated their expansion plans, and one of the most significant periods in the organisation's history began, subsequently considered to be its heyday and sometimes called its "Golden Age".

The Central London Railway was extended to <a href="Ealing%20Broadway%20station">Ealing Broadway</a> in 1920, and the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway was extended to <a href="Hendon%20Central%20tube%20station">Hendon</a> in 1923 and to <a href="Edgware%20tube%20station">Edgware</a> in 1924. The City and South London Railway was reconstructed with larger diameter tunnels to take modern trains between 1922 and 1924 and extended to <a href="Morden%20tube%20station">Morden</a> in 1926. In addition, a programme of modernising many of the Underground's busiest central London stations was started; providing them with escalators to replace <a href="elevator">lifts</a>. New rolling stock was gradually introduced with automatic sliding doors along the length of the carriage instead of manual end gates. By the middle of the 1920s, the organisation had expanded to such an extent that a large, new headquarters building was constructed at <a href="55%20Broadway">55 Broadway</a> over <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Park%20tube%20station">St. James's Park station</a>.

Starting in the early 1920s, competition from numerous small bus companies, nicknamed "pirates" because they operated irregular routes and plundered the LGOC's passengers, eroded the profitability of the Combine's bus operations and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole group. Ashfield <a href="lobbying">lobbied</a> the government for regulation of transport services in the London area. Starting in 1923, a series of legislative initiatives were made in this direction, with Ashfield and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>lor (later <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">MP</a> and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Transport%23Minister%20of%20Transport">Minister of Transport</a>) <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, at the forefront of debates as to the level of regulation and public control under which transport services should be brought. Ashfield aimed for regulation that would give the UERL group protection from competition and allow it to take substantive control of the <a href="London%20County%20Council">LCC's</a> tram system; Morrison preferred full <a href="public%20ownership">public ownership</a>. Ashfield's proposal was fraught with controversy, "The Spectator" noting, "Everybody agrees that Lord Ashfield knows more about transport than anyone else, but people are naturally loth to give, not to him, but to his shareholders, the monopoly of conveying them." After seven years of false starts, a bill was announced at the end of 1930 for the formation of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB), a <a href="Government-owned%20corporation">public corporation</a> that would take control of the UERL, the Metropolitan Railway and all bus and tram operators within an area designated as the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board%23London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Area">London Passenger Transport Area</a>. As Ashfield had done with shareholders in 1910 over the consolidation of the three UERL controlled tube lines, he used his persuasiveness to obtain their agreements to the government buy-out of their stock.

The Board was a compromise – public ownership but not full <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> – and came into existence on 1 July 1933. Ashfield served as the organisation's chairman from its establishment in 1933 on an annual salary of £12,500 (approximately £600,000 today), with Pick as Chief Executive.

The opening of extensions of the <a href="Piccadilly%20line">Piccadilly line</a> to <a href="Uxbridge%20tube%20station">Uxbridge</a>, <a href="Hounslow%20West%20tube%20station">Hounslow</a> and <a href="Cockfosters%20tube%20station">Cockfosters</a> followed in 1933. On the Metropolitan Railway, Ashfield and Pick instigated a rationalisation of services. The barely used and loss-making <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill</a> and <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction</a> branches beyond <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a> were closed in 1935 and 1936. Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned. In 1935, the availability of <a href="government-backed%20loan">government-backed loan</a>s to stimulate the flagging economy allowed Ashfield and Pick to promote system-wide improvements under the <a href="New%20Works%20Programme">New Works Programme for 1935–1940</a>, including the transfer of the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a>'s <a href="Stanmore%20tube%20station">Stanmore</a> services to the <a href="Bakerloo%20line">Bakerloo line</a> in 1939, the <a href="Northern%20line">Northern line</a>'s <a href="Northern%20line%23Northern%20Heights">Northern Heights</a> project and extension of the <a href="Central%20line%20%28London%20Underground%29">Central line</a> to <a href="Ongar%20tube%20station">Ongar</a> and <a href="Denham%20railway%20station">Denham</a>.

Following a reorganisation of public transportation by the Labour government of <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, the LPTB was scheduled to be nationalised along with the majority of British railway, bus, road haulage and waterway concerns from 1 January 1948. In advance of this, Ashfield resigned from the LPTB at the end of October 1947 and joined the board of the new <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a> which was to operate all of the nationalised public transport systems. At nationalisation, the LPTB was to be abolished and replaced by the <a href="London%20Transport%20Executive">London Transport Executive</a>. <a href="Charles%20Latham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Latham">Lord Latham</a>, a member of the LPTB and the incoming chairman of the new organisation, acted as temporary chairman for the last two months of the LPTB's existence.

In addition to his management of <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> and brief political career, Ashfield held many directorships in transport undertakings and industry. He helped establish the <a href="Chartered%20Institute%20of%20Logistics%20and%20Transport">Institute of Transport</a> in 1919/20 and was one of its first presidents. He was a director of the Mexican Railway Company and two railway companies in Cuba and a member of the 1931 Royal Commission on Railways and Transportation in Canada. He was one of two government directors of the <a href="British%20Dyestuffs%20Corporation">British Dyestuffs Corporation</a>, its chairman from 1924 and was involved in the creation of <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> in 1926, of which he was subsequently a non-executive director. Ashfield was a director of the <a href="Midland%20Bank">Midland Bank</a>, Amalgamated Anthracite Collieries and chairman of <a href="Albany%20Ward">Albany Ward</a> Theatres, Associated Provincial Picture Houses, and Provincial Cinematograph Theatres.

During World War I, he was <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> of the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> <a href="Engineer%20and%20Railway%20Staff%20Corps">Engineer and Railway Staff Corps</a> and was <a href="Honorary%20Colonel">Honorary Colonel</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>'s 84th Light Anti Aircraft Regiment during World War II.

Biographers of Stanley characterise him as having an "immensely active mind, and a strong sense of public duty" and a "great charm of manner and a sense of humour which concealed an almost ruthless determination" that made him a "formidable negotiator". His "intuitive understanding of his fellow men" gave him "presence, which allowed him to dominate meetings effortlessly" and "inspired loyalty, devotion even, among his staff". He was "a dapper ladies' man, something of a playboy tycoon, who was always smartly turned out and enjoyed moving in high society".

Ashfield died on 4 November 1948 at 31 <a href="Queen%27s%20Gate">Queen's Gate</a>, <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>. During his near forty-year tenure as managing director and chairman of the Underground Group and the LPTB, Ashfield oversaw the transformation of a collection of unconnected, competing railway, bus and tram companies, some in severe financial difficulties, into a coherent and well managed transport organisation, internationally respected for its technical expertise and design style. Transport historian <a href="Christian%20Wolmar">Christian Wolmar</a> considers it "almost impossible to exaggerate the high regard in which LT was held during its all too brief heyday, attracting official visitors from around the world eager to learn the lessons of its success and apply them in their own countries." "It represented the apogee of a type of confident public administration ... with a reputation that any state organisation today would envy ... only made possible by the brilliance of its two famous leaders, Ashfield and Pick."

A memorial to Ashfield was erected at 55 Broadway in 1950 and a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> was placed at his home, 43 South Street, <a href="Mayfair">Mayfair</a> in 1984. A large office building at London Underground's <a href="Lillie%20Bridge%20%28Fulham%29">Lillie Bridge Depot</a> is named Ashfield House in his honour. It stands to the south of the <a href="District%20line">District line</a> tracks a short distance to the east of <a href="West%20Kensington%20tube%20station">West Kensington station</a> and is also visible from <a href="West%20Cromwell%20Road">West Cromwell Road</a> (<a href="A4%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A4</a>).

A Vindication of the Rights of Men

A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) is a political <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>, written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, which attacks <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a> and advocates <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a <a href="Revolution%20Controversy">pamphlet war</a> sparked by the publication of <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke's</a> "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790), a defense of <a href="Constitutional%20monarchy%23Constitutional%20monarchy%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">constitutional monarchy</a>, aristocracy, and the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>.

Wollstonecraft attacked not only hereditary privilege, but also the rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the "<a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a>" and the "beautiful", terms first established by Burke himself in "<a href="A%20Philosophical%20Enquiry%20into%20the%20Origin%20of%20Our%20Ideas%20of%20the%20Sublime%20and%20Beautiful">A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful</a>" (1756), she kept his rhetoric as well as his argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar <a href="Claudia%20L.%20Johnson%20%28scholar%29">Claudia Johnson</a> describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.

In her arguments for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos in opposition to what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n picture of society, drawn with what she claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical "tableaux".

The "Rights of Men" was successful: it was reviewed by every major periodical of the day and the first edition, published anonymously, sold out in three weeks. However, upon the publication of the second edition (the first to carry Wollstonecraft's name on the title page), the reviews began to evaluate the text not only as a political pamphlet but also as the work of a female writer. They contrasted Wollstonecraft's "passion" with Burke's "reason" and spoke condescendingly of the text and its female author. This remained the prevailing analysis of the "Rights of Men" until the 1970s, when <a href="feminist%20literary%20criticism">feminist scholars</a> revisited Wollstonecraft's texts and endeavoured to bring greater attention to their intellectualism.

"A Vindication of the Rights of Men" was written against the backdrop of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the debates that it provoked in Britain. In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war, now referred to as the "<a href="Revolution%20Controversy">Revolution Controversy</a>", which lasted from 1789 until the end of 1795, British political commentators argued over the validity of monarchy. One scholar has called this debate "perhaps the last real discussion of the fundamentals of politics in [Britain]". The power of popular agitation in revolutionary France, demonstrated in events such as the <a href="Tennis%20Court%20Oath">Tennis Court Oath</a> and the <a href="storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">storming of the Bastille</a> in 1789, reinvigorated the <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29%23United%20Kingdom">British reform movement</a>, which had been largely moribund for a decade. Efforts to reform the British electoral system and to distribute the seats in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> more equitably were revived.

Much of the vigorous political debate in the 1790s was sparked by the publication of <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke's</a> "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" in November 1790. Most commentators in Britain expected Burke to support the French revolutionaries, because he had previously been part of the liberal <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> party, a critic of monarchical power, a supporter of the <a href="American%20revolution">American revolution</a>aries, and a prosecutor of government malfeasance in India. When he failed to do so, it shocked the populace and angered his friends and supporters. Burke's book, despite being priced at an expensive three <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s, sold an astonishing 30,000 copies in two years. <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine's</a> famous response, "<a href="The%20Rights%20of%20Man">The Rights of Man</a>" (1792), which became the rallying cry for thousands, however, greatly surpassed it, selling upwards of 200,000 copies.

Wollstonecraft's "Rights of Men" was published only weeks after Burke's "Reflections". While Burke supported aristocracy, monarchy, and the Established Church, liberals such as <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, Paine, and Wollstonecraft, argued for <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>, agrarian socialism, <a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>, and religious toleration. Most of those who came to be called radicals supported similar aims: individual liberties and <a href="civic%20virtue">civic virtue</a>. They were also united in the same broad criticisms: opposition to the bellicose "landed interest" and its role in government corruption, and opposition to a monarchy and aristocracy who they believed were unlawfully seizing the people's power.

1792 was the ""annus mirabilis" of eighteenth-century radicalism": its most important texts were published and the influence of radical associations, such as the <a href="London%20Corresponding%20Society">London Corresponding Society</a> (LCS) and the <a href="Society%20for%20Constitutional%20Information">Society for Constitutional Information</a> (SCI), was at its height. However, it was not until these middle- and working-class groups formed an alliance with the genteel <a href="Friends%20of%20the%20People%20Society">Society of the Friends of the People</a> that the government became concerned. After this alliance was formed, the conservative-dominated government prohibited <a href="seditious">seditious</a> writings. Over 100 prosecutions for sedition took place in the 1790s alone, a dramatic increase from previous decades. The British government, fearing an uprising similar to the French Revolution, took even more drastic steps to quash the radicals: they made ever more political arrests and infiltrated radical groups; they threatened to "revoke the licences of publicans who continued to host politicised debating societies and to carry reformist literature"; they seized the mail of "suspected dissidents"; they supported groups that disrupted radical events; and they attacked dissidents in the press. Radicals saw this period, which included the <a href="1794%20Treason%20Trials">1794 Treason Trials</a>, as "the institution of a system of TERROR, almost as hideous in its features, almost as gigantic in its stature, and infinitely more pernicious in its tendency, than France ever knew."

When, in October 1795, crowds threw refuse at <a href="George%20III">George III</a> and insulted him, demanding a cessation of the <a href="French%20revolutionary%20wars">war with France</a> and lower bread prices, Parliament immediately passed the "gagging acts" (the <a href="Seditious%20Meetings%20Act%201795">Seditious Meetings Act</a> and the <a href="Treasonable%20Practices%20Act">Treasonable Practices Act</a>, also known as the "Two Acts"). Under these new laws, it was almost impossible to hold public meetings and speech was severely curtailed at those that were held. British radicalism was effectively muted during the later 1790s and 1800s. It was not until the next generation that any <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">real reform</a> could be enacted.

Published partially in response to <a href="English%20dissenters">Dissenting</a> clergyman <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price's</a> sermon celebrating the French revolution, "<a href="A%20Discourse%20on%20the%20Love%20of%20Our%20Country">A Discourse on the Love of Our Country</a>", Burke used the device of a mock-letter to a young Frenchman's plea for guidance in order to defend aristocratic government, paternalism, loyalty, chivalry, and <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>. He viewed the French Revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government. In "Reflections", he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government, because civilizations, including governments, are the result of social and political consensus. If a culture's traditions were continually challenged, he contends, the result would be anarchy.

Burke criticizes many British thinkers and writers who welcomed the early stages of the French Revolution. While the radicals likened the revolution to Britain's own <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> in 1688, which had restricted the powers of the monarchy, Burke argues that the appropriate historical analogy was the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> (1642–1651), in which <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> had been executed in 1649. At the time Burke was writing, however, there had been very little revolutionary violence; more concerned with persuading his readers than informing them, he greatly exaggerated this element of the revolution in his text for rhetorical effect. In his "<a href="A%20Philosophical%20Enquiry%20into%20the%20Origin%20of%20Our%20Ideas%20of%20the%20Sublime%20and%20Beautiful">Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful</a>", he had argued that "large inexact notions convey ideas best", and to generate fear in the reader, in "Reflections" he constructs the set-piece of <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a> and <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> forced from their palace at sword point. When the violence actually escalated in France in 1793 with the <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a>, Burke was viewed as a prophet.

Burke also criticizes the learning associated with the French "<a href="philosophes">philosophes</a>"; he maintains that new ideas should not, in an imitation of the emerging discipline of science, be tested on society in an effort to improve it, but that populations should rely on custom and tradition to guide them.

In the advertisement printed at the beginning of the "Rights of Men", Wollstonecraft describes how and why she wrote it:

So the pamphlet could be published as soon as she finished writing it, Wollstonecraft wrote frantically while her publisher <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a> printed the pages. In fact, Godwin's "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs</a>" of Wollstonecraft tells that the sheets of manuscript were delivered to the press as they were written. Halfway through the work, however, she ceased writing. One biographer describes it as a "loss of nerve"; Godwin, in his "Memoirs", describes it as "a temporary fit of torpor and indolence". Johnson, perhaps canny enough at this point in their friendship to know how to encourage her, agreed to dispose of the book and told her not to worry about it. Ashamed, she rushed to finish.

Wollstonecraft's "Rights of Men" was published anonymously on 29 November 1790, the first of between fifty and seventy responses to Burke by various authors. Only three weeks later, on 18 December, a second edition, with her name printed on the title page, was issued. Wollstonecraft took time to edit the second edition, which, according to biographer Emily Sunstein, "sharpened her personal attack on Burke" and changed much of the text from <a href="First-person%20narrative">first person</a> to <a href="third-person%20narrative">third person</a>; "she also added a non-partisan code criticising hypocritical liberals who talk equality but scrape before the powers that be."
Until the 1970s, the "Rights of Men" was typically considered disorganized, incoherent, illogical, and replete with "<a href="ad%20hominem">ad hominem</a>" attacks (such as the suggestion that Burke would have promoted the crucifixion of Christ if he were a Jew). It had been touted as an example of "feminine" emotion tilting at "masculine" reason. However, since the 1970s scholars have challenged this view, arguing that Wollstonecraft employed 18th-century modes of writing, such as the digression, to great rhetorical effect. More importantly, as scholar Mitzi Myers argues, "Wollstonecraft is virtually alone among those who answered Burke in eschewing a narrowly political approach for a wide-ranging critique of the foundation of the "Reflections"." Wollstonecraft makes a primarily moral argument; her "polemic is not a confutation of Burke's political theories, but an exposure of the cruel inequities which those theories presuppose." Wollstonecraft's style was also a deliberate choice, enabling her to respond to Burke's "Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful" as well as to "Reflections".

The style of the "Rights of Men" mirrors much of Burke's own text. It has no clear structure; like "Reflections", the text follows the mental associations made by the author as she was writing. Wollstonecraft's political treatise is written, like Burke's, in the form of a letter: his to C. J. F. DePont, a young Frenchman, and hers to Burke himself. Using the same form, metaphors, and style as Burke, she turns his own argument back on him. The "Rights of Men" is as much about language and argumentation as it is about political theory; in fact, Wollstonecraft claims that these are inseparable. She advocates, as one scholar writes, "simplicity and honesty of expression, and argument employing reason rather than eloquence." At the beginning of the pamphlet, she appeals to Burke: "Quitting now the flowers of rhetoric, let us, Sir, reason together."

The "Rights of Men" does not aim to present a fully articulated alternative political theory to Burke's, but instead to demonstrate the weaknesses and contradictions in his own argument. Therefore, much of the text is focused on Burke's logical inconsistencies, such as his support of the American revolution and the <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Regency%20crisis%20of%201788">Regency Bill</a> (which proposed restricting monarchical power during George III's madness in 1788), in contrast to his lack of support for the French revolutionaries. In criticism of Burke's contradictory support of the Regency Bill along with supporting the rule of monarchy in France, she writes:

Wollstonecraft's goal, she writes, is "to shew you [Burke] to yourself, stripped of the gorgeous drapery in which you have enwrapped your tyrannic principles." However, she does also gesture towards a larger argument of her own, focusing on the inequalities faced by British citizens because of the class system. As Wollstonecraft scholar Barbara Taylor writes, "treating Burke as a representative spokesman for old-regime despotism, Wollstonecraft champions the reformist initiatives of the new French government against his 'rusty, baneful opinions', and censures British political elites for their opulence, corruption, and inhumane treatment of the poor."

Wollstonecraft's attack on rank and hierarchy dominates the "Rights of Men". She chastises Burke for his contempt for the people, whom he dismisses as the "swinish multitude", and berates him for supporting the elite, most notably <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>. In a famous passage, Burke had written: "I had thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult.—But the age of chivalry is gone." Wollstonecraft's "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792) and "An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution" (1794) extend the specific arguments made in the "Rights of Men" into larger social and political contexts.

Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft contends that people should be judged on their merits rather than on their birthrights. As Wollstonecraft scholar <a href="Janet%20Todd">Janet Todd</a> writes, "the vision of society revealed [in] "A Vindication of the Rights of Men" was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged." Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the "vices of the rich", such as "insincerity" and the "want of natural affections". She endorses a <a href="commercialism">commercial</a> society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities. For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force. However, several years later, in "<a href="Letters%20Written%20in%20Sweden%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Denmark">Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark</a>" (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.

While <a href="English%20dissenters">Dissenting</a> clergyman <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a>, whose sermon helped spark Burke's work, is the villain of "Reflections", he is the hero of the "Rights of Men". Both Wollstonecraft and Burke associate him with <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> thinking, particularly the notion that civilization could progress through rational debate, but they interpret that stance differently. Burke believed such relentless questioning would lead to anarchy, while Wollstonecraft connected Price with "reason, liberty, free discussion, mental superiority, the improving exercise of the mind, moral excellence, active benevolence, orientation toward the present and future, and the rejection of power and riches"—quintessential middle-class professional values.

Wollstonecraft wields the English philosopher <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke's</a> definition of property (that is, ownership acquired through labour) against Burke's notion of inherited wealth. She contends that inheritance is one of the major impediments to the progress of European civilization, and repeatedly argues that Britain's problems are rooted in the inequity of property distribution. Although she did not advocate a totally equal <a href="distribution%20of%20wealth">distribution of wealth</a>, she did desire one that was more equitable.

The "Rights of Men" indicts monarchy and hereditary distinctions and promotes a <a href="republicanism">republican</a> ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue is at the core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional <a href="Commonwealth%20men">Commonwealth</a> ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest good for the greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as "<a href="Original%20Stories%20from%20Real%20Life">Original Stories from Real Life</a>" (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.

Wollstonecraft's ideas of virtue revolved around the family, distinguishing her from other republicans such as <a href="Francis%20Hutcheson%20%28philosopher%29">Francis Hutcheson</a> and <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>. For Wollstonecraft, virtue begins in the home: private virtues are the foundation for public virtues. Inspired by <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau's</a> depictions of the ideal family and the republican <a href="Swiss%20canton">Swiss canton</a>, she draws a picture of idyllic family life in a small country village. One scholar describes her plan this way: "vast estates would be divided into small farms, cottagers would be allowed to make enclosures from the commons and, instead of alms being given to the poor, they would be given the means to independence and self-advancement." Individuals would learn and practice virtue in the home, virtue that would not only make them self-sufficient, but also prompt them to feel responsible for the citizens of their society.

One of the central arguments of Wollstonecraft's "Rights of Men" is that rights should be conferred because they are reasonable and just, not because they are traditional. While Burke argued that civil society and government should rely on traditions which had accrued over centuries, Wollstonecraft contends that all civil agreements are subject to rational reassessment. Precedence, she maintains, is no reason to accept a law or a constitution. As one scholar puts it, "Burke's belief in the antiquity of the British constitution and the impossibility of improvement upon a system that has been tried and tested through time is dismissed as nonsense. The past, for Wollstonecraft, is a scene of superstition, oppression, and ignorance." Wollstonecraft believed powerfully in the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> notion of progress, and rejected the contention that ancient ideas could not be improved upon. Using Burke's own architectural language, she asks, "why was it a duty to repair an ancient castle, built in barbarous ages, of Gothic materials?" She also notes, pointedly, that Burke's philosophy condones <a href="slavery">slavery</a>:
In the "Rights of Men", Wollstonecraft not only endorses <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>, but also a social contract based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at <a href="Newington%20Green">Newington Green</a> just a few years earlier, Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.

Embracing a reasoned <a href="sensibility">sensibility</a>, Wollstonecraft contrasts her theory of civil society with Burke's, which she describes as full of pomp and circumstance and riddled with prejudice. She attacks what she perceives as Burke's false feeling, countering with her own genuine emotion. She argues that to be sympathetic to the French revolution (i.e., the people) is humane while to sympathize with the French clergy, as Burke does, is a mark of inhumanity. She accuses Burke not only of insincerity, but also of manipulation, claiming that his "Reflections" is propaganda. In one of the most dramatic moments of the "Rights of Men", Wollstonecraft claims to be moved beyond Burke's tears for <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> and the monarchy of France to silence for the injustice suffered by slaves, a silence she represents with dashes meant to express feelings more authentic than Burke's:

In the "Rights of Men", Wollstonecraft challenges Burke's rhetoric as much as, or more, than his political theory. She begins by redefining the "<a href="sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a>" and the "beautiful", terms he had established in his "<a href="A%20Philosophical%20Enquiry%20into%20the%20Origin%20of%20Our%20Ideas%20of%20the%20Sublime%20and%20Beautiful">Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful</a>". While Burke associates the beautiful with weakness and femininity, and the sublime with strength and masculinity, Wollstonecraft writes, "for truth, in morals, has ever appeared to me the essence of the sublime; and, in taste, simplicity the only criterion of the beautiful." With this sentence, she calls into question Burke's gendered definitions; convinced that they are harmful, she argues later in the "Rights of Men":

As Wollstonecraft scholar <a href="Claudia%20L.%20Johnson%20%28scholar%29">Claudia Johnson</a> has written, "As feminist critique, these passages have never really been surpassed." Burke, Wollstonecraft maintains, describes womanly virtue as weakness, thus leaving women no substantive roles in the public sphere and relegating them to uselessness.

Wollstonecraft applies this feminist critique to Burke's language throughout the "Reflections". As Johnson argues, "her pamphlet as a whole refutes the Burkean axiom 'to make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely'"; Wollstonecraft successfully challenges Burke's rhetoric of the beautiful with the rhetoric of the rational. She also demonstrates how Burke embodies the worst of his own ideas. He becomes the hysterical, illogical, feminine writer, and Wollstonecraft becomes the rational, masculine writer. Ironically, in order to effect this transposition, Wollstonecraft herself becomes passionate at times, for example, in her description of slavery (quoted above).

The "Rights of Men" was successful, its price contributing in no small measure: at one shilling and sixpence it was half the price of Burke's book. After the first edition sold out, Wollstonecraft agreed to have her name printed on the title page of the second. It was her first extensive work as "a self-supporting professional and self-proclaimed intellectual", as scholar Mary Poovey writes, and:

Commentaries from the time note this; <a href="Horace%20Walpole%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Orford">Horace Walpole</a>, for example, called her a "hyena in petticoats" for attacking Marie Antoinette. <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a>, her future husband, described the book as illogical and ungrammatical; in his "<a href="Memoirs%20of%20the%20Author%20of%20A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">Memoirs</a>" of Wollstonecraft, he dedicated only a paragraph to a discussion of the content of the work, calling it "intemperate".

All the major periodicals of the day reviewed the "Rights of Men". The "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>" agreed with Wollstonecraft's arguments and praised her "lively and animated remarks". The "Monthly Review" was also sympathetic, but it pointed out faults in her writing. The "Critical Review", the "sworn foe" of the "Analytical Review", however, wrote in December 1790, after discovering that the author was a woman:

The "<a href="Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">Gentleman's Magazine</a>" followed suit, criticizing the book's logic and "its absurd presumption that men will be happier if free", as well as Wollstonecraft's own presumption in writing on topics outside of her proper domain, commenting "the "rights of men" asserted by a fair lady! The age of chivalry cannot be over, or the sexes have changed their ground." However, the "Rights of Men" put Wollstonecraft on the map as a writer; from this point forward in her career, she was well known.

Wollstonecraft sent a copy of the book to the historian <a href="Catharine%20Macaulay">Catharine Macaulay</a>, whom she greatly admired. Macaulay wrote back that she was "still more highly pleased that this publication which I have so greatly admired from its pathos & sentiment should have been written by a woman and thus to see my opinion of the powers and talents of the sex in your pen so early verified." <a href="William%20Roscoe">William Roscoe</a>, a Liverpool lawyer, writer, and patron of the arts, liked the book so much that he included Wollstonecraft in his satirical poem "The Life, Death, and Wonderful Achievements of Edmund Burke":

While most of the early reviewers of the "Rights of Men", as well as most of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and juxtaposed it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re-evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked more closely at both her work and Burke's, have come to the conclusion that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable. Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>". It is not until after the halfway point of "Rights of Men" that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, "it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of "Rights of Men" she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her for the rest of her career."

Two years later, when Wollstonecraft published the "Rights of Woman", she extended many of the arguments she had begun in "Rights of Men". If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, women should be included in that group. In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.

The first <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">European</a> descendants migrating from the eastern United States arrived in the area around the 1820s; they were mainly <a href="explorers">explorers</a>, <a href="animal%20trapping">trappers</a>, and <a href="prospectors">prospectors</a>, and they founded many of the current towns around what later became the forest. Sawtooth National Forest offers facilities for recreation, with four ski areas, <a href="whitewater">whitewater</a> and <a href="flatwater">flatwater</a> boating, hunting, 81 campgrounds, and over of trails and roads for <a href="hiking">hiking</a>, <a href="mountain%20biking">mountain biking</a>, and <a href="all-terrain%20vehicle">all-terrain vehicle</a> use, including two <a href="National%20Recreation%20Trail">National Recreation Trail</a>s.

The <a href="Forest%20Reserve%20Act%20of%201891">Forest Reserve Act of 1891</a> gave the President the authority to establish forest reserves in the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">U.S. Department of the Interior</a>. After passage of the <a href="Transfer%20Act%20of%201905">Transfer Act of 1905</a>, forest reserves became part of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> in the newly created <a href="U.S.%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a>. Sawtooth National Forest was created as the Sawtooth Forest Reserve in the Department of Agriculture by proclamation of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> on May 29, 1905. The forest's initial area was , and it was named after the <a href="Sawtooth%20Range%20%28Idaho%29">Sawtooth Mountains</a> in the northwestern part of the forest.

On November 6, 1906, President Roosevelt announced the addition of to the Sawtooth Forest Reserve, which then also constituted much of the present-day <a href="Salmon-Challis%20National%20Forest">Salmon-Challis</a> and <a href="Boise%20National%20Forest">Boise</a> National Forests. These lands were split into separate National Forests by executive order on June 26 and July 1, 1908. The forest's area underwent a number of smaller changes in the early 20th century. The Fairfield Ranger District was established in 1906 and merged with the Shake Creek Ranger District in 1972 to form the present-day Fairfield District. The Cassia Forest Reserve was established on June 12, 1905 and the Raft River Forest Reserve on November 5, 1906. The names of the forest reserves were changed to national forests on March 4, 1907. Formed from the consolidation of <a href="Cassia%20National%20Forest">Cassia</a> and <a href="Raft%20River%20National%20Forest">Raft River</a> National Forests, the <a href="Minidoka%20National%20Forest">Minidoka National Forest</a> was created on July 1, 1908, and then added to Sawtooth National Forest on July 1, 1953.

In 1936, <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> <a href="James%20P.%20Pope">James Pope</a>, a one-term Democrat from Idaho, introduced the first legislation to establish a national park in the Sawtooths. Under his proposal, the park would have been approximately in length and wide. The rest of Idaho's congressional delegation did not support the proposal, which occurred at a time when the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> was taking a more <a href="Conservation%20%28ethic%29">preservation</a>-oriented stance, and the bill died. On October 12, 1937, the Forest Service established the Sawtooth <a href="Primitive%20Area">Primitive Area</a> in the Sawtooth Mountains. Subsequently, Sawtooth National Forest began to extensively develop recreation opportunities, including new campgrounds, trails, and roads.

In 1960, Democratic Senator <a href="Frank%20Church">Frank Church</a> of Idaho introduced legislation for a feasibility study to survey the area for <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20the%20United%20States">national park</a> status. While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area. Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on, Church admitted that it was not designed to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a <a href="national%20recreation%20area">national recreation area</a> managed by the Forest Service. In April 1966, Church introduced two bills, one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the <a href="Sawtooth%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Sawtooth National Recreation Area</a> (SNRA). The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Senator <a href="Leonard%20B.%20Jordan">Len Jordan</a>, a former <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Idaho">governor</a> and sheep rancher, because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging, hunting, and grazing. The legislation was not supported by Idaho's two members of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a>; Republican congressman <a href="George%20V.%20Hansen">George Hansen</a> of the <a href="Idaho%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district">second district</a> introduced a separate bill in the House in April 1967.
In 1968, the <a href="American%20Smelting%20and%20Refining%20Company">American Smelting and Refining Company</a> (ASARCO) discovered a <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a> deposit at the base of <a href="Castle%20Peak%20%28Idaho%29">Castle Peak</a>, the highest peak in the <a href="White%20Cloud%20Mountains">White Cloud Mountains</a>. ASARCO filed paperwork with the Forest Service to construct roads and to allow for an open pit mine below Castle Peak to extract the ore. The proposed mine would have been deep, wide, and long. About of material would be processed daily with 99.5 percent being deposited in waste piles and settling ponds. ASARCO estimated that the mine would create 350 jobs and $1 million ($ today) in taxes per year, while the roads would open up opportunities for further exploration. The Forest Service would not be able to stop mining and protect the White Cloud Mountains because the <a href="General%20Mining%20Act%20of%201872">General Mining Act of 1872</a> gave mining rights to anyone who had located a <a href="lode">lode</a> or <a href="Placer%20deposit">placer</a>. Nationally, opposition to the mine mounted, while Republican Governor <a href="Don%20Samuelson">Don Samuelson</a> voiced support for the mine in 1970, saying that ASARCO was not, "going to tear down mountains. They are only going to dig a hole." He also characterized Castle Peak as, "nothing but sagebrush on one side and scraggly trees on the other." Samuelson lost his reelection bid that November in a rematch with Democrat <a href="Cecil%20Andrus">Cecil Andrus</a>, a supporter of preserving the forest who later (1977–81) served as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">U.S. interior secretary</a> in the <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Carter</a> Administration.

In March 1971, Idaho's congressional delegation, which included senators Church and Jordan and Republican representatives <a href="James%20A.%20McClure">Jim McClure</a> and <a href="Orval%20H.%20Hansen">Orval Hansen</a>, was finally united and introduced legislation to create the SNRA. On August 22, 1972, Public Law 22-400 establishing the SNRA, covering , and banning mining passed both the House and Senate and was signed into law by Republican President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. This legislation included the White Cloud and <a href="Boulder%20Mountains%20%28Idaho%29">Boulder Mountains</a> as part of the SNRA. The Sawtooth Primitive Area became the <a href="Sawtooth%20Wilderness">Sawtooth Wilderness</a> (also in the SNRA) as part of the <a href="National%20Wilderness%20Preservation%20System">National Wilderness Preservation System</a> under the <a href="Wilderness%20Act">Wilderness Act</a> of 1964. The original bill also authorized $19.8 million ($ today) for land acquisition and up to $26 million ($ today) for development. The SNRA was dedicated in a ceremony held on the shores of <a href="Redfish%20Lake">Redfish Lake</a> on September 1, 1972. The <a href="Burley%2C%20Idaho">Burley</a> and <a href="Twin%20Falls%2C%20Idaho">Twin Falls</a> Ranger Districts of Sawtooth National Forest were consolidated on October 16, 2002 into the Minidoka Ranger District.

On August 7, 2015, Democratic President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> signed the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act to create three wilderness areas: <a href="Hemingway%E2%80%93Boulders%20Wilderness">Hemingway–Boulders</a>, <a href="Jim%20McClure%E2%80%93Jerry%20Peak%20Wilderness">Jim McClure–Jerry Peak</a>, and <a href="Cecil%20D.%20Andrus%E2%80%93White%20Clouds%20Wilderness">White Clouds</a>. They cover a total of of central Idaho, primarily in Sawtooth National Forest. On March 23, 2018 the White Clouds Wilderness was renamed the Cecil D. Andrus–White Clouds Wilderness in honor of Andrus and his efforts to protect central Idaho.

Sawtooth National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an agency within the Department of Agriculture, as four units: the <a href="Fairfield%2C%20Idaho">Fairfield</a> (), <a href="Ketchum%2C%20Idaho">Ketchum</a> (), and Minidoka () Ranger Districts and Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA). The forest's headquarters are in <a href="Jerome%2C%20Idaho">Jerome</a>, where they moved to in 2018 after 32 years of being headquartered in Twin Falls. The Minidoka Ranger District is separated into the Albion (), Black Pine (), Cassia (), Raft River (), and Sublett () divisions.

<a href="Forest%20Service%20Guard%20Station">Guard stations</a> and work camps dot the forest. The SNRA headquarters and main visitor center are located north of the city of Ketchum, while there is a ranger station in <a href="Stanley%2C%20Idaho">Stanley</a> and visitor center at Redfish Lake. There are more than of private land inholdings within the forest, and it is bordered by the Boise and Salmon-Challis National Forests as well as private, state, and <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> land. <a href="Curlew%20National%20Grassland">Curlew National Grassland</a> is from the Sublett Division's eastern boundary. Small portions of the area originally designated as Sawtooth National Forest are managed by the Boise and Challis National Forests, while the Sawtooth manages portions of the Boise and Challis National Forests.

Sawtooth National Forest balances interests of different groups, such as those interested in recreation, preservation, or resource extraction. The forest practices conservation of resources, in some areas allowing for production of raw materials, such as lumber for construction purposes and wood pulp for paper products, alongside recreational uses, while in other areas only recreation is permitted. Additionally, mineral extraction through mining and <a href="oil%20exploration">oil</a> and natural gas exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Sawtooth National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Leases offered to ranchers to allow them to graze cattle and sheep on the forest are common. The forest provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not <a href="overexploited">overexploited</a> and that necessary commodities are available for future generations.

The Sawtooth Wilderness was originally designated the Sawtooth Primitive Area in 1937 before becoming part of the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1972 under the Wilderness Act. Although entirely managed by Sawtooth National Forest, only about a quarter (25.33 percent) of the Sawtooth Wilderness lies within the area Congressionally designated as Sawtooth National Forest, with the majority (69.13 percent) lying in Boise National Forest and a relatively small portion (5.54 percent) in Salmon-Challis National Forest. According to the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, the Sawtooth Wilderness has some of the clearest air in the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">lower 48 states</a>.

On August 7, 2015 President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> signed the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act creating the <a href="Hemingway%E2%80%93Boulders%20Wilderness">Hemingway–Boulders</a> (), <a href="Jim%20McClure%E2%80%93Jerry%20Peak%20Wilderness">Jim McClure–Jerry Peak</a> (), and <a href="Cecil%20D.%20Andrus%E2%80%93White%20Clouds%20Wilderness">White Clouds</a> () wilderness areas covering a combined of Sawtooth National Forest, Salmon-Challis National Forest, and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land after it passed Congress on August 4, 2015. The Hemingway–Boulders Wilderness is entirely within SNRA, while all but of the White Clouds Wilderness is in the SNRA, with the rest managed by the BLM. The Jim McClure–Jerry Peak wilderness is entirely outside the administered area of Sawtooth National Forest, but partially within the area designated as Sawtooth National Forest and thus managed by Salmon-Challis National Forest and the BLM. The 2015 bill and previous versions were introduced by Republican Representative <a href="Mike%20Simpson">Mike Simpson</a>, while prior bills had proposed to designate of wilderness as part of the controversial Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA). CIEDRA would have opened over adjacent to the new wilderness areas to motorized vehicle use, given of public land to local municipalities, and established a "no net loss" policy for motorized trails.

Prior to the 2015 wilderness designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains were part of the largest unprotected <a href="Inventoried%20roadless%20area">roadless area</a> in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of Congressional action that would designate the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a <a href="National%20Monument%20%28United%20States%29">national monument</a> by presidential proclamation under the <a href="Antiquities%20Act">Antiquities Act</a>. Former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Dirk%20Kempthorne">Dirk Kempthorne</a> initially studied the area for national monument status, but did not recommend it because Congressional action seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving increased attention when President Obama indicated he would designate a national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed wilderness areas, such as through the <a href="Northern%20Rockies%20Ecosystem%20Protection%20Act">Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act</a>. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.

The Wilderness Act enhanced the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage of the act ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or mining, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment and bicycles. The ways people may enter wilderness areas are on foot or on <a href="equestrianism">horseback</a>.

About 47 percent of the forest's land is forested, and an additional 3 percent can support trees, but does not currently have any. Lower elevations in Sawtooth National Forest often have <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a> and grassland vegetation types, while forested areas contain a variety of tree species. <a href="Lodgepole%20pine">Lodgepole pine</a> forms nearly monotypic forests in part of the SNRA with sparse vegetation under the tree cover. Plants that can be found under lodgepole pines include grasses, scattered forbs, <a href="Gaylussacia%20dumosa">dwarf huckleberry</a>, and <a href="Vaccinium%20scoparium">grouse whortleberry</a>. <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> and <a href="Populus%20tremuloides">quaking aspen</a> are found in similar environments throughout the forest with understories of low shrubs, such as <a href="Symphoricarpos%20albus">common snowberry</a> and <a href="Spiraea">white spirea</a>. Aspen is also found throughout the forest at elevations ranging from to .

The highest elevation forests contain <a href="whitebark%20pine">whitebark pine</a>, <a href="Engelmann%20spruce">Engelmann spruce</a>, <a href="subalpine%20fir">subalpine fir</a>, and <a href="limber%20pine">limber pine</a>, including the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on <a href="Dendrochronology">tree ring chronologies</a>, some of the whitebark pines are believed to be 700 to 1000 or more years old. The highest elevation forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. <a href="Willows">Willows</a>, <a href="alder">alder</a>s, <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aegiros">cottonwoods</a>, and <a href="sedge">sedge</a>s are found in riparian areas. <a href="Ponderosa%20pine">Ponderosa pine</a> occupy the dry, lower elevations near the western edge of the forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as <a href="Festuca%20idahoensis">Idaho fescue</a> and <a href="Pseudoroegneria%20spicata">bluebunch wheatgrass</a>. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as <a href="Calamagrostis%20rubescens">pinegrass</a> are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and <a href="Physocarpus%20malvaceus">mallow ninebark</a>.

The Minidoka District is separated from the rest of the forest by the <a href="Snake%20River%20Plain">Snake River Plain</a>, also known as Idaho's potato belt; snowmelt from the forest provides a steady supply of water to the plain. The Minidoka District is a part of the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a>, and while much of the vegetation here is similar to the northern part of the forest, the presence of <a href="Juniperus%20scopulorum">Rocky Mountain juniper</a> is notable as well as is the occasional cactus plant. In these <a href="pinyon-juniper%20woodland">pinyon-juniper woodland</a>s trees also include <a href="Pinus%20monophylla">singleleaf pinyon</a>, <a href="Juniperus%20osteosperma">Utah juniper</a>, and <a href="Cercocarpus%20ledifolius">curl-leaf mountain mahogany</a>. Idaho's rarest plant, the <a href="Castilleja%20christii">Christ's Indian paintbrush</a>, is <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to on upper elevations of <a href="Mount%20Harrison%20%28Idaho%29">Mount Harrison</a> in the Albion Mountains in the Minidoka District. <a href="Cymopterus%20davisii">Davis' springparsley</a> is also endemic to the Albion Mountains. Additionally, the forest contains potential habitat for the threatened <a href="Spiranthes%20diluvialis">Ute lady's tresses</a>.
<a href="Exotic%20species">Exotic species</a> (also known as invasive or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling from outside the forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include <a href="Centaurea%20maculosa">spotted knapweed</a>, <a href="Centaurea%20solstitialis">yellow starthistle</a>, <a href="Chondrilla%20juncea">rush skeletonweed</a>, <a href="Euphorbia%20esula">leafy spurge</a>, and <a href="Bromus%20tectorum">cheatgrass</a>.

The <a href="mountain%20pine%20beetle">mountain pine beetle</a> is a native insect species that is known to experience large outbreaks that infest forest groves, and is particularly common in areas with numerous lodgepole pines and fir trees. A large infestation occurred from 1995 through 2003, and the beetle wiped out areas of lodgepole pine in the SNRA, an area historically too cold for outbreaks to occur.

Sawtooth National Forest is home to over 243 bird species, 78 mammals, 28 reptiles and amphibians, and 29 fish. Invasive <a href="zebra%20mussel">zebra</a> and <a href="quagga%20mussel">quagga mussel</a>s are potential threats to the forest's aquatic ecosystems because they can spread rapidly and cover large surface areas, including human structures, thus altering ecosystems, removing native mussels and threatening native fish. <a href="Northwestern%20wolf">Wolves</a> were controversially <a href="wolf%20reintroduction">reintroduced</a> to the SNRA in the mid-1990s to restore the ecosystem stability that they provide as <a href="apex%20predator">top predators</a>.This included managing high <a href="elk">elk</a> populations, which had inhibited new vegetation growth. Opponents to the reintroduction included hunters concerned that wolves would inhibit their ability to hunt the highest number of game species possible, ranchers concerned for the welfare of their animals, and land developers concerned that a species listed under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a> may restrict what they can do to their land.

Along with <a href="North%20American%20cougar">cougar</a>s, timber wolves are the largest top predators that live in the forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the forest, with the exception of <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>s, which have become <a href="local%20extinction">locally extinct</a>. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s and the endangered <a href="Canada%20lynx">Canadian lynx</a>, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.
Elk (also known as wapiti), <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a>, and <a href="pronghorn">pronghorn</a> (also called pronghorn antelope) are some of the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the <a href="Sawtooth%20Valley">Sawtooth Valley</a> migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to motorized use to protect the elk winter range. <a href="Bighorn%20sheep">Bighorn sheep</a> are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a> population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="yellow-bellied%20marmot">yellow-bellied marmot</a>, <a href="American%20pika">pika</a>, and <a href="American%20badger">badger</a>.

<a href="Bull%20trout">Bull trout</a> are one of the <a href="Indicator%20species">management indicator species</a> for the forest. Population monitoring efforts are undertaken every year to provide an assessment of forest health. They were selected because they are dependent upon specific habitat conditions and are sensitive to habitat changes. Bull trout are only found in parts of the <a href="Salmon%20River%20%28Idaho%29">Salmon</a>, <a href="Boise%20River">Boise</a>, and <a href="Payette%20River">Payette</a> river watersheds on the Fairfield District and the SNRA. The forest is home to the longest salmon migration in the continental United States, but with the damming of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, salmon populations have <a href="Population%20dynamics%20of%20fisheries">collapsed</a>. Redfish Lake was named for the <a href="sockeye%20salmon">sockeye salmon</a> that would return to breed in the lake and its tributaries and historically had 10,000 to 35,000 adult fish return to the lake annually. Between 1990 and 1998 a total of 16 adult fish returned to Redfish Lake, but populations have recovered somewhat, and in 2014 approximately 1400 adult fish returned, up from 1100 in 2011. Repeated efforts to repopulate the sockeye salmon have taken place in the Columbia River watershed, and in 2008 the first salmon season in 31 years was held for <a href="chinook%20salmon">chinook salmon</a> in the upper Salmon River. <a href="Brook%20trout">Brook trout</a> have been introduced to the forest and are now an invasive species that compete with the threatened bull trout. The <a href="Wood%20River%20sculpin">Wood River sculpin</a> is a fish species that is endemic to the <a href="Big%20Wood%20River">Big Wood River</a> and its tributaries on the Ketchum District and is listed as vulnerable by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List</a>. <a href="Rainbow%20trout">Rainbow trout</a>, <a href="cutthroat%20trout">cutthroat trout</a>, and <a href="mountain%20whitefish">mountain whitefish</a> are all native to portions of the forest waterways.
243 bird species have been observed in the upper Salmon River Basin, with an additional 36 accidental species, or those that are not normally found in the region but have been observed on at least one occasion. <a href="Bald%20eagles">Bald eagles</a> can be found on the forest, particularly along rivers, while <a href="golden%20eagles">golden eagles</a> are occasionally seen over the sagebrush steppe. <a href="Northern%20goshawk">Northern goshawk</a>s are listed by the Forest Service as a sensitive species and are found on the forest. <a href="Black-billed%20magpie">Black-billed magpie</a>s are common on the forest, and <a href="sandhill%20cranes">sandhill cranes</a> are seen during the breeding season in the Sawtooth Valley. <a href="Black%20rosy%20finch">Black rosy finch</a> breed at the highest elevations in the northern section of the forest, while <a href="greater%20sage-grouse">greater sage-grouse</a> can be found in sagebrush habitats throughout the forest.

The <a href="South%20Hills%20crossbill">South Hills crossbill</a> is a <a href="finch">finch</a> endemic to the South Hills and Albion Mountains in the Minidoka District. It rarely interbreeds with similar crossbills that are present in its range, and it has been proposed as a separate species created via <a href="ecological%20speciation">ecological speciation</a>. The <a href="American%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">American Ornithologists' Union</a> failed to find consensus on the issue so the South Hills crossbill is still considered a subspecies of the <a href="red%20crossbill">red crossbill</a>.

There are few <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s in the forest. Snakes species include <a href="bullsnake">bullsnake</a>s and <a href="rubber%20boa">rubber boa</a>s, as well as <a href="western%20rattlesnakes">western rattlesnakes</a>, which are most likely to be found at lower elevations and in the Minidoka District. Amphibians including the <a href="Columbia%20spotted%20frog">Columbia spotted frog</a>, <a href="long-toed%20salamander">long-toed salamander</a>, and the <a href="Tailed%20frog">Rocky Mountain tailed frog</a> are relatively common.

Sawtooth National Forest has an active Fire Management Program which recognizes that <a href="forest%20fire">forest fire</a>s are a natural part of the ecosystem, but this was not always the case. The 1987 forest plan did not recognize fire as an ecosystem process or as a tool for ecosystem management; this was rectified in the 2012 forest plan. Previous firefighting efforts, which emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, caused dead and dying trees to accumulate well in excess of the level found when fires are allowed to burn out naturally. Historically speaking, fires became more common in parts of the SNRA after the development of lodgepole pine forests, which occurred prior to 1450 AD. Between 1989 and 1998 there were on average 50 fires per year, with 58 percent of them caused by lightning. The <a href="Smoky%20Mountains%20%28Idaho%29">Smoky Mountains of Idaho</a> were named from the frequent forest fires, and in 2007 the <a href="Castle%20Rock%20Fire">Castle Rock Fire</a> burned of the Smoky Mountains near Ketchum. In 2005 the Valley Road Fire burned in the White Cloud Mountains after being ignited from embers that came from a trash barrel which were blown out on a windy day. In August 2013 the <a href="2013%20Beaver%20Creek%20Fire">Beaver Creek Fire</a> and the Kelley Fire were both ignited by lightning and burned and , respectively, of the Fairfield and Ketchum ranger districts. Another lightning-caused fire, the McCan Fire, burned of the Fairfield Ranger District and other lands north of Fairfield in 2013. Both natural and prescribed fires are used as a tool to maintain desired vegetation and fuel levels. While the forest's fire plan operates within historical fire regimes, locally fire is actively suppressed to protect human life, investments, and resources.

The forest maintains a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, not only to control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set <a href="controlled%20burns">controlled burns</a>. Their jobs include maintaining a high level of preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of <a href="smokejumper">smokejumper</a>s and <a href="aerial%20firefighting">air tankers</a> used to provide air support in dropping <a href="flame%20retardant">flame retardant</a> and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used in the case of a fire. The 10-member Sawtooth <a href="Helitack">Helitack</a> crew was established in 1963 and is based at <a href="Friedman%20Memorial%20Airport">Friedman Memorial Airport</a> in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: <a href="Iron%20Mountain%20%28Idaho%29">Iron Mountain</a>, <a href="Horton%20Peak">Horton Peak</a>, <a href="Lookout%20Mountain%20%28Custer%20County%2C%20Idaho%29">Lookout Mountain</a>, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>.

The elevation in the forest ranges from at Rock Creek south of Twin Falls to above sea level at the top of <a href="Hyndman%20Peak">Hyndman Peak</a>, an elevation gain of . The mountains of the Minidoka District are part of the Basin and Range Province, while those in the northern section of the forest are part of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. The Sawtooth Mountains have at least <a href="List%20of%20peaks%20of%20the%20Sawtooth%20Range%20%28Idaho%29">fifty peaks</a> over .
The mountains of Sawtooth National Forest have a varied geological history. The northern Sawtooth Mountains formed from the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> Sawtooth <a href="batholith">batholith</a>, while south of <a href="Alturas%20Lake">Alturas Lake</a> the Sawtooth, Smoky, and Soldier mountains formed from the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="granodiorite">granodiorite</a> of the <a href="Idaho%20Batholith">Idaho Batholith</a>. Foothills of the Smoky Mountains are from the <a href="Pennsylvanian%20%28geology%29">Pennsylvanian</a> and <a href="Permian">Permian</a> Dollarhide formations. The White Cloud Mountains are underlain by the gray granodiorite of the Idaho batholith, while some of the exposed rock is baked impure <a href="limestone">limestone</a> from the Permian Grand Prize Formation.

The central mass of the Raft River Mountains consists of <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> metamorphic rocks with Elba <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> and interlayered <a href="schist">schist</a> on the southern slopes and Cambrian quartzite outcrops on the western part of the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the <a href="Phosphoria%20Formation">Phosphoria Formation</a>, a basal <a href="phosphorite">phosphorite</a> overlain by a thick sequence of <a href="chert">chert</a> and cherty <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.

The Boulder, Pioneer, Sawtooth, Smoky, and White Cloud mountains are generally jagged, while the ranges on the Minidoka District, the Albion, Black Pine, Raft River, and Sublett mountains, are generally smooth and rolling. <a href="Galena%20Summit">Galena Summit</a> is a <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a> at on <a href="Idaho%20State%20Highway%2075">State Highway 75</a> between Stanley and Ketchum, roughly where the Boulder and Smoky Mountains meet. While not in Sawtooth National Forest, <a href="Banner%20Creek%20Summit">Banner Creek Summit</a> is a mountain pass on <a href="Idaho%20State%20Highway%2021">State Highway 21</a> at the northern end of the Sawtooth Mountains, on the border of the Boise and Challis National Forests.
There are over 1,100 lakes covering and an estimated of temporary and permanent streams and rivers in the forest. Over of streams are found in the Fairfield District, over in the Ketchum District, and over in the Minidoka District. The entire northern portion of the forest is in the watershed of the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a>, a tributary of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>. The <a href="Salmon%20River%20%28Idaho%29">Salmon River's</a> headwaters are in the upper Sawtooth Valley, and this river drains much of the SNRA and follows a tortuous, overall northwesterly course before flowing into the Snake River downstream. The eastern side of the Sawtooth Mountains is drained by the South Fork of the <a href="Payette%20River">Payette River</a>. The northern Soldier Mountains, southern Smoky Mountains, and much of the Fairfield District are drained by the <a href="Boise%20River">South Fork of the Boise River</a>, which flows into <a href="Anderson%20Ranch%20Dam">Anderson Ranch Reservoir</a> just west of the forest. The Ketchum District, part of the SNRA, and the southern slopes of the Fairfield District are drained by the <a href="Big%20Wood%20River">Big Wood River</a>. Much of the Minidoka District is also drained by the Snake River via the <a href="Raft%20River">Raft River</a> and other tributaries, but portions of the Black Pine and Raft River Mountains drain into the <a href="Great%20Salt%20Lake">Great Salt Lake</a>. The annual water yield from the forest is estimated just below .

Most of the forest's lakes are the result of <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a> and occur in the SNRA in the Sawtooth and White Cloud Mountains, but lakes can be found in most of the other mountain ranges of the forest. There are over 20 lakes in the Fairfield District, 90 in the Ketchum District, and 6 lakes and 3 reservoirs in the Minidoka District. The largest lake on the forest is <a href="Redfish%20Lake">Redfish Lake</a>, a <a href="moraine">moraine</a>-dammed lake that is long, wide, and up to deep. Other large lakes include <a href="Alturas%20Lake">Alturas</a>, <a href="Pettit%20Lake">Pettit</a>, <a href="Sawtooth%20Lake">Sawtooth</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Lake">Stanley</a>, and <a href="Yellow%20Belly%20Lake">Yellow Belly</a> lakes.
The <a href="Sawtooth%20Fault">Sawtooth Fault</a> is a long east-dipping <a href="normal%20fault">normal fault</a> that runs along the base of the Sawtooth Mountains and was discovered and mapped in 2010. It is believed to be capable of producing an <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> measuring up to 7.5 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter magnitude scale</a>, with one of the most recent large earthquakes occurring 4,000 years ago and an earlier one 7,000 years ago.


Sawtooth National Forest has a history of <a href="alpine%20glacier">alpine</a> <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a> that is most obvious in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial <a href="snow%20field">snow field</a>s and <a href="rock%20glacier">rock glacier</a>s remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Mountains, and while none have been mapped elsewhere on the forest, some may still exist in the Boulder, Pioneer, and White Cloud Mountains.

The Sawtooth Mountains were last extensively glaciated in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, but glaciers probably existed during the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a>, which ended around 1850 AD. Evidence of past glaciation is abundant in the Sawtooth, White Cloud, Boulder, and Smoky mountains, as well as the north and east-facing slopes of the Albion, Raft River, and Soldier mountains. Remnants of the glaciers include <a href="glacial%20lakes">glacial lakes</a>, <a href="moraines">moraines</a>, <a href="pyramidal%20peak">horns</a>, <a href="hanging%20valleys">hanging valleys</a>, <a href="cirques">cirques</a>, and <a href="ar%C3%AAte">arête</a>s.

Much of Sawtooth National Forest receives less than of precipitation a year, with higher elevations typically receiving more precipitation. Summer and early fall are usually drier than winter in most of the forest, while in the lowlands of the Minidoka District, such as near <a href="Oakley%2C%20Idaho">Oakley</a>, the spring may be the wettest season. Winter snowfall provides a steady water supply to the streams during the summer. Locally, climate may depend on mountains that block moist air and river valleys that can funnel weather systems. <a href="Dry%20lightning">Dry lightning</a> is common in summer and fall. The growing season ranges from 150 days in the lower valleys to less than 30 days in the highest alpine areas. The climate charts below are ordered (left to right) from highest to lowest in both latitude and elevation.

Spear points dating to 12,000 years ago document the earliest presence of <a href="Paleo-Indians">Paleo-Indians</a> in the area, and there are nearly 1,500 known <a href="heritage%20sites">heritage sites</a> in the forest. After AD 1700, the <a href="Shoshone%20people">Shoshone</a>, also known as the <a href="Sheepeater%20people">Sheepeater people</a>, as well as the <a href="Bannock%20people">Bannock</a> and <a href="Northern%20Paiute">Northern Paiute</a> tribes, harvested fish, game, roots, timber, tubers, and rocks for tools while living in small groups at the northern end of the forest.

Trappers and explorers arrived in southern Idaho in the early 19th century. They established immigrant trails in the region by 1849, including the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon</a> and <a href="California%20Trail">California</a> trails. The forest was used by early settlers primarily for extractive industries. Fur trappers of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> discovered the Stanley Basin in the northern part of the forest in the 1820s, but mostly avoided it due to the scarcity of beaver. For early settlers, the welfare of their community was dependent upon timber supply, regulation of stream flow for irrigation, and use of the land for cattle range. Mining began in the 1860s, peaked in the 1880s, and fluctuated over the following century with the extraction of gold, silver, lead, and zinc. The Black Pine Division of the forest was explored in the late 1800s, and the Tallman Mine began producing gold in the 1920s with production peaking from 1949 to 1954. The Black Pine Mine again produced gold from 1992 through November 1997, when the mine's parent company, Pegasus Gold, declared bankruptcy. The location of the mine has since been <a href="Mine%20reclamation">reclaimed</a>.
Towns around the forest, including Stanley, Ketchum, and <a href="Sawtooth%20City">Sawtooth City</a>, were founded as mining towns in the latter part of the 19th century by prospectors and trappers, including <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> veteran Captain John Stanley, after whom the town of Stanley is named. Ketchum is named after the trapper and guide David Ketchum, while the Sublett Mountains are named after trapper <a href="William%20Sublette">William Sublette</a>, who lived in the area in the 1830s. Most of the logging in the region was for firewood and timber for miners and <a href="Homestead%20principle">homesteaders</a>. For much of the 20th century, sheep and cattle grazing were the primary large-scale land uses of the forest. Sheep drives were common in the <a href="Wood%20River%20Valley">Wood River Valley</a> after the mining boom and shepherds from southern Idaho drove their flocks north to graze the upper elevation areas in Sawtooth National Forest. The original sheepherders were <a href="Basque%20American">Basque American</a>s, while today many of the sheepherders are <a href="Peru">Peru</a>vians contracted through the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">Department of Labor</a>.

In 1936 the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a> and its chairman <a href="W.%20Averell%20Harriman">W. Averell Harriman</a> developed <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Idaho">Sun Valley</a> and the <a href="Bald%20Mountain%20%28Idaho%29">Bald Mountain</a> ski area—the first winter-destination resort in the United States developed for the purpose of increasing railroad passenger numbers. The area became popular with celebrities, including <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="Gary%20Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>. On July 2, 1961 Hemingway committed suicide at his home overlooking the Big Wood River; he is buried at the Ketchum Cemetery.

On February 9, 1945 a <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bomber crashed on Mount Harrison in the Albion Division of the forest during a training mission in dense fog. All nine crew were killed in the crash, and their bodies were found inside the plane and recovered over the following days. The plane's remains have never been removed. A memorial service was held on July 29, 2004 and a plaque was permanently installed honoring those who died.

Sawtooth National Forest receives over one million visitors a year. Two visitor centers, one at the SNRA headquarters north of Ketchum and one at Redfish Lake, provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays and are staffed by either forest service interpreters or volunteers. The forest's ranger stations also provide these services, but without interpretive displays. Along the roadways, exhibits showcase key parts of the forest, and there are plentiful day use and picnic areas. There are more than 81 campgrounds in the forest, with 12 in the Fairfield District, 6 in the Ketchum District, 25 in the Minidoka District, and 38 in the SNRA. Most of the campgrounds are on a first come first served basis, while some can be reserved.

Visiting distant <a href="backcountry">backcountry</a> areas requires accessing <a href="hiking">hiking trails</a> and then <a href="backpacking%20%28wilderness%29">backpacking</a> or horseback riding into remote destinations. Free permits are required for use of the wilderness and can be obtained at trailheads. Group size is restricted in the wilderness, open fires are not permitted in some high-use areas, and visitors are expected to follow <a href="Leave%20No%20Trace">Leave No Trace</a> practices. There are abundant trails throughout the forest, with over in the SNRA, in the Fairfield District, and in the Minidoka District. Two <a href="National%20Recreation%20Trail">National Recreation Trail</a>s are found on the forest, the Fishhook Creek Boardwalk at Redfish Lake and the Wood River Nature Trail at the Wood River Campground. <a href="All-terrain%20vehicle">All-terrain vehicle</a>s are allowed on over of forest roads and some trails, but access may be restricted depending on season and environmental conditions. The Sun Valley area has an extensive network of mountain biking trails. <a href="Hunting">Hunting</a> and <a href="fishing">fishing</a> are popular recreational activities permitted throughout the forest, provided that proper permits are obtained and the applicable rules and regulations are followed. Hunting and fishing licenses are available from the state of Idaho through the <a href="Idaho%20Department%20of%20Fish%20and%20Game">Idaho Department of Fish and Game</a>.

The SNRA is the primary destination for <a href="mountaineering">mountain climbers</a> and <a href="rock%20climbers">rock climbers</a> within the forest. <a href="Thompson%20Peak%20%28Idaho%29">Thompson Peak</a> and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and <a href="Mount%20Heyburn">Mount Heyburn</a> is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from <a href="flatwater">flatwater</a> to class IV <a href="whitewater">whitewater</a>. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in spring and early summer. The large lakes in the <a href="Sawtooth%20Valley">Sawtooth Valley</a>, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.

Winter activities include <a href="downhill%20skiing">downhill skiing</a>, <a href="cross-country%20skiing">cross-country skiing</a>, <a href="snowshoeing">snowshoeing</a>, and <a href="snowmobiling">snowmobiling</a>. The first destination winter resort in the U.S. was developed at <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Idaho">Sun Valley</a> in 1936 with ski slopes on Bald Mountain and <a href="Dollar%20Mountain">Dollar Mountain</a>. There are four ski areas in Sawtooth National Forest as well as the <a href="Rotarun%20Ski%20Area">Rotarun Ski Area</a> just west of <a href="Hailey%2C%20Idaho">Hailey</a> and Dollar Mountain in Sun Valley, but these are just outside the forest's boundary. There are snowshoe loops and of groomed Nordic ski trails around Galena Lodge in the SNRA. <a href="Sno-Cat">Sno-Cat</a> and <a href="heliskiing">heliskiing</a> opportunities also exist in the forest. Over of groomed snowmobile trails and warming huts are found in the Fairfield District, and there are in the Cassia Division. Backcountry hut and yurt accommodations are available in the Sawtooth National Forest for overnight trips for winter recreationalists. 

Sawtooth National Forest is home to four of Idaho's scenic byways, three of which intersect in Stanley. <a href="Idaho%20State%20Highway%2075">Idaho State Highway 75</a> is designated as the Sawtooth Scenic Byway for from <a href="Shoshone%2C%20Idaho">Shoshone</a> north to Stanley. Highway 75 from Stanley to <a href="Challis%2C%20Idaho">Challis</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2093%20in%20Idaho">U.S. Route 93</a> from Challis north to the <a href="Montana">Montana</a> border are designated as the Salmon River Scenic Byway for . <a href="Idaho%20State%20Highway%2021">Idaho State Highway 21</a> is the Ponderosa Pine Scenic Byway for from Stanley to <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise</a>. The City of Rocks Backcountry Byway follows a series of roads for around the Albion Mountains and through the <a href="City%20of%20Rocks%20National%20Reserve">City of Rocks National Reserve</a> at the southern end of the Albion Mountains.

Movies, television shows, and documentaries have been filmed in and around Sawtooth National Forest, particularly around the Sun Valley area. Movies filmed in Sun Valley include "<a href="I%20Met%20Him%20in%20Paris">I Met Him in Paris</a>" (1937), "<a href="Sun%20Valley%20Serenade">Sun Valley Serenade</a>" (1941), and "<a href="Bus%20Stop%20%281956%20film%29">Bus Stop</a>" (1956). <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood's</a> <a href="1985%20film">1985 film</a> "<a href="Pale%20Rider">Pale Rider</a>" was filmed in the SNRA, mostly in the Boulder Mountains in late 1984. The opening credits scene was shot south of Stanley in front of the Sawtooth Mountains. The SNRA was one of the settings of the 2010 3-D computer animated film "<a href="Alpha%20and%20Omega%20%28film%29">Alpha and Omega</a>".

Beginning in 1986 <a href="Vehicle%20registration%20plates%20of%20Idaho">Idaho license plates</a> depicted a basic mountain range that was supposed to represent the Sawtooths; in 1991 the plates were revised to more accurately represent the mountains. The Idaho Division of Motor Vehicles also created a license plate depicting the SNRA.

Lawrence Wetherby

Lawrence Winchester Wetherby (January 2, 1908 – March 27, 1994) was an American politician who served as <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Lieutenant Governor</a> and <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He is the only governor in state history born in <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County</a>, despite the fact that <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> (that county's <a href="county%20seat">seat</a>) is the state's most populous city.

After graduating from the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a>, Wetherby held several minor offices in the Jefferson County judicial system before being elected lieutenant governor in 1947. He was called Kentucky's first "working" lieutenant governor because Governor <a href="Earle%20C.%20Clements">Earle C. Clements</a> asked him to carry out duties beyond his <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">constitutional</a> responsibility to preside over the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state Senate</a>, such as preparing the state budget and attending the <a href="Southern%20Governors%20Association">Southern Governors Conference</a>. In 1950, Clements resigned to assume a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>, elevating Wetherby to governor. Wetherby won immediate acclaim by calling a special legislative session to increase funding for education and government benefits from the state's budget surplus. In 1951, he won a four-year full term as governor, during which he continued and expanded many of Clements' programs, including increased road construction and industrial diversification. He endorsed the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>'s 1954 <a href="desegregation">desegregation</a> order in the case of "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>" and appointed a biracial commission to oversee the successful integration of the state's schools. As chairman of the Southern Governors Conference in 1954 and 1955, he encouraged other southern governors to accept and implement desegregation.

<a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">Limited to one term</a> by the state constitution, Wetherby supported <a href="Bert%20Combs">Bert Combs</a> to be his successor, but Combs lost in the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> <a href="primary%20election">primary</a> to <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a>, a former governor and factional opponent of both Wetherby and Clements. Chandler's failure to support Wetherby's 1956 bid to succeed Democrat <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a> in the Senate contributed to his loss to <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a>. From 1964 to 1966, Wetherby served on a commission charged with revising the state constitution, and in 1966 he was elected to the Kentucky Senate, where he provided leadership in drafting the state budget. Following this, he retired from politics and served as a consultant for Brighton Engineering. He died March 27, 1994, of complications from a broken hip and was buried in <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a> in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>.

Lawrence Wetherby was born January 2, 1908, in <a href="Middletown%2C%20Kentucky">Middletown, Kentucky</a>. He was the fourth child of Samuel Davis and Fanny (Yenowine) Wetherby. His grandfather was a surgeon in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. His father was also a physician and farmer, and during his childhood years, Wetherby worked on the family farm.

After graduating from Anchorage High School, Wetherby enrolled in the pre-law program at the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a>. He was a <a href="Letterman%20%28sports%29">letterman</a> on the <a href="Louisville%20Cardinals%20football">football team</a> in 1927 and 1928; he also played <a href="Second%20baseman">second base</a> on the baseball team in 1928 and 1929, and was a letterman in that sport in 1929. He was later inducted into the university's Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1929, he earned his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree and went to work for Judge Henry Tilford. The two would remain partners until 1950. On April 24, 1930, he married Helen Dwyer; the couple had three children.

Thanks to his father's influence, Wetherby became interested in local politics at an early age. School board races fascinated him, and he allied himself with a faction of the <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jefferson County</a> <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> headed by <a href="E.%20Leland%20Taylor">Leland Taylor</a> and Ben Ewing. When Ewing was elected <a href="County%20Judge/Executive">county judge</a> in 1933, he appointed Wetherby as a part-time attorney for the Jefferson County <a href="juvenile%20court">juvenile court</a>. He held this position through 1937, then returned to it in 1942 and 1943. In March 1943, he was appointed the first trial commissioner of the juvenile court.

Wetherby was elected chairman of the 34th Legislative District Democratic Committee in 1943 and held the position through 1956. In March 1947, he resigned as trial commissioner of the juvenile court in order to run for lieutenant governor. The strongest of his four opponents in the Democratic <a href="primary%20election">primary</a> was Bill May, the nephew of <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="Andrew%20J.%20May">Andrew J. May</a>. May had sought the support of gubernatorial candidate Earle C. Clements, but Clements refused, possibly because Congressman May was an ally of Clements' political opponent <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Sr.">John Y. Brown</a>. Wetherby was also unable to secure Clements' public endorsement, but he won the primary and went on to defeat Republican Orville M. Howard by over 95,000 votes.

Despite Clements' refusal to endorse Wetherby in the primary, the two generally agreed on their legislative agendas and worked well together. Some observers called Wetherby Kentucky's first "working" lieutenant governor. Previous lieutenant governors did little beyond their constitutionally mandated duty of presiding over the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a>, but during Clements' administration, Wetherby was charged with preparing a state budget, presiding over the <a href="Legislative%20Research%20Commission">Legislative Research Commission</a>, leading tours for the state <a href="Chamber%20of%20Commerce">Chamber of Commerce</a>, and attending the <a href="Southern%20Governors%20Association">Southern Governors Conference</a>. Clements also made Wetherby executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee, which allowed Wetherby to make many important political contacts.

On November 27, 1950, Clements resigned to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate, elevating Wetherby to governor. One of his first actions was to call a special legislative session to convene on March 6, 1951 for the purpose of allocating the state's $10 million budget surplus. Among the expenditures approved in the special session were increases in teachers' salaries and state benefits for the needy and government employees. Wetherby's popularity soared as a result of this session, and he seriously considered running for the Senate seat vacated by the death of <a href="Virgil%20Chapman">Virgil Chapman</a> in 1951. Instead, after talking with Clements and other Democratic leaders, he decided to seek a full, four-year term as governor.

Among the potential candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1951 was former governor <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a>, who was about to be released as <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball%20%28MLB%29">baseball commissioner</a>. Chandler and Clements were bitter political enemies, and the possibility of a Chandler candidacy provided the Clements faction of the Democratic party with the impetus to unite behind Wetherby to prevent Chandler from gaining the nomination. Ultimately, Chandler did not seek the nomination and, despite implying that Clements controlled Wetherby, Chandler endorsed Wetherby on May 15, 1951. Wetherby had little trouble defeating Howell Vincent and Jesse Cecil in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, polling the largest majority ever in a Kentucky primary race.

In the general election, Wetherby faced <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Court of Appeals</a> judge <a href="Eugene%20Siler">Eugene Siler</a>. Siler was a <a href="Fundamentalist%20Christianity">fundamentalist Christian</a> who claimed that the state government was full of corruption, and only he could stop it. Citing the gambling in <a href="Northern%20Kentucky">Northern Kentucky</a>, bribery accusations against members of Clements' and Wetherby's administrations, and a 1951 scandal involving the <a href="Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">University of Kentucky men's basketball team</a>, he referred to Frankfort as "our <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> on the <a href="Kentucky%20River">Kentucky River</a>". Wetherby countered Siler's accusations of corruption by removing one of the officials accused of bribery from office. He deployed the newly organized <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Police">Kentucky State Police</a> to counter <a href="organized%20crime">organized crime</a> in <a href="Campbell%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Campbell</a> and <a href="Henderson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Henderson</a> counties. To further discourage crime, he supported legislation to revoke the alcohol licenses of establishments that allowed gambling. Siler's pro-<a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a> and anti-<a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a> views played well in the state's rural areas, but cost him the vote of the growing urban population. Wetherby won the election by a vote of 346,345 to 288,014.

Early in Wetherby's term, the state's revenues were inflated by the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Having adopted a <a href="PAYGO">pay-as-you-go</a> program for the state, he was forced to raise additional revenue after the war ended. He did so by imposing <a href="sin%20tax">sin tax</a>es on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and <a href="parimutuel%20betting">parimutuel betting</a>, but he was unable to convince the General Assembly to adopt a <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a>.

Because three members of Wetherby's close family had been killed in automobile accidents on the state's roadways, improving roads was a high priority for Wetherby. Using revenue from a two-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax passed under the Clements administration, Wetherby authorized the building, re-building, or re-surfacing of nearly of roads during his administration. The most important of these was the state's first toll road—the <a href="Kentucky%20Turnpike">Kentucky Turnpike</a>—connecting <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> and <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky">Elizabethtown</a>. He encouraged <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> to construct a federal toll road connecting the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Other political leaders joined him, convincing Eisenhower to construct the long-talked-about <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>. Improved roads brought increased tourism, which Wetherby supported by increasing funding to the <a href="List%20of%20Kentucky%20state%20parks">state park system</a> and adding <a href="Breaks%20Interstate%20Park">Breaks Interstate Park</a>, a new park owned jointly by Kentucky and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. Wetherby also brought national attention to Kentucky as prime hunting and fishing land by conducting his own personal sporting excursions in the state.

Wetherby tried to diversify the industries located in Kentucky to balance the state's primarily agrarian economy. He expanded the Agricultural and Industrial Development Board and charged it with conducting land surveys to identify potential industrial sites. He encouraged the development of modern airports in the state and supported the canalization of the <a href="Big%20Sandy%20River%20%28Ohio%20River%29">Big Sandy River</a> and improvement of the <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">locks and dams</a> on the Kentucky River. He continued to personally lead tours given by the state's Chamber of Commerce. Among the industries that came to the state during his administration were the <a href="General%20Electric%20Appliance%20Park">General Electric Appliance Park</a> in Louisville and the <a href="Paducah%20Gaseous%20Diffusion%20Plant">Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant</a> in <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah</a>. In 1954, he used the state police to quash labor unrest in <a href="Central%20City%2C%20Kentucky">Central City</a> and other parts of the <a href="Western%20Coal%20Fields">Western Coal Fields</a>. He was not a pawn of industry, however: he secured passage of the state's first laws regulating <a href="strip%20mining">strip mining</a> and killed a <a href="Right-to-work%20law">right-to-work bill</a> in 1954.

Neither did Wetherby ignore the needs of agriculture. Under his Green Pastures Program, measures were enacted to diversify crop production, improve beef production, and encourage <a href="soil%20conservation">soil conservation</a>. He secured federal flood control programs for the <a href="Drainage%20basin">watersheds</a> of the <a href="Salt%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Salt</a>, <a href="Licking%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Licking</a>, <a href="Green%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Green</a>, and Kentucky Rivers, saving valuable farmland. In 1952, Wetherby organized an agricultural council to consolidate the work of the state's agricultural <a href="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a>. He oversaw completion of the state fairgrounds in Louisville, a project begun under Clements, to better display the state's agricultural products.

Improvements in education were a hallmark of Wetherby's term as governor. Over the course of his administration, he increased funding to education by $20 million. He called for the creation of an educational <a href="State%20network">television network</a> and initiated the state's first publicly funded <a href="bookmobile">bookmobile</a> program. He supported the 1954 Minimum Foundation Program, an amendment to the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">state constitution</a> that allowed funding to be allocated to school districts based upon need rather than number of pupils.

In 1954 and 1955 Wetherby served as chairman of the Southern Governors Conference and urged the southern governors to peacefully implement <a href="desegregation">desegregation</a> as required by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court's</a> decision in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>". He was one of five southern governors that refused to sign a statement opposing integration. In Kentucky, he appointed an advisory council of both <a href="White%20people">white</a> and <a href="African-American">black</a> citizens to oversee public school integration, which was accomplished with little acrimony compared to other states. Desegregation was one issue where Wetherby and his lieutenant governor, <a href="Emerson%20Beauchamp">Emerson "Doc" Beauchamp</a>, disagreed, but because Beauchamp believed he would succeed Wetherby as governor, he did not openly oppose Wetherby's actions.

Among Wetherby's other accomplishments were the creation of a Department of Mental Health and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children. He constructed new state prisons, modernized the <a href="probation">probation</a> and <a href="parole">parole</a> systems, and established a more orderly system of selecting <a href="grand%20jury">grand</a> and <a href="petit%20jury">petit</a> juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase <a href="voting%20machine">voting machine</a>s in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed in his efforts to amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">Kentucky's counties</a>. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections.

Both Clements and Wetherby endorsed <a href="Bert%20Combs">Bert Combs</a> to succeed Wetherby as governor. Wetherby had named Combs to the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> in 1951 to fill a vacancy created by the death of Judge Roy Helm. Happy Chandler, Clements' old foe, ran against Combs in the primary and painted him as a pawn of "Clementine" and "Wetherbine", his derogatory nicknames for Clements and Wetherby. In fact, Chandler ran the entire campaign not just against Combs, but against Clements and Wetherby as well. He charged both Clements and Wetherby with extravagant spending in their administrations. Among his allegations were that Clements had purchased a $20,000 rug for his office and that Wetherby had paneled his office with African <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a>. Chandler promised that, if elected, he would use "good, honest Kentucky wood" in his office and that all Kentuckians would be invited to the capitol to walk on the $20,000 rug. Ultimately, invoices showed that no $20,000 rug had been purchased by Clements, and Wetherby's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a local contractor. Chandler's charges may have been inaccurate, but he defeated Combs in the primary and went on to win the general election.

Following his term as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a> unexpectedly died of a heart attack. The timing of his death meant that the state would elect two senators in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a> to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the state would help his own re-election bid. Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor.

Neither Wetherby nor Clements enjoyed the support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, <a href="Party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Senate Majority Leader</a> <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> suffered a heart attack during the campaign, and as <a href="Assistant%20party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">majority whip</a>, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took him away from the campaign trail for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to <a href="Thruston%20Ballard%20Morton">Thruston Ballard Morton</a> by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.

After this defeat, Wetherby moved to <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Franklin County</a> and secured a position at Brighton Engineering with help from his old primary opponent, Bill May. From 1964 to 1966, he was a delegate to an assembly charged with revising the state constitution. In 1965, May backed Wetherby in his campaign for the Kentucky Senate. He won the election, defeating the candidate favored by Chandler, and was chosen <a href="President%20Pro%20Tempore%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20Senate">president of that body</a> from 1966 to 1968. He was so effective in this position that the state's 1966 budget was debated for only ten days before passing by a vote of 31–5 in virtually the same form as it was presented.

After his service in the state senate, Wetherby returned to Brighton Engineering, where he eventually became a vice-president. He died March 27, 1994 of complications from a broken hip. He is buried at the <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a>. The administration building at <a href="Western%20Kentucky%20University">Western Kentucky University</a> and a gymnasium at <a href="Morehead%20State%20University">Morehead State University</a> were named in his honor.

City of Blinding Lights

"City of Blinding Lights" is a song by Irish <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="U2">U2</a>. It is the fifth track on their eleventh studio album, "<a href="How%20to%20Dismantle%20an%20Atomic%20Bomb">How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</a>" (2004), and was released as the album's fourth single on 6 June 2005. The song reached number one in Spain, and peaked in the top ten in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and several other countries. The music video was shot at the <a href="General%20Motors%20Place">General Motors Place</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada.

The earliest incarnation of the song was developed during sessions for the band's 1997 album, "<a href="Pop%20%28U2%20album%29">Pop</a>". The lyrics were written by the band's lead vocalist <a href="Bono">Bono</a>, taking partial inspiration from his recollection of his first trip to London, and from the band's experience playing in New York City in the aftermath of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> during their <a href="Elevation%20Tour">Elevation Tour</a> in 2001. Other lyrics refer to Bono's relationship with his wife <a href="Ali%20Hewson">Ali</a> The song's underlying theme reflects lost innocence and was inspired by an image Bono saw of himself from the early 1980s. The sound has been compared to the tone of U2's 1984 album, "<a href="The%20Unforgettable%20Fire">The Unforgettable Fire</a>" and their 1987 single "<a href="Where%20the%20Streets%20Have%20No%20Name">Where the Streets Have No Name</a>."

"City of Blinding Lights" was well received by critics and won a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Song">Best Rock Song</a> at the <a href="48th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2006 ceremony</a>. The song made its live debut on the group's 2005-2006 <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a>, when it was commonly played as the opening song, and it has been performed at nearly every show from a U2 concert tour since. The track has been used in episodes of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" and "<a href="Entourage%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Entourage</a>", and in the film "<a href="The%20Devil%20Wears%20Prada%20%28film%29">The Devil Wears Prada</a>".

Former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> used the song at his <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">campaign events</a> during the <a href="2008%20US%20presidential%20election">2008</a> and <a href="2012%20US%20presidential%20election">2012</a> U.S. presidential elections, and listed it as one of his favourite songs; U2 performed it at his at the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a>.

U2 developed "City of Blinding Lights" from a song called "Scott Walker," an outtake from the band's 1997 album "<a href="Pop%20%28U2%20album%29">Pop</a>". This incarnation, written as an homage to the singer <a href="Scott%20Walker%20%28singer%29">of the same name</a>, was only an outline when the recording sessions for "Pop" concluded. The group reworked it in preparation for their 2000 album "<a href="All%20That%20You%20Can%27t%20Leave%20Behind">All That You Can't Leave Behind</a>", but the song was still unfinished when that album was released. They rewrote the song for their 2004 album "<a href="How%20to%20Dismantle%20an%20Atomic%20Bomb">How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</a>". Bassist <a href="Adam%20Clayton">Adam Clayton</a> said, "There was a melody and a groove that ultimately didn't go anywhere and we kind of threw out everything, found chords that worked with that melody and built it back up, new drum parts, new bass parts, new guitars."
A photographic exhibition in the Netherlands by longtime band photographer <a href="Anton%20Corbijn">Anton Corbijn</a> served as a thematic inspiration for the song. Lead vocalist <a href="Bono">Bono</a> saw an image of himself boarding a helicopter, taken in 1982 during filming of the music video for "<a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day%20%28U2%20song%29">New Year's Day."</a> A journalist asked him what he would say to his younger self if given the chance; Bono replied, "I'd tell him he's absolutely right and stop second guessing himself." He explained his comments later, saying, "I realized how much I'd lost ... that way of looking at the world. There was such a clarity to it, but it was so defiant in a way."

The chorus was inspired by U2's first concert in New York City following the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> during their 2001 <a href="Elevation%20Tour">Elevation Tour</a>. When the lights illuminated the audience during a performance of "<a href="Where%20the%20Streets%20Have%20No%20Name">Where the Streets Have No Name</a>," the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans. Upon seeing this raw release of emotion, Bono shouted, "Oh you look so beautiful tonight"; later, the band integrated the line into the chorus. The fans' passion, along with the resolve of the city following the attack, were the primary inspirations for many of the song's other lyrics.
"City of Blinding Lights" is played in <a href="Time%20signature">common time</a> at a <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 139 beats per minute in two <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a>s: <a href="A%E2%99%AD%20major">A♭ major</a> in the verses, and <a href="E%E2%99%AD%20major">E♭ major</a> in the chorus.

The album version of the song runs for 5:47. It begins with a low note played on an electric guitar with heavy <a href="Delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a> and <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">distortion</a>. The note is <a href="sustain">sustain</a>ed for ten seconds as its <a href="harmonics">harmonics</a> gradually <a href="audio%20feedback">feed back</a>. A pulsing <a href="rhythm%20guitar">rhythm guitar</a> part with <a href="Damping%20%28music%29">muted</a> <a href="staccato">staccato</a> chords by <a href="the%20Edge">the Edge</a> then begins underneath. After a further ten seconds it is joined by lower-register guitar drones played by the Edge, and a repetition of four descending piano notes performed by the Edge and Bono. Forty-five seconds into the song, halfway through the introduction, Clayton's bass and percussion by drummer <a href="Larry%20Mullen%2C%20Jr.">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> fade into the song with producer <a href="Jacknife%20Lee">Jacknife Lee</a>'s synthesizers, which play part of the melody line. The first verse begins at 1:20 and is accompanied by the bass, drums and rhythm guitar playing the <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> A–E–<a href="D%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">D</a>. This alters to <a href="B%20%28musical%20note%29">B</a>–D in the <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29%23Pre-chorus">pre-chorus</a>, with a short harmony vocal line leading to the E–D chorus.

After the second chorus, the lead guitar alternates with Bono's repeated "Time" into the <a href="B%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">B</a>–A <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> before returning to an extended chorus. The vocals <a href="Scientific%20pitch%20notation">range</a> from D3 in the verses to a peak of <a href="C%20%28musical%20note%29">C</a>5 in the chorus. The Edge provides <a href="backing%20vocals">backing vocals</a> in the second verse, the first three chorus lines, and the bridge lyric "Time won't leave me as I am / Time won't take the boy out of this man". There is no chorus after the third verse; instead, the track enters into a <a href="Coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> where, after restating the introductory piano theme, the guitar, bass, and drum parts come to a finish. The song concludes on a final reprise of the piano notes. The radio edit, with a run-time of 4:11, is 1:36 shorter than the album version. The introduction is half the length and the bass and drums enter after only two repetitions of the piano notes. The first two verses are kept intact but the bridge is shortened by seven seconds, removing two calls of "Time." The third verse is cut and the coda shortened by twenty seconds.

The sound of "City of Blinding Lights" has been compared to U2's 1987 single "Where the Streets Have No Name," prompted by a similar style of guitar playing, as well as to the atmospheric tone of the band's 1984 album "<a href="The%20Unforgettable%20Fire">The Unforgettable Fire</a>". The melding of guitar and piano in the introduction was likened by the "<a href="Edmonton%20Journal">Edmonton Journal</a>" to the <a href="Coldplay">Coldplay</a> song "<a href="Clocks%20%28song%29">Clocks."</a> "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" described the song as "building into a bittersweet lament", while "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" said it was "beautiful but slightly sinister", comparing the quality of the lyrics to the <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> song "<a href="The%20Inner%20Light%20%28song%29">The Inner Light."</a>

The underlying theme of "City of Blinding Lights," reflected in the chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at <a href="Empire%E2%80%93Fulton%20Ferry%20State%20Park">Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park</a> under the <a href="Brooklyn%20Bridge">Brooklyn Bridge</a>; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about the first time the band arrived in New York City, calling it "a song about innocence and naïvete." Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, <a href="Ali%20Hewson">Alison Stewart</a>, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through <a href="Piccadilly%20Circus">Piccadilly Circus</a> and along <a href="Wardour%20Street">Wardour Street</a> put him in mind of "discovering what a big city could offer you and what it could take away." Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.

Like many other U2 songs, "City of Blinding Lights" can be interpreted in a religious manner. Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt he felt about his convictions on politics, marriage, and faith as he aged, concluding that a person's confidence in their beliefs makes it seem as if they know more than they do. Music critic Bill Friskics-Warren felt that the final line, "Blessings not just for the ones who kneel, luckily", was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough, and was an attack on Christianity because "faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries." Steve Stockman, a chaplain at <a href="Queen%27s%20University%20of%20Belfast">Queen's University of Belfast</a>, believed the song was a metaphor for growing up, and that the final line meant that not just people of faith could be blessed.

<a href="Promotional%20recording">Promotional singles</a> were released in the United Kingdom and United States in April 2005. The UK release featured the "Paradise Soul" mix, <a href="Paul%20Epworth">Paul Epworth</a>'s "Phones P.D.A. in N.Y.C." mix, and the "Killahurtz Fly" mix of "<a href="All%20Because%20of%20You%20%28U2%20song%29">All Because of You</a>" on a <a href="12-inch%20single">12-inch record</a>, and the U.S. release contained the album version and the radio edit on a CD. "City of Blinding Lights" was released internationally as the fourth single from "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" on 6 June 2005, following "<a href="Vertigo%20%28U2%20song%29">Vertigo</a>" in November 2004 and the joint release of "<a href="Sometimes%20You%20Can%27t%20Make%20It%20on%20Your%20Own">Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own</a>" and "All Because of You" in February 2005.

Three major versions of the single were released, including two <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a>s and one <a href="DVD%20single">DVD single</a>. Additionally, a <a href="mini%20CD%20single">mini CD single</a> was released in Europe, and a separate CD single containing all four tracks from CD1 and CD2 was released in Japan. The "<a href="Hot%20Chip">Hot Chip</a> 2006" remix of the song was included on the 2010 compilation album "<a href="Artificial%20Horizon%20%28album%29">Artificial Horizon</a>".

The Killahurtz Fly mix of "All Because of You" was remixed by the team of Mick Park and Lea Kenny. The song features additional bass and guitars played by Darren Murray. The live versions of "<a href="The%20Fly%20%28song%29">The Fly</a>" and "<a href="Even%20Better%20Than%20the%20Real%20Thing">Even Better Than the Real Thing</a>" were recorded at the <a href="Sellafield%23Music">Stop Sellafield</a> concert staged by <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> at the <a href="Manchester%20Central%20%28Conference%20Centre%29">G-Mex Centre</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> on 19 June 1992. Videos of these performances would later be included as bonus tracks on the DVD release of "". The rendition of "<a href="Three%20%28U2%20EP%29">Out of Control</a>" was taken from a <a href="How%20to%20Dismantle%20an%20Atomic%20Bomb%23Promotion">promotional concert</a>, the band played at the <a href="Empire%20%E2%80%93%20Fulton%20Ferry%20State%20Park">Empire – Fulton Ferry State Park</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York City on 22 November 2004; the live video of "City of Blinding Lights" on the DVD release was taken from the same concert. The music video for "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own", directed by <a href="Phil%20Joanou">Phil Joanou</a>, was also included on the DVD.

The <a href="music%20video">music video</a> for "City of Blinding Lights" was shot at the <a href="General%20Motors%20Place">General Motors Place</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> on 27 April 2005, and was directed by <a href="Alex%20and%20Martin">Alex Courtes and Martin Fougerol</a>. The video included additional footage from the band's <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a> concert of 28 April 2005. Planning for the project began as soon as U2 became aware the arena was available (a result of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">NHL lockout of 2004–2005</a>). <a href="Band%20manager">Manager</a> <a href="Paul%20McGuinness">Paul McGuinness</a> believed selecting Vancouver as the filming location made a lot of sense, saying, "[i]t's a world-renowned production centre. We knew we'd be able to get the crews and camera people and equipment here." Members of the public were invited to be part of the video via radio and internet announcements. Word of the shoot leaked before the official announcement, which led to fans lining up outside for the entire day. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people were allowed in for the filming. During the shoot, U2 performed "City of Blinding Lights" multiple times, followed by "Vertigo," "All Because of You" and "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own."

The video shows the band playing the song on the Vertigo Tour concert stage. The live audio is kept to demonstrate the imperfections and emotion in the performance. The lighting is kept low, drawing attention to the visuals on the LED curtains used throughout the tour and obscuring much of the band members' facial features in shadow. Courtes and Fougerol explained: "we wanted to reflect the mood we've seen at the concerts, so we played with that lighting knowing that you are more blinded from a light if it was darker before".

"City of Blinding Lights" was performed on every night of the <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a>, opening 86 of the 131 concerts and a public dress rehearsal immediately before its launch. Performances frequently began with <a href="confetti">confetti</a> falling from the ceiling, serving as a bridge to engage the audience. The song made extensive use of the stage's LED curtains for its visual effects; "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" noted that "they do a fine imitation of <a href="Shinjuku%2C%20Tokyo">Shinjuku</a> on speed, and the lighting design for 'City of Blinding Lights' takes advantage of that ... the visual effect manages to be far more the sum of its parts." The "<a href="Vancouver%20Sun">Vancouver Sun</a>" described the result as "akin to a busy street at night through a misted windshield", later saying it provided "a theme for the night – the sparse, elegant stage was constantly bathed in vivid colours". During the Vertigo Tour, the piano introduction was played by Adam Clayton on a keyboard. Sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy believed Clayton's bass in the live setting to be "the driving implement that pushes the sound along".

"City of Blinding Lights" was played on every night of the <a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20Tour">U2 360° Tour</a>, in each case appearing approximately halfway through the set. The lighting effects used on the U2 360° Tour video screen emulate the LED curtain visuals of the Vertigo Tour and were described as "psychedelic" by <a href="Edna%20Gundersen">Edna Gundersen</a> of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>". It is one of a handful of songs to utilize the <a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20Tour%23Conception%20and%20stage%20design">fully descended video screen</a>.

With the exception of two shows early in the tour, the song was played at every date of the 2015 <a href="Innocence%20%2B%20Experience%20Tour">Innocence + Experience Tour</a>, typically opening the encore. The lighting effects utilised the numerous fluorescent tubes set around the stage, while the video screen showed cityscapes at night superimposed with the band members performances. The song reappeared in a regular slot closing out the main set of that tour's companion, the 2018 <a href="Experience%20%2B%20Innocence%20Tour">Experience + Innocence Tour</a>, with a similar visual presentation. One reviewer called the presentation a "veritable explosion of light effects". The main set finale role held special importance due to the fact that all of the songs from "<a href="The%20Joshua%20Tree">The Joshua Tree</a>", including "<a href="Where%20the%20Streets%20Have%20No%20Name">Where the Streets Have No Name</a>", were removed from the Experience + Innocence Tour, having just been played in sequence during the intervening <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20Tour%202017">Joshua Tree Tour 2017</a>. Clayton said, "I think ending [the main set] on 'City Of Blinding Lights,' lyrically it has an interesting through line which relates to innocence, in a way. I mean, there is a reading of that ... in terms of saying goodbye to certain parts of yourself, that just connects [to the overall innocence and experience theme] in a way. And it's a lovely, contemporary, modern piece of music. We think that will take on some of the emotional weight of 'Streets'."

Live performances of the song appear on the DVDs "" and "<a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20at%20the%20Rose%20Bowl">U2 360° at the Rose Bowl</a>", the bonus disc of "", and on the 2005 U2.com subscriber's release "<a href="U2.COMmunication">U2.COMmunication</a>". The "U2.COMmunication" version is an audio rip of the performance from "Vertigo 2005: Live from Chicago".

Reception to "City of Blinding Lights" was positive. Reviewing the album, <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> editor <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> said the song had "huge melodic and sonic hooks" and labelled it one of "the ingredients that make "How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb" a very good U2 record." "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" felt the song demonstrated the band's ability to "make pop-chart lust work for them." <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> reviewer <a href="Amanda%20Petrusich">Amanda Petrusich</a> thought it was one of the album's highlights, calling it "an earnest and galactic fight song, and the sort of track that's best enjoyed in cars and airplanes, simply because it encites so much giddy movement."

<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> opined, "U2 sounds updated ... the bombast stays in check and Bono's questions sound earnest without being overzealous," though felt it "lack[s] the musical and lyrical guts of '<a href="Pride%20%28In%20the%20Name%20of%20Love%29">Pride (In the Name of Love)</a>' or '<a href="Sunday%20Bloody%20Sunday%20%28song%29">Sunday Bloody Sunday</a>.'" Rating the song three stars out of five, "Uncut" reviewer Stephen Dalton wrote it was "indebted to the sky-punching peaks, grand vistas and monochrome emotions of the band's 1980s albums", deeming it a "heart-stirring anthem." Peter Murphy called it "the album's masterpiece" in his review for "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>", describing the opening as "little short of celestial." At the <a href="48th%20Grammy%20Awards">48th Grammy Awards</a> in 2006, "City of Blinding Lights" won the award for the <a href="Best%20Rock%20Song">Best Rock Song</a>. In a 2010 survey conducted by fan site atU2.com, 1080 of 4814 participants (22.43%) labelled it their favourite song on the album, ranking it first on the list. Previous fan surveys in 2005, 2006, and 2007 had also ranked the song the most favoured from the album.

"City of Blinding Lights" reached number two in the <a href="Canadian%20Singles%20Chart">Canadian</a> and <a href="Danish%20Singles%20Chart">Danish</a> singles charts and peaked at number eight in Ireland. It charted in the Top 75 in the United Kingdom for nine weeks, peaking at number two and ranking number 113 on the year-end charts. In Spain, the song spent two weeks at number one on the <a href="Spanish%20Singles%20Chart">Spanish Singles Chart</a>, and remained there for a total of 16 weeks. In the Netherlands, the song peaked at number three, and spent 15 weeks on the chart. In Australia, the song peaked at number 31 on the <a href="Australian%20Singles%20Chart">Australian Singles Chart</a>, and spent two weeks on the chart. In the United States it cracked the "<a href="Billboard%20charts">Billboard</a>" Adult Top 40 chart at number 40. Over 331,000 digital copies of the track have been sold as of June 2010.

The song featured in the 2006 film "<a href="The%20Devil%20Wears%20Prada%20%28film%29">The Devil Wears Prada</a>" during the scene where Andy arrives in Paris. Director <a href="David%20Frankel">David Frankel</a> first used the song in a montage of pre-production scenes he shot on location in the city; the song fit the images so well that he decided to include it in the film. The film's use of the song was parodied in the 2009 "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" episode "<a href="The%20Devil%20Wears%20Nada">The Devil Wears Nada</a>"; "City of Blinding Lights" is played briefly as <a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer</a> and <a href="Lenny%20and%20Carl%23Carl%20Carlson">Carl</a> arrive in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. The song was featured in "I Love You Too," a 2005 episode of the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> series "<a href="Entourage%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Entourage</a>". In the sequence, U2 performs the song at a concert and Bono wishes a happy birthday to <a href="Johnny%20%26quot%3BDrama%26quot%3B%20Chase">Johnny Chase</a>. American sports network <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> used "City of Blinding Lights" in their <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2006 FIFA World Cup</a> television commercials; the piece, titled "Anthem," featured narration about the sport by Bono, which was set against a montage of children playing <a href="Association%20football">football</a> across the globe and . ESPN used the track for a second time in January 2010 in commercials for the <a href="2010%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">2010 FIFA World Cup</a>, causing weekly online sales of the track to double from the month prior. In 2008, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> used "City of Blinding Lights" for the fourth wake up call of <a href="STS-126">STS-126</a>. The song was played for Mission Specialist <a href="Shane%20Kimbrough">Shane Kimbrough</a>. The song was used again on 3 March 2011 for the eighth wake up call of <a href="STS-133">STS-133</a>; it was played for all of the crew members.

The track was used by <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> as the entrance theme for his <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20primary%20campaign%2C%202008">presidential candidacy announcement</a> in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>, on 10 February 2007, and it was played before his acceptance speech at the <a href="2008%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2008 Democratic National Convention</a>. Obama frequently used it as the lead-in as he took the stage for campaign events during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008 U.S. presidential election</a>, a spectacle that even convinced one student to vote for him, and played it on primary night rallies with supporters. In August 2008, Obama listed "City of Blinding Lights" as one of his ten favourite songs. In his dissertation, music student Jacob Charron speculated that the music used by Obama on the campaign trail was selected because it would not upset the older voters and would be recognizable to the younger voters. The song was also valuable for its global image, ringing guitar line, and suggestions of awakening.

U2 performed the song, along with "Pride (In the Name of Love)," to upwards of 400,000 people on 18 January 2009 at the concert at the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a> to celebrate the upcoming <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Barack%20Obama">inauguration of Obama</a>. Introducing "City of Blinding Lights," which the band were asked to play, Bono spoke directly to Obama, saying, "What a thrill for four Irish boys from the northside of Dublin to honour you, sir, the next President of the United States, Barack Obama, for choosing this song to be part of the soundtrack of your campaign, and more besides." Bono modified the first verse to reference the surroundings, singing "America, let your road rise / Under Lincoln's unblinking eyes" in place of "Neon hearts, dayglo eyes / A city lit by fireflies," gave a shout-out to vice presidential inauguree <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> at the end of the verse, and changed a part of the chorus to proclaim "America's getting ready to leave the ground."

Keen Johnson

Keen Johnson (January 12, 1896February 7, 1970) was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">45th</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor of Kentucky</a>, serving from 1939 to 1943; being the only journalist to have held that office. After serving in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Johnson purchased and edited the "Elizabethtown Mirror" newspaper. He revived the struggling paper, sold it to a competitor and used the profits to obtain his journalism degree from the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a> in 1922. After graduation, he became editor of "<a href="The%20Anderson%20News">The Anderson News</a>", and in 1925, he accepted an offer to co-publish and edit the "<a href="Richmond%20Register">Richmond Daily Register</a>".

In 1935, Johnson was chosen as the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nominee for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a>. He was elected and served under Governor <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a> from 1935 to 1939. He had already secured the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1939 when Chandler resigned and elevated Johnson to governor so that Johnson could appoint Chandler to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> seat vacated by the death of <a href="M.%20M.%20Logan">M. M. Logan</a>. He went on to win a full gubernatorial term in the general election, defeating <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="King%20Swope">King Swope</a>. Johnson's desire to expand the state's social services was hampered by the financial strain imposed on the state by the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Nevertheless, he ran a fiscally conservative administration and took the state from being $7 million in debt to having a surplus of $10 million by the end of his term.

Following his term as governor, Johnson joined <a href="Reynolds%20Metals">Reynolds Metals</a> as a special assistant to the president. He continued his employment with Reynolds until 1961. He took a year-long <a href="leave%20of%20absence">leave of absence</a> in 1946 to accept President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>'s appointment as the first U.S. <a href="Undersecretary%20of%20Labor">Undersecretary of Labor</a>, serving under <a href="Lewis%20B.%20Schwellenbach">Lewis B. Schwellenbach</a>. He unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1960, losing to incumbent Republican <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a>. He died February 7, 1970, and was buried in Richmond Cemetery in Richmond, Kentucky.

Keen Johnson was born in a two-room cabin at Brandon's Chapel in <a href="Lyon%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Lyon County, Kentucky</a>, on January 12, 1896. He was the only son of Reverend Robert and Mattie (Holloway) Johnson. His parents named him in honor of John S. Keen, a family friend from <a href="Adair%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Adair County</a>. The Johnsons also had two daughters—Catherine (Keturah) and Christine. Robert Johnson was a <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> minister, and the family moved often as a result of his occupation.

After completing his elementary education in the public schools, Johnson attended Vanderbilt Preparatory School for Boys, a Methodist institution in <a href="Elkton%2C%20Kentucky">Elkton, Kentucky</a>. He finished his preparatory coursework in 1914 and matriculated to <a href="Central%20Methodist%20College">Central Methodist College</a> in <a href="Fayette%2C%20Missouri">Fayette, Missouri</a>. He had intended to continue his studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Missouri">University of Missouri</a> School of Journalism, but he interrupted his studies to enlist in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> for service in World War I.

After <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Basic%20Training">basic training</a>, Johnson entered <a href="officer%20training">officer training</a> at <a href="Fort%20Riley">Fort Riley</a> on May 15, 1917. In August 1917, he was appointed <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> and assigned to the 354th Infantry, <a href="89th%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">89th Division</a> of the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Forces">American Expeditionary Forces</a> at <a href="Camp%20Funston">Camp Funston</a>. He was promoted to <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> on March 29, 1918, and on June 4, 1918, he was deployed to France, where he studied logistical communications at the Army School of the Line and Staff College. He remained in Europe with the American Expeditionary Force until April 1919 and was <a href="honorable%20discharge">honorably discharged</a> from the Army on October 31, 1919.

On June 23, 1917, while still completing his military training, Johnson married Eunice Nichols. Their only child, a daughter named Judith, was born May 19, 1927. Upon his return from military service, Johnson purchased the "<a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky">Elizabethtown</a> Mirror" with financial assistance from his father. He built the struggling paper almost from the ground up, and a competitor soon bought him out for a profit. Johnson used the profit from the sale of the "Mirror" to continue his education at the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>. While a student, he worked as a reporter for the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald</a>". He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism in 1922. The university awarded him an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> degree in 1940.

After graduation, Johnson purchased half-ownership of "<a href="The%20Anderson%20News">The Anderson News</a>" and served as the paper's editor and publisher. In 1925, Shelton M. Saufley asked Johnson to enter into a joint venture to purchase the "<a href="Richmond%20Register">Richmond Daily Register</a>". Lured by the idea of publishing a daily paper, Johnson accepted. As a result of one of his editorials, Johnson was named executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee in 1932. He continued to hold this position and publish the "Register" through 1939.

In 1935, Johnson was one of three contenders for the Democratic nomination for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a>. In the <a href="primary%20election">primary</a>, he received more votes than his opponents, J. E. Wise and B. F. Wright, but a newly enacted election law required a <a href="runoff%20election">runoff</a> if no candidate received a <a href="majority">majority</a>. On September 7, Johnson defeated Wise in the runoff.

In the gubernatorial primary, <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a> defeated <a href="Tom%20Rhea">Tom Rhea</a>, the candidate favored by sitting governor <a href="Ruby%20Laffoon">Ruby Laffoon</a>. Johnson had also favored Rhea, and had backed Robert T. Crowe over <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a>, Chandler's choice in the 1927 Democratic primary. Nevertheless, the two put aside their differences and won the general election. Chandler defeated <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="King%20Swope">King Swope</a> by over 95,000 votes, and Johnson defeated <a href="J.%20J.%20Kavanaugh">J. J. Kavanaugh</a> by over 100,000 votes.

The division between Chandler and Laffoon led to factionalism within the state Democratic Party. When no strong gubernatorial candidate emerged from the Chandler faction in 1939, Chandler threw his support behind Johnson. <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Sr.">John Y. Brown, Sr.</a> announced he would challenge Johnson in the primary. This solidified the Chandler faction's support, as Brown was an outspoken critic of the Chandler administration. Brown gained the support of Chandler critics, notably former governor Ruby Laffoon, Tom Rhea, <a href="Earle%20C.%20Clements">Earle C. Clements</a>, and <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a>. He further garnered the support of the <a href="United%20Mine%20Workers">United Mine Workers</a> and labor boss <a href="John%20L.%20Lewis">John L. Lewis</a>. It was to no avail, as Johnson defeated Brown in the primary by over 33,000 votes to secure the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
The Republicans chose King Swope, the loser in the 1935 gubernatorial election, to oppose Johnson. In the middle of the campaign, however, Johnson was elevated to governor. United States Senator <a href="M.%20M.%20Logan">M. M. Logan</a> died in October 1939, and Governor Chandler resigned so that Johnson—thus elevated to governor—could appoint him to the vacant seat. In the general election on November 17, Johnson defeated Swope 460,834 to 354,704, securing a full term as governor.

In his inaugural address, Johnson promised to be "a saving, thrifty, frugal governor". His policies helped him eliminate the state's debt of $7 million and left the treasury with a surplus of $10 million by the end of his term. It was the first time the state had had a surplus since the administration of J. C. W. Beckham in 1903. Johnson achieved the surplus without enacting any tax increases. Not all in Johnson's party were happy with his approach to governing; one critic noted, "Old Keen frugaled here and frugaled there till he damn near frugaled us to death."

"<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" reporter Howard Henderson wrote several stories exposing corruption in Johnson's administration, including a significant one dealing with laundry contracts. Hubert Meredith, Johnson's politically ambitious <a href="Kentucky%20Attorney%20General">attorney general</a>, freely aired his concerns about the administration, gaining recognition for himself from the publicity generated. Historian <a href="James%20C.%20Klotter">James C. Klotter</a> opined "It is doubtful whether Johnson's administration had any more political scandal than others, but the publicity made it seem that way."

In the 1940 legislative session, Johnson successfully lobbied the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> to allocate money to a teacher retirement system that had previously been authorized but left unfunded. Despite his fiscally conservative nature, he increased funds to programs to assist the elderly by $1 million per year. Other accomplishments of the session included the provision of pensions for justices on the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, creation of soil conservation districts in the state, and banning the sale of <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>.

Johnson's primary interest lay in improving the state's mental and penal institutions. These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years by the end of his term, he was disappointed that he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.

In the 1941 legislative session, Johnson vetoed a measure allowing the sale of alcoholic beverages to surrounding states, even those with laws forbidding alcohol sales. The bill was very popular, and was supported by many of the state's powerful special interests. It had passed the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> by a vote of 84–0 and the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a> by a vote of 31–3. After Johnson's veto, the House reversed itself, voting 86–3 to sustain the veto.

In the 1942 legislative session, Johnson stressed the importance of allowing Kentucky cities to purchase and distribute power from the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>. In an address to the Assembly, Johnson declared, "I have never had a stronger conviction on a question of public policy... The principle involved is as correct as the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>." The Assembly passed the necessary legislation as Johnson requested.

A major accomplishment of the Johnson administration was the passage of a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> requires redistricting after every <a href="United%20States%20Census">decennial census</a>, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session for the sole purpose of considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.

Johnson took an active part in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1943. Among the candidates were Ben Kilgore, <a href="Rodes%20K.%20Myers">Rodes K. Myers</a>, and <a href="J.%20Lyter%20Donaldson">J. Lyter Donaldson</a>. Myers was Johnson's lieutenant governor, but he had turned on the administration. Johnson called him a <a href="carpetbagger">carpetbagger</a> from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, "a political adventurer", and "a phony farmer". He also ridiculed Kilgore, who had strong support from the "Louisville Courier-Journal", the Rural Electric Association, and the Farm Bureau, by calling him a "<a href="Casanova">Casanova</a>". Donaldson, Johnson's former campaign manager, secured his support and the Democratic nomination. He was defeated in the general election by Republican <a href="Simeon%20Willis">Simeon Willis</a>.

Beginning in 1940, Johnson was a member of the State Democratic National Committee, serving until 1948. On June 6, 1942, he was named to the board of regents of Eastern State College (now <a href="Eastern%20Kentucky%20University">Eastern Kentucky University</a> or EKU), a position he held for eight years. EKU's Keen Johnson Building, a 1939 <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> project, was named in honor of him. The building and its clock tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks on the university's campus.

Johnson developed a strong rapport with union leaders and in 1946, President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> and Kentucky Senator Alben Barkley asked him to accept an appointment to the newly created post of <a href="United%20States%20Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20Labor">Undersecretary of Labor</a>. In August 1946, Johnson took a <a href="leave%20of%20absence">leave of absence</a> from Reynolds and accepted the appointment. He frequently attended President Truman's cabinet meetings due to the illness of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Labor">Secretary</a> <a href="Lewis%20B.%20Schwellenbach">Lewis B. Schwellenbach</a>.

In mid-1947, Johnson returned to Reynolds. In 1950, he became a member of the company's board of directors. In this capacity, he organized meetings of sales executives and traveled extensively to promote the company's aluminum products. He retired from Reynolds in January 1961.

In 1960, Johnson sought a seat in the U.S. Senate. He defeated John Y.

Omayra Sánchez

Omayra Sánchez Garzón (August 28, 1972 – November 16, 1985) was a 13-year-old Colombian girl killed in <a href="Armero">Armero</a>, <a href="Tolima%20Department">Tolima</a>, by the <a href="Armero%20tragedy">1985 eruption</a> of the <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a> volcano. Volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s (volcanically induced <a href="mudflow">mudflow</a>s, <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s, and <a href="debris%20flow">debris flow</a>s) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.

After a lahar demolished her home, Sánchez was pinned beneath the debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely as a result of either <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a> or <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.

A photograph of Sánchez taken by the photojournalist <a href="Frank%20Fournier">Frank Fournier</a> shortly before she died was published in news outlets around the world. It was later designated the <a href="World%20Press%20Photo%20of%20the%20Year">World Press Photo of the Year</a> for 1985. Sánchez has remained a lasting figure in popular culture, remembered through music, literature, and commemorative articles.

On November 13, 1985, the <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a> volcano erupted. At 9:09 pm of that night, <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s exploding from the crater melted the mountain's icecap, forming lahars (volcanic mudflows and debris flows) which cascaded into river valleys below. One lahar, consisting of three pulses, did most of the damage. Traveling at per second, the first pulse enveloped most of the town of <a href="Armero">Armero</a>, killing up to 20,000 people; the two later pulses weakened buildings. Another lahar killed 1,800 people in nearby <a href="Chinchin%C3%A1%2C%20Caldas">Chinchiná</a>. In total 23,000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to Armero were destroyed.

Loss of life was exacerbated by the authorities' failure to take costly preventive measures in the absence of clear signs of imminent danger. There had been no substantial eruption of the volcano since 1845, which contributed to complacency; locals called the volcano the "Sleeping Lion".

In September 1985, as earthquakes and <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic eruption</a>s rocked the area around the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October; it highlighted the danger from falling ash and <a href="volcanic%20rock">rock</a> near <a href="Murillo%2C%20Tolima">Murillo</a>, <a href="Santa%20Isabel%2C%20Tolima">Santa Isabel</a>, and <a href="L%C3%ADbano%2C%20Tolima">Líbano</a>, as well as the threat of lahars in <a href="Mariquita%2C%20Tolima">Mariquita</a>, <a href="Armero-Guayabal">Guayabal</a>, Chinchiná, and Armero. The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk: many survivors had never heard of it, though several major newspapers had featured it. Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but had "met with strong opposition from economic interests." He said that the short time between the map's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution.

The Colombian Congress criticised scientific and <a href="civil%20defense">civil defense</a> agencies for scaremongering, and the government and army were preoccupied with the <a href="Colombian%20armed%20conflict%20%281964%E2%80%93present%29">guerrilla campaign</a> in <a href="Bogot%C3%A1">Bogotá</a>, the national capital, which was then at its height.

The death toll was increased by the lack of early warnings, unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars, and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano. Colombia's worst natural disaster, the <a href="Armero%20tragedy">Armero tragedy</a> (as it came to be known) was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of <a href="Mount%20Pel%C3%A9e">Mount Pelée</a>). It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD. Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history.

Omayra Sánchez lived in the neighborhood of Santander with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a> collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique and aunt María Adela Garzón. Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business. The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar. After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof. Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was "trapped up to her neck", while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.

For the first few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by concrete but got her hand through a crack in the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood over the course of a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.

Despite her predicament, Sánchez remained relatively positive: she sang to <a href="Germ%C3%A1n%20Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Barrag%C3%A1n">Germán Santa María Barragán</a>, a journalist who was working as a volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began <a href="hallucination">hallucinating</a>, saying that she did not want to be late for school, and mentioned a math exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a> or <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>.

Her brother survived the lahars; her father and aunt died. Her mother expressed her feelings about Omayra's death: "It is horrible, but we have to think about the living ... I will live for my son, who only lost a finger."

As the public became aware of Sánchez's situation through the media, her death became a symbol of the failure of officials to properly assist victims who could have been saved. Controversy broke out after descriptions of the shortages were released in newspapers, disproving what officials had previously indicated: that they had used the best of their supplies. Volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels, cutting tools, and stretchers ran out. The rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization. An unnamed police officer said that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized. Colombia's Minister of Defense, Miguel Uribe, said he "understood criticism of the rescue effort", but said that Colombia was "an undeveloped country" that did not "have that kind of equipment."

Frank Fournier, a French reporter who landed in Bogotá on November 15, took a photograph of Sánchez in her final days, titled "The Agony of Omayra Sánchez". When he reached Armero at dawn on the 16th, a farmer directed him to Sánchez, who by then had been trapped for nearly three days and was near-deserted. Fournier later described the town as "very haunting," with "eerie silence" punctuated by screaming. He said that he took the photograph feeling that he could only "report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl" in his attempt to publicize the disaster's need for relief efforts, feeling otherwise "powerless".

At the time, there was international awareness of the disaster. Sánchez was one of the victims at the center of the associated controversy over responsibility for the destructive aftermath. The image captured international attention. According to an unnamed BBC reporter, "Many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra's life." After the photo was published in "<a href="Paris%20Match">Paris Match</a>," many accused Fournier of being "a vulture." He responded, 
"I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it. ... I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country's leaders." The picture later won the <a href="World%20Press%20Photo%20of%20the%20Year">World Press Photo of the Year</a> for 1985.

The Armero catastrophe came shortly after the <a href="19th%20of%20April%20Movement">M-19</a> guerrilla group's raid and subsequent <a href="Palace%20of%20Justice%20siege">Palace of Justice siege</a> on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation. After Sánchez's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano's eruption.

The Nevado del Ruiz volcano is still active, according to the Volcano Watch Center in Colombia. Melting only 10 percent of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to —similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985. Such <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s can travel up to along river valleys in a few hours. Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk. The city of Armero no longer exists. The site was commemorated as a memorial with <a href="Christian%20cross">Christian cross</a>es and a small monument to Sánchez.

In the years following the eruption, Sánchez has been repeatedly commemorated, especially in newspapers like "El Tiempo". Many victims of the disaster were commemorated, but Sánchez in particular has attracted lasting attention in popular poetry, novels, and music.

For example, a <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> band formed in Chile in 2008 named themselves Omayra Sánchez; they express their "discontent that they feel with the negligence on the part of the people who in this day and age run the world". "Adiós, Omayra: La catástrofe de Armero" (1988), written by <a href="Eduardo%20Santa">Eduardo Santa</a> as a response to the eruption, depicts the girl's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe. In "No Morirás" (1994), Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero, nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house. <a href="Isabel%20Allende">Isabel Allende</a>'s <a href="short%20story">short story</a>, "And of Clay Are We Created" ("De barro estamos hechos"), is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home. Allende later wrote, "Her [Sánchez's] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me in my dreams. Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost."

To try to prevent repetition of such a disaster, the government of Colombia created the "Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres" (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the "Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres" (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness). All Colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters.

Anekantavada

According to <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the <a href="Absolute%20%28philosophy%29">absolute truth</a>. This knowledge ("<a href="Kevala%20Jnana">Kevala Jnana</a>"), it adds, is comprehended only by the <a href="Arihant%20%28Jainism%29">Arihants</a>. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. All knowledge claims, according to the "anekāntavāda" doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.

The origins of "anekāntavāda " can be traced back to the teachings of <a href="Mahavira">Mahāvīra</a> (599–527 <a href="BCE">BCE</a>), the 24th Jain . The <a href="dialectic">dialectic</a>al concepts of "syādvāda" "conditioned viewpoints" and "nayavāda" "partial viewpoints" arose from "anekāntavāda" in the medieval era, providing Jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression. The details of the doctrine emerged in Jainism in the 1st millennium CE, from debates between scholars of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of philosophies.

The word "anekāntavāda" is a compound of two <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> words: "anekānta" and "vāda". The word "anekānta" itself is composed of three root words, "an" (not), "eka" (one) and "anta" (end, side), together it connotes "not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness", or "manifoldness". The word "vāda" means "doctrine, way, speak, thesis". The term "anekāntavāda" is translated by scholars as the doctrine of "many-sidedness", "non-onesidedness", or "many pointedness".

The term "anekāntavāda" is not found in early texts considered canonical by Svetambara tradition of Jainism. However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Svetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the "<a href="Tattvarthasutra">Tattvarthasutra</a>" by Acharya Umaswami, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.

The Jain doctrine of "anekāntavāda", also known as "anekāntatva", states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is "naya", or "partial expression of the truth". Language is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around. One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is "syāt", or valid "in some respect" but it still remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete". In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.

The "anekāntavāda" premises of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the "Samaññaphala Sutta". The Jain āgamas suggest that Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" ("syāt"). These texts identify "anekāntavāda" doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Māhavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is" and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the absolute reality. "Syādvāda" (predication <a href="logic">logic</a>) and "Nayavāda" (perspective <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>) of Jainism expand on the concept of "anekāntavāda". "Syādvāda" recommends the expression of "anekānta" by prefixing the epithet "syād" to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.

The Jain doctrine of "anekāntavāda", according to Bimal Matilal, states that "no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation". For a metaphysical proposition to be true, according to Jainism, it must include one or more conditions ("syadvada") or limitations ("nayavada", standpoints).

"Syādvāda" () is the theory of "conditioned predication", the first part of which is derived from the Sanskrit word "syāt" (), which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb "as" (), 'to be', and which becomes "syād" when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with "sandhi". The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc. It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc. The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'. The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.

Syat can be translated into English as meaning "perchance, may be, perhaps" (it is). The use of the verb 'as' in the optative tense is found in the more ancient Vedic era literature in a similar sense. For example, sutra 1.4.96 of <a href="P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini">Panini</a>'s Astadhyayi explains it as signifying "a chance, maybe, probable".

In Jainism, however, "syadvada" and "anekanta" is not a theory of uncertainty, doubt or relative probabilities. Rather, it is "conditional yes or conditional approval" of any proposition, state Matilal and other scholars. This usage has historic precedents in classical Sanskrit literature, and particularly in other ancient Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) with the phrase "syad etat", meaning "let it be so, but", or "an answer that is 'neither yes nor no', provisionally accepting an opponent's viewpoint for a certain premise". This would be expressed in archaic English with the subjunctive: 'be it so', a direct translation of "syad etat". Traditionally, this debate methodology was used by Indian scholars to acknowledge the opponent's viewpoint, but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade the opponent of aspects not considered.

According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context "syadvada" does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism, rather it means "multiplicity or multiple possibilities". "Syat" in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is "neither yes nor no", but it connotes a "many sidedness" to any proposition with a sevenfold predication.

"Syādvāda" is a theory of qualified predication, states Koller. It states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways, because reality is many-sided. It is done so systematically in later Jain texts through "saptibhaṅgīnāya" or "<a href="Jaina%20seven-valued%20logic">the theory of sevenfold scheme</a>". These "saptibhaṅgī" seem to be have been first formulated in Jainism by the 5th or 6th century CE Svetambara scholar Mallavadin, and they are:

Each of these seven predicates state the Jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from the perspective of time, space, substance and mode. The phrase "syāt" declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance ("<a href="Dravya%20%28Jainism%29">dravya</a>"), place ("kṣetra"), time ("kāla"), and being ("bhāva"), and negation with regard to other substance ("dravya"), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being ("bhāva"). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance ("dravya") – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it simply is not. In regard to place ("kṣetra") – room, it simply is; terrace, it simply is not. In regard to time ("kāla") – summer, it simply is; winter, it simply is not. In regard to being ("bhāva") – brown, it simply is; white, it simply is not. And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended.

According to <a href="Acharya%20Samantabhadra">Samantabhadra</a>'s text "Āptamīmāṁsā" (Verse 105), ""Syādvāda", the doctrine of conditional predications, and "kevalajñāna" (omniscience), are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while "kevalajñāna" illumines directly, "syādvāda" illumines indirectly". "Syadvada" is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.

"Nayavāda" () is the theory of standpoints or viewpoints. "Nayavāda" is a compound of two <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> words—"naya" ("standpoint, viewpoint, interpretation") and "vāda" ("doctrine, thesis"). Nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic, and how to make proper conclusions about that topic.

According to Jainism, there are seven "nayas" or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using "syadvada". These seven "naya", according to <a href="Umaswati">Umaswati</a>, are:

The "naya" theory emerged after about the 5th century CE, and underwent extensive development in Jainism. There are many variants of "nayavada" concept in later Jain texts.

A particular viewpoint is called a "naya" or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, "Nayavada" does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A "naya" reveals only a part of the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications ("syādvāda").

Ancient India, particularly the centuries in which the Mahavira and the Buddha lived, was a ground of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about "jiva" and "ajiva" (self, matter) utilizes "anekantavada".

The <a href="Upanishads">Upanishadic</a> thought (Hindu) postulated the impermanence of matter and body, but the existence of an unchanging, eternal metaphysical reality of "<a href="Brahman">Brahman</a>" and "<a href="%C4%80tman%20%28Hinduism%29">Ātman</a>" (soul, self). The Buddhist thought also postulated impermanence, but denied the existence of any unchanging, eternal soul or self and instead posited the concept of <a href="anatta">anatta</a> (no-self). According to the vedāntin (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other's point of view. The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with "anekāntavāda". From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the <a href="ontology">ontology</a> and <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a> of "anekāntavāda" and "syādvāda", Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as "ekantika" or only partially true. The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes substances but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes process but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance ("dravya") and process ("paryaya").

This philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through "anekānta" has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as <a href="Arvind%20Sharma">Arvind Sharma</a>, who wrote:
Some Indian writers state that Anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that Jainism accepts "non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth", a form of sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in "exclusivist term as the one true path". Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text "Uttaradhyayana Sutra" in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be "heterodox and heretics" and that they "have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the <a href="Arihant%20%28Jainism%29">Jinas</a>". Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that those who do not follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be "approved or accommodated".

John Koller states "anekāntavāda" to be "epistemological respect for view of others" about the nature of existence whether it is "inherently enduring or constantly changing", but "not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal".

In contemporary times, according to Paul Dundas, the "Anekantavada" doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". This is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings, states Dundas. The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahavira is a doctrine about the nature of <a href="Absolute%20%28philosophy%29">Absolute Reality</a> and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine. However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right". The Five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps, just one perspective". Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism, according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.

The principle of "anekāntavāda" is one of the foundational <a href="Jain%20philosophy">Jain philosophical</a> concept. The development of "anekāntavāda" also encouraged the development of the dialectics of "syādvāda" (conditioned viewpoints) and "nayavāda" (partial viewpoints).

According to Karl Potter, the Jain "anekāntavāda" doctrine emerged in a milieu that included Buddhists and Hindus in ancient and medieval India. The diverse Hindu schools such as Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya-Yoga and Mimamsa-Vedanta, all accepted the premise of <a href="Atman%20%28Hinduism%29">Atman</a> that "unchanging permanent soul, self exists and is self-evident", while various schools of early Buddhism denied it and substituted it with <a href="Anatta">Anatta</a> (no-self, no-soul). Further, for causation theories, Vedanta schools and Madhyamika Buddhists had similar ideas, while Nyaya-Vaisheshika and non-Madhyamika Buddhists generally agreed on the other side. Jainism, using its "anekāntavāda" doctrine occupied the center of this theological divide on soul-self ("jiva") and causation theories, between the various schools of Buddhist and Hindu thought.

The origins of "anekāntavāda" are traceable in the teachings of Mahāvīra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, Mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.

Early Jain texts were not composed in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language. According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial "anekantavada" doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era. These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.

The early Svetambara canons and teachings do not use the terms "anekāntavāda" and "syādvāda", but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. "Śvētāmbara" text, "<a href="Sutrakritanga">Sutrakritanga</a>" contains references to "Vibhagyavāda", which, according to <a href="Hermann%20Jacobi">Hermann Jacobi</a>, is the same as "syādvāda" and "saptibhaṅgī". For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted "vibhagyavada" as "syadvada", the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text "<a href="Sutrakritanga">Sutrakritanga</a>". However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.

According to Upadhyaye, the "Bhagvatisūtra" (also called Vyākhyāprajñapti) mentions three primary predications of the "saptibhaṅgīnaya". This too is a Svetambara text, and considered by Digambara Jains as unauthentic.

The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the "<a href="Tattvarthasutra">Tattvarthasutra</a>" of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara. The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.

The Digambara scholar <a href="Kundakunda">Kundakunda</a>, in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the doctrine of "syādvāda" and "saptibhaṅgī" in "Pravacanasāra" and "<a href="Pancastikayasara">Pancastikayasāra</a>". Kundakunda also used "nayas" to discuss the essence of the <a href="Self%20%28philosophy%29">self</a> in "<a href="Samayasara">Samayasāra</a>". Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE. In contrast, the earliest available secondary literature on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on "anekantavada" to the late 1st millennium CE.

The Jain texts explain the "anekāntvāda" concept using the parable of blind men and elephant, in a manner similar to those found in both Buddhist and Hindu texts about limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:

This parable is called "Andha-gaja-nyaya" maxim in Jain texts.

Two of the Jain references to this parable are found in "Tattvarthaslokavatika" of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the "Syādvādamanjari" of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.

While the <a href="Blind%20men%20and%20an%20elephant">same parable</a> is found in Buddhist and Hindu texts to emphasize the need to be watchful for partial viewpoints of a complex reality, the Jain text apply it to isolated topic and all subjects. For example, the "syadvada" principle states that all the following seven predicates must be accepted as true for a cooking pot, according to Matilal:


Ācārya <a href="Haribhadra">Haribhadra</a> (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of "anekāntavāda". He wrote a <a href="doxography">doxography</a>, a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.

Ācārya Amrtacandra starts his famous 10th century CE work "Purusathasiddhiupaya" with strong praise for "anekāntavāda": "I bow down to the principle of "anekānta", the source and foundation of the highest scriptures, the dispeller of wrong one-sided notions, that which takes into account all aspects of truth, reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity."

Ācārya Vidyānandi (11th century CE) provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in "Tattvarthaslokavārtikka", 116:

, a 17th-century Jain monk, went beyond "anekāntavāda" by advocating "madhāyastha", meaning "standing in the middle" or "equidistance". This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non-Jain and belonged to other faiths. There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji, as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy.

The <a href="Jain%20philosophy">Jain philosophical</a> concept of Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient <a href="Indian%20philosophy">Indian philosophy</a>, in the areas of skepticism and relativity. The epistemology of "anekāntavāda" and "syādvāda" also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.

While employing "anekāntavāda", the 17th century Jain scholar <a href="Yasovijaya">Yasovijaya</a> stated that it is not "anābhigrahika" (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism. In Jain belief, "anekāntavāda" transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.

"Anekāntavāda" played a role in the history of Jainism in India, during intellectual debates from <a href="Saiva">Śaiva</a>s, <a href="Vaishnava">Vaiṣṇavas</a>, <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>s, <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s, and <a href="Christians">Christians</a> at various times. According to John Koller, professor of <a href="Asian%20studies">Asian studies</a>, "anekāntavāda" allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents. In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of <a href="Haribhadra">Haribhadra</a> justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.

There is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non-Jains, Jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like Buddhists and Hindus. Their texts have never presented a theory for holy war. Jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved the classic manuscripts of Buddhism and Hinduism, a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality. The combination of historic facts, states Cort, suggest that Jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non-Jain views, and that it is inappropriate to rewrite the Jainism past as a history of "benevolence and tolerance" towards others.

Mahatma Gandhi mentioned Anekantavada and Syadvada in the journal "<a href="Young%20India">Young India</a> – 21 Jan 1926". According to Jeffery D. Long – a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, the Jain Syadvada doctrine helped Gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to the "reality of both the personal and impersonal aspects of <a href="Brahman">Brahman</a>", and his view of "Hindu religious pluralism":

Referring to the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>, John Koller states that the threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of other human beings and other life forms, states Koller, is "rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives". Koller states that "anekāntavāda" is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.

According to Sabine Scholz, the application of the "Anekantavada" as a religious basis for "intellectual Ahimsa" is a modern era reinterpretation, one attributed to the writings of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view states that "Anekantavada" is an expression of "religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony". In the 21st century, some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against "intolerance, fundamentalism and terrorism". Other scholars such as <a href="John%20E.%20Cort">John E. Cort</a> and <a href="Paul%20Dundas">Paul Dundas</a> state that, while Jainism indeed teaches non-violence as the highest ethical value, the reinterpretation of "Anekantavada" as "religious tolerance of other opinions" is a "misreading of the original doctrine". In Jain history, it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation. Jain history shows, to the contrary, that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of Buddhist and Hindu spiritual theories, beliefs and ideologies. John Cort states that the "Anekantavada" doctrine in pre-20th century Jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or "intellectual Ahimsa". Jain intellectual and social history toward non-Jains, according to Cort, has been contrary to the modern revisionist attempts, particularly by diaspora Jains, to present "Jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non-Jains", or that Jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in Indian intellectual history. According to Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, indiscriminate open mindedness and the approach of "accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not" is an erroneous view in Jainism and not supported by the "Anekantavada" doctrine.

According to Paul Dundas, in and after the 12th century, the persecution and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of <a href="Ahimsa">Ahimsa</a> (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote during a time of widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody" in self-defense would not lose any merit. N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states "Anekantavada" doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and "Anekantavada" doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that "to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it".

The reinterpretation of "Anekantavada" as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel, popular but not unusual for contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.

According to Bhagchandra Jain, one of the difference between the Buddhist and Jain views is that "Jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative ("anekāntika") truth" while for Buddhism this is not the case.

In Jainism, states Jayatilleke, "no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false, irrespective of the standpoint from which it was made, in Buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in the case of some propositions." Unlike Jainism, there are propositions that are categorically true in Buddhism, and there are others that are "anekamsika" (uncertain, indefinite). Examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are the <a href="Four%20Noble%20Truths">Four Noble Truths</a>, while examples of the latter in Buddhism are the <a href="The%20unanswered%20questions">avyakata-theses</a>. Further, unlike Jainism, Buddhism does not have a Nayavāda doctrine.

According to Karl Potter and other scholars, Hinduism developed various theory of relations such as "satkaryavada", "asatkaryavada", "avirodhavada" and others. The "anekantavada" overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The "Anekantavada" doctrine is "satkaryavada" in explaining causes, and the "asatkaryavada" in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects. The different schools of <a href="Hindu%20philosophy">Hindu philosophy</a> further elaborated and refined the theory of "<a href="pramana">pramana</a>s" and the theory of relations to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.

<a href="Indologists">Indologists</a> such as professor <a href="John%20E.%20Cort">John E. Cort</a> state that "anekāntavāda" is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint. Jain monks used "anekāntavāda" and "syādvāda" as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend the Jain doctrine. According to <a href="Paul%20Dundas">Paul Dundas</a>, in Jain hands, this method of analysis became "a fearsome weapon of philosophical <a href="polemic">polemic</a> with which the doctrines of <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence, respectively, and thus could be shown to be one-pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be". The Jain scholars, however, considered their own theory of "Anekantavada" self-evident, immune from criticism, needing neither limitations nor conditions.

The doctrines of "anekāntavāda" and "syādavāda" are often criticised to denying any certainty, or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines. Another argument against it, posited by medieval era Buddhists and Hindus applied the principle on itself, that is if nothing is definitely true or false, is "anekāntavāda" true or false?

According to Karl Potter, the "Anekantavada" doctrine accepts the norm in Indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual, that object and subject are interdependent. However, as a theory of relations, it does not solve the deficiencies in other progress philosophies, just "compounds the felony by merely duplicating the already troublesome notion of a dependence relation".

The <a href="Nyaya">Nyaya</a> school criticized the Jain doctrine of "anekantavada", states Karl Potter, as "wanting to say one thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say, "jiva and ajiva are not related" and "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that "jiva" attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of "anekantavada" makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya texts.

The <a href="Vaisheshika">Vaisheshika</a> and <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a> school scholar Vyomashiva criticized the "Anekantavada" doctrine because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for <a href="moksha">moksha</a> meaningless. Any spiritually liberated person must be considered under "Anekantavada" doctrine to be [a] both liberated and not liberated from one point of view, and [b] simply not liberated from another point of view, since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it. In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity.

"Anekāntavāda" was analyzed and critiqued by <a href="Adi%20Shankara">Adi Śankarācārya</a> (~800 CE) in his "bhasya" on "<a href="Brahmasutra">Brahmasutra</a>" (2:2:33–36): He stated that "anekantavada" doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems: "virodha" (contradictions) and "samsaya" (dubiety), neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity.

Shankara's criticism of "anekantavada" extended beyond the arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters. According to Shankara, the goal of philosophy is to identify one's doubts and remove them through reason and understanding, not get more confused. The problem with "anekantavada" doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion. Further, states Shankara, Jains use this doctrine to be "certain that everything is uncertain". According to Karl Potter, Shankara does not take Jains seriously and admits that he doesn't understand Jainism's theory of relations.

Contemporary scholars, states Piotr Balcerowicz, concur that the Jain doctrine of "Anekantavada" does reject some versions of the "law of non-contradiction", but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances.

The Buddhist scholar <a href="Shantarakshita">Śāntarakṣita</a>, and his student Kamalasila, criticized "anekantavada" by presenting his arguments that it leads to the Buddhist premise "jivas (souls) do not exist". That is, the two of the most important doctrines of Jainism are mutually contradictory premises. According to Santaraksita, Jains state that "jiva is one considered collectively, and many considered distributively", but if so debates Santaraksita, "jiva cannot change". He then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment, which is equivalent to "jiva don't exist". According to Karl Potter, the argument posited by Śāntarakṣita is flawed, because it commits what is called in the Western logic as the "fallacy of division".

The Buddhist logician <a href="Dharmakirti">Dharmakirti</a> critiqued "anekāntavāda" as follows:
The medieval era Jain logicians <a href="Akalanka">Akalanka</a> and <a href="Vidyananda%20%288th-century%20Jain%20monk%29">Vidyananda</a>, who were likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his "Pramanasamgraha" acknowledges seven problems when "anekantavada" is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases ("vaiyadhi karanya"), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence. Vidyananda acknowledged six of those in the Akalanka list, adding the problem of "vyatikara" (cross breeding in ideas) and "apratipatti" (incomprehensibility). <a href="Prabh%C4%81candra">Prabhācandra</a>, who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in "anekantavada" application.

Triturus

Triturus is a <a href="genus%20%28biology%29">genus</a> of <a href="newts">newts</a> comprising the crested and the marbled newts, which are found from <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> through most of continental <a href="Europe">Europe</a> to westernmost <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, and the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> region. Their English names refer to their appearance: marbled newts have a green–black colour pattern, while the males of crested newts, which are dark brown with a yellow or orange underside, develop a conspicuous jagged seam on their back and tail during their breeding phase.

Crested and marbled newts live and breed in vegetation-rich ponds or similar aquatic habitats for two to six months and usually spend the rest of the year in shady, protection-rich land habitats close to their breeding sites. Males court females with a ritualised <a href="courtship%20display">display</a>, ending in the deposition of a <a href="spermatophore">spermatophore</a> that is picked up by the female. After fertilisation, a female lays 200–400 eggs, folding them individually into leaves of water plants. Larvae develop over two to four months before <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosing</a> into land-dwelling juveniles.

Historically, most European newts were included in the genus, but <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomists</a> have split off the <a href="alpine%20newt">alpine newt</a>s ("Ichthyosaura"), the <a href="Lissotriton">small-bodied newts</a> ("Lissotriton") and the <a href="Ommatotriton">banded newts</a> ("Ommatotriton") as separate genera. The closest relatives of "Triturus" are the <a href="Calotriton">European brook newts</a> ("Calotriton"). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the <a href="Anatolian%20crested%20newt">Anatolian crested newt</a> was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, <a href="hybridisation%20%28biology%29">hybridisation</a> may take place.

Although not immediately threatened, crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines, caused mainly by habitat <a href="habitat%20destruction">loss</a> and <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">fragmentation</a>. Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected. All species are legally protected in Europe, and some of their habitats have been designated as special reserves.

The genus name "Triturus" was introduced in 1815 by the <a href="polymath">polymath</a> <a href="Constantine%20Samuel%20Rafinesque">Constantine Samuel Rafinesque</a>, with the <a href="northern%20crested%20newt">northern crested newt</a> ("Triturus cristatus") as <a href="type%20species">type species</a>. That species was originally described as "Triton cristatus" by <a href="Josephus%20Nicolaus%20Laurenti">Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti</a> in 1768, but <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> had already used the name "Triton" for a <a href="Charonia">genus of sea snails</a> ten years before, making a new genus name for the newts necessary.

"Triturus" included most European <a href="newt">newt</a> species until the end of the 20th century, but was substantially revised after it was shown to be <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>. Three separate genera now accommodate former members of the genus: the <a href="Lissotriton">small-bodied newts</a> ("Lissotriton"), the <a href="Ommatotriton">banded newts</a> ("Ommatotriton"), and the <a href="alpine%20newt">alpine newt</a> ("Ichthyosaura"). The <a href="monophyly">monophyly</a> of the genus "Triturus" in the strict sense is supported by molecular data and <a href="synapomorphies">synapomorphies</a> such as a genetic defect causing 50% embryo mortality (see below, "<a href="%23Egg%20deposition%20and%20development">Egg deposition and development</a>").

As of 2016, the genus contains nine accepted species. There are seven species of "crested newts": <a href="Anatolian%20crested%20newt">Anatolian crested newt</a> ("Triturus anatolicus"), <a href="Balkan%20crested%20newt">Balkan crested newt</a> ("T. ivanbureschi"), <a href="Danube%20crested%20newt">Danube crested newt</a> ("T. dobrogicus"), <a href="Italian%20crested%20newt">Italian crested newt</a> ("T. carnifex"), <a href="Macedonian%20crested%20newt">Macedonian crested newt</a> ("T. macedonicus"), <a href="northern%20crested%20newt">northern crested newt</a> ("T. cristatus"), and <a href="southern%20crested%20newt">southern crested newt</a> ("T. karelinii"). "Marbled newts" have two species, the <a href="marbled%20newt">marbled newt</a> ("T. marmoratus") and the <a href="southern%20marbled%20newt">southern marbled newt</a> ("T. pygmaeus").

Both the crested and the marbled newts were long considered as single species, "Triturus cristatus" and "T. marmoratus", respectively. Substantial genetic differences between <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> were, however, noted and eventually led to their recognition as full species, with the crested newts often collectively referred to as ""T. cristatus" <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>". The Balkan and the Anatolian crested newt, the most recent species formally described (2013 and 2016, respectively), were only recognised through <a href="genetic%20data">genetic data</a>; together with the Southern crested newt, they form a <a href="cryptic%20species%20complex">cryptic species complex</a> with no morphological differences known.

"Triturus" is a genus of rather large-bodied newts. They typically have a total length of between , with some crested newts of up to described. Size depends on sex and the environment: females are slightly larger and have a proportionally longer tail than males in most species, and the Italian crested newt seems to be larger in colder parts of its range.

Crested newts are dark brown, with black spots on the sides, and white stippling in some species. Their belly is yellow to orange with black blotches, forming a pattern characteristic for individuals. Females and juveniles of some species have a yellow line running down their back and tail. During breeding phase, crested newts change in appearance, most markedly the males. These develop a skin seam running along their back and tail; this crest is the namesake feature of the crested newts and can be up to 1.5 cm high and very jagged in the northern crested newt. Another feature of males at breeding time is a silvery-white band along the sides of the tail.

Marbled newts owe their name to their green–black, marbled colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line runs down back and tail. The crest of male marbled newts is smaller and fleshier than that of the crested newts and not indented, but marbled newt males also have a whitish tail band at breeding time.

Apart from the obvious colour differences between crested and marbled newts, species in the genus also have different body forms. They range from stocky with sturdy limbs in the Anatolian, Balkan and the southern crested newt as well as the marbled newts, to very slender with short legs in the Danube crested newt. These types were first noted by herpetologist <a href="Willy%20Wolterstorff">Willy Wolterstorff</a>, who used the ratio of forelimb length to distance between fore- and hindlimbs to distinguish subspecies of the crested newt (now full species); this index however sometimes leads to misidentifications. The number of <a href="rib">rib</a>-bearing <a href="Spinal%20vertebra">vertebrae</a> in the skeleton was shown to be a better species indicator. It ranges from 12 in the marbled newts to 16–17 in the Danube crested newt and is usually observed through <a href="radiography">radiography</a> on dead or sedated specimens.

The two marbled newts are readily distinguished by size and colouration. In contrast, separating crested newt species based on appearance is not straightforward, but most can be determined by a combination of body form, coloration, and male crest shape. The Anatolian, Balkan, and southern crested newt however are cryptic, morphologically indistinguishable species. "Triturus" newts occupy distinct geographical regions (see "<a href="%23Distribution">Distribution</a>"), but <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a> forms occur at range borders between some species and have intermediate characteristics (see "<a href="%23Hybridisation%20and%20introgression">Hybridisation and introgression</a>").

Like other newts, "Triturus" species develop in the water as larvae, and return to it each year for breeding. Adults spend one half to three quarters of the year on land, depending on the species, and thus depend on both suitable aquatic breeding sites and terrestrial habitats. After larval development in the first year, juveniles pass another year or two before reaching maturity; in the north and at higher elevations, this can take longer. The larval and juvenile stages are the riskiest for the newts, while survival is higher in adults. Once the risky stages passed, adult newts usually attain an age of seven to nine years, although individuals of the northern crested newts have reached 17 years in the wild.

The aquatic habitats preferred by the newts are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant <a href="aquatic%20plant">underwater vegetation</a> but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger <a href="ponds">ponds</a>, which need not be of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern crested newt in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian crested newt) rice paddies. The Danube crested newt is more adapted to flowing water and often breeds in river margins, <a href="oxbow%20lake">oxbow lake</a>s or flooded <a href="marshland">marshland</a>, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts that can be found in <a href="syntopy">syntopy</a> with "Triturus" species include the <a href="smooth%20newt">smooth</a>, the <a href="palmate%20newt">palmate</a>, the <a href="Carpathian%20newt">Carpathian</a>, and the <a href="alpine%20newt">alpine newt</a>.

Adult newts begin moving to their breeding sites in spring when temperatures stay above . This usually occurs in March for most species, but can be much earlier in the southern parts of the distribution range. Southern marbled newts mainly breed from January to early March and may already enter ponds in autumn. The time adults spend in water differs among species and correlates with body shape: while it is only about three months in the marbled newts, it is six months in the Danube crested newt, whose slender body is best adapted to swimming. "Triturus" newts in their aquatic phase are mostly nocturnal and, compared to the smaller newts of "Lissotriton" and "Ichthyosaura", usually prefer the deeper parts of a water body, where they hide under vegetation. As with other newts, they occasionally have to move to the surface to breathe air. The aquatic phase serves not only for reproduction, but also offers the animals more abundant prey, and immature crested newts frequently return to the water in spring even if they do not breed.

During their terrestrial phase, crested and marbled newts depend on a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are much more difficult to detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or <a href="grove%20%28nature%29">groves</a> are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example <a href="hedgerows">hedgerows</a>, <a href="scrubland">scrub</a>, swampy meadows, or <a href="quarries">quarries</a>, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.

Juveniles often <a href="Biological%20dispersal">disperse</a> to new breeding sites, while the adults in general move back to the same breeding sites each year. The newts do not migrate very far: they may cover around in one night and rarely disperse much farther than . For orientation, the newts likely use a combination of cues including odour and the calls of other amphibians, and <a href="Animal%20navigation%23Orientation%20by%20the%20night%20sky">orientation by the night sky</a> has been demonstrated in the marbled newt. Activity is highest on wet nights; the newts usually stay hidden during daytime. There is often an increase in activity in late summer and autumn, when the newts likely move closer to their breeding sites. Over most of their range, they <a href="hibernate">hibernate</a> in winter, using mainly subterranean hiding places, where many individuals will often congregate. In their southern range, they may instead sometimes <a href="aestivate">aestivate</a> during the dry months of summer.

Like other newts, "Triturus" species are carnivorous and feed mainly on invertebrates. During the land phase, prey include <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s and other <a href="annelids">annelids</a>, different <a href="insects">insects</a>, <a href="woodlice">woodlice</a>, and <a href="snails%20and%20slugs">snails and slugs</a>. During the breeding season, they prey on various aquatic invertebrates, and also <a href="tadpoles">tadpoles</a> of other amphibians such as the <a href="common%20frog">common frog</a> or <a href="common%20toad">common toad</a>, and smaller newts. Larvae, depending on their size, eat small invertebrates and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.

The larvae are themselves eaten by various animals such as carnivorous invertebrates and <a href="water%20birds">water birds</a>, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by <a href="herons">herons</a> and other birds, snakes such as the <a href="grass%20snake">grass snake</a>, and mammals such as <a href="shrew">shrew</a>s, <a href="European%20badger">badgers</a> and <a href="European%20hedgehog">hedgehogs</a>. They secrete the poison <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a> from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American <a href="Taricha">Pacific newts</a> ("Taricha"). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a <a href="warning%20coloration">warning coloration</a> which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.

A complex courting ritual performed underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use <a href="lek%20mating">leks</a>, or courtship arenas, small patches of clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, they use the same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. <a href="Pheromone">Pheromone</a>s are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position himself in front of her. After this first "orientation" phase, courtship proceeds with "display" and "spermatophore transfer".

<a href="Courtship%20display">Courtship display</a> serves to emphasise the male's body and crest size and to waft pheromones towards the female. A position characteristic for the large "Triturus" species is the "cat buckle", where the male's body is kinked and often rests only on the forelegs ("hand stand"). He will also lean towards the female ("lean-in"), rock his body, and flap his tail towards her, sometimes lashing it violently ("whiplash"). If the female shows interest, the ritual enters the third phase, where the male creeps away from her, his tail quivering. When the female touches his tail with her snout, he deposits a packet of sperm (a <a href="spermatophore">spermatophore</a>) on the ground. The ritual ends with the male guiding the female over the spermatophore, which she then takes up with her <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>. In the southern marbled newt, courtship is somewhat different from the larger species in that it does not seem to involve male "cat buckles" and "whiplashes", but instead slower tail fanning and undulating of the tail tip (presumably to mimic a prey animal and lure the female).

Females usually engage with several males over a breeding season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the <a href="oviduct">oviduct</a>. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, such as <a href="water%20cress">water cress</a> or <a href="Glyceria%20fluitans">floating sweetgrass</a>, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt ("T. marmoratus") can lay up to 400. "Triturus" embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2 mm in diameter with a 6 mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested when they do not possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are <a href="homozygous">homozygous</a> for that chromosome).

Larvae hatch after two to five weeks, depending largely on temperature. In the first days after hatching, they live on their remaining embryonic yolk supply and are not able to swim, but attach to plants or the egg capsule with two balancers, adhesive organs on their head. After this period, they begin to ingest small invertebrates, and actively forage about ten days after hatching. As in all salamanders and newts, forelimbs—already present as stumps at hatching—develop first, followed later by the backlegs. Unlike smaller newts, "Triturus" larvae are mostly <a href="nektonic">nektonic</a>, swimming freely in the water column. Just before the transition to land, the larvae <a href="wiktionary%3Aresorb">resorb</a> their external gills; they can at this stage reach a size of in the larger species. <a href="Metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a> takes place two to four months after hatching, but the duration of all stages of larval development varies with temperature. Survival of larvae from hatching to metamorphosis has been estimated at a mean of roughly 4% for the northern crested newt, which is comparable to other newts. In unfavourable conditions, larvae may delay their development and overwinter in water, although this seems to be less common than in the small-bodied newts. <a href="Paedomorphism">Paedomophic</a> adults, retaining their gills and staying aquatic, have occasionally been observed in several crested newt species.

Crested and marbled newts are found in Eurasia, from <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> in the west to <a href="West%20Siberia">West Siberia</a> and the southern <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> region in the east, and reach north to central <a href="Fennoscandia">Fennoscandia</a>. Overall, the species have contiguous, <a href="parapatric">parapatric</a> ranges; only the northern crested newt and the marbled newt occur <a href="sympatry">sympatrically</a> in western France, and the southern crested newt has a disjunct, <a href="allopatric">allopatric</a> distribution in <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>, the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, and south of the Caspian Sea.

The northern crested newt is the most widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the southern marbled newt, and the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> basin and some of its tributaries in the Danube crested newt. The Italian crested newt ("T. carnifex") has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> outside its native range in some European countries and the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>. In the northern <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, four species of crested newt occur in close vicinity, and may sometimes even co-exist.

"Triturus" species usually live at low elevation; the Danube crested newt for example is confined to lowlands up to above sea level. However, they do occur at higher altitudes towards the south of their range: the Italian crested newt is found up to in the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennine Mountains</a>, the southern crested newt up to in the southern Caucausus, and the marbled newt up to around in central Spain.

<a href="Molecular%20phylogenetic">Molecular phylogenetic</a> data helped clarify relationships within the genus "Triturus". A 2011 phylogeny based on complete <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The crested and the marbled newts are <a href="sister%20groups">sister groups</a>, and within the crested newts, the Balkan–Asian group with "T. anatolicus", "T. karelinii" and "T. ivanbureschi" is sister to the remaining species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern ("T. cristatus") and the Danube crested newt ("T. dobrogicus"), as well as the Italian ("T. carnifex") and the Macedonian crested newt ("T. macedonicus"), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> gave some conflicting results regarding those divergences.

A 24-million-year-old fossil belonging to "Triturus", perhaps a marbled newt, shows that the genus already existed at that time and contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (<a href="Year%23mya">mya</a>) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the <a href="Calotriton">European brook newts</a> ("Calotriton"). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to <a href="paleogeography">paleogeography</a>: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.

The crested newts are believed to have originated in the Balkans and <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiated</a> in a brief time interval between 11.5 and 8 mya: First, the Balkan–Asian group (the Anatolian, Balkan and southern crested newt) branched off from the other crested newts, probably in a <a href="vicariance">vicariance</a> event caused by the separation of the Balkan and Anatolian land masses. The origin of current-day species is not fully understood so far, but one hypothesis suggests that ecological differences, notably in the adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle, may have evolved between populations and led to <a href="parapatric%20speciation">parapatric speciation</a>. Alternatively, the complex geological history of the Balkan peninsula may have further separated populations there, with subsequent <a href="allopatric%20speciation">allopatric speciation</a> and the spread of species into their current ranges.

At the onset of the <a href="Quaternary%20ice%20age">Quaternary glacial cycles</a>, around 2.6 mya, the extant "Triturus" species had already emerged. They were thus affected by the cycles of expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using <a href="environmental%20niche%20modelling">environmental niche modelling</a> and <a href="phylogeography">phylogeography</a> showed that during the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a>, around 21,000 years ago, crested and marbled newts likely survived in warmer <a href="refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugia</a> mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the southern marbled newt which expanded northwards and replaced the marbled newt. Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the <a href="Carpathian%20Basin">Carpathian Basin</a> during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.

The northern crested newt and the marbled newt are the only species in the genus with a considerable range overlap (in western France). In that area, they have patchy, mosaic-like distributions and in general prefer different habitats. When they do occur in the same breeding ponds, they can form hybrids, which have intermediate characteristics. Individuals resulting from the cross of a crested newt male with a marbled newt female had mistakenly been described as distinct species "Triton blasii" , and the reverse hybrids as "Triton trouessarti" . The first type is much rarer due to increased mortality of the larvae and consists only of males, while in the second, males have lower survival rates than females. Overall, viability is reduced in these hybrids and they rarely backcross with their parent species. Hybrids made up 3–7% of the adult populations in different studies.

Other "Triturus" species only meet at narrow zones on their range borders. Hybridisation does occur in several of these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and intermediate forms, but is rare, supporting overall <a href="reproductive%20isolation">reproductive isolation</a>. Backcrossing and <a href="introgression">introgression</a> do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In a case study in the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the <a href="gene%20pool">gene pool</a> of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only in the direction of the southern marbled newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, "<a href="%23Glacial%20refugia%20and%20recolonisation">Glacial refugia and recolonisation</a>").

Most of the crested and marbled newts are listed as species of "<a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a>, but population declines have been registered in all assessed species. The Danube crested newt and the southern marbled newt are considered "<a href="near%20threatened">near threatened</a>" because populations have declined significantly. Populations have been affected more heavily in some countries and species are listed in some national red lists. The Anatolian, Balkan and the Macedonian crested newt, recognised only recently, have not yet been evaluated separately for conservation status.

The major threat for crested and marbled newts is habitat loss. This concerns especially breeding sites, which are lost through the upscaling and intensification of agriculture, drainage, urban sprawl, and artificial flooding regimes (affecting in particular the Danube crested newt). Especially in the southern ranges, exploitation of groundwater and decreasing spring rain, possibly caused by <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>, threaten breeding ponds. Aquatic habitats are also degraded through pollution with agricultural pesticides and fertiliser. Introduction of <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> and predatory fish threatens larval development; the <a href="Perccottus%20glenii">Chinese sleeper</a> has been a major concern in Eastern Europe. Exotic plants can also degrade habitats: the <a href="swamp%20stonecrop">swamp stonecrop</a> replaces natural vegetation and overshadows waterbodies in the United Kingdom, and its hard leaves are unsuitable for egg-laying to crested newts.

Land habitats, equally important for newt populations, are lost through the replacement of natural forests by plantations or clear-cutting (especially in the northern range), and the conversion of structure-rich landscapes into uniform farmland.
Their limited dispersal makes the newts especially vulnerable to <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">fragmentation</a>, i.e. the loss of connections for exchange between suitable habitats. High concentrations of <a href="road%20salt">road salt</a> have been found to be lethal to crested newts.

Other threats include illegal collection for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, and the northern crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be <a href="genetic%20pollution">genetically polluted</a> through the introduction of close species, as it is the case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus "<a href="Batrachochytrium%20salamandrivorans">Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans</a>", introduced to Europe from Asia.

The crested newts are listed in <a href="Berne%20Convention%20%28conservation%29">Berne Convention</a> Appendix II as "strictly protected", and the marbled newts in Appendix III as "protected". They are also included in Annex II (species requiring designation of special areas of conservation; crested newts) and IV (species in need of strict protection; all species) of the <a href="Habitats%20Directive">EU habitats and species directive</a>. As required by these frameworks, their capture, disturbance, killing or trade, as well as the destruction of their habitats, are prohibited in most European countries. The EU habitats directive is also the basis for the <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> protected areas, several of which have been designated for the crested newts.

Habitat protection and management is seen as the most important element for the conservation of "Triturus" newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide <a href="wildlife%20corridor">corridors</a> of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such <a href="Species%20translocation">translocations</a> need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as <a href="flagship%20species">flagship species</a>, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.

Boulonnais horse

The Boulonnais, also known as the "White Marble Horse", is a <a href="draft%20horse">draft horse</a> breed. It is known for its large but elegant appearance and is usually <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a>, although <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> and <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a> are also allowed by the French <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a>. Originally there were several sub-types, but they were crossbred until only one is seen today. The breed's origins trace to a period before the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a> and, during the 17th century, <a href="Barb%20%28horse%29">Spanish Barb</a>, <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a>, and <a href="Andalusian%20horse">Andalusian</a> blood were added to create the modern type.

During the early 1900s, the Boulonnais were imported in large numbers to the United States and were quite popular in France; however, the European population suffered severe decreases during 20th-century wars. The breed nearly became extinct following World War II, but rebounded in France in the 1970s as a popular breed for <a href="horse%20meat">horse meat</a>. Breed numbers remain low; it is estimated that fewer than 1,000 horses remain in Europe, mostly in France, with a few in other nations. Studies as early as 1983 indicated a danger of inbreeding within the Boulonnais population, and a 2009 report suggested that the breed should be a priority for conservation within France. The smallest type of Boulonnais was originally used to pull carts full of fresh fish from <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> to <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, while the larger varieties performed heavy draft work, both on farms and in the cities. The Boulonnais was also <a href="crossbred">crossbred</a> to create and refine several other draft breeds.

The Boulonnais today stands from or more. It has a short, elegant head with a broad forehead and a short, muscular neck. Members of the breed have full chests, rounded rib cages and sloping shoulders. The legs are fairly short but robust and strong. Unlike other draft breeds such as the <a href="Shire%20horse">Shire</a> or <a href="Clydesdale%20horse">Clydesdale</a>, it has no heavy <a href="Feathering%20%28horse%29">feathering</a> on its lower legs. The breed is generally <a href="livestock%20branding">branded</a> with a small anchor mark on the left side of the neck. Due mostly to the many additions of <a href="Oriental%20horse">Oriental blood</a>, the Boulonnais has an elegant appearance that is not often seen in heavy draft breeds and it has been called "Europe's noblest draft horse". The fineness of the skin and delicate appearance of the veins has allowed the horse to be described as looking "like polished marble", leading to its "White Marble Horse" nickname.

In 1778, the French National Stud performed an initial survey of the breed and found that most were <a href="black%20%28horse%29">black</a> or <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">dark bay</a>. During the 1800s, <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">gray</a> horses began to appear, and it was the predominating color by the end of the century. Gray became a popular color during this time due to the use of the horses to haul fish at night – gray horses were more visible in the dark, and therefore more valuable. In the later years of the 20th century, breeders again began to prefer darker colors such as bay and <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a>. Today, chestnut, gray and black are the only colors allowed by the French breed registry, with the vast majority of horses being gray – a popular phrase says that the horses have coats "the color of the clouds from the coast".

There were originally several types of Boulonnais. The Petit Boulonnais, Mareyeuse or Mareyeur was used in the rapid transport of cartloads of fresh fish ("la marée") from the <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> to Paris; it stood and weighed . The Picard draft came from the <a href="Picardy">Picardy</a> region, and was called the "horse of the bad land", in comparison to the Cauchoix horse from the <a href="Pays%20de%20Caux">Pays de Caux</a> area, which was called the "horse of the good land". The "grand Boulonnais", which stood high and weighed , was bred in the 19th century for farm work in the <a href="sugar%20beet">sugar beet</a> fields. All of these types were bred together to create the modern Boulonnais horse.

One theory states that the origins of the Boulonnais breed emerged from the <a href="crossbreeding">crossbreeding</a> of native French mares and stallions brought by the <a href="Numidian">Numidian</a> army in 55–54 BC. However, many equine scholars are skeptical of this theory, and state that, whatever the early origins, the later <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> and local climate and soil types had a greater influence on the breed than any early Oriental blood. During the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>, two breeders, Eustache, <a href="Count%20of%20Boulogne">Comte de Boulogne</a>, and later Robert, <a href="Counts%20of%20Artois">Comte d'Artois</a>, wanted to create a fast, agile, and strong <a href="horses%20in%20warfare">warhorse</a> for <a href="knight">knight</a>s to ride in battle. They crossed the existing heavy French stallions with German <a href="Mecklenburger">Mecklenberg</a> mares, similar to modern-day <a href="Hanoverian%20%28horse%29">Hanoverians</a>. During the 17th-century Spanish occupation of <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, a mixture of <a href="Barb%20%28horse%29">Spanish Barb</a>, <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a>, and <a href="Andalusian%20horse">Andalusian</a> blood was added to the breed, to create the modern Boulonnais. By the 17th century, horse dealers were coming into the Boulonnais district from <a href="Picardy">Picardy</a> and <a href="Upper%20Normandy">Upper Normandy</a> to buy local horses, which enjoyed a good reputation among breeders. From the late 18th through the mid-19th century, the Boulonnais spread across France and Europe; during this time, the breed increased in size as the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> called for larger horses that retained the active <a href="horse%20gaits">movement</a> of the original type. Beginning in the 1830s, it was proposed to cross the Arabian with the Boulonnais to create a new type of <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> horse, and in the 1860s, calls were put forth to add <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> blood for the same reason. However, breeders rejected these calls, stating that using the breed to create cavalry horses would make them poorer draft horses. Breed societies also discouraged crosses between the Boulonnais and the <a href="Belgian%20%28horse%29">Brabant</a>. In June 1886, a <a href="studbook">studbook</a> was created for the breed in France, and placed under the jurisdiction of the Syndicat Hippique Boulonnais (SHB) in 1902.

During the early 20th century, the Boulonnais was imported into the United States in large numbers, where it was <a href="breed%20registry">registered</a> along with other French heavy horse breeds as the "French draft horse". Breed members in the United States were registered with the Anglo-Norman Horse Association (or National Norman Horse Association) beginning in 1876, an association that was renamed the National French Draft Association in 1885. This association declared in 1876 that the Boulonnais, <a href="Norman%20horse">Norman</a>, <a href="Percheron">Percheron</a> and Picardy breeds were all essentially the same, and should all be known as the "Norman horse". They later declared that all of the "Norman horses" were in fact "Percherons", regardless of actual breeding. This was mostly designed to sell mixed breed draft horses to American consumers at higher prices, and the Illinois Board of Agriculture soon ruled that only those Percherons who came from proven Percheron stock were to be registered as such, and all other breeds, including the Boulonnais, were to be considered separately. Boulonnais were exported from France to Austria, although they saw little success there, and breeding stallions were sent to Argentina.

The Boulonnais was once a popular workhorse in <a href="France">France</a>, with an estimated population of over 600,000 in the early 1900s. <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> almost destroyed the breed, as its home area saw heavy combat in both wars and the bands of <a href="broodmare">broodmare</a>s were scattered. Between World War II and the 1970s, the breed almost became extinct, and only a few breeders kept it alive. In the 1970s, it became popular for <a href="horse%20meat">horse meat</a>, and consumers considered it to be some of the best meat available. However, by this point, there were fewer than 1,000 mares remaining. During the mid-20th century, the stallions Fréthun (foaled in 1949), Select (1962), Trésor (1963), Astérix (1966) and Prince (1981) had a strong influence on the breed, although this contributed to the problem of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>. Fréthun genes are found in 14 percent of the pedigrees of Boulonnais living today. In the early 1970s, Henry Blanc, the newly appointed director of the French National Stud, proposed that nine draft horse breeds, including the Boulonnais, be recategorized from pulling horses to meat horses. When enacted, this recategorization helped to preserve the gene pool of the Boulonnais by encouraging breeding, but it also changed its primary purpose, resulting in a dramatic weight increase by the 1980s.

The Boulonnais is still bred in small numbers, with the American Boulonnais Horse Association estimating a population of fewer than 1,000 animals remaining in Europe. Many <a href="stud%20farm">studs</a> are government-funded, to prevent the breed from dying out. The majority of the breed, 95 percent, are located in the <a href="Nord-Pas-de-Calais">Nord-Pas-de-Calais</a> and Normandy regions and 75 percent in just the Pas-de-Calais department of Nord-Pas-de-Calais alone. Although most Boulonnais are in France, a few are exported. In 1999, fifteen foals were exported to Brazil and one stallion to Argentina. On average, a little over a dozen horses a year are exported, mainly to Brazil and Belgium for breeding and to Germany for forestry work. A few horses live in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg, as well as in North America. Since 2006, twenty horses, including two registry-approved breeding stallions, have been exported from France to Denmark to create a <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a> in that country.

The French national stud, the <a href="Haras%20Nationaux">Haras Nationaux</a>, allows the registration of horses bred using <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a> and <a href="embryo%20transfer">embryo transfer</a>, but does not allow the registration of <a href="cloning">cloned</a> horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, along with several other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding and a lack of genetic diversity in the breed.

During the 17th century, the smaller Mareyeuse type was used for transporting fresh fish from <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a> to Paris, a distance of almost 200 miles, in under 18 hours. This journey is remembered annually in the <a href="Route%20du%20Poisson">Route du Poisson</a> race. Only mares pulled small carts full of ice and fish on the relay-style trip. By 1884, the Boulonnais was called the "largest and most valuable of that kind of horse in France". At that time, they were used to move heavy blocks of building stone in Paris, with six to eight horses drawing blocks of several tons. During the 20th century, the larger Boulonnais type was utilized by the French army, and highly regarded for its ability to pull <a href="artillery">artillery</a> and supply wagons. Falling demand for the breed means that today it is bred mainly for <a href="horsemeat">horsemeat</a>. In 2010, 60 percent of Boulonnais horses bred in France were intended for slaughter, and 80 percent of these were exported, mainly to Italy, to be fattened before being sent to slaughterhouses. However, the sector is in crisis due to falling prices, controversy and the importation of cheap meat; despite a resurgence following the <a href="Mad%20Cow">Mad Cow</a> scares of the 1990s, the consumption of horse meat has fallen sharply, although the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region remains the largest consumer of horse meat in France.

The Boulonnais provided part of the base for the <a href="Anglo-Norman%20horse">Anglo-Norman</a> breed, which was later to play a large role in the creation of the <a href="Selle%20Francais">Selle Francais</a>. It was also used in the creation and refinement of the <a href="Italian%20Heavy%20Draft">Italian Heavy Draft</a>, the post-World War II improvement of the <a href="Schleswig%20horse">Schleswig horse</a>, and the creation of the early 19th-century <a href="Ardennes%20%28horse%29">Ardennes</a>. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a <a href="warmblood">warmblood</a> for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as, if an Araboulonnais mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection.

Vkhutemas

Vkhutemas (, <a href="acronym">acronym</a> for "" "Vysshiye Khudozhestvenno-Tekhnicheskiye Masterskiye" "Higher Art and Technical Studios") was the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, replacing the Moscow <a href="Svomas">Svomas</a>. The workshops were established by a decree from <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> with the intentions, in the words of the Soviet government, "to prepare master artists of the highest qualifications for industry, and builders and managers for professional-technical education". The school had 100 faculty members and an enrollment of 2,500 students. Vkhutemas was formed by a merger of two previous schools: the <a href="Moscow%20School%20of%20Painting%2C%20Sculpture%20and%20Architecture">Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture</a> and the <a href="Stroganov%20Moscow%20Arts%20and%20Industrial%20Institute">Stroganov School of Applied Arts</a>. The workshops had artistic and industrial faculties; the art faculty taught courses in graphics, sculpture and architecture while the industrial faculty taught courses in printing, textiles, ceramics, woodworking, and metalworking. It was a center for three major movements in <a href="Russian%20avant-garde">avant garde</a> art and architecture: <a href="Constructivism%20%28art%29">constructivism</a>, <a href="Rationalism%20%28architecture%29">rationalism</a>, and <a href="suprematism">suprematism</a>. In the workshops, the faculty and students transformed attitudes to art and reality with the use of precise <a href="geometry">geometry</a> with an emphasis on <a href="space">space</a>, in one of the great revolutions in the history of art. In 1926, the school was reorganized under a new rector and its name was changed from "Studios" to "Institute" ("Вхутеин, Высший художественно-технический институт", "Vkhutein, Vysshiye Khudozhestvenno-Tekhnicheskii Institut"), or Vkhutein. It was dissolved in 1930, following political and internal pressures throughout its ten-year existence. The school's faculty, students, and legacy were dispersed into as many as six other schools.

A preliminary basic course was an important part of the new teaching method that was developed at Vkhutemas, and was made compulsory for all students, regardless of their future specialization. This was based on a combination of scientific and artistic disciplines. During the basic course, students had to learn the language of <a href="plastic%20arts">plastic forms</a>, and <a href="color">chromatics</a>. Drawing was considered a foundation of the plastic arts, and students investigated relationships between color and form, and the principles of spatial composition. Akin to the <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a>'s basic course, which all first-year students were required to attend, it gave a more abstract foundation to the technical work in the studios. In the early 1920s this basic course consisted of the following:

The primary movements in art which influenced education at Vkhutemas were constructivism and suprematism, although individuals were versatile enough to fit into many or no movements—often teaching in multiple departments and working in diverse media. The leader figure of suprematist art, <a href="Kazimir%20Malevich">Kazimir Malevich</a>, joined the teaching staff of Vkhutemas in 1925, however his group <a href="Unovis">Unovis</a>, of the <a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a> art college that included <a href="El%20Lissitzky">El Lissitzky</a>, exhibited at Vkhutemas as early as 1921. While constructivism was ostensibly developed as an art form in graphics and sculpture, it had architecture and construction as its underlying subject matter. This influence pervaded the school. The artistic education at Vkhutemas tended to be multidisciplinary, which stemmed from its origins as a merger of a fine arts college and a craft school. A further contributor to this was the generality of the basic course, which continued after students had specialised and was complemented by a versatile faculty. Vkhutemas cultivated <a href="polymath">polymath</a> masters in the Renaissance mold, many with achievements in graphics, sculpture, product design, and architecture. Painters and sculptors often made projects related to architecture; examples include "<a href="Tatlin%27s%20Tower">Tatlin's Tower</a>", Malevich's "Architektons", and Rodchenko's "Spatial Constructions". Artists moved from department to department, such as Rodchenko from painting to metalworking. <a href="Gustav%20Klutsis">Gustav Klutsis</a>, who was head of a workshop on colour theory, also moved from painting and sculptural works to exhibition stands and kiosks. El Lissitzky, who had trained as an architect, also worked in a broad cross section of media such as graphics, print and exhibition design.

The industrial faculties had the task of preparing artists of a new type, artists capable of working not only in the traditional pictorial and plastic arts but also capable of creating all objects in the human environment such as the articles of daily life, the implements of labor, etc. The industrial department at Vkhutemas endeavored to create products of viability in the economy and functionality found in society. Class-based political requirements steered artists toward crafts, and the designing of household or industrial goods. There was significant pressure in this respect by the <a href="Central%20Committee">Central Committee</a> of the <a href="Communist%20Party">Communist Party</a>, that in 1926, 1927, and 1928, required a student body composition "of worker and peasant origins", and several demands for "working class" elements. This push for design economy resulted in a tendency towards working, functional designs with minimised luxuries. Tables designed by Rodchenko were equipped with mechanical moving parts, and were standardised and multi-functional. The products designed at Vkhutemas never bridged the gap between workshops and factory production, although they cultivated a factory <a href="aesthetic">aesthetic</a>—Popova, <a href="Varvara%20Stepanova">Stepanova</a>, and Tatlin even designed worker's industrial apparel. Furniture pieces constructed at Vkhutemas explored the possibilities of new industrial materials such as plywood and tubular steel.

There were many successes for the departments, and they were to influence future design thinking. At the 1925 "<a href="Exposition%20Internationale%20des%20Arts%20D%C3%A9coratifs%20et%20Industriels%20Modernes">Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes</a>" in Paris, the Soviet pavilion by <a href="Konstantin%20Melnikov">Konstantin Melnikov</a> and its contents attracted both criticism and praise for its economic and <a href="proletarian">working class</a> architecture. One focus of criticism was the "nakedness" of the structure, in comparison to other luxurious pavilions such as that by <a href="%C3%89mile-Jacques%20Ruhlmann">Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann</a>. Alexander Rodchenko designed a worker's club, and the furniture that the Wood and Metal Working Faculty ("Дерметфак") contributed was an international success. The student work won several prizes, and Melnikov's pavilion won the "Grand Prix". As a new generation of artist/designers, the students and faculty at Vkhutemas paved the way for designer furniture by architects such as <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>, and <a href="Alvar%20Aalto">Alvar Aalto</a> later in the century.

The dean of this department was Alexander Rodchenko, who was appointed in February 1922. Rodchenko's department was more expansive than its name would suggest, concentrating on abstract and concrete examples of product design. In a report to the rector of 1923, Rodchenko listed the following subjects as being offered: higher mathematics, descriptive geometry, theoretical mechanics, physics, the history of art and political literacy. Theoretical tasks included graphic design and "volumetric and spatial discipline"; while practical experience was given in foundry work, minting, engraving and <a href="electrotyping">electrotyping</a>. Students were also given internships in factories. Rodchenko's approach effectively combined art and technology, and he was offered the deanship of Vkhutein in 1928, although he refused. El Lissitzky was also a member of the faculty.

The textile department was run by the constructivist designer Varvara Stepanova. In common with other departments, it was run on utilitarian lines, but Stepanova encouraged her students to take an interest in fashion: they were told to carry notebooks so that they could note the contemporary fabrics and aesthetics of everyday life as seen on the high street. Stepanova wrote in her 1925 course plan that this was done "with the goal of devising methods for a conscious awareness of the demands imposed on us by new social conditions". Lyubov Popova was also a member of the textile faculty, and in 1922, when hired to design fabrics for the First State Textile Print Factory, Popova and Stepanova were among the first women designers in the Soviet textile industry. Popova designed textiles both with asymmetrical architectonic geometries, and also work that was thematic. Before her death in 1924, Popova produced fabrics with grids of printed <a href="Hammer%20and%20sickle">hammers and sickles</a>, which would predate work by others in the political climate of the <a href="first%20five-year%20plan">first five-year plan</a>.

Vladimir Lenin signed a decree to create the school although its emphasis was on art rather than <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>. Three months after its founding, on 25 February 1921, Lenin went to Vkhutemas to visit the daughter of <a href="Inessa%20Armand">Inessa Armand</a> and to converse with the students, where in a discussion about art he found an affinity among them for <a href="Futurism">Futurism</a>. There he first viewed avant garde art, such as suprematist painting and he did not wholly approve of it, expressing concern over the connection between the student's art and politics. After the discussion, he was accepting and stated, "Well, tastes differ" and "I am an old man".

Although Lenin was not an enthusiast for avant garde art, the Vkhutemas faculty and students made projects to honor him and further his politics. <a href="Ivan%20Leonidov">Ivan Leonidov</a>'s final project at Vkhutemas was his design for a "Lenin Institute of Librarianship". A model of Vladimir Tatlin's "<a href="Tatlin%27s%20Tower">Monument to the Third International</a>" was built by students and displayed at their workshop in Saint Petersburg. Furthermore, "<a href="Lenin%27s%20Mausoleum">Lenin's Mausoleum</a>" was designed by faculty member <a href="Aleksey%20Shchusev">Aleksey Shchusev</a>. <a href="Alexei%20Gan">Alexei Gan</a>'s book "Constructivism", published in 1922, provided a theoretical link between the new emerging art and contemporary politics, connecting constructivism with the revolution, and Marxism. The founding decree included a statement that students have an "obligatory education in political literacy and the fundamentals of the communist world view on all courses". These examples help justify the school's projects in terms of the early political requirements but others would arise throughout the school's existence.

Vkhutemas was a close parallel to the German <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner. Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a Basic Course in aesthetic principles, courses in color theory, industrial design, and architecture. Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus, but it was less publicised and consequently, is less familiar to the West. Vkhutemas's influence was expansive however—the school exhibited two structures by faculty and award-winning student work at the 1925 Exposition in Paris. Furthermore, Vkhutemas attracted the interest and several visits from the director of the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Barr">Alfred Barr</a>. With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus. The second Bauhaus director <a href="Hannes%20Meyer">Hannes Meyer</a> attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, <a href="El%20Lissitzky">El Lissitzky</a>'s book "Russia – an Architecture for World Revolution" published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects. Both schools flourished in a relatively liberal period, and were closed under pressure from increasingly totalitarian regimes.

As early as 1923, Rodchenko and others published a report in <a href="LEF%20%28journal%29">LEF</a> which foretold of Vkhutemas's closure. It was in response to students' failure to gain a foothold in industry and was entitled, "The Breakdown of VKhUTEMAS: Report on the Condition of the Higher Artistic and Technical Workshops", which stated that the school was "disconnected from the ideological and practical tasks of today". In 1927, the school's name was modified: "Institute" replaced "Studios" ("Вхутеин, Высший художественно-технический институт"), or Vkhutein. Under this reorganisation, the 'artistic' content of the basic course was reduced to one term, when at one point it was two years. The school appointed a new rector, <a href="Pavel%20Novitsky%20%28photographer%29">Pavel Novitsky</a>, who took over from the painter <a href="Vladimir%20Favorsky">Vladimir Favorsky</a> in 1926. It was under Novitsky's tenure that external political pressures increased, including the "working class" decree, and a series of external reviews by industry, and commercial organisations of student works' viability. The school was dissolved in 1930, and was merged into various other programs. One such merger was with MVTU, forming the Architectural-Construction Institute, which became the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1933. The Modernist movements which Vkhutemas had helped generate were critically considered as abstract formalism, and were succeeded historically by <a href="socialist%20realism">socialist realism</a>, <a href="postconstructivism">postconstructivism</a>, and the Empire style of <a href="Stalinist%20architecture">Stalinist architecture</a>.

John W. Johnston

John Warfield Johnston (September 9, 1818February 27, 1889) was an American lawyer and politician from <a href="Abingdon%2C%20Virginia">Abingdon, Virginia</a>. He served in the <a href="Senate%20of%20Virginia">Virginia State Senate</a>, and represented <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> when the state was readmitted after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. He was a United States Senator for 13 years. In national politics, he was a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a>.

Johnston had been ineligible to serve in Congress because of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%23Participants%20in%20rebellion">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, which forbade anyone who had sworn allegiance to the United States and subsequently sided with the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> during the Civil War from holding public office. However, his restrictions were removed at the suggestion of the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a> when he aided a sick and dying former slave after the War. He was the first person who had sided with the Confederacy to serve in the United States Senate.

Several issues marked Johnston's senatorial career. He was caught in the middle during the debate over the <a href="Arlington%20House%2C%20The%20Robert%20E.%20Lee%20Memorial">Arlington Memorial</a>. The initial proposal to relocate the dead was distasteful to Johnston, yet the ensuing debate caused him to want to defend the memory of <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>; the need to stay quiet for the sake of the Democratic Party, however, proved decisive. Johnston was an outspoken opponent of the Texas-Pacific Bill, a sectional struggle for control of railroads in the South, which figured in the <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">Compromise of 1877</a>. He was also an outspoken Funder during Virginia's heated debate as to how much of its pre-War debt the state ought to have been obliged to pay back. The controversy culminated in the formation of the <a href="Readjuster%20Party">Readjuster Party</a> and the appointment of <a href="William%20Mahone">William Mahone</a> as its leader; this marked the end of Johnston's career in the Senate.

Johnston was born in his paternal grandfather's house, "Panicello", near <a href="Abingdon%2C%20Virginia">Abingdon, Virginia</a>. He was the only child of Dr. John Warfield Johnston and Louisa Smith Bowen. His grandfather was Judge Peter Johnston, who had fought under <a href="Henry%20Lee%20III">Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolution">Revolutionary War</a>, and his great-grandmother was the sister of <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a>. His mother was the sister of Rees T. Bowen, a Virginia politician, and his paternal uncles included <a href="Charles%20Clement%20Johnston">Charles Clement Johnston</a> and General <a href="Joseph%20Eggleston%20Johnston">Joseph Eggleston Johnston</a>. His first cousin was U. S. Congressman <a href="Henry%20Bowen">Henry Bowen</a>. Johnston's ancestry was Scottish, English, Welsh, and <a href="Scots-Irish%20American">Scots-Irish</a>.

Johnston attended Abingdon Academy, South Carolina College at Columbia, and the law department of the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia%20at%20Charlottesville">University of Virginia at Charlottesville</a>. He was admitted to the bar in 1839 and commenced practice in <a href="Tazewell%2C%20Virginia">Tazewell, Virginia</a>.

On October 12, 1841, he married Nicketti Buchanan Floyd, the daughter of Governor <a href="John%20Floyd%20%28Virginia%20politician%29">John Floyd</a> and Letitia Preston, and the sister of Governor <a href="John%20Buchanan%20Floyd">John Buchanan Floyd</a>. His wife was Catholic, having converted when young; Johnston converted after the marriage.

In 1859, he moved his family to <a href="Abingdon%2C%20Virginia">Abingdon, Virginia</a>, and lived at first on East Main Street. An Abingdon resident noted that "it was a delightful home to visit and the young men enjoyed the cordial welcome that they received from the old and the young." While there, the family started construction of a new home called "Eggleston", three miles (5 km) east of town; the family's affectionate name for it was "Castle Dusty". They moved in sometime after August 1860.

Johnston and Nicketti Buchanan Floyd had twelve children, one of whom was Dr. George Ben Johnston, prominent physician in Richmond who is credited with the first antiseptic operation performed in Virginia. Both the Johnston Memorial Hospital in Abingdon and the Johnston-Willis Hospital in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> are named after him.

Johnston served as <a href="state%27s%20attorney">commonwealth attorney</a> for Tazewell County between 1844 and 1846. In 1846, he was elected to serve the remainder of the 1846–1847 term in the <a href="Senate%20of%20Virginia">Virginia Senate</a>, representing Tazewell, Wythe, Grayson, Smyth, Carroll, and Pulaski counties. He was re-elected for the 1847–1848 session.

During the Civil War, he held the position of Confederate States receiver, and was also elected as a councilman for the town of Abingdon in 1861. Not much is known of his activities during the war, but he did send a letter to Brigadier-General <a href="John%20Echols">John Echols</a> that the Order of Heroes of America, was "growing fearfully" in southwest Virginia. This secret order was composed of Union sympathizers. This information was used in conjunction with other reports to request a suspension of "<a href="Habeas%20corpus%23Suspension%20during%20the%20Civil%20War%20and%20Reconstruction">habeas corpus</a>" so that the military could make arrests.

After the war, in 1867, he founded the Villa Maria Academy of the Visitation in Abingdon for the education of girls. He was judge of the <a href="circuit%20court">Circuit Superior Court</a> of Law and Chancery of Virginia in 1869–1870. Also around 1869, he formed a law partnership with a young local attorney, and his future son-in-law, <a href="Daniel%20Trigg">Daniel Trigg</a>. In 1872, they set up their offices in a small building near the courthouse which became known as the Johnston-Trigg Law Office.

In November 1868, he wrote a letter to his daughter, which revealed that butter was scarce and that he doubted he would get a supply for the winter, but that "when we have spare ribs, sausages & crackilin bread, we can do without butter. The fact is I begin to consider butter a luxury anyhow, that poor people have no business with."

Virginia by 1869 was essentially a military zone. <a href="Gilbert%20C.%20Walker">Gilbert C. Walker</a> was elected as governor in this year and ushered in a moderate conservatism, with <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whiggish</a> roots. The new General Assembly ratified the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth</a> and <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendments</a> to end <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> and also elected two people as representatives for the U. S. Senate, including Johnston. He was to serve the unexpired portion of a six-year term that started in March 1865. Johnston received a letter from <a href="William%20Mahone">William Mahone</a>, sent on October 18, 1869, that he must go to Richmond "without fail, by the first train. You are Senator."

Johnston was one of the few Virginia men eligible to hold office: at the time, anyone who had fought for, or served, the former Confederacy was ineligible to hold office under the Fourteenth Amendment until their "political disabilities" were removed by Congress by a two-thirds vote. Johnston's were removed because word had reached the local Abingdon <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a> officer that he had helped care for an elderly former slave, Peter, who had passed through Abingdon on his way to <a href="Charlotte%20County%2C%20Virginia">Charlotte County, Virginia</a> from <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>.

The Norfolk and Western Railroad passed from Johnston's house, and former slaves used the tracks as a guide to return home from where they had been sold. In the summer of 1865 Johnston aided many with food and shelter, and in August of that year he found Peter near death in a stable near the railroad; Johnston carried him to the house, where he stayed at least a month.

When Peter regained enough strength he told his story, which Johnston later wrote down and is now kept with his papers at <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>. Peter had been a slave of a Mr. Read in Charlotte County, a neighbor of <a href="John%20Randolph%20of%20Roanoke">John Randolph</a>. He had been sold (apparently because of Read's debts) to a trader, leaving behind a wife and young daughter to work a cotton field for thirty-five years in Mississippi. When he was freed, Peter walked from Mississippi until he reached Abingdon in his quest to return home. Johnston wrote: "It was evident to me and my wife that all our care could not rebuild that worn-out body, and that death was near at hand. He weakened rapidly ... His life was weary, toilsome, and full of trouble. But surely the Lord has rewards for such as he, and will give him rest in all eternity, and permit him to see Susy and his Mammy and Daddy." Peter died of tuberculosis.

The Freedmen's Bureau agent wrote to Congressman <a href="William%20D.%20Kelley">William Kelley</a> of Pennsylvania requesting the removal of Johnston's disabilities because of his charity. Kelly did so and the bill passed both houses of Congress. Johnston only discovered all of this when he read about the passage of the bill in the newspaper.

Johnston went to Washington in December in hopes that Virginia would be readmitted to the Union. It was, however, not until January 26, 1870, that Virginia was readmitted; Johnston was able to take his seat shortly afterward. The delay was due to a Congressional need to pass an act that would allow Virginia representation in the body.

When Johnston arrived on January 28 to take his seat, he had some difficulty. <a href="George%20F.%20Edmunds">George F. Edmunds</a> of <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> questioned whether he was the right Mr. Johnston and thought a fraud was being perpetrated until <a href="Waitman%20T.%20Willey">Waitman T. Willey</a> of West Virginia vouched for Johnston's identity, allowing his qualification. Later, he was in the process of signing a document put before him, but without having read it. This was the <a href="ironclad%20oath">ironclad oath</a>, that required all white males to swear they had never borne arms against the Union or supported the Confederacy. If the senator sitting next to Johnston, <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a> of <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, had not noticed, Johnston would likely have been "disgraced ... forever in the eyes of the people of Virginia". The oath had been deemed unconstitutional in 1867, but its use was not effectively ended until 1871. At this time, Johnston was the only senator who had sided with the Confederacy—all the rest were either Northerners by birth or had been "Union men".

At the time he joined the Senate, the two parties in Virginia were the Conservatives and the Radicals. Johnston was a Conservative, which was an alliance of pre-War Democrats and <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whigs</a>. The Democrats had once been bitter rivals of the Whigs and would not join a party of that name, giving rise to the Conservative party. Which direction Johnston would vote in the national arena was unknown, but mattered little because the Senate was overwhelmingly Republican. There were only 10 Democrats at the time out of 68 senators. There was speculation that Johnston might side with the Republicans and "turn traitor to his party and state ... for patronage" based on a letter he had written to the new Virginia governor. These doubts were settled when Johnston declined a formal invitation to join the Republican caucus and went to a joint meeting of House and Senate Democrats; it was declared that "a Conservative in Virginia was a democrat in Washington".

Johnston served from January 26, 1870, to March 4, 1871, and was re-elected on March 15, 1871, for the term beginning March 4, 1871. He was re-elected again in 1877 and served until March 4, 1883. He was a member Committee on Revolutionary Claims, and later served as its chairman during the <a href="45th%20United%20States%20Congress">Forty-fifth</a> and <a href="47th%20United%20States%20Congress">Forty-seventh Congresses</a>. He was also chairman of the Committee on Agriculture during the <a href="46th%20United%20States%20Congress">Forty-sixth Congress</a>.

In November 1881, Johnston served on the Committee on Foreign Relations. It is recorded that when <a href="Clara%20Barton">Clara Barton</a>'s plea to President <a href="Chester%20Arthur">Chester Arthur</a> to sign the <a href="First%20Geneva%20Convention">First Geneva Convention</a> (establishing the <a href="International%20Red%20Cross">International Red Cross</a>), Arthur's favorable reply was referred to this committee and Johnston was named as one of the members.

On December 13, 1870, <a href="Thomas%20C.%20McCreery">Thomas C. McCreery</a> (D) of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> introduced a resolution regarding the <a href="Arlington%20House%2C%20The%20Robert%20E.%20Lee%20Memorial">Arlington House</a>, the former home of the Confederate leader <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, that brought down a firestorm of objections. Arlington House had been captured by Union forces during the Civil War and its grounds were used as a cemetery for 16,000 soldiers by the end of the war. The resolution called for an investigation to establish its ownership and the possibility of returning it to <a href="Mary%20Anna%20Custis%20Lee">Mrs. Robert E. Lee</a>. In addition, McCreery proposed the government fix up the premises, return any <a href="George%20Washington">Washington</a> relics discovered, and determine whether a suitable location nearby existed to relocate the dead. Johnston described the excitement caused as the most pronounced he would see in his thirteen years in the Senate. It put him in "the most painful and embarrassing position of my life". and he was vehemently opposed:

However, in the course of the speeches opposing the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He was up for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.

Later, Johnston made a speech on behalf of Mrs. Lee and her Memorial proposal. His first attempt to speak was objected to and he was denied permission. Near the end of the session, when an unrelated bill was under discussion, Johnston made a motion related to it and then used the opportunity, which was allowed to Senators, to make his speech; this caused "great indignation and impatience on the floor". The Lee family and their advisors desired that the "true facts about the sale of Arlington and the nature of her claim to the property, should be placed before the country" so that, if found in her favor, she could receive compensation and then donate the property to the government. Eventually the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> did find in the family's favor in 1882.

When Johnston was up for re-election in 1877, he was involved in the controversial Texas-Pacific Bill, a battle between Northern and Southern railroad interests. Johnston was opposed to Tom Scott's <a href="Texas%20and%20Pacific%20Railway">Texas and Pacific Railway</a>, and the bill, which favored Scott's interests. Scott was trying to persuade Southern states to accept his railroad so that they would subsequently appoint senators who would vote for the bill. Johnston's seat was vulnerable if Scott succeeded in influencing the Virginia legislature, as it was known that he opposed the bill. As Johnston wrote in a letter, "... what I have done about the Pacific road is before the people and I cannot recall it if I would. It would not be policy to retreat from my position nor am I inclined to do so, if was policy. I thought & I think that I was right & am therefore ready to take the consequences. I intend to fight it out on that line." William Mahone worked to prevent his re-election. Most Southern states went along with Scott, but Virginia and Louisiana did not, and Johnston was re-elected.

The Texas-Pacific Bill remained a bargaining chip in the <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">Compromise of 1877</a>, following the 1876 Presidential election crisis. Later, Johnston gave a speech in 1878 in Congress against the railroad, specifically Bill No. 942, which he viewed as "a positive menace to the commercial interests of the South".

Another issue that marked Johnston's career was the Funder vs. Readjuster debate. Funders maintained that the state was obligated to pay back its entire pre-War debt, whereas the Readjusters suggested differing, lesser figures, regarding how much was owed. The controversy culminated in the end of the Conservative Party in Virginia and the formation of the <a href="Readjuster%20Party">Readjuster Party</a> and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. William Mahone was chosen as head of the Readjusters and they gained control of the state legislature in 1879, but not the governorship. The legislature then elected Mahone as the successor to Democrat <a href="Robert%20E.%20Withers">Robert E. Withers</a> in the U. S. Senate. However, without a sympathetic governor, they could not enact their reforms. Their next chance came in the election of 1881; their aim was to elect a governor, but most importantly to maintain control of the state legislature, since it would elect "a successor to the Hon. John W. Johnston ..." Their party succeeded and the legislature elected prominent Readjuster, and Mahone's "intimate friend", <a href="Harrison%20H.%20Riddleberger">Harrison H. Riddleberger</a> to replace Johnston, eighty-one to forty-nine.

After serving in the Senate, Johnston resumed his legal practice. He died in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, on February 27, 1889, aged seventy. He was conscious until his death and was aware that he was dying. On March 1, his family brought his body from Richmond to Wytheville, where he was buried in St. Mary's Cemetery.

On May 11, 1903, a ceremony was held to install the portraits of deceased judges in the Washington County Courthouse. David F. Bailey was the speaker that presented the portrait of Johnston. In his speech, he described Johnston:

Johnston was outlived by his wife, Nicketti, who died on June 9, 1908, aged eighty-nine.

Osbert Lancaster

Sir Osbert Lancaster, <a href="CBE">CBE</a> (4 August 1908 – 27 July 1986) was an English <a href="cartoonist">cartoonist</a>, architectural historian, stage designer and author. He was known for his cartoons in the British press, and for his lifelong work to inform the general public about good buildings and architectural heritage. 

The only child of a prosperous family, Lancaster was educated at <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a> and <a href="Lincoln%20College%2C%20Oxford">Lincoln College, Oxford</a>, at both of which he was an undistinguished scholar. From an early age he was determined to be a professional artist and designer, and studied at leading art colleges in Oxford and London. While working as a contributor to "<a href="Architectural%20Review">The Architectural Review</a>" in the mid-1930s, Lancaster published the first of a series of books on architecture, aiming to simultaneously amuse the general reader and demystify the subject. Several of the terms he coined as labels for architectural styles have gained common usage, including "<a href="Pont%20Street%20Dutch">Pont Street Dutch</a>" and "Stockbrokers' Tudor", and his books have continued to be regarded as important works of reference on the subject.

In 1938 Lancaster was invited to contribute topical cartoons to "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>". He introduced the single column-width cartoon popular in the French press but not until then seen in British papers. Between 1939 and his retirement in 1981 he drew about 10,000 of these "pocket cartoons", which made him a nationally known figure. He developed a cast of regular characters, led by his best-known creation, <a href="Maudie%20Littlehampton">Maudie Littlehampton</a>, through whom he expressed his views on the fashions, fads and political events of the day.

From his youth, Lancaster wanted to design for the theatre, and in 1951 he was commissioned to create costumes and scenery for a new ballet, "<a href="Pineapple%20Poll">Pineapple Poll</a>". Between then and the early 1970s he designed new productions for the <a href="Royal%20Ballet">Royal Ballet</a>, <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne</a>, <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte</a>, <a href="the%20Old%20Vic">the Old Vic</a> and the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>. His productivity declined in his later years, when his health began to fail. He died at his London home in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>, aged 77. His diverse career, honoured by a <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighthood</a> in 1975, was celebrated by an exhibition at the <a href="Wallace%20Collection">Wallace Collection</a> marking the centenary of his birth and titled "Cartoons and Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster".

Lancaster was born in London in 1908, the only child of Robert Lancaster (1880–1917) and his wife, Clare Bracebridge, "née" Manger. His paternal grandfather, <a href="William%20Lancaster%20%28politician%29">Sir William Lancaster</a>, rose from modest beginnings to become the chief executive of the <a href="Prudential%20Assurance%20Company">Prudential Assurance Company</a>, <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20manor">Lord of the manor</a> of <a href="East%20Winch">East Winch</a>, Norfolk, and a philanthropist in the field of education. Osbert's mother was an artist, known for her paintings of flowers, who had exhibited regularly at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>; his father was a publisher, who volunteered for the army on the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, was commissioned as a <a href="Second%20lieutenant%23United%20Kingdom%20%26amp%3B%20other%20Commonwealth%20countries">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Norfolk%20Regiment">Norfolk Regiment</a>, and was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a> in April 1917.

<a href="Elgin%20Crescent">Elgin Crescent</a>, <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>, where Lancaster was born and raised, was an <a href="Social%20class%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Upper%20middle%20class">upper-middle class</a> area. The family maintained a staff of servants, including a cook and a <a href="Nanny">nurse</a>. Such was the mixed nature of London in the early years of the 20th century that a short distance away were the deprived and dangerous <a href="North%20Kensington">Notting Dale</a> and the <a href="Portobello%20Road">Portobello Road</a>, where, as Lancaster recalled in his 1953 memoirs, it was said to be impossible for a well-dressed man to walk and emerge intact. From an early age Lancaster was aware of the variety of classes, nationalities, and social attitudes around him.

In 1918 Lancaster was sent to <a href="St%20Ronan%27s%20School">St Ronan's preparatory school</a>, <a href="Worthing">Worthing</a>. The régime at the school leaned heavily towards sport, in which he was neither interested nor proficient. The headmaster, <a href="Stanley%20Harris%20%28footballer%29">Stanley Harris</a>, was a celebrated amateur footballer and occasional first class cricketer, but he was reasonably tolerant of Lancaster's disdain for games, and on the whole Lancaster enjoyed his time at the school. His education there was, he later commented, of more importance to him than anything he learned later in his school and university career. He left St Ronan's in 1921, aged thirteen, and went to <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse</a>, where his father and uncles had all been sent. There he was shocked by the bullying and bad language, but in addition to its sporty, philistine "bloods", the school had an intellectual and aesthetic tradition. Lancaster's biographer <a href="Richard%20Boston">Richard Boston</a> writes, "The hearty <a href="Robert%20Baden-Powell">Baden-Powell</a>, for example, was offset by <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> and <a href="Robert%20Graves">Robert Graves</a>, while talented Carthusian artists had included <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, <a href="John%20Leech%20%28caricaturist%29">Leech</a>, <a href="Claud%20Lovat%20Fraser">Lovat Fraser</a> and <a href="Max%20Beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a>". The art master, P.J.("Purple")Johnson, encouraged Lancaster, insisting that a sound technique was a prerequisite for effective self-expression in drawing or painting; in that respect the boy's time at the school was valuable, though otherwise the headmaster found him "irretrievably gauche ... a sad disappointment". Lancaster shared Beerbohm's view that being an old boy of the school was more pleasurable than being a pupil there.
At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to <a href="Lincoln%20College%2C%20Oxford">Lincoln College, Oxford</a>, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of <a href="Figure%20drawing">life classes</a> at the <a href="Byam%20Shaw%20School%20of%20Art">Byam Shaw School of Art</a> in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the "hearties" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the "aesthetes" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an <a href="Edwardian%20age">Edwardian</a> dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don <a href="Maurice%20Bowra">Maurice Bowra</a>; Lancaster's friend <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a> commented, "Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip." Lancaster's undergraduate set included <a href="Stephen%20Spender">Stephen Spender</a>, <a href="Randolph%20Churchill">Randolph Churchill</a>, and most importantly <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.

Lancaster tried rowing with the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Boat%20Club">Oxford University Boat Club</a>, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school. He joined the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Dramatic%20Society">Oxford University Dramatic Society</a> (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed. He contributed prose and drawings to "<a href="The%20Isis%20Magazine">Isis</a>" and "<a href="Cherwell%20%28newspaper%29">Cherwell</a>" magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene. All these diversions led him to neglect his academic work. He had made things more difficult for himself by switching from the history course to English after his first year, a decision he regretted once confronted with the rigours of compulsory <a href="Old%20English">Anglo-Saxon</a>, which he found incomprehensible. Making a belated effort, he extended his studies from the usual three years to four, and graduated with a fourth-class degree in 1930.

Lancaster's family believed that art was a suitable hobby but an unacceptable profession; they agreed that the best career for him would be the law. He dutifully attended a <a href="Cram%20school">crammer</a> and joined the <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a>, but repeatedly failed his law examinations. His studies were abruptly bought to an end by his health. A chest ailment was diagnosed as possibly <a href="tuberculosis">tubercular</a>, and he was sent to a sanatorium in Switzerland. After three months he was declared fit, and following a holiday in <a href="Venice">Venice</a> – a lifelong love and aesthetic influence – he returned to England in 1931. He abandoned all thoughts of becoming a lawyer and enrolled full-time at the <a href="Slade%20School%20of%20Art">Slade School of Art</a> in London.

At the Slade, Lancaster enjoyed most of his classes, but particularly those in stage design run by <a href="Vladimir%20Polunin">Vladimir Polunin</a>, who had been <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Diaghilev</a>'s chief scene-painter and had worked with <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a>. Among Polunin's students was Karen Harris, daughter of the banker Sir Austin Harris. Lancaster fell in love with her; his feelings were reciprocated, but she was only seventeen and her parents thought her too young to marry. At first they were cautious about Lancaster's suitability as a husband and provider, but they came to approve of him. He and Karen were married in June 1933. They had two children: Cara (born 1934) and <a href="William%20Lancaster%20%28anthropologist%29">William</a> (born 1938); the former became a <a href="stage%20manager">stage manager</a>, the latter, an <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a>.
Lancaster earned a living as a freelance artist, producing advertising posters, Christmas cards, book illustrations and a series of murals for a hotel. In 1934 he secured a regular post with "<a href="Architectural%20Review">The Architectural Review</a>", which was owned by a family friend and of which Betjeman was assistant editor. The magazine had a reputation as "the mouthpiece of the <a href="Modern%20architecture">modernist movement</a>", employing leading proponents such as <a href="Ern%C5%91%20Goldfinger">Ernő Goldfinger</a> and <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>. Despite describing the <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> style as "balls", Lancaster was not anti-modernist, but he joined Betjeman and <a href="Robert%20Byron">Robert Byron</a> in advancing the countervailing value of more traditional architecture. Chief among his many activities for "The Architectural Review" was reviewing books, particularly those on art. His biographer James Knox comments that Lancaster's taste was already assured, appreciating the diverse gifts of contemporary artists including <a href="Edward%20Burra">Edward Burra</a>, <a href="Giorgio%20de%20Chirico">Giorgio de Chirico</a>, <a href="Edward%20Wadsworth">Edward Wadsworth</a> and <a href="Paul%20Nash%20%28artist%29">Paul Nash</a>.

Knox singles out as Lancaster's most lasting contribution to the magazine a series of illustrated satires on planning and architecture, under the title "Progress at Pelvis Bay". The collected articles were turned into a book, under the same title, published in 1936. It lampooned greedy and philistine property development in a typical seaside resort. Reviewing the book in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", Simon Harcourt-Smith wrote, "Mr Lancaster spares us no horrifying detail of the borough's development ... [his] admirable drawings complete the picture of progress and desolation. I hope that every local authority and real-estate developer will be compelled to read this ghoulish little book." Lancaster followed this with "Pillar to Post" (1938), a lighthearted book with roughly equal amounts of text and drawings, aiming to demystify architecture for the intelligent lay person. The architectural scholar <a href="Christopher%20Hussey">Christopher Hussey</a> remarked on the author's inventive coinage of terms for period styles such as "Banker's Georgian", "Stockbrokers' Tudor" and "By-pass Variegated", and described the book as both perceptive and shrewd.

In 1938 Lancaster agreed to help Betjeman write a series of articles for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>". He became friendly with the paper's features editor, John Rayner, who responded positively to Lancaster's praise of "the little column-width cartoons" popular in the French press but not, so far, seen in British papers. Rayner dubbed them "<a href="Editorial%20cartoon%23Pocket%20cartoons">pocket cartoons</a>" after the <a href="pocket%20battleships">pocket battleships</a> then much in the news, and invited Lancaster to contribute some. The first appeared on 3 January 1939. The early cartoons accompanied the "<a href="William%20Hickey%20%28columnist%29">William Hickey</a>" gossip column; later they were promoted to a front-page slot, where they remained a regular feature, with only brief interruptions, for more than forty years, totalling about 10,000. The popularity of Lancaster's cartoons led to attempts by other papers, including "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", to lure him away from the "Express", but he resisted them. Although he thought the "Express's" proprietor, <a href="Max%20Aitken%2C%201st%20Baron%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbook</a>, "an old brute" and "a bastard", he found him "an ideal employer as far as I was concerned: he left one's work absolutely alone".

Shortly after the outbreak of war, Lancaster joined the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Information</a>. He spoke good French and German, and because of that and his journalistic experience, he was recruited by the section handling British propaganda overseas. Several other prominent figures were members of the section and there were many clashes of egos and few tangible achievements. In July 1941, Lancaster was transferred to the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a>'s news department. His duties included giving daily news briefings to other public servants and the British press, monitoring German propaganda broadcasts, and drawing caricatures for leaflets in German, Dutch and French for aerial drops in enemy-held territory.
In addition to his official duties Lancaster was art critic for "The Observer" between 1942 and 1944, and continued to contribute the pocket cartoons to the "Express"; from 1943 he also drew a large weekly cartoon for its sister newspaper, "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Express">The Sunday Express</a>", under the pen-name "Bunbury". Despite the wartime shortage of paper, the publisher <a href="John%20Murray%20%28publisher%29">John Murray</a> produced a collection of the pocket cartoons every year from 1940 to 1944.

In December 1944, the war approaching its end, Lancaster was posted to Greece as press attaché to the British embassy in Athens. After the occupying Germans had withdrawn, opposing factions brought the country to the brink of civil war. Fearing a communist takeover, the British government supported <a href="Georgios%20Papandreou">Georgios Papandreou</a>, prime minister of the former <a href="Greek%20government-in-exile">government-in-exile</a>, now precariously in power in Athens, backed by British troops. When Papandreou's police fired on a <a href="Dekemvriana">civilian demonstration</a> in full view of the world's press, British support for him came under international pressure. The British embassy, at which Lancaster arrived on 12 December, was the target for gunfire from various anti-government groups, and he joined the ambassador (<a href="Reginald%20Leeper">Reginald Leeper</a>), the British Minister Resident in the Mediterranean (<a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>) and a staff virtually under siege.
Following an initiative by Macmillan and the personal intervention of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, a new government took office in Athens acceptable to all sides, and peace was briefly restored, in January 1945. Lancaster's task was then to restore trust and good relations between Britain – its government, embassy and military – and the international press corps. In this he was generally thought to have succeeded. After that, he took the opportunity of travelling in the country beyond Athens during the months before civil strife returned in 1946. He explored <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> and <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>, and also visited <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> and some of the <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Greece">islands</a>. He fell in love with Greece, which he revisited repeatedly throughout the rest of his life. During his excursions in 1945 and 1946 he sketched continually, and the results were published with his accompanying text as "Classical Landscape with Figures" in 1947. Boston describes it as "an unflinching but lyrical account of the conditions of post-war Greece"; "The Times" called it "a fine work of scholarship" as well as "an outstanding picture book".

During the three years between his return from Greece and the end of the decade, Lancaster published two more books, one a comic story originally written for his children, "The Saracen's Head", and the other a further satirical book about architecture and planning, "<a href="Drayneflete%20Revealed">Drayneflete Revealed</a>". In 1947–48 he was the Sydney Jones Lecturer in Art at <a href="Liverpool%20University">Liverpool University</a>, following earlier appointees including <a href="Herbert%20Read">Sir Herbert Read</a>, <a href="William%20George%20Constable">W. G. Constable</a>, <a href="Frank%20Lambert%20%28curator%29">Frank Lambert</a> and <a href="H.%20S.%20Goodhart-Rendel">H. S. Goodhart-Rendel</a>.

The 1951 <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a> gave Lancaster new opportunities to expand his artistic scope. Despite the hostility to the festival shown by his main employer, Beaverbrook, Lancaster was a major contributor. He and his friend <a href="John%20Piper%20%28artist%29">John Piper</a> were commissioned to design the centrepiece of the Festival Gardens on the south bank of the <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>. Boston describes it as "a 250-yard succession of pavilions, arcades, towers, pagodas, terraces, gardens, lakes and fountains, in styles that included Brighton Regency, Gothic and Chinese". The main site of the festival, around the new <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>, was intended to convey the spirit of modernist architecture; the gardens were designed to evoke the atmosphere of <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian</a> <a href="pleasure%20gardens">pleasure gardens</a>, such as <a href="Vauxhall%20Gardens">Vauxhall</a> and <a href="Ranelagh%20Gardens">Ranelagh</a>.

The gardens attracted about eight million visitors during the 1951 festival. "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" called them "a masterpiece ... fantasy on fantasy, red and gold and blue and green, a labyrinth of light-hearted absurdity".

Lancaster's association with Piper led to a second departure in his professional career: stage design. In connexion with the Festival of Britain, <a href="Royal%20Ballet">Sadler's Wells Ballet</a> mounted a new work, "<a href="Pineapple%20Poll">Pineapple Poll</a>" by <a href="John%20Cranko">John Cranko</a>, and approached Piper to design it. He could not take the commission and recommended his colleague. This was an opportunity Lancaster had keenly awaited since he was eleven, when his mother took him to see Diaghilev's production of "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Beauty%20%28ballet%29">The Sleeping Beauty</a>". He recalled "the dazzling beauty of the <a href="Leon%20Bakst">Bakst</a> sets and the intensity of my own response. ... There and then I formed an ambition that was not destined to be fulfilled for more than thirty years". Cranko's exuberant ballet was an immediate success – "the hit of the season", in Knox's phrase – and turned Lancaster into one of the country's most sought-after theatre designers. During the rest of the 1950s and the 1960s his costumes and scenery were seen in new productions at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a>, <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne</a>, <a href="the%20Old%20Vic">the Old Vic</a>, <a href="Aldeburgh%20Festival">Aldeburgh</a> and in <a href="West%20End%20theatre">the West End</a>.

Although he had provided drawings for a few books by other authors in the 1930s it was not until after the war that Lancaster was continually in demand as an illustrator. He illustrated or designed covers for a wide range of books, both fiction and non-fiction. His commissions included drawings for works by friends such as <a href="Nancy%20Mitford">Nancy Mitford</a>, <a href="Alan%20Moorehead">Alan Moorehead</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a>; for best-sellers including <a href="C.%20Northcote%20Parkinson">C.Northcote Parkinson</a> and <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P.G.Wodehouse</a>; and for other modern authors including <a href="Ruth%20McKenney">Ruth McKenney</a>, <a href="Violet%20Powell">Violet Powell</a>, <a href="Simon%20Raven">Simon Raven</a> and <a href="Virginia%20Graham">Virginia Graham</a>. He also illustrated new editions of classic works by authors from Shakespeare to Beerbohm and <a href="Saki">Saki</a>.

In "Osbert: A Portrait of Osbert Lancaster", Boston comments that after the dramatic events in Athens his subject's later life was uneventful and industrious with "a somewhat dismaying dearth of rows, intrigues, scandals or scrapes to report." The Lancasters had a Georgian house in <a href="Henley-on-Thames">Henley-on-Thames</a>, and a flat in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>, where they lived from Mondays to Fridays. He worked at home in the mornings, on illustrations, stage designs, book reviews and any other commissions, before joining his wife for a midday <a href="Martini%20%28cocktail%29">dry martini</a> and finally dressing and going to one of his <a href="Gentlemen%27s%20club">clubs</a> for lunch. After that he would walk to the "Express" building in <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a> at about four in the afternoon. There he would gossip with his colleagues before sitting at his desk smoking furiously, producing the next day's pocket cartoon. By about half-past six he would have presented the cartoon to the editor and be ready for a drink at <a href="El%20Vino">El Vino's</a> across the road, and then the evening's social events.

Karen Lancaster died in 1964. They were markedly different in character, she quiet and home-loving, he extrovert and gregarious, but they were devoted to each other, and her death left him devastated. Three years later he married the journalist <a href="Anne%20Scott-James">Anne Scott-James</a>; they had known each other for many years, although at first she did not much like him, finding him "stagey" and "supercilious". By the 1960s they had become good friends, and after Karen died the widowed Lancaster and the divorced Scott-James spent increasing amounts of time together. Their wedding was at the <a href="Chelsea%20Register%20Office">Chelsea Register Office</a> on 2 January 1967. After their marriage they kept his Chelsea flat, and lived at weekends in her house in the <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> village of <a href="Aldworth">Aldworth</a>, the house in Henley having been sold.
Though generally a commentator rather than a campaigner, Lancaster made an exception for the protection of Britain's architectural heritage, where he became a leader of public opinion. The historian <a href="Jerry%20White%20%28historian%29">Jerry White</a> has written that the demolition of the <a href="Euston%20Arch">Euston Arch</a> in London in 1962 alerted the general public that "without vigilance and sturdy resistance, London was in danger of losing its landmarks one by one, in the interests of either profit or a misconceived public weal". Lancaster had been pressing this point since before the war. In 1967 he was appointed to the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">Greater London Council</a>'s Historic Buildings advisory committee, joining Betjeman, Pevsner and <a href="John%20Summerson">Sir John Summerson</a>. They played a major role in defeating the <a href="Labour%20government%2C%201964%E2%80%931970">Labour</a> government's plans to demolish the front of the <a href="Tate%20Gallery">Tate Gallery</a>. In 1973, with Betjeman and others of like mind Lancaster campaigned against the <a href="Heath%20ministry">Conservative</a> government's imposition of entry charges to hitherto free galleries and museums; the charges caused admissions to drop drastically, and were soon abolished.

In June 1975 Lancaster was <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighted</a> in the <a href="Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>. He and his wife collaborated on "The Pleasure Garden" (1977), a history of the British garden. Although great gardens such as <a href="Stowe%20House%23Stowe%20Landscape%20Gardens">Stowe</a> were given full coverage, her text and his drawings did not neglect more modest efforts: "The suburban garden is the most important garden of the 20th century and there is no excuse other than ignorance for using the word 'suburban' in a derogatory sense". The following year Lancaster was made a <a href="Royal%20Designers%20for%20Industry">Royal Designer for Industry</a> (RDI) by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a>, a distinction in which his predecessors had included the artist and architect <a href="Hugh%20Casson">Hugh Casson</a>; the typographer <a href="Eric%20Gill">Eric Gill</a>; <a href="Charles%20Holden">Charles Holden</a>, London Transport's architect; <a href="Barnes%20Wallis">Barnes Wallis</a>, the wartime engineer; and a modernist architect with whom Lancaster had vigorously crossed swords, <a href="Basil%20Spence">Sir Basil Spence</a>. There would not be another theatre designer RDI until <a href="Stefanos%20Lazaridis">Stefanos Lazaridis</a> in 2003. In 1978 Lancaster suffered the first of a series of <a href="stroke">stroke</a>s, and his health began a slow decline. He designed no more for the theatre, drew his last pocket cartoon for the "Express" in May 1981, and published his last collection, "The Life and Times of Maudie Littlehampton" the following year.

Lancaster died at his Chelsea flat on 27 July 1986, aged 77. He was buried with previous generations of his family in the churchyard at East Winch. A memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's, Covent Garden</a> in October 1986.

In 2008 the architectural historian <a href="Gavin%20Stamp">Gavin Stamp</a> described Lancaster's "Pillar to Post" (1938) – later revised and combined with the sequel "Homes Sweet Homes" (1939) – as "one of the most influential books on architecture ever published – and certainly the funniest". Lancaster felt that architects and architectural writers had created a mystique that left the lay person confused, and in the two books he set out to demystify the subject, with, he said, "a small mass of information leavened by a large dose of personal prejudice."

From an early age Lancaster had been fascinated by architecture. He recalled his first trip to Venice and the "staggering" view of <a href="San%20Giorgio%20Maggiore">San Giorgio Maggiore</a> from the <a href="Piazza%20San%20Marco%23Description%20of%20the%20Piazzetta">Piazzetta</a>, and as a young man he went on what he described as "church crawls" with Betjeman. His concern for architectural heritage led him to write and draw what Knox describes as "a series of architectural polemics in the guise of disarming 'picture books'". <a href="Harold%20Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a> said of Lancaster's work in this sphere, "Under that silken, sardonic smile there lies the zeal of an ardent reformer ... a most witty and entertaining book. But it is more than that. It is a lucid summary of a most important subject". Four of Lancaster's books are in this category: "Progress at Pelvis Bay" lampoons insensitive planners and avaricious developers; "Pillar to Post" illustrates and analyses the exteriors of buildings from ancient times to the present; "Homes Sweet Homes" does the same for the interiors. "Drayneflete Revealed" is in the same vein as "Progress at Pelvis Bay". In all of these Lancaster employs something of the technique he prescribed for stage design: presenting a slightly heightened version of reality. The twisted columns in the "<a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a>" section are not drawn directly from actual baroque buildings, but are the artist's distillation of the many examples he has seen and sketched. By such means, he set out to make the general public aware of good buildings, and "the present lamentable state of English architecture".

Lancaster's sketches and paintings in and around Greece are rarely satirical; they are a record of his love for, and careful scrutiny of the country. When his contempt for tyranny prevented him from visiting Greece while it was under military rule he went instead to Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon and Syria, always with a large sketchbook, in which he wrote and drew. From these sketches he produced "Classical Landscape with Figures" (1947), "Sailing to Byzantium: An Architectural Companion" (1969) and, in a different vein, "Scene Changes" (1978), in which he ventured into writing poetry to accompany his drawings. <a href="Dilys%20Powell">Dilys Powell</a>, a well-known <a href="Hellenophile">Hellenophile</a>, wrote that Lancaster was "one of the few who could make a joke about the Greeks without giving offence; he was devoted to Greece; he was born to celebrate her".

Although the Beaverbrook papers were editorially right-wing, Lancaster was never pressured into following a party line. His inclination was to satirise the government of the day, regardless of party, and he felt that his overtly partisan colleagues such as <a href="David%20Low%20%28cartoonist%29">David Low</a> and <a href="Victor%20Weisz">Vicky</a> were constrained by their political allegiances. He wrote, "It is not the cartoonist's business to wave flags and cheer as the procession passes; his allotted role is that of the little boy who points out that the Emperor is stark naked".

In the late 1940s Lancaster developed a repertory company of characters in whose mouths he put his social and political jokes. The star character was <a href="Maudie%20Littlehampton">Maudie, Countess of Littlehampton</a>, who managed to be shrewd and flighty simultaneously. She began as what her creator called "a slightly dotty class symbol", but developed into "a voice of straightforward comment which might be my own". Maudie's political views were eclectic: "on some matters she is far to the right of Mr <a href="Enoch%20Powell">Enoch Powell</a>, and on others well to the left of Mr <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a>". Her comments on the fads and peculiarities of the day caught the public imagination; the art historian <a href="Bevis%20Hillier">Bevis Hillier</a> calls her "an iconic figure to rank with Low's <a href="Colonel%20Blimp">Colonel Blimp</a> and <a href="Carl%20Giles">Giles's</a> Grandma". Various candidates have been proposed as the model for Maudie, but Lancaster maintained that she was not based on any one real person.

Other regular characters included Maudie's dim but occasionally perceptive husband Willy; two formidable dowagers: the Littlehamptons' Great-Aunt Edna, and Mrs Frogmarch, a middle-class Tory activist; Canon Fontwater, a personification of the <a href="Churches%20Militant%2C%20Penitent%2C%20and%20Triumphant">Church Militant</a>; Mrs Rajagojollibarmi, an Asian politician; and Father O'Bubblegum, Fontwater's Roman Catholic opposite number; they are seen in the illustration to the right, from the 1975 collection "Liquid Assets". Lancaster's younger contemporary <a href="Mark%20Boxer">Mark Boxer</a> remarked on the way some characters such as the Canon had developed "square characteristics to fit into the shape of the cartoon box". In his wartime cartoons Lancaster often caricatured <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a> and <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>; later he rarely portrayed current politicians, although Knox includes a few pocket cartoons from the 1960s in which <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">General de Gaulle</a>, <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> and others appear. <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> featured in a few pocket cartoons during the <a href="Watergate">Watergate</a> scandal; in one he is drawn standing by a flushing lavatory, saying innocently, "Tapes? What tapes?"

The novelist <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a> commented that Lancaster, having carefully invented and stylised his own persona – "bristling moustache, check suits, shirt and tie in bold tints" – created similarly stylised characters for his cartoons, achieving "the traditional dramatic effectiveness of a greatly extended cast for a <a href="commedia%20dell%27arte">commedia dell'arte</a> performance".

Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>. His first costumes and scenery were for the <a href="Royal%20Ballet">Sadler's Wells Ballet</a>'s "<a href="Pineapple%20Poll">Pineapple Poll</a>" (1951), <a href="John%20Cranko">John Cranko</a>'s ballet with a story based on a <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">Gilbert</a> poem and music by <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sullivan</a>. His last were for the <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a>'s revival of "<a href="The%20Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a>" (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the <a href="Royal%20Ballet">Royal Ballet</a>, as well as for <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival Opera</a>, <a href="the%20Old%20Vic">the Old Vic</a> and the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>'s "<a href="Peter%20Grimes">Peter Grimes</a>", for the <a href="National%20Opera%20and%20Ballet%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgarian National Opera</a> in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> in 1964.

Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: "Pineapple Poll" and "<a href="La%20fille%20mal%20gard%C3%A9e%20%28Ashton%29">La fille mal gardée</a>". In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, "Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for "Fille" amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – "except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life".
Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but "through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects". <a href="Geraint%20Evans">Sir Geraint Evans</a> commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: "[His] design for <a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a> was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work."

Lancaster's old-fashioned persona, together with his choice of a countess as his principal cartoon mouthpiece, led some to assume his politics were on the right of the spectrum. But despite what he described as his strong traditionalist feelings he was a floating voter: "I've voted Tory and Labour in my time and I think once, in a moment of total mental aberration, voted Liberal." He distrusted the Conservatives for what he saw as their persistent bias in favour of property developers and against conservation. He rarely let his own views show obviously in his cartoons, but his hatred of political oppression was reflected in his portrayal of <a href="fascist">fascist</a>, <a href="communist">communist</a> and <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> regimes, and he refused to go to his beloved Greece while the military <a href="Greek%20military%20junta%20of%201967%E2%80%931974">junta</a> was in power from 1967 to 1974. In religion he described himself as "a <a href="Church%20of%20England">C of E</a> man ... with that embarrassment induced in all right-thinking men by any mention of God outside church."

Apart from an exhibition as an undergraduate, Lancaster had four large-scale shows of his works. The first was in <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> in 1955–56, when Betjeman opened an exhibition covering the range of Lancaster's output, including posters from the 1930s as well as cartoons, stage designs, watercolours and architectural drawings. In 1967 a London show concentrated on his costumes and scenery, with examples of work from plays, ballets, opera and, exceptionally, film ("<a href="Those%20Magnificent%20Men%20in%20their%20Flying%20Machines">Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines</a>", 1965). In 1973, at the instigation of <a href="Roy%20Strong">Roy Strong</a>, the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery</a> mounted "The Littlehampton Bequest", for which Lancaster painted portraits of Willy Littlehampton's supposed ancestors and offspring, in the style of artists down the centuries, from <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Holbein</a> to <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Van Dyck</a> and <a href="Peter%20Lely">Lely</a>, and then to <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Reynolds</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Gainsborough">Gainsborough</a> and on to <a href="John%20Singer%20Sargent">Sargent</a> and <a href="David%20Hockney">Hockney</a>. Strong wrote an introduction to the book Lancaster published of the collected portraits. To mark the centenary of Lancaster's birth, <a href="The%20Wallace%20Collection">The Wallace Collection</a> staged an exhibition titled "Cartoons and Coronets: The Genius of Osbert Lancaster" from October 2008 to January 2009. It was curated by James Knox, the editor and author of a lavishly-illustrated biography and catalogue with the same title as the exhibition.

Lancaster's honours included his <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a>, his <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> in the <a href="1953%20Coronation%20Honours">1953 Coronation Honours</a> and an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">D.Litt</a> from <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>, as well as honorary degrees from <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">Birmingham</a> (1964), <a href="University%20of%20Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> (1970), and <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a> (1974).

In 2008, the year of Lancaster's centenary, <a href="Peter%20York">Peter York</a> called him "A national treasure ... arguably Britain's most popular newspaper cartoonist, certainly our most effective, popular architectural historian and illustrator and one of the most inspired 20th-century theatre, opera and ballet designers." But York added that in recent years Lancaster had been largely forgotten: "People under 40 don't know him", as they still knew Betjeman from his many television programmes. The "Oxford Companion to English Literature" called Lancaster "a writer, artist, cartoonist, and theatre designer, whose many illustrated works gently mock the English way of life: he was particularly good at country‐house and upper‐class architecture and mannerisms, but also had a sharp eye for suburbia." The obituary in "The Times" described him as "the most polite and unsplenetic of cartoonists, he was never a crusader, remaining always a witty, civilized critic with a profound understanding of the vagaries of human nature." Sir Roy Strong wrote that Lancaster's cartoons were those "of a gentleman of the old school ... He never crossed into the brilliant savagery of <a href="Gerald%20Scarfe">Gerald Scarfe</a> or "<a href="Spitting%20Image">Spitting Image</a>". The one-liners in his pocket cartoons were <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Cowardesque</a>".

Although he was much praised at the time – Anthony Powell said, "Osbert kept people going by his own high spirits and wit" – Lancaster was conscious that the work of a political cartoonist is ephemeral, and he did not expect longevity for his topical drawings. His legacy as a pocket cartoonist has been the genre itself; his successors in the national press have included <a href="Mel%20Calman">Mel Calman</a>, <a href="Michael%20Heath%20%28cartoonist%29">Michael Heath</a>, <a href="Mark%20Boxer">Marc</a>, <a href="Matt%20Pritchett">Matt</a> and <a href="Wally%20Fawkes">Trog</a>. Despite the topical nature of Lancaster's cartoons, they remain of interest to the historian; Lucie-Smith quotes a contemporary tribute by <a href="Moran%20Caplat">Moran Caplat</a>: "No social history of this [20th] century will be complete without him. He has joined the handful of artists who, over the last three hundred years, have each in their time mirrored our nation."

"The Times" said of Lancaster's stage designs, "When the history of Glyndebourne comes to be written, high in the roll of honour will stand the name of Osbert Lancaster, who has the great gift of designing décor that invigorates every opera". But although theatre designs are less ephemeral than topical cartoons, in general they have a practical lifetime measured in years or at most a few decades. The survival of Lancaster's costumes and scenery for "Pineapple Poll" and "La fille mal gardée" into the 21st century is exceptional, and most of even his highest-praised productions for repertory works have been succeeded by new designs by artists from Hockney to <a href="Ultz">Ultz</a>.

Lancaster's prose style divided opinion. Betjeman teased him that it was "deliciously convoluted"; Boston and Knox both echo this view. But Beaverbrook's right-hand man, George Malcolm Thompson, said of Lancaster, "The annoying thing at the "Express" was that he was not only the only one who could draw; he could also "write" better than anyone in the building."

Lancaster's most enduring works have been his architectural books. "Pillar to Post" and its successors have been reissued in various editions, and at 2018 are in print as a boxed set entitled "Cartoons, Columns and Curlicues", containing "Pillar to Post", "Homes Sweet Homes" and "Drayneflete Revealed". Reviewing the new edition in "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>", Niall McGarrigle wrote, "The books are of their time, of course, but their legacy is part of the strong heritage culture that we rightly fight for today". <a href="Alan%20Powers">Alan Powers</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Financial%20Times">The Financial Times</a>", "At least old buildings are now cherished rather better, and the house fronts around Lancaster's birthplace in Notting Hill are jollied up in his favourite pinks and mauves ... now we understand that the compact streets and houses of the past provide the best opportunity for social encounters and save energy, and that even bad buildings can make us smile. For both of these revelations, we owe Osbert Lancaster a lot."

Hoodwinked!

Hoodwinked! (alternatively styled Hoodwinked) is a 2005 American <a href="computer-animated">computer-animated</a> <a href="Family%20film">family</a> <a href="comedy%20film">comedy film</a>. It retells the folktale "<a href="Little%20Red%20Riding%20Hood">Little Red Riding Hood</a>" as a police investigation, using flashbacks to show multiple characters' points of view. It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with <a href="Kanbar%20Entertainment">Kanbar Entertainment</a>, directed and written by <a href="Cory%20Edwards">Cory Edwards</a>, <a href="Todd%20Edwards%20%28film%20writer%29">Todd Edwards</a>, and <a href="Tony%20Leech">Tony Leech</a>, and produced by <a href="Katie%20Hooten">Katie Hooten</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Kanbar">Maurice Kanbar</a>, <a href="David%20K.%20Lovegren">David K. Lovegren</a>, <a href="Sue%20Bea%20Montgomery">Sue Bea Montgomery</a>, and <a href="Preston%20Stutzman">Preston Stutzman</a>. The film was released by <a href="The%20Weinstein%20Company">The Weinstein Company</a> in Los Angeles, California, on December 16, 2005 for a one-week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13, 2006. The cast features <a href="Anne%20Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a>, <a href="Glenn%20Close">Glenn Close</a>, <a href="Jim%20Belushi">Jim Belushi</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Warburton">Patrick Warburton</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Anderson">Anthony Anderson</a>, <a href="David%20Ogden%20Stiers">David Ogden Stiers</a>, <a href="Xzibit">Xzibit</a>, <a href="Chazz%20Palminteri">Chazz Palminteri</a> and <a href="Andy%20Dick">Andy Dick</a>.

"Hoodwinked!" was among the earliest computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, with a less-realistic design inspired by <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until near the end of production, and while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.

Structurally, the film was inspired by non-linear crime dramas, such as "<a href="Rashomon%20%28film%29">Rashomon</a>" and "<a href="Pulp%20Fiction%20%28film%29">Pulp Fiction</a>". It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful "<a href="Shrek%20franchise">Shrek</a>" series, which accentuated the <a href="fairy%20tale%20parody">fairy tale parody</a> genre of which it is a part. The film however, intentionally deviated from that series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements. This was in part based on Cory Edwards' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre.

Critical reception to the film was varied; although its script and cast were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized. The film was a commercial success, earning over thirteen times its less-than-$8 million budget. A sequel, "<a href="Hoodwinked%20Too%21%20Hood%20vs.%20Evil">Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil</a>", directed by <a href="Mike%20Disa">Mike Disa</a>, and written by the Edwards brothers and Leech, was released in 2011 to negative reviews and financial failure.

Little Red Riding Hood (<a href="Anne%20Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a>) discovers that the Big Bad Wolf (<a href="Patrick%20Warburton">Patrick Warburton</a>) has disguised himself as her grandmother. Granny (<a href="Glenn%20Close">Glenn Close</a>) jumps out of the closet tied up just as the axe-wielding woodsman (<a href="Jim%20Belushi">Jim Belushi</a>) bursts through the window, startling everyone. The police quickly arrive, and Red, Wolf, Granny, and the Woodsman are questioned by Detective Nicky Flippers (<a href="David%20Ogden%20Stiers">David Ogden Stiers</a>) about the events leading up to the incident.

Red explains that she was delivering goodies for her grandmother when she discovered a threat from the mysterious Goodie Bandit. Hoping to save her Granny's recipes, she embarked upon a journey to take them to the top of a nearby mountain where her Granny lives. On her way, she encountered the Wolf, who asked her a series of suspicious questions. She managed to escape and eventually reached her Granny's house; however, she found the Wolf already waiting in ambush.

What at first seems to be an open-and-shut case becomes confused though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits. Locating Red, he questioned her, hoping to get to the bottom of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Granny's house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.

When questioned, the Woodsman, Kirk, reveals that he is in fact an aspiring actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his <a href="schnitzel">schnitzel</a> truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he went out into the woods to get in character for his role and spent the rest of the day chopping trees. A large tree rolled after him and pushed him through the window of Granny's home. The investigation then turns to Granny, who reveals that, unbeknownst to her family, she is an extreme sports enthusiast. During a ski race earlier that day, she was attacked by the opposing team, but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goody Bandit.

Despondent over her Granny's lack of honesty, Red wanders off alone. Meanwhile, Nicky Flippers realizes that the one commonality between all four stories is a bunny named Boingo (<a href="Andy%20Dick">Andy Dick</a>) and concludes that he is the Goody Bandit. However, Boingo has already sneaked into the home and stolen Granny's recipes. Red sees Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station, but the police pursue him in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and Kirk manage to locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red. Boingo plans to add an addictive substance to the stolen recipes and then destroy the forest, making way for new real estate for expanding his business.

The Wolf and Kirk go undercover to distract Boingo as Granny sneaks into his lair, but open conflict ensues. Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red down the mountain in a cable car loaded with explosives and Granny goes after her, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red manages to free herself, and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been located by the Wolf's squirrel assistant Twitchy (<a href="Cory%20Edwards">Cory Edwards</a>), are waiting at the bottom of the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen. Some time later, Kirk finds success as part of a yodeling troupe, and Red, Granny, the Wolf, and Twitchy are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join a crime solving organization called Happily Ever After Agency.

"Hoodwinked!" was one of the first independent <a href="computer-animated">computer-animated</a> films to be produced without the aid of a distributor. It was produced on a budget of less than $8 million,
significantly less than a typical computer-animated film's budget.
The costs of computer-animation software had only recently decreased to a price that was accessible to more than just major studios, and according to producer David Lovegren, "Six or seven years ago, the idea of doing "Hoodwinked!" as an independent [animated] feature would have been impossible."

The filmmakers only made the film independently by necessity,
and Cory Edwards has said, "It's not a model to be followed. It was a once-in-a-lifetime, seat-of-your-pants kind of thing that just barely came off."
However, he added that the process was worth going through to get the film made, and encouraged aspiring filmmakers to be willing to follow it.

Brothers Cory and <a href="Todd%20Edwards%20%28film%20writer%29">Todd Edwards</a> founded <a href="Blue%20Yonder%20Films">Blue Yonder Films</a> after a number of years spent producing <a href="Television%20advertisement">commercials</a> and <a href="music%20videos">music videos</a> in Tulsa. Joined by their friend Preston Stutzman, who was put in charge of marketing for the company, they released their first feature film, "<a href="Chillicothe%20%28film%29">Chillicothe</a>", at the 1999 <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. The three then moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of new opportunities, but did not find the amount of success that they had expected.
<a href="Sue%20Bea%20Montgomery">Sue Bea Montgomery</a>, who had served as an associate producer on "Chillicothe", also tried to interest studios in working with them, but was met with indifference. She determined that they would have to find greater success in independent filmmaking before anyone would take interest in them and introduced the three to <a href="Maurice%20Kanbar">Maurice Kanbar</a>, a successful entrepreneur who had made a minor investment in "Chillicothe".
They pitched a number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and proposed that he invest in a development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent in exchange for a significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a <a href="direct-to-DVD">direct-to-DVD</a> computer-animated short film that Cory had made called "Wobots". He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>" or "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>", but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as "<a href="Rashomon%20%28film%29">Rashomon</a>", "<a href="Pulp%20Fiction%20%28film%29">Pulp Fiction</a>", "<a href="Run%20Lola%20Run">Run Lola Run</a>", and "<a href="Memento%20%28film%29">Memento</a>" and came up with the idea of telling the <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a> "<a href="Little%20Red%20Riding%20Hood">Little Red Riding Hood</a>" as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.
Kanbar was taken with the idea and agreed to fully finance the film before even seeing a finished script, with the initial intent of releasing the film directly to DVD. In 2002, Kanbar and Montgomery founded <a href="Kanbar%20Entertainment">Kanbar Entertainment</a> and <a href="Kanbar%20Animation">Kanbar Animation</a> for the production of the film.

Cory served as the film's main director, as he had more experience with animation, comedy, and children's entertainment, while Todd served as co-director. Montgomery and Stutzman were joined by <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> animation veteran David Lovegren as producers on the film, and Cory's and Todd's sister <a href="Katie%20Hooten">Katie Hooten</a> joined as an associate producer. Tony Leech, who had worked with the Edwards brothers on "Chillicothe", was initially hired as an editor, but gained story input as well. He eventually proved to be so valuable to the production that he was given a role as co-director.

The filmmakers found independently producing the film to have both benefits and challenges. Although they were given a great amount of creative control by their executive producer Maurice Kanbar, their small budget kept them from making potentially beneficial changes to the story once production was underway. Todd Edwards related that "Money doesn't just buy you more talent and more machinery, it also buys you flexibility on a story level. At Disney, if they don't like the third act, they just throw the whole thing out and re-animate the whole thing, even if it's finished ... We had no such luxury, and so in a way, you're watching our first version of the movie."
Knowing ahead of time their inability to alter the film's script once animating had begun, an effort was made by the filmmakers to finalize the script as much as possible before the start of production, which is not a common practice for studio-produced animated films.

Turning away from the well-known <a href="archetype">archetype</a>s of the "Little Red Riding Hood" characters, the filmmakers continued to look towards non-linear crime dramas for inspiration instead. Producer Preston Stutzman explained that "The whole film is about surprises and secret lives."
Not wanting Red to be "boring" or "too innocent", she was patterned on <a href="James%20Dean">James Dean</a> and given the desire of leaving home to find her way in the world. Todd Edwards had the idea of basing the Wolf on <a href="Chevy%20Chase">Chevy Chase</a>'s character in "<a href="Fletch%20%28film%29">Fletch</a>", feeling that it would be fun to apply the character's dry, deadpan style of humor to an animated wolf, while Cory Edwards created the hyperactive character of Twitchy to serve as the Wolf's <a href="foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a>. Going against types, Red's Granny was written as a thrill-seeking action hero, while the strong Woodsman was written as being childishly incompetent.

The police officers were written to come across as everyday guys and Cory Edwards has explained that the decision to make three of them pigs was not politically motivated.
Nicky Flippers was not a part of the story as it was initially conceived and prior to his creation, the investigation was going to be led by Chief Grizzly. After producer Sue Bea Montgomery and her husband pointed out similarities between the film and the 1950s television series "<a href="The%20Thin%20Man%20%28TV%20series%29">The Thin Man</a>", the Edwards brothers and Leech decided to introduce the character and his dog into the film as an homage. They considered several different types of animals before settling on making him a frog.

Cory Edwards chose to approach the film predominantly as an action/comedy, instead of as a typical animated film, and wrote the script to appeal to audiences of any age like many of the films produced by <a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> or Disney.
"<a href="Wile%20E.%20Coyote%20and%20Road%20Runner">Road Runner</a>", "<a href="Rocky%20and%20Bullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a>", and "<a href="The%20Muppets">The Muppets</a>" have all been cited as inspirations for the film. An attempt was made to distance the film from "<a href="Shrek%20franchise">Shrek</a>" and other similar themed films that had been recently released, by excluding <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>, <a href="Magician%20%28fantasy%29">wizards</a>, and <a href="Fairy">fairies</a> from the film.
Cory Edwards also strived for a different style of humor than "Shrek", choosing to make his film more <a href="family-friendliness">family friendly</a> and less of a satire.

Working out of Tony Leech's apartment, Cory Edwards sketched the film's <a href="storyboards">storyboards</a>, Todd Edwards wrote the script while simultaneously writing the songs, and Leech edited the <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Animatic">story reel</a> on his <a href="Macintosh">Mac computer</a>. Producer Sue Bea Montgomery showed test screenings of the story reel to children in her neighborhood, and gained input from their reactions. The filmmakers had been considering removing Japeth, but chose not to when he proved popular at these screenings. The children also particularly liked Twitchy, which led to the expansion of the character's role.

In an effort to save costs, the film's cast was originally going to be composed mostly of friends and family members of the filmmakers.
Cory and Todd brought in their cousin Tye Edwards to play Dolph and turned to their friend Joshua J. Greene to play Jimmy Lizard.
Japeth was written specifically for Benjy Gaither, the son of <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a> singers <a href="Bill%20Gaither%20%28gospel%20singer%29">Bill</a> and <a href="Gloria%20Gaither">Gloria Gaither</a>. He had been a friend of the Edwards brothers since childhood and Cory's short film "Wobots" had been produced through his animation studio Live Bait Productions.
Cory's wife Vicki was given the role of a skunk reporter, and while some consideration was initially given to having an adult play the child woodpecker Quill, the role was instead given to producer David K. Lovegren's daughter Kathryn.
The Edwards brothers, Leech, and producer Preston Stutzman all took on roles as well. Cory took on the role of Twitchy, and <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> was used to speed up the recording of his dialogue by 50 percent.
Todd played Sandwich Man, Leech played both Det. Bill Stork and Glen, and Stutzman played Timmy.

As the producers gained greater confidence in the film however, larger name actors were brought in. Patrick Warburton was the first celebrity actor to join the film and did so purely out of a love for the script. Though Cory Edwards had originally envisioned the Wolf as sounding like a mixture between a young Chevy Chase and <a href="Bill%20Murray">Bill Murray</a>, he praised Warburton's performance, saying that he "made the Wolf his own character." Andy Dick also joined the cast early on, to voice Boingo. He used <a href="improvisation">improvisation</a> and approached the role differently from how it had been written, interpreting the character as victimized and unstable. The filmmakers were enthusiastic over Dick's angle on the character, and Todd Edwards said, "What we had written was kind of stock, to be honest, but Andy Dick, well, where he was supposed to laugh, he'd be crying. Where he was supposed to yell, he'd be laughing. He just mixed it up!" Prolific <a href="Voice%20acting">voice performers</a> Tara Strong, David Ogden Stiers, and Tom Kenny were cast in multiple roles. Strong was cast as Red and Zorra, Stiers was cast as Kirk, the Woodsman and Nicky Flippers, and Kenny was cast as Tommy and Woolworth the Sheep. <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a>-winning actress <a href="Sally%20Struthers">Sally Struthers</a> was brought in to play Granny Puckett and <a href="Joel%20McCrary">Joel McCrary</a> was cast as Chief Grizzly.

The film's animation was created on <a href="Autodesk%20Maya">Maya</a> software, and in an effort to save costs, was produced in <a href="Manila%2C%20Philippines">Manila, Philippines</a>.
Producers Sue Bea Montgomery and David K. Lovegren founded the animation studio Digital Eyecandy for the purpose of the film's production
and stationed it in a 5,000-square-foot rented house. Cory Edwards traveled to this studio a total of fifteen times over the course of the film's three-year production and has explained that although the house was located in an expensive part of Manila, the rent was no more than that of his two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. When Cory was not able to be on site, Todd took over directing duties. "Along with Tony, we were kind of a 'three headed monster,'" Cory explains. "We all knew what movie we were making, and I trusted those guys to make creative calls when I couldn't be there." Lovegren had attempted to start an independent animation studio in the Philippines before in 2001, but the studio, called ImagineAsia, was closed after it failed to attract business. Digital Eyecandy hired approximately twenty animators that had previously been employed by ImagineAsia
and at one point, the studio reached fifty employees.

The film's animators had little experience with computer-animation and feature-length films, and had to be trained by the producers over the course of the film's production. Since none of the animators were specialists, they were not divided into specific teams, but instead each worked on all areas of the animating process. The filmmakers found this to be a poor method though, because it kept the individual skills of the animators from being optimized. Due to their independent backgrounds, the animators were accustomed to working at fast paces, and despite their small numbers, each phase of production was able to be completed within a short period of time. Still, schedule and budget restraints led the filmmakers to enlist <a href="Prana%20Studios">Prana Studios</a> in Mumbai, India to perform <a href="lighting">lighting</a> and <a href="compositing">compositing</a>.

The filmmakers found that the most difficult aspect of producing the film independently was their inability to fix all of the mistakes made in the film's animation. Todd Edwards explained that "it becomes an equation: 'I have 10 things that I would like to change in this shot. I have the time and the budget to do three. Pick those three and then let's move on.' And that was hard to do."

Knowing that they could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead designed to imitate the look of <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a>. Cory Edwards cited <a href="Rankin-Bass">Rankin-Bass</a> as an inspiration and explained, "If we approach our look like that – photographed miniatures in stop-motion – and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look, then we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures." Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film "<a href="Howard%20the%20Duck%20%28film%29">Howard the Duck</a>" with the simple, but beloved puppet character <a href="Kermit%20the%20Frog">Kermit the Frog</a> to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.

Distancing the film from what producer Preston Stutzman called the "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world[s]" of other CG animated films, an attempt was made to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. "<a href="The%20Nightmare%20Before%20Christmas">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>" was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her look more like a doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that "CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic, but "Hoodwinked" takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon."

The film's score was composed by <a href="John%20Mark%20Painter">John Mark Painter</a>, who along with his wife Fleming McWilliams, constituted the <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> duo <a href="Fleming%20and%20John">Fleming and John</a> in the 1990s. The Edwards brothers were fans of the group and first met Painter while Cory was performing in an animated film on which Painter served as the composer. The score was inspired by music from the 1960s and the soundtracks to "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%281968%20film%29">Planet of the Apes</a>", "<a href="Dark%20Shadows">Dark Shadows</a>", and "<a href="The%20Untouchables%20%28film%29">The Untouchables</a>" have been cited as influences, as well as the works of <a href="Henry%20Mancini">Henry Mancini</a>.
It was recorded in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, where <a href="Kristin%20Wilkinson">Kristin Wilkinson</a> served as the <a href="orchestrator">orchestrator</a> and <a href="conducting">conductor</a>.

In an effort to appeal to older audience members, Todd Edwards chose to replace parts of Painter's score with original rock music. From this came the song "Little Boat", written and sung by <a href="Daniel%20Rogers%20%28songwriter%29">Daniel Rogers</a>, who had composed Edwards' first film "Chillicothe".
"Runaway" was written by Joshua J. Greene, a friend of the Edwards brothers, who also provided the voice of Jimmy Lizard in the film. "The Real G", sung by Cory Edwards and "Bounce", sung by <a href="Todd%20Collins%20%28singer%29">Todd Collins</a> were both written by Painter and Cory Edwards. "Blow Your House Down" was performed by the Filipino band <a href="Pupil%20%28band%29">Pupil</a> and written by their lead singer <a href="Ely%20Buendia">Ely Buendia</a>.

Todd Edwards wrote nine original songs for the film and sung four of them: "Critters Have Feelings", "Tree Critter", "Eva Deanna", and "Glow". "Eva Deanna" was written about a day that he and his wife spent at the zoo with their niece, the daughter of associate producer Katie Hooten.
"Glow" was written about the Edwards siblings' grandmother, Vera, who had died a few years earlier. "Great Big World" was sung by Anne Hathaway and replaced another song called "Woods Go-Round", which Edwards considered too childish and described as being "in the vein of Saturday morning cartoons." This change required the scene to be re-animated and re-cut. "Be Prepared" was sung by Benjy Gaither and developed out of a practicality; the filmmakers wanted to introduce Japeth while the character is rocking back and forth on his horns, as though the horns are a rocking chair. However, they realized that this would make the horns too big to fit in a minecart later on in the film. As a solution, they came up with the gag of having the character switch his horns several times, and this led to the song's concept.
McWilliams joined Jim Belushi to sing "The Schnitzel Song" and Painter asked his longtime friend <a href="Ben%20Folds">Ben Folds</a> to sing "Red is Blue", a selection strongly advocated for by Edwards. Folds was working on a new album at the time, but a year after the proposal, found the opportunity to record the song and compose a piano arrangement for it as well.
"Top of the Woods" was sung by Andy Dick and was originally composed to be slow-paced. The recording of Dick's performance was sped up though at the suggestion of Ralf Palmer, a prolific animator and friend of producer Sue Bea Montgomery.

"Hoodwinked!" was shown to potential distributors throughout various stages of its production. Though a distribution offer was made by <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a>, it was turned down as the filmmakers did not feel that it was a good deal. As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. <a href="Harvey%20Weinstein">Harvey</a> and <a href="Bob%20Weinstein">Bob Weinstein</a> were also at the festival at the time, screening <a href="Robert%20Rodriguez">Robert Rodriguez</a>'s film "<a href="Sin%20City%20%28film%29">Sin City</a>", which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, <a href="The%20Weinstein%20Company">The Weinstein Company</a>. They decided to pick "Hoodwinked!" up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films.

The Weinsteins had recently left the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Company">Walt Disney Company</a> and according to Cory Edwards, they "loved the idea of picking up an animated film and giving Disney a run for their money." The involvement of the Weinstein Company encouraged Kanbar enough to enlist <a href="Skywalker%20Sound">Skywalker Sound</a>. The film was nearly complete by the time that the Weinsteins became involved, and Edwards has stated that nothing was done by them to ruin "the original vision of the movie." However, a few edit suggestions were made to quicken the film's pace which Edwards felt were good ideas, as he considered the first twenty minutes to be dragging.

The Weinstein Company also heavily recast the film with bigger-name actors in the hopes of attracting a larger audience. Anne Hathaway replaced Tara Strong in the lead role of Red; Jim Belushi replaced David Ogden Stiers in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman; Anthony Anderson replaced Tony Leech in the role of Det. Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly; and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Despite these recastings, Tara Strong retained the much-smaller role of Zorra, David Ogden Stiers retained the role of Nicky Flippers, Tom Kenny retained the role of Tommy, and Tony Leech retained the role of Glen. Many high-profile country singers were considered to replace Benjy Gaither in the role of Japeth, but none of them were available and Gaither retained the role. The Weinsteins also wanted to replace Joshua J. Greene in the role of Jimmy Lizard with a more famous actor such as <a href="Albert%20Brooks">Albert Brooks</a>, but the role was ultimately not recast. Edwards appreciated the reason for the recastings and attributed a large part of the film's financial success to them. He expressed disappointment about the amount of recasting however, saying, "At a certain point it became Recast-o-Rama, everybody got recast-happy. My feeling is, you get two or three names on that poster, you're fine. Our Hoodwinked poster has like a paragraph of names on it. After a certain point, I don't think you need more than two, three celebrities – give it to the voice actors. It sweetens the pot." Since the film's animation had already been mostly completed by the time the recastings were made, the new actors had to deliver their lines exactly as the old actors had done, giving them no opportunity to improvise. Edwards expressed disappointment with the fact that the original actors would not get any credit for their improvisations in the film, which were copied by the replacement actors.

The soundtrack was released in December 2005. Owing to legal disputes, the CD was pulled off of the market a month after its release
and was not available again until November 2009.
It was re-released on <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes</a> in January 2010.

"Hoodwinked!" received a one-week, limited release in Los Angeles on December 16, 2005 to qualify for Oscar consideration.
A nationwide U.S. release was scheduled for Christmas Day, 2005, but it was moved to January 13, 2006 to avoid competition with other films released during the holiday season.

"Hoodwinked!" was released on DVD on May 2, 2006 and on Blu-ray and DVD on February 15, 2011. The film was the best-selling DVD in its initial week of release, selling over 700,000 copies and making over $13.5 million.
A twenty-two-minute behind the scenes video podcast is available for free on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>.

In its opening four-day weekend, "Hoodwinked!" grossed $16,879,402 in 2,394 theaters in the United States, ranking  2 at the box office and averaging $7,050 per venue.
It fell $50,000 short of "<a href="Glory%20Road%20%28film%29">Glory Road</a>", which took the box office's number-one spot that week.
The film maintained its number-two spot in the box office for its second weekend, dropping 16.1 percent, and placed in the top ten for a total of five weeks. At the end of its theatrical run it had grossed a total of $110,013,167 worldwide – $51,386,611 in the United States and $58,626,556 in other territories.

"Hoodwinked!" received mixed reviews from critics. On <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film has a rating of 47%, based on 124 reviews. The site's consensus reads, "This fractured fairytale doesn't have the wit or animation quality to compete with the likes of the "Shrek" franchise." On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, it received a score of 45 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

James Berardinelli of <a href="ReelViews">ReelViews</a> gave the film two and a half stars out of four, and claimed that many of the film's ideas for altering its familiar storyline "sound better on paper than they turn out in execution." Finding it tedious to view the film's story told multiple times, he wrote that the film "slips into boredom." Bruce Westbrook of the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" also gave the film two and a half stars, and although he praised its "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" gave the film a C+ and called it "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children." He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">New York Daily News</a>" suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While <a href="Ty%20Burr">Ty Burr</a> of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, ""Hoodwinked" never builds to a level of sustained comic mania ... One aches to think what the great "<a href="Looney%20Tunes">Looney Tunes</a>" directors could have done with this material."

Several critics however, were more enthusiastic about the film. Owen Gleiberman of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave "Hoodwinked!" an A- and praised the zaniness of its humor. Calling the filmmakers heroes, he compared them to <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> and <a href="Steven%20Soderbergh">Steven Soderbergh</a> due to their potential for bringing independent filmmaking to prominence in animation.
Although Nancy Churnin of the "<a href="Dallas%20Morning%20News">Dallas Morning News</a>" considered the film inferior to those of Pixar and DreamWorks, she still gave it a B and wrote, "it's got an upstart charm, a clever premise, appealing characters voiced by a terrific cast and a script that should make you laugh out loud more than once."
In his review for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", Michael Wilmington praised the film's voice cast, music, and script, and wrote, "it packs more verbal wit and surprise than the usual cartoon."
Kevin Thomas of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" gave it three and a half stars out of five calling it "high-energy, imaginative entertainment".

Japeth was praised amongst both positive and negative reviews. Gleiberman and Churnin both felt that the character was one of the best parts of the film, and Westbrook and Wilmington both described him as "a hoot". In a mostly positive review for the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>", Roger Moore called the character hilarious,
while in a mostly negative review for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", Justin Chang wrote that the character "steals the show every minute he's onscreen."

One of the main criticisms of the film was the poor quality of its animation. Berardinelli called it some of the worst CGI animation in memory. He felt that the characters looked plastic, considered the backgrounds dull, and wrote, "On more than one occasion, I thought I was watching something made for TV. When compared to today's visual standards for animated films, Hoodwinked is far below the curve." Burr considered the film's surfaces poorly rendered and compared them to "<a href="Teletubbies">Teletubbieland</a> reupholstered with <a href="Naugahyde">Naugahyde</a>." Westbrook felt that the animation worked well for the animal characters, but wrote, "the humans have a glassy sheen and brittle hardness, much like work done in the early days of CG ... That art has come too far to embrace a throwback like Hoodwinked as lovably quaint. It's simply dated." Stephen Hunter of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" compared the characters to rubber toys, and wrote, "their faces are without nuance or vividness ... In movement, especially, do they lack grace and conviction. It seems like the recent breakthroughs in computerized magic have bypassed the poor Edwards fellows, as it looks stuck somewhere in the 1970s, or maybe even earlier."

Many reviews negatively compared the film to the "Shrek" series. Liam Lacey of "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" considered the film to be "a sort of discount Shrek", while Burr called it ""Shrek" with added drek." Westbrook wrote that "Echoing such a popular predecessor as Shrek is not a good thing – especially when the echo is so faint." Berardinelli felt that the fairy tale references were not as smartly done as in the first Shrek film, while Bernard felt that "Hoodwinked!" took fairy tale revisionism too far. He felt that the humor in "Shrek" worked due to the fairy tale characters remaining in character throughout the film, and wrote, "It's pointless to scold them for behaving the way fairy tales intended, and that's far funnier than turning them into breakdancing anachronisms." Bill Muller of "<a href="The%20Arizona%20Republic">The Arizona Republic</a>", considered Red's kung fu abilities to be overly similar to <a href="Princess%20Fiona">Princess Fiona's</a> ""<a href="The%20Matrix">Matrix</a>" agility." Gleiberman also noted the similarities between the film and "Shrek", but he was positive in the comparison, feeling that its independent production gave the filmmakers "the freedom to follow their flakiest corkscrew whims." While Wilmington did not find "Hoodwinked!" as impressive or beguiling as "Shrek", he wrote that "when it's cooking, it does make you laugh."

Retrospectively, several critics noted that the film was considerably better than the 2007 computer-animated <a href="fairy%20tale%20parody">fairy tale parody</a> film "<a href="Happily%20N%27Ever%20After">Happily N'Ever After</a>". Although Burr had given "Hoodwinked!" a negative review, he likened the film to "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>" in comparison to "Happily N'Ever After". Wilmington also considered "Hoodwinked!" the superior of the two films, and Lou Lumenick of the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" felt that the film was far wittier than "Happily N'Ever After". While Christy Lemire of <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> likened "Hoodwinked!" to a poor man's "Shrek", she went on to call "Happily N'Ever After" a poor man's "Hoodwinked!"

In 2018, <a href="Richard%20Brody">Richard Brody</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" called "Hoodwinked!" one of the top independent films for families. Acknowledging the crudeness of the animation, he nonetheless praised the writing as "bold and funny" and wrote that the direction "displays admirable comic timing." Brody considered the character personalities distinct from those in other animated comedies. He also commended the vocal performances for having a "zippy, brash energy that doesn't feel condescending". "Hoodwinked!" has also been praised by <a href="Tony%20Bancroft">Tony Bancroft</a>, who co-directed "<a href="Mulan%20%281998%20film%29">Mulan</a>".

"Hoodwinked!" received a <a href="Saturn%20Award">Saturn Award</a> nomination for <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Animated%20Film">Best Animated Film</a> at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Science%20Fiction%2C%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Horror%20Films">Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films</a>, but lost to "<a href="Corpse%20Bride">Corpse Bride</a>". "Entertainment Weekly" ranked the film as number ten on "The Must List" for its January 27, 2006 issue, calling it a "genre-busting indie animated gem."

In February 2006, author Timothy Sexton wrote an article titled "Hoodwinked: A Postmodern Examination of the Dangers of Runaway Capitalism" for "<a href="Associated%20Content">Associated Content</a>", in which he posited that "Hoodwinked!" was one of the first postmodern animated films and also carried political undertones. He argued that the relative nature of truth was shown by revealing deviations from the original fairy tale as the film explored the story from each of the central characters' points of view. Calling "Hoodwinked!" "the most subversive movie released nationwide since "<a href="Fahrenheit%209/11">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>"", Sexton went on to interpret the film as a critique on the <a href="free%20enterprise%20system">free enterprise system</a>. He drew comparisons between the film's villain and the typical American business owner, going so far as to say that the character was "clearly based on people like <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="Sam%20Walton">Sam Walton</a>". In Sexton's view, the film exposed the flaws of capitalism, showing that if left unregulated, business owners will establish monopolies and eliminate competition.

The film's director and co-writer Cory Edwards was surprised by Sexton's interpretation and denied that the film intentionally carried any political messages. He explained that he and the other filmmakers were simply drawing from the evil schemes common of "<a href="James%20Bond%20in%20film">James Bond</a>" films, "Bugs Bunny" cartoons, and "<a href="The%20A-Team">The A-Team</a>", and wrote "If Mr. Sexton sees my movie as a sermon against mega-corporations monopolizing America, that's fine. But our villain is just as easily the face of every dictator in history, or every schoolyard bully who is compensating for low self-esteem, or any Mafia boss who dominates by either absorbing or wiping out his competition. Hey, if you look at an abstract painting and see the devil in a red splotch, that's your prerogative ... I guess a movie's message is only partially supplied by the filmmaker."

In May 2007 "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine ran an article by James Poniewozik titled "Is "Shrek" Bad for Kids?" which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned "Hoodwinked!" writing, "I thought "Hoodwinked!" and most of the "Shrek" series were hilarious ... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, "As the writer-director of "Hoodwinked", it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We went to great lengths to distance our film from "Shrek"s humor (and no, I don't think "Shrek" considers kids). I would hope that "Hoodwinked" and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not."

A sequel, "Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil", was released on April 29, 2011. It was first announced in January 2006
and in February, Cory Edwards, Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech explained that although they would be writing the screenplay, they would not return to direct. Cory Edwards later elaborated on this decision, explaining that he had a negative experience working with some of the first film's "key players" and felt that he had been poorly treated by them.
He also cited concerns over being confined to animation, and stated that he felt it would be a lateral move to direct a sequel to his first film as his second film. In March 2007, Edwards announced that <a href="Mike%20Disa">Mike Disa</a> had been hired to direct the sequel and expressed enthusiasm over his involvement, saying that he "has a real passion for the film and a devotion to maintaining the "Hoodwinked" world. He wants to do the sequel justice and he really gets what we're trying to do."
Although much of the first film's cast returned for the sequel, Anne Hathaway was replaced by <a href="Hayden%20Panettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> in the role of Red and Jim Belushi was replaced by <a href="Martin%20Short">Martin Short</a> in the role of Kirk, the Woodsman.

Kanbar Entertainment initially intended to finance production of the sequel independently as it had done with the first film, but entered into a co-financing agreement proposed by The Weinstein Company.
The film was initially scheduled to be released on January 15, 2010, but in December 2009, The Weinstein Company postponed the film's release date indefinitely.
In April 2010, Kanbar Entertainment brought a lawsuit against The Weinstein Company. In addition to claiming that the postponement of the film's release date breached an agreement between the two companies, the lawsuit accused the Weinstein Company of not contributing to monthly production accounts after February, 2009, neglecting to consult Kanbar Entertainment of a release strategy, and not responding to proposed changes to the film, even though Kanbar Entertainment held "final authority on production decisions".

The film was a financial failure, earning $16.9 million worldwide; only about half of its budget.
Critical reception to the film was almost universally negative, with a Rotten score of 11% across 61 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 20/100 on Metacritic.
Cory Edwards expressed disappointment with the finished film, indicating that it was heavily altered from the original script and saying that it was "deflating to give this thing away and watch others run with it in ways I would not."

Sunderland Echo

The Sunderland Echo is a daily newspaper serving the <a href="City%20of%20Sunderland">Sunderland</a>, <a href="South%20Tyneside">South Tyneside</a> and <a href="Easington%20%28district%29">East Durham</a> areas of <a href="North%20East%20England">North East England</a>. The newspaper was founded by <a href="Samuel%20Storey">Samuel Storey</a>, <a href="Edward%20Backhouse">Edward Backhouse</a>, <a href="Edward%20Temperley%20Gourley">Edward Temperley Gourley</a>, <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Palmer%2C%201st%20Baronet">Charles Palmer</a>, <a href="Richard%20Ruddock">Richard Ruddock</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Glaholm">Thomas Glaholm</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Scott%20Turnbull">Thomas Scott Turnbull</a> in 1873, as the "Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette". Designed to provide a platform for the <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29">Radical</a> views held by Storey and his partners, it was also Sunderland's first local daily paper.

The inaugural edition of the "Echo" was printed in Press Lane, Sunderland on 22 December 1873; 1,000 copies were produced and sold for a <a href="Halfpenny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">halfpenny</a> each. The "Echo" survived intense competition in its early years, as well as the <a href="Great%20Depression">depression</a> of the 1930s and two World Wars. Sunderland was heavily bombed in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and, although the "Echo" building was undamaged, it was forced to print its competitor's paper under wartime rules. It was during this time that the paper's format changed, from a <a href="broadsheet">broadsheet</a> to its current <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> layout, because of national <a href="newsprint">newsprint</a> shortages.

The "Echo" is published Monday–Saturday and is part of the <a href="Johnston%20Press">Johnston Press</a> group—one of the United Kingdom's largest publishers of local and regional newspapers. As of December 2017, the paper had an average daily <a href="Newspaper%20circulation">circulation</a> of 11,075. It retails at 75 <a href="Penny%20sterling">pence</a>. The "Echo" was based at Echo House, <a href="Pennywell">Pennywell</a> Industrial Estate, Sunderland, from 1976 until April 2015. It now shares a site with sister papers the "<a href="Hartlepool%20Mail">Hartlepool Mail</a>" and "<a href="Shields%20Gazette">Shields Gazette</a>" at Alexander House,
1 Mandarin Road, Rainton Bridge Business Park, <a href="Houghton-le-Spring">Houghton-le-Spring</a>.

The "Sunderland Echo" is an award-winning evening newspaper, published from Monday to Saturday each week. The paper has a daily circulation of 11,075, with an overall readership of 41,557, representing about 12.5% of adults in the area. The news coverage provided by the "Echo" focuses mainly on local events, including human interest, crime and court stories, as well as reports on the local <a href="League%20One">League One</a> football team, <a href="Sunderland%20AFC">Sunderland AFC</a>.

Reader profile statistics suggest that 51% of "Echo" readers are male, and 49% are female. The highest proportion of readers, 18%, are between the ages of 45 and 54. Independent research carried out for the "Echo" in 2000 found readers spent an average of 33 minutes reading the paper. The same survey showed the "Echo" appealed to people across the range of <a href="demographics">demographics</a>, with between 44 and 50% of people in each <a href="Socioeconomics">socio-economic</a> grouping being regular readers. Current industry figures show between 14.5% and 19% of each socio-economic grouping in the area being readers 

The "Sunderland Echo" covers a circulation area of in North East England, which includes parts of <a href="South%20Tyneside">South Tyneside</a> and <a href="County%20Durham">County Durham</a>, as well as the city of Sunderland. <a href="Whitburn%2C%20South%20Tyneside">Whitburn</a>, <a href="Marsden%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Marsden</a> and <a href="The%20Boldons">The Boldons</a>, all to the north of Sunderland, are among the South Tyneside communities covered. <a href="Peterlee">Peterlee</a>, <a href="Horden">Horden</a>, <a href="Seaham">Seaham</a>, <a href="Dawdon">Dawdon</a>, <a href="Murton%2C%20County%20Durham">Murton</a> and <a href="Seaton%2C%20County%20Durham">Seaton</a>, to the south of Sunderland, are the main towns and villages in the East Durham circulation area. The paper is also sold in <a href="Washington%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Washington</a>, <a href="Bournmoor">Burnmoor</a> and <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>, which are to the west of Sunderland. Villages on the outskirts of the city, including <a href="Houghton-le-Spring">Houghton-le-Spring</a>, <a href="Penshaw">Penshaw</a>, <a href="Fencehouses">Fencehouses</a>, <a href="Ryhope">Ryhope</a> and <a href="Hetton-le-Hole">Hetton-le-Hole</a> are included in the circulation area too. The main newspaper rivals in the Sunderland and County Durham area include "<a href="The%20Northern%20Echo">The Northern Echo</a>", "<a href="The%20Journal%20%28newspaper%29">The Journal</a>", the "<a href="Hartlepool%20Mail">Hartlepool Mail</a>" and the "<a href="Evening%20Chronicle">Evening Chronicle</a>". The "Sunderland Star", a free weekly newspaper printed by the "Echo", is also distributed in the city. According to independent research conducted on behalf of the "Echo" in 2000, the "popularity of the "Echo" in Sunderland and East Durham is greater than that of all other regional newspapers put together".

In addition to the main newspaper, the "Echo" also produces a number of regular supplements and articles of specialist interest each week. These include sport and business supplements each Monday, a "Down Your Way" <a href="local%20news">local news</a> supplement on Tuesdays, jobs, <a href="Association%20football">junior football</a> and nostalgia features on Wednesdays, an entertainment supplement, cars guide and nostalgia stories on Thursdays and a property pull-out on Fridays. The Saturday edition includes a leisure pull-out, featuring fashion, entertainment and restaurant reviews, while a local history nostalgia supplement, "Retro", is published once a month. Nostalgia calendars, featuring old photographs of Sunderland and Seaham, are also produced.

The first edition of the "Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette" was printed on 22 December 1873, on a flat-bed press in Press Lane, Sunderland. Five hundred copies of the four-page issue were produced at noon and 4 pm, and sold for a halfpenny each.

Samuel Storey, a former teacher and future Sunderland mayor and Member of Parliament, founded the paper to provide a platform for his political views and to fill a gap in the newspaper market. Although the 100,000-strong population of Sunderland was already served by two weekly newspapers—"The Sunderland Times" and "The Sunderland Herald"—neither reflected the radical views held by Storey and his partners and there were no daily papers in the town. Storey promised readers in the first edition that, if things went wrong, "the "Echo" would try its best to put them right". But he added: "Always with moderation and without esteeming all those who oppose us as fools and knaves." Early copies of the "Echo" included lengthy reports of <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> meetings, and critical articles on Liberal opponents.
The "Sunderland Echo" was launched with an initial investment of £3,500, raised by donations of £500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quaker</a> banker Edward Backhouse, <a href="Shipbroking">shipbroker</a> and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, <a href="shipbuilder">shipbuilder</a> and MP Sir Charles Palmer, newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Lack of experience—only Ruddock had previous knowledge of newspaper management—and over-optimistic estimates of costs meant that the initial funds were quickly exhausted. Storey later admitted: "In our childlike, simple ways, we thought this might be sufficient, but in a few months all the money was gone, so we paid in another £3,500 and that soon went too." As the prospect of any great financial success receded, Ruddock, Gourley and Palmer withdrew from the project. Storey, however, remained dedicated to the idea, and took on their shares. A further £7,000 in investment from Storey enabled the remaining partners to abandon the "wheezing flat-bed press" and, in July 1876, the "Echo" moved to new premises at 14 Bridge Street, Sunderland.

Bridge Street remained the home of the "Echo" for the next 100 years. Old buildings were demolished, new machine and composing rooms built on West Wear Street and two rotary presses installed just before the move, each capable of printing 24,000 copies an hour. These changes brought about increased circulation, but it took another seven years before the "Echo" made a profit. It was a time of intense competition; the "Sunderland Times" converted from a bi-weekly to a daily paper in the same month as the "Echo" moved to Bridge Street, and <a href="Tory">Tory</a> supporters started a paper of their own, the "Sunderland Daily Post". The "Sunderland Times" was the first to collapse, but the "Post" survived for the next quarter of a century, providing the "Echo" with an often bitter rival.

Following the deaths of two further partners, Backhouse in 1879 and Turnbull in 1880, Storey bought their shares to become the "Echo"'s chief proprietor. A year later, in 1881, he met Scottish-born millionaire <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>, and formed a <a href="syndicate">syndicate</a> with him to set up new newspapers and buy up others. Among those purchased were the "<a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> Express and Star", the "Northern Daily Mail" in <a href="Hartlepool">Hartlepool</a> and the "<a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> Evening News". An attempt to buy the "<a href="Shields%20Gazette">Shields Gazette</a>", the country's oldest daily newspaper, failed. The syndicate finally broke up in 1885, with Storey retaining control of the "Echo", "<a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> Telegraph", "Portsmouth News" and the "Northern Daily Mail". These papers formed the basis of a new company, Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, formed in the 1930s. The 19th century ended with the rivalry between the "Echo" and the "Sunderland Daily Post" intensifying. The <a href="Silksworth">Silksworth</a> Colliery strike of 1891 pitted the two papers against each other, with the "Post" attacking Storey for having exploited the strike for political gain. Storey successfully sued for libel.

The new century saw the "Echo" falling behind the times in its production methods. Established as a "leading daily newspaper", it was one of the last to still be setting type by hand in 1900. This changed in 1902, when <a href="Linotype%20machine">Linotype</a> lead-setting machines were brought in to set type mechanically. A landslide victory for the Liberal Party followed at the 1906 <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">General Election</a>, which heralded a new era for the "Echo". The paper's old rival, the "Sunderland Daily Post", was discontinued six months later, and the "Football Echo" was launched on 7 September 1907.

<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> brought its own difficulties for the "Echo". Reporters went off to battle and, after the cost of <a href="newsprint">newsprint</a> soared, the paper was forced to double in price to a <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">penny</a>. The "Echo"'s 50th anniversary in 1923 was marked by a visit from company chairman Samuel Storey. Storey died two years later, three months after his eldest son Fred, and the chairmanship passed to another Samuel—Fred's elder son. In the same year, plans were laid to improve the Bridge Street premises. The work included enlarging the printing works and was completed by the end of the 1920s.

The <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">depression</a> of the 1930s brought <a href="Unemployment">mass unemployment</a> to Sunderland. But, for the "Echo", it was also a time of important structural changes in ownership. A new company controlling the three titles owned by the Storey family was formed in 1934—Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd. There was a change in name for the "Echo" too, when the word "Daily" was dropped from its title of "Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette". The decade also, however, brought a fire which destroyed most of the bound files of archive copies of the "Echo". Nineteenth-century editions of the "Echo" can only be accessed in <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> at the City Centre Library in Fawcett Street.

The Second World War brought havoc to <a href="Wearside">Wearside</a>, with Sunderland one of the seven most heavily bombed towns in the country. Despite the heavy shelling of the North East coast and <a href="River%20Wear">River Wear</a>, the "Echo" offices and printing plant escaped undamaged. The "Shields Gazette", the "Echo's" nearest rival, was not as fortunate. Its premises in Chapter Row, <a href="South%20Shields">South Shields</a>, were bombed in September 1941 and, under an emergency wartime arrangement, the paper was printed on the "Echo" presses. The "Echo" continued to be published throughout the war, despite paper <a href="rationing">rationing</a>, a lack of reporters and a strict censorship of photographs. The war did have one major impact on the "Echo"—in the form of its size. Wartime restrictions on newsprint reduced the former broadsheet to its present tabloid size, and this style has been retained ever since.

The post-war years saw the "Echo" drop "Shipping Gazette" from its main title-piece, following a redesign in 1959. Instead, the paper became known as "Echo Sunderland" for several years, although the name "Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette" continued to be printed in much smaller type above the new title. A further title-piece redesign in 1972, however, dispensed with the words "Shipping Gazette" and introduced an illustration of <a href="Wearmouth%20Bridge">Wearmouth Bridge</a> alongside the title "Echo Sunderland".

Following a major refurbishment of the Bridge Street base in the mid-1960s, the next milestones for the paper came in 1973. The first was <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland A.F.C.</a>'s 1–0 win over <a href="Leeds%20United%20A.F.C.">Leeds United</a> in the <a href="1973%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a>. <a href="Ian%20Porterfield">Ian Porterfield</a>'s winning goal was headline news at the time, giving the "Echo" its all-time record circulation figure of 95,000 copies of the "Sports Echo". The second important event of 1973 was the 100th anniversary of the paper. Celebrations included a birthday party, with dignitaries such as Sunderland A.F.C. manager <a href="Bob%20Stokoe">Bob Stokoe</a> among the guests. <a href="Samuel%20Storey%2C%20Baron%20Buckton">Lord Buckton</a>, the chairman of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Ltd, announced his retirement at the event, and was succeeded by his son, <a href="The%20Honourable">The Honourable</a> Richard Storey. News of a move from Bridge Street to Pennywell, Sunderland, was also announced during the anniversary celebrations. The old newspaper building has since been replaced by a modern apartment block. The "Echo" name still lives on, however, as the project as been named "Echo24".

The "Echo" moved from Bridge Street to a purpose-built newspaper office at Echo House, Pennywell Industrial Estate, in 1976. The move brought an end to the traditional methods of printing using hot molten metal to produce type and printing plates, and introduced computer technology. The £4 million development saw the "Echo" become the first daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It also saw a change in the "Echo"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look "Echo" was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.

Another change inspired by the move was a return for the "Football Echo" man. The <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a> character had for years indicated the match results of Sunderland with a smile, a frown or a tear, while adorning the outside wall of the Bridge Street building. After several years in storage, he was returned to the wall of the new "Echo" building in 1976, where he still remains today.

In 1985 there was a break in tradition when the "Echo" title-piece appeared reversed out in white on a red background, instead of the more familiar red or black lettering. The new title-piece was designed to give a greater impact to the colourful front page. It was the first in a series of changes which included dropping "Sunderland" from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming "The Echo". This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name "Sunderland Echo".

The 1990s saw the "Echo" take a huge technological leap forward when a £12 million printing press was installed. It was used for the first time in December 1996 and was capable of printing up to 70,000 newspapers an hour. The press was part of a multimillion-pound revamp, which also saw journalists making up full news pages on computer screens for the first time. The "Echo"'s first internet news service was also launched in 1996. A further £5 million was spent on updating the pre-press and press hall area in 2004, to improve printing quality and speed of production.

The "Echo" was still part of Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers until the end of the 1990s, although printed by Northeast Press, a subsidiary of the main company. However, the last link to the original founder, Samuel Storey, disappeared in 1999, when Johnston Press took over the business in May that year. The "Sunderland Echo" is still published by Northeast Press, although Johnston Press—the nation's second largest regional publisher—now owns the whole company. In September 2012 it was announced the multimillion-pound press hall was to close, with the loss of 81 jobs, and printing operations moved to Sheffield. On Saturday, 3 November, the final "Echo" was printed in Sunderland. The "Echo" was based at Echo House, <a href="Pennywell">Pennywell</a> Industrial Estate, Sunderland, from 1976 until April 2015. It now shares a site with sister papers the "<a href="Hartlepool%20Mail">Hartlepool Mail</a>" and "<a href="Shields%20Gazette">Shields Gazette</a>" at Alexander House,
1 Mandarin Road, Rainton Bridge Business Park, <a href="Houghton-le-Spring">Houghton-le-Spring</a>.
The "Echo's" new-look website was launched in February 2007, while a digital editing suite was created within the office at the same time. The audio-visual equipment allows reporters to both write about and film stories as they happen, and the articles can be published on-line within seconds.

Statistics show that almost 80,000 people visited the "Echo"'s website in January 2007, and this figure rose to 216,000 by January 2008.. The website is updated 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with stories including football match reports and football transfer rumours among the most popular. Slideshows, videos and <a href="podcast">podcast</a>s are also included on the site in addition to the news of the day.

The "Echo" has won numerous accolades, as well as <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">government</a> praise, for its campaigning journalism, specialist writing, community work, photographic images and appeals for good causes over the decades. Examples of notable writing include a 2006 campaign highlighting the threat posed by bogus callers to the elderly and a 2005 campaign to protect 999 crews from being attacked on duty, which both received official praise in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>. A 1996 drug education campaign, which included the creation of a telephone service for tip-offs about suspected local drug dealers, was also highly praised. The "Newspaper Society" named the "Echo" as its Campaigning Newspaper of the Year for the "Drug Busters" drive, and the campaign also won an award from the "International Newspaper Marketing Association".

In the 135 years of its existence, the "Echo" has become part of the culture of the North East of England and a replica branch office of the "Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette" was built at the open air <a href="Beamish%20Museum">Beamish Museum</a> in County Durham in 1991. Designed to show visitors how the newspaper would have operated in around 1913, the life-size exhibit includes a distribution office, reporter's office, stationery shop and fully working printing press. The replica office took museum staff several months to research and create, and was opened by Sir Richard Storey, great-grandson of "Echo" founder Samuel Storey, on 10 May 1991.

A racehorse was named after the paper in 1991, which was owned by a consortium of 250 "Echo" readers. The <a href="gelding">gelding</a> won races at <a href="Hamilton%2C%20South%20Lanarkshire">Hamilton</a>, <a href="Redcar">Redcar</a>, <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> and <a href="Haydock">Haydock</a> in the early 1990s, but had to be put down on 17 February 1996 after pulling up badly lame during a routine morning gallop. The "Echo" was also used in a display at the <a href="Science%20Museum%20%28London%29">Science Museum</a> in London in 1999, to show how writing can be made simpler for people with reading difficulties, and a specially printed edition of the newspaper appeared on the TV show "<a href="Touching%20Evil">Touching Evil</a>", starring <a href="Robson%20Green">Robson Green</a>, in the same year.

Red-capped parrot

The red-capped parrot (Purpureicephalus spurius) is a species of <a href="broad-tailed%20parrot">broad-tailed parrot</a> native to southwest <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. It was described by <a href="Heinrich%20Kuhl">Heinrich Kuhl</a> in 1820, with no subspecies recognised. It has long been classified in its own genus owing to its distinctive elongated beak, though genetic analysis shows that it lies within the lineage of the "<a href="Psephotellus">Psephotellus</a>" parrots and that its closest relative is the <a href="mulga%20parrot">mulga parrot</a> ("Psephotellus varius"). Not easily confused with other parrot species, it has a bright crimson <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a>, green-yellow cheeks, and a distinctive long bill. The wings, back, and long tail are dark green, and the underparts are purple-blue. The adult female is very similar though sometimes slightly duller than the male; her key distinguishing feature is a white stripe on the wing under-surface. Juveniles are predominantly green.

Found in <a href="woodland">woodland</a> and open <a href="savanna">savanna</a> country, the red-capped parrot is predominantly <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, consuming seeds, particularly of <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a>s, as well as flowers and berries, but insects are occasionally eaten. Nesting takes place in <a href="tree%20hollow">tree hollow</a>s, generally of older large trees. Although the red-capped parrot has been shot as a pest and has been affected by land clearing, the population is growing and the species is considered of <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). It has a reputation of being anxious and difficult to breed in captivity.

The red-capped parrot was first described in 1820 by German <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Heinrich%20Kuhl">Heinrich Kuhl</a> as "Psittacus spurius", from an immature specimen collected in <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a> on the <a href="Baudin%20expedition%20to%20Australia">Baudin expedition</a> (1801–1803) and housed at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20%28France%29">National Museum of Natural History</a> in Paris. The specific epithet "spurius" is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective meaning "illegitimate", and refers to the markedly different adult and immature <a href="plumage">plumage</a>s (hence appearing unrelated). Irish naturalist <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> named the species "Platycercus pileatus" in 1830 from an adult male specimen that had been acquired by the Zoological Society of London. English artist <a href="Edward%20Lear">Edward Lear</a> illustrated the live specimen in his 1830 work "<a href="Illustrations%20of%20the%20Family%20of%20Psittacidae%2C%20or%20Parrots">Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots</a>". It was placed in the monotypic genus "Purpureicephalus"—as "P. pileatus"—by French biologist <a href="Charles%20Lucien%20Bonaparte">Charles Lucien Bonaparte</a> in 1854. The generic name is an amalgam of the Latin "purpureus" "purple", and the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "kephalé" "head". In this generic combination, the current name is translated as "bastard red-head". The species name "pileatus" was generally used until German naturalist <a href="Otto%20Finsch">Otto Finsch</a> followed Kuhl in using the specific name "spurius", calling it "Platycercus spurius" in 1868. His countryman <a href="Anton%20Reichenow">Anton Reichenow</a> classified "Purpureicephalus" as a subgenus of "Platycercus" before placing it in the genus "Porphyreicephalus" (later corrected to "Porphyrocephalus"), until 1912, when Australian amateur ornithologist <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> re-established the genus as "Purpureicephalus". The red-capped parrot's elongated bill and its unusual coloration—lack of cheek patches compared with "Platycercus"—are the main reasons for its placement in its own genus. 

No subspecies are recognised currently. Mathews tentatively described a subspecies "carteri" in 1915 from a specimen collected at <a href="Broomehill%2C%20Western%20Australia">Broomehill</a> on the basis of darker upperparts and greener cheeks; it was not considered distinct by later authors. There is no known geographical variation; five birds from <a href="Esperance%2C%20Western%20Australia">Esperance</a> had smaller bills and <a href="Bird_feet_and_legs%23Hindlimbs">tarsi</a> than individuals from elsewhere in its range, but the sample was too small to draw any conclusions. 
The red-capped parrot is related to other <a href="broad-tailed%20parrot">broad-tailed parrot</a>s, but relationships within the group had been unclear. In 1938, Australian ornithologist <a href="Dominic%20Serventy">Dominic Serventy</a> proposed that it was the sole survivor of a lineage of eastern Australian origin, with no close living relatives. In 1955, British evolutionary biologist <a href="Arthur%20Cain">Arthur Cain</a> proposed that the eastern lineage had vanished after being outcompeted by the <a href="crimson%20rosella">crimson rosella</a> ("Platycercus elegans"), and that its closest relative was the <a href="horned%20parakeet">horned parakeet</a> ("Eunymphicus cornutus") of New Caledonia, which he concluded had adopted a much greener plumage of a wetter climate. A 2011 genetic study including nuclear and <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> found that the red-capped parrot was closely related to the <a href="mulga%20parrot">mulga parrot</a> ("Psephotellus varius"), the two lineages having diverged in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. The combined lineage itself diverging from one giving rise to the <a href="hooded%20parrot">hooded parrot</a> ("Psephotellus dissimilis") and <a href="golden-shouldered%20parrot">golden-shouldered parrot</a> ("Psephotellus chrysopterygius").

"Red-capped parrot" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">International Ornithologists' Union</a> (IOC). English ornithologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> used the name "red-capped parakeet" in 1848 based on Vigors' scientific name, which also inspired the old <a href="aviculture">avicultural</a> term "pileated parrot". It has also been called "western king parrot" to distinguish it from the <a href="Australian%20king%20parrot">Australian king parrot</a> ("Alisterus scapularis") occurring in the east, "purple-crowned parrot", "grey parrot", or "hookbill" for the distinctive <a href="Glossary_of_bird_terms%23U">upper mandible</a>. The name "pileated parakeet" potentially causes confusion among aviarists with the South American <a href="pileated%20parrot">pileated parrot</a> ("Pionopsitta pileata"). Gould also reported "blue parrot" as an early colonial name. The name "king parrot" has persisted in Western Australia, English naturalist <a href="W.%20B.%20Alexander">W. B. Alexander</a> commenting that it was always known by this name in a field note in 1917, Pizzey reiterated this in a 2012 birding guide. Names in the <a href="Nyungar%20language">Nyungar language</a>, spoken by people of the southwest region, have been recorded at: Perth, "Djar-rail-bur-tong" and "Djarrybarldung"; <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a>, "Jul-u-up"; <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a>, "Chelyup"; and Southwest, "Djalyup". A recommended orthography and pronunciation list of Nyungar names has proposed "daryl" [char’rill], "djarrailboordang" [cha’rail’bore’dang], and "djayop" [cha’awp].

The red-capped parrot has a long bill and bright, clear patterned plumage, variously described as magnificent, gaudy, or clownishly coloured. Measuring in length with a wingspan, and weighing , the adult red-capped parrot is a distinctive and easily recognised medium-sized parrot. The adult male has a crimson forehead and <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a>, which extends from the <a href="Beak%23Gape">gape</a> or base of the lower <a href="Beak%23Mandibles">mandible</a> through the eye and grey-brown <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a>. Its hindneck and cheeks are green, and its ear <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a> are more yellow-green. In March and April, the crown feathers and ear coverts of birds with new plumage can have fine black edging. The feathers of the head, back and underparts, have grey bases that are generally hidden. The upperparts, including the wings, are dark green, the rump yellow-green, and the tail is green with a dark blue tip. The underparts are purplish-blue, the <a href="Flank%20%28anatomy%29">flanks</a> green and red, and the <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> dark brown with a dark grey eye ring. The bill is pale blue-grey with a dark grey tip, its upper mandible elongated to a slender hook.

The colouring of the female is similar to, though slightly duller than that of the male; the red of its plumage is not as intense and its red flanks are spotted with some green and yellow. Its breast is a more greyish shade of violet than purple. In flight, it has a whitish stripe visible on the underside of the wing. Female birds have white spots on seven or more underwing feathers, although a few of both sexes lack spots entirely. Birds with white spots on fewer than seven wing feathers can be either female or subadult male. The male has a slightly wider and flatter head, noticeable when birds are compared directly with each other, as well as longer wings and tail. Adult <a href="moult">moult</a>ing takes place in the Southern Hemisphere summer and autumn. The red-capped parrot perches and walks with a distinctive upright posture. 

Juveniles have greenish plumage overall, before beginning their first moult around August. Their subsequent plumage much more closely resembles that of adult birds. The faintly seen markings of the adult pattern begin as a dark green crown, with a reddish frontal band, the grey-violet of the female breast, and red underparts mottled green. The bill is more orange, but turns the pale blue-grey of adult birds by two to five months of age. Juvenile birds with white spots on ten or fewer feathers on the wing undersurface are male, while those with more cannot be sexed. Male subadults often have residual white spots on their wing feathers.

The rapidly repeated <a href="contact%20call">contact call</a> has been transcribed as "krukk-rak" or "crrr-uk", while the <a href="Alarm%20signal">alarm call</a> consists of a series of high-pitched loud notes. Male birds chatter loudly when agitated or marking their nest territory, but, unlike rosellas, not while feeding. Nestlings and fledglings up to two weeks post leaving the nest make a high-pitched two-syllable food begging call.

The red-capped parrot occurs in the <a href="Southwest%20Australia%20%28ecoregion%29">Southwest Australia ecoregion</a> in dense to open forest and <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, and heathland in coastal regions. The distribution range is south from <a href="Moore%20River">Moore River</a> to the coast to Esperance. Records of the species extend inland from the southern coast, as far as <a href="Gingin">Gingin</a> and <a href="Mooliabeenee">Mooliabeenee</a>. Within its range, it is sedentary in areas of higher rainfall, and locally nomadic in dryer areas. The red-capped parrot mostly occurs within of the coastline, becoming sparser further inland.

The usual habitat is <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> forest or woodlands, but its distribution is mostly associated with marri ("<a href="Corymbia%20calophylla">Corymbia calophylla</a>"). This tree species provides a constant food source and has increased in range and population since the settlement of Europeans. The parrot can be found in vegetation dominated by other tree species such as jarrah ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>"), tuart ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20gomphocephala">E. gomphocephala</a>"), wandoo ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20wandoo">E. wandoo</a>"), yate ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20cornuta">E. cornuta</a>"), and peppermint ("<a href="Agonis%20flexuosa">Agonis flexuosa</a>"). A seed-eating bird, it is encountered in farmland, orchards, and suburban landscapes in Perth. It also occurs around remnant stands of marri conserved as shade trees on farmland in the western <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> and <a href="Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Swan Coastal Plain</a>. It can be adversely impacted by land clearing and removal of trees. The red-capped parrot uses large trees to roost in at night and retire to during the middle of the day. It generally avoids blue gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</a>") and pine plantations. 

The parrot is frequently observed at lake reserves in suburban areas on the Swan Coastal Plain, within sight of waders (<a href="Charadriiformes">Charadriiformes</a>) occurring at freshwater to brackish wetlands. It is common at the <a href="Forrestdale%20and%20Thomsons%20Lakes%20Ramsar%20Site">Forrestdale and Thomsons Lakes Ramsar Site</a>, <a href="Bibra%20Lake">Bibra Lake</a>, and the <a href="Benger%20Swamp">Benger Swamp</a> wetland, a region rich in avian species. It is also found at the <a href="Dryandra%20Woodland">Dryandra Woodland</a>, another species-rich reserve with the stands of jarrah and marri over sheoak ("<a href="Allocasuarina%20huegeliana">Allocasuarina huegeliana</a>") and dryandra (<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">"Banksia" ser. "Dryandra"</a>) that are known to be favoured. Red-cap parrot is commonly sighted at <a href="Two%20Peoples%20Bay%20Nature%20Reserve">Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve</a> and along roadsides around the Stirling Range and <a href="Porongurups">Porongorups</a>.

The parrots are found in pairs or small groups of 4 to 6 individuals, or occasionally in larger flocks of 20–30 birds. Rarely a flock of up to 100 birds may be encountered; these are generally composed of juveniles. Birds may associate with <a href="Australian%20ringneck">Australian ringneck</a> parrots ("Barnardius zonarius") or <a href="western%20rosella">western rosella</a>s ("Platycercus icterotis"). The red-capped parrot is shy, and often retreats to the upper canopy of trees if disturbed, which has made study of its breeding and social behaviour difficult. Hence many aspects of these are poorly known.

The red-capped parrot is thought to be monogamous, pairs forming long-term bonds generally from around 20 months of age. Younger females have been recorded pairing with older males at 8 or 9 months old, but do not appear able to breed at this age. The male initiates courtship by following the female and making a contact call, as well as performing a courtship display. This involves it raising its crown feathers, ruffling its crown and rump feathers, lowering its wings to display its rump, and raising and flaring its tail feathers. The female often stoops low and gives out a food-begging call. These displays begin before a nest site is chosen and continue through the breeding season until around two weeks after the young have fledged.

The breeding season is August to December. The red-capped parrot needs mature trees large enough to have hollows in the trunk or branches. These trees can be on <a href="road%20verge">road verge</a>s, along water courses, or in <a href="Field%20%28agriculture%29">paddocks</a>, as well as forest or woodland. Nests are generally apart, and pairs defend them vigorously from other birds, particularly other red-capped parrots, for the duration of nesting. The <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> site is a tree hollow generally in an older large tree, such as a marri, jarrah, tuart, flooded gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20rudis">Eucalyptus rudis</a>") or paperbark ("<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>" spp.), at a height between , averaging around above the ground and often north or east-facing. A lower entrance, narrow with a larger hollow, recorded at was considered exceptional. There are often chew marks at the entrance, which is wide. The hollow is deep and is lined with wood dust at the bottom. The female <a href="Egg_incubation%23Avian_incubation">incubates</a> her <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of usually five, occasionally six (records up to nine), milk-white eggs. The size of each almost spherical egg is . The male attends her from a nearby tree, signalling to leave the nest for food he has brought. Information on the incubation period is limited, but is between 20 and 24 days.

The nestlings are <a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>—they remain in the nest initially, weighing at birth and gaining, on average, a day. At birth they are covered in white down, which is soon replaced by grey down. Their eyes open by 9–11 days of age, and primary quills appear by 9–15 days and primary feathers proper by 14–20 days. They are fed by the female alone for the first two weeks, then by both parents. They fledge between 30 and 37 days, generally all leaving the nest on the same day. The parents continue to feed them for another two weeks.

Marri seeds are the preferred diet, but it also extracts seeds from karri ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20diversicolor">Eucalyptus diversicolor</a>"), woody pear ("<a href="Xylomelum">Xylomelum</a>"), "<a href="Grevillea">Grevillea</a>", "<a href="Hakea">Hakea</a>", dryandra ("<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>") and sheoak ("<a href="Casuarina">Casuarina</a>", "<a href="Allocasuarina">Allocasuarina</a>"), mangite ("<a href="Banksia%20grandis">Banksia grandis</a>"), as well as from grasses, herbs, or shrubs associated with marri-dominated vegetation types. The beak of this parrot allows more precision to obtain seeds from a eucalypt's capsule, the tough case of marri is chewed through by the ringneck parrot or cleaved by the powerful beak of cockatoos (<a href="Cacatuidae">Cacatuidae</a> species). The immature fruit of marri is also consumed. A grass species—wild oats ("<a href="Avena%20fatua">Avena fatua</a>")—and acacia are grazed for green seed. Records of feeding on acacia seed pods include "<a href="Acacia%20celastrifolia">Acacia celastrifolia</a>", "<a href="Acacia%20dentifera">A. dentifera</a>", "<a href="Acacia%20oncinophylla">A. oncinophylla</a>" and "<a href="Acacia%20restiacea">A. restiacea</a>," which occur in its range, and stripping pods for small seed of cultivated "<a href="Acacia%20merinthophora">Acacia merinthophora</a>". The nectar filled blooms of kangaroo paws ("<a href="Anigozanthos">Anigozanthos</a>" sp.) are also sought out, although, unlike the honeyeater and spinebill, their weight breaks the long stalk when feeding. Any viable seed that is consumed may be undigested and dispersed.

Although the red-capped parrot eats fewer introduced plant species than other parrots, it does eat the seeds of slender thistle ("<a href="Carduus%20pycnocephalus">Carduus pycnocephalus</a>"), sheep thistle ("<a href="Carduus%20tenuiflorus">C. tenuiflorus</a>"), and variegated thistle ("<a href="Silybum%20marianum">Silybum marianum</a>"). The species has also adapted to exploit the introduction of orchard fruit such as apples and pears and the gardens of suburban areas. The red-capped parrot bites predominantly red-skinned apples, attempting to retrieve the seed from inside. It does not eat the flesh but instead squeezes it to drink the juice. The fruit of other cultivated introductions are also selected, including almond, nectarine, olive, peaches, plums, pomegranates, and white cedar ("<a href="Melia%20azedarach">Melia azedarach</a>"). Insects such as <a href="psyllid">psyllid</a>s also form part of their diet. Insect larvae and <a href="Lerp%20%28biology%29">lerp</a> are also consumed, particularly in late winter and spring during its breeding season. 

The red-capped parrot primarily feeds on the ground, clasping the capsule of eucalypts or cones of sheoak with one foot and extracting the seed with their slender hooked beak. The dexterity it exhibits using its foot and beak to dislodge seeds is also shown by the <a href="long-billed%20black%20cockatoo">long-billed black cockatoo</a> ("Calyptorhynchus baudinii"). The two occur in the same habitat, both specialising in extracting the marri's store of large seeds. Both species prise marri seeds out of their woody capsule by manipulating it with the foot and lower mandible, and inserting the point of the upper mandible at openings in the seed-dispersing valve. The marks left by the lower mandible on the marri's nut distinguish it from those fed on by other parrots and cockatoos. The red-capped parrot leaves shallow marks around the opening of the capsule, with little damage to the husk. The species mainly feeds and manipulates objects with its left foot; limited sampling of Australian parrot species indicates that laterality is associated with larger size, and many of these are left-footed, though two other broad-tailed parrot species (crimson rosella and Australian ringneck) are right-footed, and smaller species show no preference.

A parasitic protozoan, "<a href="Eimeria%20purpureicephali">Eimeria purpureicephali</a>", was isolated and described from a diseased bird in 2016. It is an intracellular parasite that lives in the host's gastrointestinal system. Species of <a href="bird%20louse">bird louse</a> recorded on the red-capped parrot include "<a href="Forficuloecus%20palmai">Forficuloecus palmai</a>", "<a href="Heteromenopon%20kalamundae">Heteromenopon kalamundae</a>" and a member of the genus "<a href="Neopsittaconirmus">Neopsittaconirmus</a>". <a href="Psittacine%20beak%20and%20feather%20disease">Psittacine beak and feather disease</a> virus was isolated and sequenced from a fledgling in 2016.

Due to damage to orchard crops, these birds have been classified and shot as pests, although 1985 fieldwork in orchards around <a href="Balingup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Balingup</a> showed that the damage they inflicted was insignificant. Local government acts in the agricultural districts of <a href="Shire%20of%20Collie">Collie</a> and <a href="West%20Arthur">West Arthur</a> proclaimed them vermin in 1943. Despite this, its population is growing, possibly due to existing areas being degraded to a more favourable habitat. On account of this and its large range, it is considered to be a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), though it has declined in the shires north of Perth as marri forests have vanished with urban development. Like most species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, the red-capped parrot is protected by the <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.

Its attractive colours make the red-capped parrot a desirable species to keep, although it has a reputation for being anxious in captivity and difficult to breed. This may be because of historically high proportion of wild-caught birds entering aviculture.
The first record of successful reproduction in captivity was in England, almost simultaneously by two aviculturalists in 1909, the slightly earlier hatching of one brood saw Mr. Astley awarded a medal by the nation's Avicultural Society.

Banksia ilicifolia

Banksia ilicifolia, commonly known as holly-leaved banksia, is a <a href="tree">tree</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. Endemic to <a href="Southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, it belongs to <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Isostylis">"Banksia" subg. "Isostylis"</a>, a subgenus of three closely related "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" species with <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s that are dome-shaped heads rather than characteristic "Banksia" flower spikes. It is generally a tree up to tall with a columnar or irregular <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>. Both the scientific and common names arise from the similarity of its foliage to that of the English holly "<a href="Ilex%20aquifolium">Ilex aquifolium</a>"; the glossy green leaves generally have very prickly serrated margins, although some plants lack toothed leaves. The inflorescences are initially yellow but become red-tinged with maturity; this acts as a signal to alert birds that the flowers have opened and nectar is available.

<a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> described "Banksia ilicifolia" in 1810. Although "Banksia ilicifolia" is variable in growth form, with low coastal shrubby forms on the south coast near <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a>, there are no recognised <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> as such. Distributed broadly, the species is restricted to sandy soils. Unlike its close relatives which are killed by fire and repopulate from seed, "Banksia ilicifolia" regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from <a href="epicormic%20shoot">epicormic buds</a> under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.

"Banksia ilicifolia" is a variable species. It usually grows as an erect tree up to in height, but some populations along the south coast consist of small trees or even spreading shrubs. It is generally a high small tree in the <a href="Margaret%20River">Margaret River</a> region. The leaves arising from many short branchlets make a dense foliage close to the trunk and branches.

"Banksia ilicifolia" has a stout trunk up to in diameter, and rough, fibrous, grey bark which is up to thick. New growth takes place mainly in summer. Young branchlets are covered in hair which they lose after two or three years. Leaves grow on stems less than two years of age, and are <a href="phyllotaxis">arranged</a> in a scattered pattern along the stems although crowded at the apices (branchlet tips). Resembling those of holly, its leaves are a dark shiny green colour, and variously <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped), elliptic, <a href="wikt%3Atruncate%23Adjective">truncate</a> or <a href="wikt%3Aundulate%23Adjective">undulate</a> (wavy) in shape, and long. Generally serrated, the leaf edges have up to 14 prickly "teeth" separated by broad v- to u-shaped sinuses along each side, although some leaves have margins lacking teeth. The leaves sit atop <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a> in length. The upper and undersurface of the leaves are initially covered in fine hairs but become smooth with maturity. Flowering takes place from late winter to early summer. The inflorescences are dome-shaped flower heads rather than spikes as many other banksias, and arise from stems that are around a year old. No lateral branchlets grow outwards from the node where the flower head arises. The flower heads measure in diameter, and bear 60 to 100 individual flowers. The inflorescences pass through three colour phases, being initially yellow, then pink, then finally red, before falling away from the head. One to three <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop from fertilised flowers, and remain embedded in the woody base of the flower head. Each follicle bears one or two seeds.

The <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a> leaves are a dull green with no visible nerves or markings. Transversely elliptic in shape, they measure 8 to 13 mm long by 12 to 18 mm wide and range from convex to concave. The pointed spreading <a href="Auricle%20%28botany%29">auricles</a> are 1.5 mm long. The cotyledon leaves sit atop the stout <a href="hypocotyl">hypocotyl</a>, which is green and smooth. The seedling leaves are crowded above the cotyledons. Resembling those of "<a href="Banksia%20coccinea">B. coccinea</a>", they are lined with triangular lobes or "teeth" (with a u- or v-shaped sinus) and obovate to broadly lanceolate in shape. The first set of leaves measure in length and around in width, with three or four lobes in each margin. Both upper and lower seedling leaf surfaces are covered in spreading hairs, as is the seedling stem. Juvenile leaves are obovate to truncate or mucronate with triangular lobes and measure long by wide. These lobes are smaller toward the petiole and apex of the leaf.

In the Margaret River region, "Banksia ilicifolia" has been confused with <a href="Banksia%20sessilis%20var.%20cordata">"Banksia sessilis" var. "cordata"</a> as both have prickly foliage and domed flowerheads. However, the former grows on deep sand while the latter grows on grey sand over limestone ridges. The embedded follicles of "B. ilicifolia" compared with the loose ones of "B. sessilis" are another distinguishing feature.

Specimens of "B. ilicifolia" were first collected by Scottish surgeon <a href="Archibald%20Menzies">Archibald Menzies</a> during the visit of the <a href="Vancouver%20Expedition">Vancouver Expedition</a> to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> in September and October 1791, but this collection did not result in the <a href="Species%20description">description</a> of the species. It was next collected by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in December 1801, during the visit of <a href="HMS%20Investigator%20%281798%29">HMS "Investigator"</a> to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a>. The species was also drawn by the expedition's <a href="botanical%20artist">botanical artist</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20Bauer">Ferdinand Bauer</a>. Like nearly all of Bauer's field drawings of Proteaceae, the original field sketch of "B. ilicifolia" was destroyed in a <a href="Hofburg%20fire">Hofburg fire</a> in 1945. A painting based on the drawing survives, however, at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="London">London</a>.

Brown eventually published the species in his 1810 work "<a href="On%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20plants%20called%20Proteaceae">On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae</a>". The specific name is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "ilex" "holly" and "folium" "leaf", hence "holly-leaved". In 1810, Brown published "<a href="Prodromus%20Florae%20Novae%20Hollandiae%20et%20Insulae%20Van%20Diemen">Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen</a>" in which he <a href="Brown%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">arranged the genus</a> into two unranked groups. "B. ilicifolia" was placed alone in "<a href="Isostylis">Isostylis</a>" because of its unusual dome-shaped inflorescences. All other species were placed in "<a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Banksia">Banksia verae</a>", the "true banksias", because they have the elongate flower spike then considered characteristic of "Banksia".

The shrubby, coastal <a href="ecotype">ecotype</a> was published as a separate species "Banksia aquifolium" by <a href="John%20Lindley">John Lindley</a> in his 1840 "<a href="A%20Sketch%20of%20the%20Vegetation%20of%20the%20Swan%20River%20Colony">A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony</a>", but this is now regarded as a <a href="taxonomic%20synonym">taxonomic synonym</a> of "B. ilicifolia". A specimen collected by <a href="Ludwig%20Preiss">Ludwig Preiss</a> on 13 April 1839 from coastal sands in Perth was described as "Banksia ilicifolia" var "integrifolia" in Bentham's "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>" in 1870, but has not been recognised since. "B. ilicifolia" is variable in form, although the variations are not consistent enough to warrant recognising infraspecific taxa. Adult leaf margins can be entire or serrate (like holly), and can both be present on the one plant. Populations from the south coast have larger flowers and leaves, but some trees in the north of the range also have large flowers and leaves.

<a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> challenged "Banksia" L.f. on the grounds that "Banksia" J.R.Forst & G. Forst had been published before it, and transferred all "Banksia" taxa to the new name "Sirmuellera". Thus, "B. ilicifolia" became "Sirmuellera ilicifolia" (R.Br.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge did not gain wide acceptance, and "Banksia" L.f. was formally <a href="Conserved%20name">conserved</a> against future challenges in 1940.

The unranked group "Isostylis", with its one species, was reclassified as a <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a> in the 1856 <a href="Meissner%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">arrangement</a> of <a href="Carl%20Meissner">Carl Meissner</a>, and 1870 <a href="Bentham%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">arrangement</a> of <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a>. In his 1981 revision of the genus, Alex George reclassified the group as a <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a>—<a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Isostylis">"Banksia" subg. "Isostylis"</a>—defined by the dome-shaped flower heads, with "B. ilicifolia" joined by newly described species "B. cuneata" and later "B. oligantha". "Banksia ilicifolia" is the only common member of that subgenus; the two other species are rare and threatened, and are protected under the <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>. Relationships between "B. ilicifolia" and the other members of "B." subg. "Isostylis" still remain unclear. Although DNA studies found "B. cuneata" to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of <a href="genetic%20divergence">genetic divergence</a> within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested "B. ilicifolia" as basal, while others suggested "B. oligantha". <a href="Biogeographical">Biogeographical</a> factors suggest that "B. ilicifolia" would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the <a href="High%20Rainfall%20Zone">High Rainfall Zone</a> where <a href="relict">relict</a>ual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the <a href="Transitional%20Rainfall%20Zone">Transitional Rainfall Zone</a>, where more recently evolved species are most common.

A 1996 <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of the genus by botanists <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> assumed the status "B." subg. "Isostylis" as a subgenus and earliest offshoot within "Banksia", so George's placement of "B. ilicifolia" was retained in <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">their arrangement</a>. The placement of "B. ilicifolia " was unchanged in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">George's 1999 arrangement</a>, and can be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for "Banksia" and "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". Their analyses suggest a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. "Banksia ilicifolia" and "B. oligantha" form a <a href="clade">clade</a>, that is they are each other's closest relative, with "Banksia cuneata" resolving as the next closest relative, suggesting a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> "B." subg. "Isostylis"; but the clade appears fairly <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> (that it, it evolved relatively recently), suggesting that "B." subg. "Isostylis" may not merit subgeneric rank. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus "Banksia" by merging "Dryandra" into it, and published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s; thus "B." subg. "Banksia" was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. ilicifolia" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

A relatively common species, the holly-leaved banksia is widely distributed within south west Western Australia. It occurs within of the coast, from <a href="Mount%20Lesueur">Mount Lesueur</a> to Augusta, and then east to the <a href="Cordinup%20River%2C%20Western%20Australia">Cordinup River</a> east of <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a>. In the Margaret River region, it grows on yellow sand plains behind the <a href="Leeuwin-Naturaliste%20National%20Park%23Leeuwin%20%E2%80%93%20Naturaliste%20ridge">Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge</a>. Almost all occurrences are to the west (seaward) side of the <a href="Darling%20Scarp">Darling Scarp</a>, although there are two outlying populations – one near <a href="Collie%2C%20Western%20Australia">Collie</a> east of <a href="Bunbury%2C%20Western%20Australia">Bunbury</a> and the other in the Tonbridge-<a href="Lake%20Muir">Lake Muir</a> area near <a href="Manjimup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Manjimup</a>. Along the south coast, there is one inland population at Sheepwash Nature Reserve near <a href="Narrikup%2C%20Western%20Australia">Narrikup</a> northwest of Albany. The annual rainfall over its distribution ranges from .

"Banksia ilicifolia" grows exclusively on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy soils are evident. It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally grows in open woodland alongside such trees as jarrah ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">Eucalyptus marginata</a>"), candlestick banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20attenuata">Banksia attenuata</a>"), firewood banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20menziesii">B. menziesii</a>") and Western Australian Christmas tree ("<a href="Nuytsia%20floribunda">Nuytsia floribunda</a>"). Along the south coast, it grows in heath, sometimes forming stands with bull banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20grandis">B. grandis</a>").

The holly-leaved banksia gives its name to the "Banksia ilicifolia" woodlands ('community type 22'), a possibly threatened ecological community found in the Bassendean and Spearwood systems in the central Swan Coastal Plain north of Rockingham. These are low-lying areas which are seasonally waterlogged. The habitat is open woodland and with an open <a href="understory">understorey</a>, and such trees as "B. ilicifolia", "B. attenuata" and stout paperbark ("<a href="Melaleuca%20preissiana">Melaleuca preissiana</a>").

"Banksia ilicifolia" is a component of the critically endangered <a href="Assemblages%20of%20plants%20and%20invertebrate%20animals%20of%20tumulus%20%28organic%20mound%29%20springs%20of%20the%20Swan%20Coastal%20Plain">Assemblage of Tumulus Springs (organic mound springs) of the Swan Coastal Plain</a> community north of Perth, which is characterised by a permanently moist peaty soil. The dominant trees include "M. preissiana", swamp banksia ("<a href="Banksia%20littoralis">B. littoralis</a>") and flooded gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20rudis">Eucalyptus rudis</a>"), with understorey ferns such as bracken ("<a href="Pteridium%20esculentum">Pteridium esculentum</a>") and "<a href="Cyclosorus%20interruptus">Cyclosorus interruptus</a>", and shrubs swamp peppermint ("<a href="Taxandria%20linearifolia">Taxandria linearifolia</a>") and "<a href="Astartea%20fascicularis">Astartea fascicularis</a>".

"Banksia ilicifolia" has been recorded as a source of nectar for the <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a> ("Tarsipes rostratus") in winter to early summer (May to December), from field studies in the <a href="Scott%20National%20Park">Scott National Park</a>, replaced by "<a href="Adenanthos%20meisneri">Adenanthos meisneri</a>" in the summer. Several honeyeater species visit and pollinate "Banksia ilicifolia". The <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus superciliosus") in particular prefers this species over other banksias.
A field study carried out at <a href="Jandakot%20Airport">Jandakot Airport</a> south of Perth and published in 1988 found that birds and insects overwhelmingly preferred visiting yellow-coloured flowerheads. The species recorded include several species of honeyeater, including the <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), <a href="western%20wattlebird">western wattlebird</a> ("A. lunulata"), western spinebill, <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta"), <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae"), <a href="white-cheeked%20honeyeater">white-cheeked honeyeater</a> ("P. nigra"), <a href="singing%20honeyeater">singing honeyeater</a>, ("Lichenostomus virescens"), as well as the <a href="Australian%20ringneck%23Subspecies">twenty-eight parrot</a> ("Barnardius zonarius semitorquatus") two species of native bee of the genus "<a href="Leioproctus">Leioproctus</a>", a beetle of the genus "<a href="Liparetrus">Liparetrus</a>", and ant species "<a href="Iridomyrmex%20conifer">Iridomyrmex conifer</a>". The yellow flowerheads are also the ones that bear the most nectar, and are greatly preferred by red wattlebirds.

An analysis of the invertebrate population in the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> of "Banksia" woodland found that mites and ticks (<a href="Acari">Acari</a>), beetles (<a href="Coleoptera">Coleoptera</a>) and ants, bees and wasps (<a href="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a>) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on "B. ilicifolia", although outnumbered by thrips (<a href="Thysanoptera">Thysanoptera</a>). More arthropods on "B. ilicifolia" might be related to a higher nutrient (<a href="potassium">potassium</a>) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on "Banksia" species were thought to be related to the presence of insectivorous birds.

Hand-pollination experiments on wild populations near Perth showed that "Banksia ilicifolia" is self-compatible, although progeny produced have less vigour and seed production is reduced. Further experiments show that seedlings of <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a> with plants greater than apart are more vigorous and adaptable, suggesting that plants breeding within small fragmented populations are subject to reduced vigour and genetic <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>.

"Banksia ilicifolia" regenerates after <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a> by regrowing from <a href="epicormic%20shoot">epicormic shoot</a>s under its bark. Follicles open and release seeds after several years. It is weakly <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>, like eight other "Banksia" species, all of which tend to occur in Western Australia's southwestern corner. The other two species of the subgenus "Isostylis" are killed by fire and regenerate by seed.

All banksias have developed proteoid or <a href="cluster%20root">cluster root</a>s in response to the nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>). The plant develops masses of fine lateral roots which form a mat-like structure underneath the soil surface. These enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in "Banksia" woodland in southwestern Australia—"Banksia menziesii", "B. attenuata" and "B. ilicifolia"—found that all three develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of "B. menziesii" differ from the other two, and that they also change depending on the age of the roots. Along with its shallow lateral roots, "Banksia ilicifolia" sinks one or more deep <a href="taproot">taproot</a>s seeking the water table. It is an obligate <a href="phreatophyte">phreatophyte</a>, that is, it is reliant upon accessing <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> for its survival; it is more closely tied to the <a href="water%20table">water table</a> than the co-occurring "B. menziesii" and "B. attenuata", and must remain in areas where the depth of the water table is less than below the surface. Recent falls of the water table on the Swan Coastal Plain from use of the <a href="Gnangara%20Mound">Gnangara Mound</a> aquifer for Perth's water supply combined with years of below average rainfall have seen the population and vigour or "Banksia ilicifolia" fall considerably (more so than other banksia species) since the mid-1960s.

Like many Western Australian banksias, "Banksia ilicifolia" has been shown to be highly sensitive to dieback from the soil-borne <a href="water%20mould">water mould</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>". A study of "Banksia attenuata" woodland southeast of Perth across 16 years and following a wave of "P. cinnamomi" infestation showed that "B. ilicifolia" populations were present but significantly reduced in diseased areas. Specimens in coastal dune vegetation were reported killed by "<a href="Armillaria%20luteobubalina">Armillaria luteobubalina</a>", with mycelial sheaths of the fungus beneath the bark of the root collar.

Rarely cultivated, "Banksia ilicifolia" requires a sunny position and sandy well-drained soil to do well. A slow-growing plant, it takes up to ten years to flower from seed. The glossy green foliage and long flowering period, combined with prominently displayed flowers give it horticultural potential, although its prickly foliage makes fallen leaves a problem if planted near lawns or walkways. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 22 to 41 days to <a href="germinate">germinate</a>. Difficulties in collection and low seed set make seed relatively expensive. Seeds are often eaten by insects before they can be collected.

Banksia cuneata

Banksia cuneata, commonly known as matchstick banksia or Quairading banksia, is an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> of <a href="Angiosperms">flowering plant</a> in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. Endemic to <a href="Southwest%20Australia">southwest</a> <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, it belongs to <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Isostylis">"Banksia" subg. "Isostylis"</a>, a sub-genus of three closely related "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" species with <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s or flower clusters that are dome-shaped heads rather than characteristic "Banksia" flower spikes. A shrub or small tree up to high, it has prickly foliage and pink and cream flowers. The common name "Matchstick Banksia" arises from the blooms in late bud, the individual buds of which resemble matchsticks. The species is <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> by <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s (Meliphagidae).

Although "B. cuneata" was first collected before 1880, it was not until 1981 that Australian botanist <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This "Banksia" is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As "Banksia cuneata" is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency—fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. "Banksia cuneata" is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.

"Banksia cuneata" grows as a shrub or small tree up to high, without a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. It has one or more main trunks with smooth grey bark, and many branches. Young stems are covered in coarse hairs, but these are lost as the stems age. The leaves are wedge-shaped with serrated edges, having from one to five teeth along each side. They range from long and wide, on a <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a> of 2 to 3 mm. The upper surface is dull green; as with the stems, both leaf surfaces are covered in coarse hairs when young, but these are soon lost.

Flowers occur in dome-shaped heads from three to four cm (1.2–1.6 in) in diameter, growing at the ends of branches. They comprise 55 to 65 individual flowers, enclosed at the base by a whorl of short <a href="involucral%20bract">involucral bract</a>s. As with most other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>, each flower consists of a <a href="petal">perianth</a> comprising four united <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and a single <a href="gynoecium">pistil</a>, the <a href="style%20%28botany%29">style</a> of which is initially enclosed within the limb of the perianth, but breaks free at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a>. In "B. cuneata", the perianth is about long, with a limb of about . Prior to anthesis, the long thin perianth topped by a prominent limb resembles a <a href="match">match</a>stick, which explains one common name for this species. At first, the perianth is mostly cream, being pink only near its base; it later becomes pink throughout. The style is initially cream, but turns red; the <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen presenter</a> is green.

Old flowers soon fall from the flower heads (often called cones at this stage), revealing a woody base which may have up to five <a href="follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicle</a>s embedded in it. These are a mottled grey colour, smooth, felted with short fine hairs, and measure from high, along the seam, and across the seam. Each follicle contains up to two seeds; these are roughly triangular in shape, with a large papery wing.

"Banksia cuneata" is most easily distinguished from the other two species in "B." subg. "Isostylis" by its brighter flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from "<a href="Banksia%20ilicifolia">B. ilicifolia</a>" in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of "<a href="Banksia%20oligantha">B. oligantha</a>" are smaller still, and its foliage is not as prickly as that of "B. cuneata".

The earliest known specimen collection of "B. cuneata" was made by <a href="Julia%20Wells">Julia Wells</a> some time before 1880. What would later become the <a href="holotype">type specimen</a> for the species was collected by Western Australian botanist and "Banksia" expert <a href="Alex%20George">Alex George</a> on 20 November 1971, from <a href="Badjaling%20Nature%20Reserve">Badjaling Nature Reserve</a>, about east of Quairading, at . The species was finally published by George nearly a decade later, in his 1981 monograph "<a href="The%20genus%20Banksia%20L.f.%20%28Proteaceae%29">The genus "Banksia" L.f. (Proteaceae)</a>". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "cuneatus" ("wedge-shaped"), in reference to the shape of the leaves.

The species has an uneventful nomenclatural history: it has no <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>, and no subspecies or varieties have been published. It bears the <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s of Matchstick Banksia or Quairading Banksia.

George placed "B. cuneata" in subgenus <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Isostylis">"Isostylis"</a> because of its dome-shaped flower heads. A 1996 <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis of the genus by botanists <a href="Kevin%20Thiele">Kevin Thiele</a> and <a href="Pauline%20Ladiges">Pauline Ladiges</a> yielded no information about the circumscription of "B." subg. "Isostylis", nor of the relationships within it, so George's placement of this species was retained in <a href="Thiele%20and%20Ladiges%27%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">their arrangement</a>. That arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in <a href="George%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Banksia">his 1999 arrangement</a>. The placement of "B. cuneata" there was unaffected, and can be summarised as follows:

Since 1998, American botanist <a href="Austin%20Mast">Austin Mast</a> and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data for the subtribe <a href="Grevilleoideae">Banksiinae</a>, which then comprised genera "Banksia" and "<a href="Banksia%20ser.%20Dryandra">Dryandra</a>". Their analyses suggest a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. "Banksia cuneata" resolves as the next closest relative, or "sister", to a <a href="clade">clade</a> containing "B. ilicifolia" and "B. oligantha", suggesting a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> "B." subg. "Isostylis"; but the clade appears fairly <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> (that it, it evolved relatively recently), suggesting that "B." subg. "Isostylis" may not merit subgeneric rank.

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus "Banksia" by merging "Dryandra" into it, and published <a href="Banksia%20subg.%20Spathulatae">"B." subg. "Spathulatae"</a> for the taxa having spoon-shaped <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>s; thus "B." subg. "Banksia" was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of "Dryandra" was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then "B. cuneata" is placed in "B." subg. "Banksia".

Relationships between "B. cuneata" and the other members of "B." subg. "Isostylis" still remain unclear. Though Mast's studies found "B. cuneata" to be the most <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> of the three species, a 2004 study of <a href="genetic%20divergence">genetic divergence</a> within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested "B. ilicifolia" as basal, while others suggested "B. oligantha". Further complicating the situation is the southernmost population of "B. cuneata", which has both genetic and <a href="phenetics">phenetic</a> affinities with "B. oligantha" located to the southeast. The origin of this population is unknown. It might have arisen through <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a>isation, or it may be a transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, <a href="biogeography">biogeographical</a> factors suggest that "B. ilicifolia" would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the <a href="High%20Rainfall%20Zone">High Rainfall Zone</a> where <a href="relict">relict</a>ual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the <a href="Transitional%20Rainfall%20Zone">Transitional Rainfall Zone</a>, where more recently evolved species are most common.

An endangered species, "B. cuneata" occurs only over a range around <a href="Pingelly%2C%20Western%20Australia">Pingelly</a> and <a href="Quairading%2C%20Western%20Australia">Quairading</a>, in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. It favours deep yellow sand at elevations between , in <a href="woodland">woodland</a> habitat. It often grows in association with "<a href="Banksia%20prionotes">Banksia prionotes</a>" and "<a href="Xylomelum%20angustifolium">Xylomelum angustifolium</a>".

Reports on the number of populations and individuals vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 plants in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 plants. In 1988, however, only four populations comprising 300 plants were found; surprisingly, only fifty plants could be found in the location where a population of 300 had previously been reported; yet there were no dead plants, and no evidence of disturbance. Since then the number of populations reported have ranged from 6 to 11, and reports of the total number of plants have ranged from 340 to 580.

Pollinated primarily by honeyeaters, the inflorescences appear from September to December. Prominent flowers, a red or pink colour, a straight style and a tubular perianth are features thought to promote pollination by birds. The structure of "B. cuneata"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s flower, with the style end functioning as a <a href="pollen-presenter">pollen presenter</a>, suggests that <a href="reproduction">autogamous</a> <a href="reproduction">self-fertilisation</a> must be common. This is countered, however, by <a href="Dichogamy">protandry</a>: <a href="pollen">pollen</a> is released well before the pistil becomes receptive; usually by the time the <a href="gynoecium">pistil</a> becomes receptive most of the pollen has either been transferred, or has lost its viability. This strategy is effective against individual flowers fertilising themselves, but does nothing to prevent <a href="geitonogamy">geitonogamy</a>: fertilisation of flowers by different flowers on the same plant. Because of the way flowers are clustered together in heads, this must be quite common, although whether it results in successful fruit set is another matter: <a href="isozyme%20study">isozyme studies</a> have observed "intense selection against homozygotes", a fairly common outbreeding strategy in plants that set lots of seed.

Assessments of the <a href="mating%20system">mating system</a> of this species have found that <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a> rates vary between populations. Populations in relatively intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are both more <a href="inbreeding">inbred</a> on average, and more variable. This has been attributed to a range of causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more <a href="genetic%20structure">genetic structure</a> and thus more <a href="Effective%20selfing%20model">effective selfing</a>. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an <a href="understory">understorey</a>, and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average, leading to less <a href="natural%20selection">selection</a> against inbred fertilisations; and the sporadic presence of pollinators leads to outcrossing variability.

No seed is set when pollinators are <a href="pollinator%20exclusion%20experiment">excluded</a>, indicating that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These are very high numbers for "Banksia", indicating that there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant—typically more than 500. However, there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone—often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a "Banksia" species.

"Banksia cuneata" lacks a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, so plants are killed by bushfire. However, this species is strongly <a href="serotiny">serotinous</a>: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an <a href="canopy%20seed%20bank">aerial seed bank</a> in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a <a href="resin">resin</a> that seals the follicles shut, preventing <a href="dehiscence%20%28botany%29">dehiscence</a>; the heat of a bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and <a href="seed%20separator">seed separator</a>, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are <a href="hygroscopy">hygroscopic</a>; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for "B. cuneata" is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population and there will be no seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a>. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.

"B. cuneata" is very unusual in apparently suffering no seed loss due to <a href="seed%20predation">granivory</a>. In nearly all other species, burrowing <a href="insect">insect</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e eat a large proportion of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to "B. cuneata". Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a "Banksia" species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and <a href="senescence">senescence</a> sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.

The high seed maturation and viability rates are offset, however, by an extremely low seedling survival rate. This is almost solely due to moisture stress. In one study, an estimated 17,100 viable seeds were released following an experimental fire. Fewer than 5% of them germinated, and only eleven plants survived the first summer drought. The last plants to die were in depressions, in shaded areas or amongst leaf litter; and the eleven survivors were all on road shoulders, where they benefited from road <a href="Surface%20runoff">runoff</a> and a thick <a href="mulch">mulch</a> of <a href="pisolite">pisolitic</a> <a href="laterite">laterite</a>. The inevitable conclusion is that seedling survival is primarily determined by water availability.

"Banksia cuneata" was declared <a href="endangered%20species">critically endangered</a> after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, was on a conservation reserve, but all others were on road verges, and contained only 50–70 plants each. However, since then more plants have been located, and populations have been found to be gradually increasing in response to a number of <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation</a> measures including fencing and baiting of <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.

In April 1987, Western Australia's <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Department of Environment and Conservation</a> burnt part of one population in an experimental regeneration fire. The mature plants were killed, and the seedlings that <a href="volunteer%20%28botany%29">volunteer</a>ed did not survive the summer <a href="drought">drought</a>. A "Matchstick Banksia Recovery Team" was established in 1995, and over time they succeeded in establishing a large number of seedlings. A large adult population was destroyed by bushfire in 1996, causing further concern, but this was followed by the recruitment of large numbers of seedlings.

Threats to "B. cuneata" include land clearing, which leads to direct plant loss and population fragmentation, <a href="grazing">grazing</a> pressure, competition from exotic weeds, changes to the <a href="fire%20regime">fire regime</a>, and encroaching <a href="salinity%20in%20Australia">salinity</a>. <a href="The%20Banksia%20Atlas">The Banksia Atlas</a> survey found one population to be on the side of a road; the plants were aging with no new seedlings noted, and the site was weed-infested. A large part of the surviving populations are on private land, and depend on good relationships with local landowners. Many have obliged by fencing off areas and restricting entry of rabbits. There has been some attempt by CALM to translocate populations away from hazardous areas; these have met with some success, helped with watering in the first year.

Even before the extensive clearing of the <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> in the 1930s, "B. cuneata" must have had a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.

Levels of <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> within individual populations of "B. cuneata" are unusually high for a rare and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the <a href="Salt%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Salt River</a>, an <a href="ephemeral">ephemeral</a> saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both "B. cuneata" and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions as a barrier to the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to <a href="genetic%20divergence">diverge</a> through <a href="genetic%20drift">genetic drift</a>. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested on both sides of the river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.

"<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>" dieback has not been identified as a threat to this species, but testing has found it to be highly susceptible; in one study it exhibited the highest susceptibility of 49 "Banksia" species studied, with 80% of plants dead within 96 days of inoculation with the disease, and 100% dead within a year.

The survival of this species is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable to the effects of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to <a href="extinction">extinction</a>, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.

Propagation is by seed, although these are hard to obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to <a href="germination">germinate</a>. <a href="Cutting">Cutting</a>s yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a <a href="pH">pH</a> of 6.0–7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form can be obtained by pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the <a href="floriculture">cut flower industry</a> because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.

Ironically, given its conservation status, Kingsley Dixon of <a href="Kings%20Park%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kings Park and Botanic Garden</a> suggested that it may have weed potential: the species was trialled as a cut flower crop on land north of Moore River, and seedlings were noted afterwards.

"Banksia cuneata" has been adopted as the floral emblem of the <a href="Shire%20of%20Quairading">Shire of Quairading</a>, and has been incorporated into the shire logo. There is a park named Cuneata Park in the town of <a href="Quairading%2C%20Western%20Australia">Quairading</a>.

Augustus Owsley Stanley

Augustus Owsley Stanley I (May 21, 1867 – August 12, 1958) was an American politician from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. A member of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, he served as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">38th Governor of Kentucky</a> and also represented the state in both the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a>. From 1903 to 1915, Stanley represented <a href="Kentucky%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district">Kentucky's 2nd congressional district</a> in the House of Representatives, where he gained a reputation as a <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive reformer</a>. Beginning in 1904, he called for an <a href="Competition%20law">antitrust</a> investigation of the <a href="American%20Tobacco%20Company">American Tobacco Company</a>, claiming they were a <a href="monopsony">monopsony</a> that drove down prices for the tobacco farmers of his district. As a result of his investigation, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> ordered the breakup of the American Tobacco Company in 1911. Stanley also chaired a committee that conducted an antitrust investigation of <a href="United%20States%20Steel">U.S. Steel</a>, which brought him national acclaim. Many of his ideas were incorporated into the <a href="Clayton%20Antitrust%20Act">Clayton Antitrust Act</a>.

During an unsuccessful senatorial bid in 1914, Stanley assumed an anti-<a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a> stance. This issue would dominate his political career for more than a decade and put him at odds with <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a>, the leader of the pro-<a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a> faction of the state's Democratic Party. In 1915, Stanley ran for governor, defeating his close friend <a href="Edwin%20P.%20Morrow">Edwin P. Morrow</a> by just over 400 votes in the closest gubernatorial race in the state's history. Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> called Stanley's administration the apex of the Progressive Era in Kentucky. Among the reforms adopted during his tenure were a state antitrust law, a <a href="campaign%20finance%20reform">campaign finance reform</a> law, and a <a href="workman%27s%20compensation">workman's compensation</a> law. In 1918, Stanley was chosen as the Democratic nominee to succeed the recently deceased senator <a href="Ollie%20M.%20James">Ollie M. James</a>. Stanley was elected, but did not resign as governor to take the seat until May 1919 and accomplished little in his single term. He lost his re-election bid to <a href="Frederic%20M.%20Sackett">Frederic M. Sackett</a> in the 1924 Republican landslide and never again held elected office. He died in Washington, D.C., on August 12, 1958.

Augustus Owsley Stanley was born in <a href="Shelbyville%2C%20Kentucky">Shelbyville, Kentucky</a>, on May 21, 1867; he was the eldest of seven children of William and Amanda (Owsley) Stanley. His father was a minister of the <a href="Christian%20Church%20%28Disciples%20of%20Christ%29">Disciples of Christ</a> and served as a <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%27s%20Corps">judge advocate</a> on the staff of <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> in the <a href="Confederate%20Army">Confederate Army</a>. His mother was the niece of former Kentucky governor <a href="William%20Owsley">William Owsley</a>. He attended Gordon Academy in <a href="Nicholasville%2C%20Kentucky">Nicholasville, Kentucky</a>, and the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>) before graduating with an A.B. from <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a> in 1889. At both Centre and Kentucky A&M, he competed at the State Oratorical Contest, becoming the only such competitor to represent two different institutions.

For a year after graduation, Stanley served as <a href="chairperson">chair</a> of <a href="belles-lettres">belles-lettres</a> at Christian College in <a href="Hustonville%2C%20Kentucky">Hustonville, Kentucky</a>. The following year, he was principal of Marion Academy in <a href="Bradfordsville%2C%20Kentucky">Bradfordsville</a>, then spent two years in the same position at Mackville Academy in <a href="Mackville%2C%20Kentucky">Mackville</a>. While he held these positions, he studied law under Gilbert Cassiday. He was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> in 1894, and opened his practice in <a href="Flemingsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Flemingsburg, Kentucky</a>.

Stanley's first venture into the political arena was in 1897 when he made an unsuccessful bid to become <a href="county%20attorney">county attorney</a> of <a href="Fleming%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fleming County</a>. He continued to practice law in Flemingsburg until March 1898 when he moved to <a href="Henderson%2C%20Kentucky">Henderson</a> because of financial hardships. He served as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">presidential elector</a> on the ticket of <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> in 1900.

In 1902, Stanley was elected as a <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a> from <a href="Kentucky%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district">Kentucky's 2nd congressional district</a>. During his tenure in the House, he served on the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Mines%20and%20Mining">Committee on Mines and Mining</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Territories">Committee on Territories</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Agriculture">Committee on Agriculture</a>. He advocated for <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> reforms such as more extensive study of mine accident prevention, railroad regulation, a pure food and drug act, and an <a href="eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a>.

By the time of Stanley's election to the House, the <a href="American%20Tobacco%20Company">American Tobacco Company</a> had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came to the defense of the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Ways and Means Committee</a> to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.

Besides his legislative efforts on behalf of farmers, Stanley also directly encouraged them to organize and keep their crops off the market until prices improved. He helped draft the charter for the Dark District Tobacco Planters Association. Some of the more radical members of this group, known as the "Night Riders", used <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a> violence to compel membership in the Association during what became known as the <a href="Black%20Patch%20Tobacco%20Wars">Black Patch Tobacco Wars</a>.

Finally in 1909, Stanley attached his proposed repeal of the tobacco tax as a <a href="Rider%20%28legislation%29">rider</a> to the <a href="Payne-Aldrich%20Tariff%20Act">Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act</a>. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.

Stanley gained national notoriety for his actions against <a href="United%20States%20Steel">U.S. Steel</a>. In 1909, he introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of the company, but it died in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Rules">House Rules Committee</a>. A second resolution, introduced in June 1910, passed the House, but was ignored by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a>. Stanley introduced a stronger resolution later that month, but it was killed in committee. After Republicans lost control of the house in the 1910 congressional elections, Stanley reintroduced his resolution. <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Speaker</a> <a href="Champ%20Clark">Champ Clark</a> appointed him as chairman of a nine-member committee to investigate U.S. Steel.

The committee's investigation lasted from May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along party lines. Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged <a href="price%20fixing">price fixing</a> by U.S. Steel and censured President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> for his role in U.S. Steel's purchase of the <a href="Tennessee%20Coal%2C%20Iron%20and%20Railroad%20Company">Tennessee Coal and Iron Company</a>. The minority report, authored by Republican <a href="Augustus%20P.%20Gardner">Augustus P. Gardner</a>, absolved Roosevelt and downplayed the price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the <a href="Sherman%20Anti-Trust%20Act">Sherman Anti-Trust Act</a>. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the <a href="Clayton%20Antitrust%20Act">Clayton Antitrust Act</a>.

Although he had no serious challengers for his House seat, Stanley declined to seek re-election in 1914, choosing instead to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate. He was one of three Democrats seeking the seat, the others being Governor <a href="James%20B.%20McCreary">James B. McCreary</a> and former governor <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a>. McCreary was never a serious challenger, and the <a href="Primary%20election">primary</a> campaign centered on Stanley and Beckham, the leaders of the two largest factions of the state's Democratic party. The two men disliked each other. Stanley had once referred to Beckham as "a fungus growth on the grave of Goebel" – an allusion to Beckham's former running mate, Governor <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a>, whose assassination in 1900 had elevated Beckham to the governorship. During the campaign, Stanley criticized Beckham's use of <a href="political%20machine">machine politics</a>, calling his opponent "<a href="Little%20Lord%20Fauntleroy">Little Lord Fauntleroy</a>".

<a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> became the major issue of the campaign. Though both Stanley and Beckham were known to drink liquor, Beckham campaigned on a pro-<a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a> platform. Stanley, an opponent of prohibition, criticized Beckham's position as hypocritical, saying of pro-temperance politicians in general and Beckham in particular "They keep full of booze and introduce bills to punish the man who sells it to them." "[Beckham] would sell out the world to go to the Senate," he added. The support of "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" editor <a href="Henry%20Watterson">Henry Watterson</a> and Representative <a href="Ben%20Johnson%20%28politician%29">Ben Johnson</a> were not enough to carry Stanley to victory. Beckham secured the Democratic nomination by almost 7,000 votes and went on to win the seat in the general election.

Several candidates announced their intention to seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1915, but by late August, only two remained in the race. Stanley was the choice of the anti-prohibition faction of the party, while state <a href="Superintendent%20%28education%29">superintendent</a> Harry V. McChesney represented the prohibition faction, backed by Beckham. Stanley won the nomination with 107,585 votes to McChesney's 69,722. The Republicans nominated Stanley's close friend <a href="Edwin%20P.%20Morrow">Edwin P. Morrow</a>. The two traveled the state together, often speaking from the same stage.

Stanley was a powerful orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, and by the end of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as "Free Old Dog Ring," and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach."

Democrats had been divided in the primary, but united behind Stanley in the general election. Senators Beckham and <a href="Ollie%20M.%20James">Ollie M. James</a> endorsed him, as did Governor <a href="James%20B.%20McCreary">James B. McCreary</a>. <a href="Samuel%20Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a> praised Stanley for his opposition to trusts while in Congress; endorsements from local chapters of the <a href="American%20Federation%20of%20Labor">American Federation of Labor</a> soon followed. Even Harry McChesney, Stanley's primary opponent, urged Kentuckians to vote a <a href="Straight-ticket%20voting">straight Democratic ticket</a>.

The election was too close to call on election night. Knowing that a challenged election would be decided by the heavily Democratic General Assembly, Morrow conceded a week later. Official results showed that Stanley won the election by 471 votes, the closest gubernatorial vote in the state's history.

Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> called Stanley's administration the apex of the <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Progressive</a> Era in Kentucky. The most significant legislation passed during the 1916 legislative session were a state <a href="Competition%20law">antitrust law</a> and a ban on railroads offering free passes to public figures. A Corrupt Practices Act required candidates for office to file reports of their expenses, limited the amount of allowable expenses, and forbade <a href="Public%20utility">public service corporations</a> from contributing to any campaign. Other accomplishments included initiating the state's first budget program, enacting its first <a href="workman%27s%20compensation">workman's compensation</a> law, and instituting a convict labor law. The one progressive measure that did not pass, a bill granting <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, failed in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a> by a single vote.

Stanley called the General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reform of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt unjustly burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was in better shape financially than many of its peers, Stanley still sought to balance the budget. The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed many of the bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by <a href="M.%20M.%20Logan">M. M. Logan</a>. Additional taxes were passed on <a href="Distilled%20beverage">distilled spirits</a>, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the dramatic increase in funds yielded by the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.

Stanley's administration was affected by the United States' entry into World War I. The legislature established and funded a state Council of Defense, but Stanley vetoed a bill that would have banned the teaching of German in public schools.

As in his run for Senate and in the gubernatorial primary, the liquor question was central to Stanley's tenure as governor. Although anti-prohibition forces declared prohibition dead following his election, a prohibition amendment was introduced during the first legislative session following it. The amendment failed by a vote of 20–14 in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state senate</a>. In 1918 it was submitted to the state's voters by an overwhelming 95–17 joint vote of the General Assembly. Although Stanley was against prohibition, he supported the 1918 amendment in order to settle the liquor issue and clear the legislature's order paper for other measures. In 1919, Kentucky was the first "wet" state to ratify the <a href="Eighteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eighteenth Amendment</a>, enshrining prohibition into the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">national constitution</a>.

On August 18, 1918, incumbent senator Ollie M. James died. Stanley appointed <a href="George%20B.%20Martin">George B. Martin</a> to finish James' term, which was to expire on March 3 of the following year. James had already been nominated for re-election in 1918 by the Democratic primary, and the task of selecting the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley. Stanley enjoyed the advantage of a united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not challenge him for his own seat when he faced re-election. The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner. Stanley was attacked for his veto of the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance. Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes. He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919. As a Democrat in a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.

When Stanley sought <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201924">re-election</a> to his seat in 1924, he faced an uphill battle. No Kentucky senator had been re-elected to his seat in over forty years (though <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">senators had been popularly elected</a> only since 1914). His opposition to prohibition cost him the support of pro-temperance voters and Democratic governor <a href="William%20J.%20Fields">William J. Fields</a>. He was also opposed by the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, then a powerful organization in the state, because of his opposition to bigotry and secret organizations. His Republican opponent <a href="Frederic%20M.%20Sackett">Frederic M. Sackett</a> secured the support of the Beckham wing of the Democratic Party. Despite having his own private stock of liquor, Sackett took a pro-temperance position in the campaign and was endorsed by the <a href="Anti-Saloon%20League">Anti-Saloon League</a>. "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" editor <a href="Robert%20Worth%20Bingham">Robert Worth Bingham</a> added his endorsement, calling Sackett "one of the best men I know". In the general election, Stanley lost his seat by almost 25,000 votes. Sackett's victory meant Kentucky would have two Republican senators for the first time in its history.

Following his defeat in the Senate, Stanley returned to his legal practice. In the 1927 gubernatorial election, he threw his support to his old enemy, J. C. W. Beckham, hoping to improve his chances of returning to the Senate in 1930. Beckham lost to Republican <a href="Flem%20D.%20Sampson">Flem D. Sampson</a>, greatly diminishing Stanley's chances in the senatorial campaign.

In 1930, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> appointed Stanley to the <a href="International%20Joint%20Commission">International Joint Commission</a>, a body charged with settling boundary disputes between the United States and Canada. Stanley became its chair in 1933. He was very proud of his service on the Commission, and once noted that nowhere on earth have two great powers lived so long as neighbors with so <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20relations">few disputes</a>. He served until 1954 when he resigned under pressure from his own party.

Stanley died in Washington, D.C., on August 12, 1958, and was buried in <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a> in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>. He was survived by his wife, Sue (Soaper) Stanley, and two of his three sons, William Stanley and Augustus Owsley Stanley II. His grandson, <a href="Owsley%20Stanley">Augustus Owsley Stanley III</a> (1935–2011), became a well-known <a href="LSD">LSD</a> chemist and backer of the <a href="Grateful%20Dead">Grateful Dead</a> during the <a href="hippie%20movement">hippie movement</a>.

History of the Australian Capital Territory

The history of the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a> (ACT) as a separate <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">administrative division</a> began in 1911, when it was transferred from <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> to the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian federal government</a>. The territory contains Australia's capital city <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> and various smaller settlements. Until 1989, it also administered the <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a>, a small coastal region.

<a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> have lived in the present-day ACT for at least 20,000 years. The area formed the traditional lands of the <a href="Ngambri">Ngambri</a> people and several other <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20languages">linguistic groups</a>. It was incorporated into the <a href="Colony%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Colony of New South Wales</a> with British settlement in 1788, but no white person reached the area until <a href="Joseph%20Wild">Joseph Wild</a> in 1820. In 1824, Joshua Moore built a homestead named "Canberry", whose name was derived from a local Aboriginal language; its meaning is disputed. Further homesteads and <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">stations</a> were established over the course of the 19th century. These were initially large properties used for sheep and cattle grazing, but they were later broken up and subdivided into smaller farms and urban settlements. The oldest gazetted settlement in the ACT is <a href="Tharwa%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Tharwa</a>, which was proclaimed in 1862.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Constitution of Australia</a> – which <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">took effect</a> on 1 January 1901 – provided that a new national capital should be built at a site determined by <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Federal Parliament</a>. It had to be within the state of New South Wales, but at least away from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. The "<a href="Seat%20of%20Government%20Act%201908">Seat of Government Act 1908</a>" fixed Canberra as the site of the new capital, and the surrounding region was formally ceded to the federal government on 1 January 1911. It was originally known as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), adopting its current name in 1938. American architect <a href="Walter%20Burley%20Griffin">Walter Burley Griffin</a> won the competition to design the new city, and was appointed to oversee its construction. He was dogged by disputes with the government and the onset of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and was fired in 1921. Multiple planning bodies were established but achieved little, in part due to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>.

Parliament moved to Canberra in 1927, although government offices were slow to follow. The growth of Canberra and the ACT was slow, with potential residents discouraged by the cold climate and lack of facilities. Development accelerated after World War II, championed by Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> who regarded the state of the capital as an embarrassment. The <a href="National%20Capital%20Development%20Commission">National Capital Development Commission</a> was created in 1957 with more power than its predecessors. It ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of <a href="Lake%20Burley%20Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>, the centrepiece of Canberra, with construction completed in 1964. This prompted the development of the <a href="Parliamentary%20Triangle%2C%20Canberra">Parliamentary Triangle</a>, a core part of Griffin's design, and followed various buildings of national importance were constructed on the lakefront. On average, the population of Canberra increased by more than 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975. More residential land was released through the creation of new town centres in the 1960s and 1970s.

An elective <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20Advisory%20Council">Advisory Council</a> was created for the ACT in 1930. It was replaced by a <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20House%20of%20Assembly">House of Assembly</a> in 1974. Full self-government was granted in 1988, with the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> electing the <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory</a> to serve as the territory's head of government. The assembly has most of the powers and responsibilities of state governments, but its actions are subject to a federal veto. The ACT gained <a href="Division%20of%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">a seat</a> in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> in 1949, initially with limited voting rights. It has had multiple members since 1974, and since 1975 has also elected two members of the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a>.

Indigenous Australian peoples have long inhabited what is now the ACT. Anthropologist <a href="Norman%20Tindale">Norman Tindale</a> has suggested the principal group occupying the region were the <a href="Ngunnawal%20people">Ngunnawal people</a>, while the <a href="Ngarigo">Ngarigo</a> and <a href="Walgalu">Walgalu</a> lived immediately to the south, the Wandandian to the east, the <a href="Gandangara%20people">Gandangara</a> to the north, and the <a href="Wiradjuri">Wiradjuri</a> to the north-west.

Archæological evidence from the Birrigai rock shelter in <a href="Tidbinbilla%20Nature%20Reserve">Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve</a> indicates habitation dating back at least 21,000 years. It is possible that the area was inhabited for considerably longer, with <a href="Mungo%20Man">evidence</a> of an Aboriginal presence in south-western New South Wales dating back around 40,000–62,000 years. Another site of significance in the reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a <a href="bogong%20moth">bogong moth</a> resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the <a href="Australian%20Alps">Southern Alps</a> and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.

Numerous other culturally significant and archæologically notable sites are known across the territory, including shelters, rock art sites, stone artefact scatters, <a href="scarred%20trees">scarred trees</a> and <a href="chert">chert</a> quarries. Tidbinbilla Mountain is believed to have long been used for Aboriginal initiation ceremonies.

Following European settlement, the growth of the new colony of New South Wales led to an increasing demand for <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a>. Governor <a href="Lachlan%20Macquarie">Lachlan Macquarie</a> supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south of the capital <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, including one to find an overland route to <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay</a>, an area which would later be incorporated into the ACT as its only coastal possession. In 1818 <a href="Charles%20Throsby">Charles Throsby</a>, <a href="Hamilton%20Hume">Hamilton Hume</a>, <a href="James%20Meehan">James Meehan</a> and William Kearns set out to find the route, a task accomplished that same year by Throsby and Kearns.

The 1820s saw further exploration in the Canberra area associated with the construction of a road from Sydney to the <a href="Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Goulburn</a> plains, supervised by Throsby and his overseer, <a href="Joseph%20Wild">Joseph Wild</a>. While working on the project, Throsby learned of a nearby lake and river from the local Aborigines, and he accordingly sent Wild to lead a small party to investigate the site. On 1820, Wild ventured off from his two companions, and later that day arrived at the north shore of what is now known as <a href="Lake%20George%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Lake George</a>. In Governor Macquarie visited the site, and while he was in attendance Throsby decided to push on to reach the river of which he had been informed. Accompanied by Wild and James Vaughan, he journeyed south in search of the <a href="Murrumbidgee%20River">Murrumbidgee</a>. The search was unsuccessful, but they did discover the <a href="Yass%20River">Yass River</a>, and it is surmised that they would have set foot on part of the future ACT.

A second expedition was mounted shortly thereafter, and Throsby's nephew Charles Throsby Smith, Wild and Vaughan further explored the <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo</a> (Ngambri) and <a href="Queanbeyan%20River">Queanbeyan</a> (Jullergung) Rivers, becoming the first Europeans to camp at the site. However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee, and Smith declared that the river did not exist. The issue of the Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821, when Charles Throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached the watercourse, on the way providing the first detailed account of the land where Canberra now resides.

The next significant expedition to the region came in 1823, when Wild was employed by <a href="John%20Ovens">Brigade Major John Ovens</a> and <a href="Mark%20John%20Currie">Captain Mark Currie</a> to guide them to the Murrumbidgee. They travelled south along the river and named the area now known as Tuggeranong "Isabella's Plain", after Isabella Maria Brisbane (1821–1849), the two-year-old daughter of <a href="Thomas%20Brisbane">Thomas Brisbane</a>, the then Governor of New South Wales. Unable to cross the river near the current site of <a href="Tharwa%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Tharwa</a>, they continued on to the Monaro Plains. The last expedition in the region prior to settlement was undertaken by <a href="Allan%20Cunningham%20%28botanist%29">Allan Cunningham</a> in 1824. He reported that the region was suitable for grazing, and the settlement of the Limestone Plains followed immediately thereafter.

When the <a href="Nineteen%20Counties">boundaries for settlement</a> of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> were determined, the Limestone Plains were opened up to settlers. The first land grant in the region was made to Joshua John Moore in 1823, and settlement in the area began in 1824 with the construction of a homestead by his stockmen on what is now the <a href="Acton%20Peninsula">Acton Peninsula</a>. Moore formally purchased the site in 1826 and named the property "Canberry", or "Canberra", although he never visited it. His claim covered much of the future <a href="North%20Canberra">North Canberra</a>.

Adjacent to the eastern boundary on Moore's claim was the settlement of <a href="Duntroon%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Duntroon</a>, occupied by <a href="James%20Ainslie%20%28pastoralist%29">James Ainslie</a> on behalf of <a href="Robert%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20landowner%29">Robert Campbell</a>. John Palmer was granted land in the region, which was taken up by his son George in 1826. He established "Palmerville" near <a href="Ginninderra%20Creek">Ginninderra Creek</a> in 1829, and the "Squire" at <a href="Gungahlin">Gungahlin</a> was completed in 1861. "Palmerville" in the <a href="Ginninderra">Ginninderra</a> district was the site of first school in the region, and operated from 1844 to 1848. The first school in the future Canberra opened on the "Duntroon" Estate, next door to <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Reid">St John's Church</a> in what would become the suburb of Reid in the 20th century. Canberra's first church, St John's, was consecrated and opened for use in 1845.

The <a href="Tuggeranong">Tuggeranong</a> Plains, situated south of the Molonglo River, were first settled in 1827 by Peter Murdoch. The Waniassa Homestead (also known as Tuggeranong Homestead) was established in 1836 by Thomas McQuoid, and the first buildings of the Lanyon estate, owned by John Lanyon and James Wright, were built in 1838. <a href="Tharwa%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Tharwa</a> was settled in 1834; the homestead in this area was "<a href="Cuppacumbalong%20Homestead">Cuppacumbalong</a>", established by James Wright in 1839. Tharwa is the oldest official settlement in the ACT, having been proclaimed in 1862.

Settlers moved further south into what is now the <a href="Namadgi%20National%20Park">Namadgi National Park</a>. William Herbert made a claim over part of the Orroral Valley at some point between 1826 and 1836, while during the 1830s <a href="Garrett%20Cotter">Garrett Cotter</a> inhabited what would later be named the <a href="Cotter%20River">Cotter River</a> Valley, in his honour. From the late 1830s, the Boboyan Homestead and station were established. Gudgenby was settled in the early 1840s and the Gudgenby Homestead was erected around this time. By 1848 most of the major valleys of the Namadgi area had been settled.

Convict labour was widely used in the region, and the first <a href="bushranger">bushranger</a>s in the area were runaway convicts. <a href="John%20Tennant%20%28bushranger%29">John Tennant</a>, the earliest and best-known bushranger of the region, lived in a hideout on what is now known as Mount Tennant, behind Tharwa. From 1827 he raided the local homesteads, stealing stock, food and possessions until his arrest in 1828; He was later hung in Sydney for his crimes. The lawlessness of the region led to the appointment of the first resident magistrate on 1837 – Allured Tasker Faunce, who was also known as "Ironman Faunce" since his time as a magistrate at <a href="Brisbane%20Water">Brisbane Water</a>. The magistrate oversaw legal matters and issued liquor licences to several establishments, the first being the Elmsall Inn on the Duntroon estate in 1841.

A significant influx of population and economic activity occurred around the 1850s <a href="Australian%20gold%20rushes">goldrushes</a>, particularly the Kiandra rush of 1859–60. The goldrushes prompted the establishment of communication between Sydney and the region by way of the <a href="Cobb%20and%20Co">Cobb & Co</a> coaches, which transported mail and passengers. The first post offices opened in Ginninderra in 1859 and at Lanyon the following year. Bushranger activity continued with the goldrushes: Australian-born bandits <a href="Ben%20Hall%20%28bushranger%29">Ben Hall</a> and the <a href="Clarke%20brothers">Clarke brothers</a> were active in the area, targeting <a href="mail%20coach">mail coach</a>es and gold transportation.
<a href="Terence%20Aubrey%20Murray">Terence Aubrey Murray</a> was born in Ireland in 1810 and came to Sydney with his father, a retired redcoat army officer, and siblings in 1827. In 1837, he acquired the <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Canberra">Yarralumla</a> sheep station, taking up residence in Yarralumla's Georgian-style homestead, which he extended. He was elected unopposed to represent the surrounding Counties of <a href="Murray%20County%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Murray</a>, <a href="King%20County%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">King</a> and <a href="Georgiana%20County%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Georgiana</a> in the first partially elective <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Council">Legislative Council</a> in 1843. With the establishment of <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> in 1856, Murray became a member of the first <a href="Members%20of%20the%20New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Assembly%2C%201856%E2%80%931858">Legislative Assembly</a>, representing the electorate of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Southern%20Boroughs">Southern Boroughs</a> – which included nearby <a href="Queanbeyan%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Queanbeyan</a> – and in 1859 he was elected to represent <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Argyle">Argyle</a> – which included another of his pastoral properties, Winderradeen, in the <a href="Collector%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Collector</a> area, north of Canberra.

The <a href="Robertson%20Land%20Acts">Robertson Land Acts</a> and the <a href="Closer%20Settlement%20Acts">Closer Settlement Acts</a> altered the mechanism for granting <a href="land%20tenure">land tenure</a> and precipitated the break-up of large properties in New South Wales. During the 1860s, in the wake of the new government legislation, small farmers nicknamed "selectors" moved into what would become the ACT, taking up parcels of (usually inferior) land which existed between the estates of the wealthy, established landholders.

During colonial times, prior to the establishment of the ACT, the European communities of <a href="Ginninderra">Ginninderra</a>, <a href="Molonglo%20Plains">Molonglo</a> and Tuggeranong settled in and farmed the surrounding land, raising sheep in the main but also breeding horses and growing grain. The region was also called the Queanbeyan/<a href="Yass%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Yass</a> district, after the two largest towns in the area. The villages of Ginninderra and Tharwa developed to service the local agrarian communities. In 1882, the first allotments in the village of Hall – named after early pastoralist Henry Hall – were sold. By 1901, it was an established town with a hotel, coachbuilder, blacksmith, butcher, shoemaker, saddler, dairy and two stores.

In 1886, the agronomist <a href="William%20Farrer">William Farrer</a>, established the research farm 'Lambrigg' on the banks of the Murrumbidgee south of present-day Tuggeranong. Farrer experimented with rust and drought-resistant wheat; the varieties he bred were widely used by Australian growers, and he was later credited with establishing Australia as a major producer. Tharwa Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge in the region, was opened in 1895 and was the first crossing over the Murrumbidgee River. By 1911, when the region came under federal control, the population had grown to 1,714 settlers.

During the first 20 years of settlement, there was only limited contact between the settlers and Aboriginal people. Joseph Franklin purchased land in the <a href="Brindabella%20Ranges">Brindabellas</a> in 1849 and attempted to set up a cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of the mountains. The rush of prospectors into the <a href="Kiandra">Kiandra</a> area through the Brindabellas and the mountains to the west of the ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.

Over the succeeding years, the Ngunnawal and other local indigenous people effectively ceased to exist as cohesive and independent communities adhering to their traditional ways of life. Those who had not succumbed to disease and other predations either dispersed to the local settlements or were relocated to more distant Aboriginal reserves set up by the New South Wales government in the latter part of the 19th century. The children of mixed European-Aboriginal families were generally expected to assimilate into the settlement communities. The Ngunnawal people were subsequently often considered to be "extinct"; however, in a situation parallel to that of the <a href="Tasmanian%20Aborigines">Tasmanian Aborigines</a>, people with claims to Ngunnawal ancestry continue to identify themselves as such. However, there have been contemporary instances of dispute within the community itself over who is properly considered to be a member of the Ngunnawal people.

The district's change from a New South Wales rural area to the national capital began with the debates over <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation</a> during the 19th century. Prior to 1840 <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> was the administrative centre for the colony, and thus it could be presupposed that any potential federal government would be seated there. However, this started to change when, buoyed by the <a href="Victorian%20Gold%20Rush">Victorian Gold Rush</a>, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> grew rapidly, and by 1860 its population had overtaken that of Sydney. The discovery of gold also helped to increase Melbourne's financial base, to the point where at one stage "nearly 5% of all British imperial government revenue ... passed through [Melbourne's] port". Thus Melbourne soon possessed both the size and the economic clout to rival Sydney and to command additional administrative powers.

When Federation was first being discussed, views differed about the location of the capital. Early advocate for Australian federation, <a href="John%20Dunmore%20Lang">John Dunmore Lang</a>, backed Sydney, but <a href="Henry%20Parkes">Henry Parkes</a>, a prominent New South Wales politician and Premier, proposed the capital be founded on "neutral ground", nominating the town of <a href="Albury%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Albury</a> as a location. (Albury was located in New South Wales, yet its position on the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> placed it on the border between New South Wales and Victoria).

In 1898, a referendum on a proposed Constitution was held in four of the colonies – New South Wales, Victoria, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Although the referendum achieved a majority in all four colonies, the New South Wales referendum failed to gain the minimum number of votes needed for the bill to pass. Following this result, a meeting of the four Premiers in 1898 heard from <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Reid</a>, the Premier of New South Wales, who argued that locating the future capital in New South Wales would be sufficient to ensure the passage of the Bill. This was accepted by the other three Premiers, and the proposed <a href="Constitution%20of%20Australia">Australian Constitution</a> was modified so that Section 125 specified that the national capital must be "within the state of New South Wales". However, they also added the condition that it must be situated no less than from Sydney. In addition, if the bill passed, Melbourne would be the interim seat of government (but not referred to as the "capital") until a location for the new capital had been determined. The 1899 referendum on this revised bill was successful, passing with sufficient numbers.
Nevertheless, this left open the question of where to locate the capital. Initially the <a href="Bombala%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bombala</a> district in the far south of NSW was proposed, to which southern <a href="Monaro%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Monaro</a>, (which incorporated Bombala), <a href="Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Orange</a> and <a href="Yass%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Yass</a> were soon added. The NSW Premier, <a href="John%20See">John See</a>, offered to provide any of the three recommended sites as a future capital territory. <a href="Edmund%20Barton">Edmund Barton</a>, the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> of the new Federal Government, added another four sites to this list: <a href="Albury">Albury</a>, <a href="Tamworth%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tamworth</a>, <a href="Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Armidale</a> and <a href="Tumut%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tumut</a>, and members of the new government toured the various sites in 1902. The tour proved inconclusive, and upon their return the members decided to refer the problem to a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>, with the <a href="Minister%20for%20Home%20Affairs">Minister for Home Affairs</a>, <a href="William%20Lyne">William Lyne</a>, pushing for Tumut or Albury as he preferred a site in his electorate. Subsequently, the Commission presented its report to Parliament in 1903, recommending the sites of <a href="Albury%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Albury</a>, <a href="Tumut%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tumut</a> and <a href="Orange%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Orange</a>, in that order. However, there continued to be problems, as the House of Representatives backed the Tumut option, while the Senate preferred the town of Bombala. As a result of this disagreement the bill lapsed, and it was left to the second Parliament to choose a location for the capital.

The new Parliament met in 1904 and reached a compromise, choosing <a href="Dalgety%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Dalgety</a>, which, like Bombala, was located in the Monaro region. Thus, with the passage of the "<a href="Seat%20of%20Government%20Act%201904">Seat of Government Act 1904</a>", it appeared that the matter had been settled. However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.
Finally, in 1906, New South Wales agreed to cede sufficient land, but on the condition that it was in the <a href="Yass%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Yass</a>-<a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> region, this site being closer to Sydney. Following a tour of the region by several Senators and Members of the Commonwealth Parliament, in 1908 a new ballot was called in the Federal Parliament with eleven sites nominated. Initially, Dalgety remained at the forefront, but by the eighth round Yass-Canberra had emerged as a new leader, and the site was confirmed in the ninth round of voting. Thus was passed the new "<a href="Seat%20of%20Government%20Act%201908">Seat of Government Act 1908</a>", which repealed the 1904 Act and specified a capital in the Yass-Canberra region.

Government Surveyor <a href="Charles%20Scrivener">Charles Scrivener</a> was deployed to the region in the same year in order to map out a specific site and, after an extensive search, settled upon the present location, about south-west of Sydney in the foothills of the Australian Alps.

In 1909, New South Wales transferred the land for the creation of the Federal Capital Territory to federal control through two pieces of legislation, the "<a href="Seat%20of%20Government%20Acceptance%20Act%201909">Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909</a>" and the "<a href="Seat%20of%20Government%20Surrender%20Act%201909">Seat of Government Surrender Act 1909</a>". The Act transferred <a href="Crown%20land">Crown land</a> in the counties of <a href="Murray%20County%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Murray</a> and <a href="Cowley%20County%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cowley</a> to the Commonwealth, which amounted to an area about and eight parcels of land near <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay</a>. All private land in the surrendered area had to be bought by the Commonwealth. The Seat of Government Acceptance Act also gave the Commonwealth rights to use and control the waters of the Queanbeyan and <a href="Molonglo%20River">Molonglo River</a>s.

In 1910, the "<a href="Seat%20of%20Government%20%28Administration%29%20Act%201910">Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910</a>" created the legal framework for the Territory. The act specified that laws in the Territory could be made by the Commonwealth and that Ordinances could be made by the Governor-General, and placed the ACT under the jurisdiction of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales Supreme Court</a>. When the Act came into force on 1911, control of the Territory was officially assumed by the Commonwealth. This Act remained the constitutional basis for law-making in the ACT until the granting of self-government in 1989.

The <a href="Minister%20for%20Home%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Home Affairs</a>, <a href="King%20O%27Malley">King O'Malley</a>, who was responsible for the legislation creating the ACT, also introduced a bill in 1910 making the ACT an alcohol-free area; this bill was passed by the Federal parliament and the law was not repealed until 1928. Until that time local residents travelled to <a href="Queanbeyan%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Queanbeyan</a>, just across the New South Wales border, to drink on Saturday. In 1938 the Territory was formally renamed the Australian Capital Territory.

The "<a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory%20Acceptance%20Act%201915">Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915</a>" and the New South Wales "<a href="Seat%20of%20Government%20Surrender%20Act%201915">Seat of Government Surrender Act 1915</a>" created a <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Territory of Jervis Bay</a>, which was administered as part of the Federal Capital Territory and with all laws of the Territory applicable.

Prior to the final decision on the location of the new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing <a href="freehold%20%28real%20property%29">freehold</a> arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would be in a position to capitalise on the new circumstances.

Such was not the case. Legislation restricted land holdings in the new territory to <a href="leasehold">leasehold</a>, rather than freehold. This was intended to avoid land speculation and give the national government, as the lessor, greater control over development. Landowners were concerned that the legislation had a number of shortcomings: land valuations were fixed to the date when the Act passed ( 1908), there was no compensation for improvements made to the land, and owners were not given first right of refusal when their old land was offered for lease.

Along with the loss of their land, local residents discovered that they had been disenfranchised. Now a part of the ACT, they had lost their vote in the New South Wales government, and their numbers were too small to warrant a seat in the new federal parliament. As a result, they had no representation in parliament through which to argue against the provisions of the legislation.

In response the residents formed the <a href="Federal%20Territory%20Vigilance%20Association">Vigilance Association</a> with the intent of protecting their interests during the establishment of the new capital territory. Legal challenges to the resumption of the land were unsuccessful, but the Vigilance Association did win some concessions: the government agreed to pay for the improvements to the land, and did so at the value when the land was acquired; and the landowners gained the right of first refusal on their old properties when they were put up for lease. As of 2010 all residential land in the ACT is held on a 99-year crown lease.

One of the first federal facilities established in the Territory was the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College</a>, established on the Campbells' property <a href="Duntroon%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Duntroon</a>, which opened in 1911. Prior to this, Australia's military lacked formally trained officers, who were needed due to changes to the Australian military model that had emerged after Federation.

In the same year, an international competition to design the future capital was held, which was won by the Chicago architect <a href="Walter%20Burley%20Griffin">Walter Burley Griffin</a> in 1912. Griffin's proposal, rendered by his architect wife <a href="Marion%20Mahony%20Griffin">Marion Mahony Griffin</a>, had an abundance of geometric patterns, incorporated concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several centres. It had as its centrepiece an elaborate lake composed of smaller bodies of water, with extensive natural vegetation around it. Griffin's proposal was "the grandest scheme submitted, yet it had an appealing simplicity and clarity". The lakes and geometry were deliberately designed so that their orientation was related to various natural topographical landmarks. It was further intended that buildings of national significance and natural landmarks would align with these geometric axes. Later, Scrivener, as part of a government committee, was responsible for modifying Griffin's winning design. He recommended a less elaborate and geometric shape, which Griffin opposed, saying that geometry was "one of the raison d'etre of the ornamental waters", but he was overruled. The new design was widely criticised as being ugly.

The official naming of Canberra occurred on 1913, and construction began immediately. After official indecision over the plan, revisions and their implementation, Griffin was invited to Canberra to discuss the matter. He arrived in and was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction for three years. Bureaucratic wrangling delayed Griffin's work; a Royal Commission in 1916 ruled his authority for executing the plan had been usurped by certain officials. Griffin had a strained working relationship with the Australian authorities, and a lack of federal government funding meant that by the time he left in 1920, little significant work had been done on the city. Prime Minister <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a> removed Griffin from his position. At the time of his removal, Griffin had revised his plan, overseen the earthworks of the major avenues, and established the Glenloch Cork Plantation.
After Griffin's departure, the <a href="Federal%20Capital%20Advisory%20Committee">Federal Capital Advisory Committee</a> was established to advise the government of the construction efforts. The Committee had limited success meeting its goals; however, the chairman, <a href="John%20Sulman">John Sulman</a>, was instrumental in applying the ideas of the <a href="garden%20city%20movement">garden city movement</a> to Griffin's plan. The Committee was replaced in 1925 by the <a href="Federal%20Capital%20Commission">Federal Capital Commission</a>. The role of the FCC was to prepare Canberra for the transfer of the Commonwealth Parliament and the public service from Melbourne to Canberra. The Federal Government officially relocated to the ACT from Melbourne on the formal opening of the <a href="Old%20Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Provisional Parliament House</a> on 1927. Among the new Parliament's first acts was the repeal of the prohibition laws. At first the public service remained based in Melbourne, the various departments' headquarters only gradually moving to Canberra over the space of several years. From 1938 to 1957 the <a href="National%20Capital%20Planning%20and%20Development%20Committee">National Capital Planning and Development Committee</a> continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra; however, the NCPDC did not have executive power, and decisions were made on the development of Canberra without the Committee's consultation. A few major buildings were constructed during this period of NCPDC responsibility, such as the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, which opened in 1941. With the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, followed by <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>, development of the new capital was slow, and in the decade after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village, and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly. Canberra was often derisively described as "several suburbs in search of a city". The Prime Minister, <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment. Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city, feeling that their performance lacked intensity. Menzies ruled for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly.
After World War II there was a shortage of housing and office space in Canberra, so a Senate Select Committee hearing was held in 1954 to address its development requirements. This Committee recommended the creation of a single planning body with executive power. Consequently, the NCPDC was replaced by the <a href="National%20Capital%20Development%20Commission">National Capital Development Commission</a> in 1957. The NCDC ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of <a href="Lake%20Burley%20Griffin">Lake Burley Griffin</a>, and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work. The completion of the centrepiece of Griffin's design finally the laid the platform for the development of Griffin's <a href="Parliamentary%20Triangle%2C%20Canberra">Parliamentary Triangle</a>. In the four decades since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance were constructed on the lakefront. According to the policy plan of the government, "The lake is not only one of the centrepieces of Canberra's plan in its own right, but forms the immediate foreground of the National Parliamentary Area." The newly built <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>, on the northern shores of the lake was expanded, and sculptures and monuments were built.

The completion of the central basin placed a waterway between Parliament House and the War Memorial and a landscaped boulevard was built along the land axis. A new <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library</a> was constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle, followed by the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a>, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery</a> and finally a new <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House</a> in 1988. In 2001, the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum</a> was built on the former lakeside site of the <a href="Royal%20Canberra%20Hospital">Royal Canberra Hospital</a>.

On average, the population of Canberra increased by more than 50% every five years between 1955 and 1975 as the development of the capital became more concerted. To accommodate the influx of residents, the NCDC oversaw the release of new residential land though the creation of new town centres: <a href="Woden%20Valley">Woden</a> opened in 1964, followed by <a href="Belconnen">Belconnen</a> in 1966, <a href="Weston%20Creek">Weston Creek</a> in 1969 and <a href="Tuggeranong">Tuggeranong</a> in 1973. The NCDC was disbanded in 1988, its planning authority transferred to the newly created ACT government and the new <a href="National%20Capital%20Authority">National Capital Authority</a>, which was established to oversee Commonwealth interests in development of the national capital. Canberra has continued to grow with the further release of residential land in <a href="Gungahlin">Gungahlin</a> in the 1990s.

A significant priority for the establishment of Canberra was the construction of water storage facilities. <a href="Cotter%20Dam">Cotter Dam</a> was the first dam built on the <a href="Cotter%20River">Cotter River</a>; construction on this concrete gravity dam started in 1912 and finished in 1915. Its height was raised to in 1951. <a href="Water%20chlorination">Chlorination</a> of Canberra's water began at Cotter Dam in 1955; operations were moved to the Mount Stromlo Water Treatment Plant in .

Two additional dams were built on the Cotter: the <a href="Bendora%20Dam">Bendora Dam</a>, a double-curvature, concrete-arch structure, was completed in 1961; and the <a href="Corin%20Dam">Corin Dam</a>, an earth and rock-fill embankment dam, was built in 1968. In 1979 <a href="Googong%20Dam">Googong Dam</a> was built on the <a href="Queanbeyan%20River">Queanbeyan River</a> in New South Wales.

Transport into and out of the ACT was an early development priority. In 1931 the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20%28Australia%29">Federal Highway</a> linking the ACT to <a href="Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Goulburn</a> was completed, and in 1936 an airfield was constructed at Duntroon. On 1940 Australia's chief military officer and three senior ministers in the Menzies Government, <a href="James%20Fairbairn">James Fairbairn</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20Street">Geoffrey Street</a> and <a href="Henry%20Somer%20Gullett">Henry Somer Gullett</a>, were killed <a href="Canberra%20air%20disaster%2C%201940">when their plane crashed</a> on the southern approach to Canberra.

A branch from the <a href="Bombala%20railway%20line">Bombala railway line</a> was built from Queanbeyan to <a href="Canberra%20railway%20station">Canberra station</a> in 1914 and extended to Civic in , but the bridge over the Molonglo River was washed away in 1922 and never rebuilt. Plans to build a railway to Yass were abandoned. A <a href="Narrow%20gauge%20railway">1067 mm gauge</a> construction railway was built in 1923 between the <a href="Yarralumla%20brickworks">Yarralumla brickworks</a> and the provisional Parliament House. It was later extended to Civic, but the whole line was closed in . A railway connecting Canberra to Jervis Bay was planned, but never constructed. Several facilities were built in Jervis Bay including the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20College">Royal Australian Naval College</a> ("HMAS Creswell") erected in 1913, the Jervis Bay Air Base Range, and a Botanic Gardens.

The native forest of the ACT was composed almost wholly of <a href="eucalyptus">eucalypt</a> species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes, especially during the economic boom following World War II. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality in the Cotter River catchment led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry had begun in 1915, when <a href="Thomas%20Weston%20%28horticulturalist%29">T. C. G. Weston</a> had commenced trials of a number of species including "<a href="Monterey%20Pine">Pinus radiata</a>" on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Plantation forestry began in earnest in 1926 with planted annually around <a href="Uriarra%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Uriarra</a> and <a href="Pierces%20Creek%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Pierce's Creek</a>.

By 1938 the area planted yearly was , with the favourable benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment. In 1967 the Australian Government approved a plan for a total of plantation in the ACT, which was achieved in 1970. The ease of access to the plantations has made them popular recreation areas for Canberrans. Throughout the 20th century, significant areas of plantation forest were periodically lost to bushfires, with major fires occurring in 1939, 1952, 1979, 1983, 2001 and <a href="2003%20Canberra%20bushfires">2003</a>.
In 1936 about of forest was set aside to create the <a href="Tidbinbilla%20Nature%20Reserve">Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve</a>, and in 1939 a koala enclose was built by the Institute of Anatomy. The government acquired land to establish a national park and fauna reserve in 1962, expanding it to and later, to its current size of . In 1969 the first wildlife displays were created, and the park was officially gazetted in 1971. In 1984 the <a href="Namadgi%20National%20Park">Namadgi National Park</a> was declared. It is and takes up approximately 46% of the ACT's land.

In 1911, Mount Stromlo was assessed as a possible site for a <a href="Mount%20Stromlo%20Observatory">Commonwealth Solar Observatory</a>, and it became the location of the facility in 1924. It was operated as a Commonwealth government facility until 1957, when it was transferred to the Australian National University (ANU). From 1944 to 1968 it was also the site of the national time-keeping service. By the early 1980s, Mount Stromlo, together with the ANU's Siding Spring observatory, was producing Australia's greatest astronomical research output.

The Australian Government signed an agreement with the United States in 1960 for the establishment of satellite-tracking stations in the ACT. As a result of the agreement, three tracking stations were built in the ACT by <a href="NASA">NASA</a>. The <a href="Canberra%20Deep%20Space%20Communication%20Complex">Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex</a> was officially opened on 1965 by Prime Minister Menzies, and is the only station still in operation in the ACT, communicating with interplanetary spacecraft.

The <a href="Orroral%20Valley%20Tracking%20Station">Orroral Valley Tracking Station</a>, which was for orbiting satellite support, opened in in what is now part of <a href="Namadgi%20National%20Park">Namadgi National Park</a>, was closed down in 1985. <a href="Honeysuckle%20Creek%20Tracking%20Station">Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station</a>, completed in , was a communications relay station for <a href="Project%20Apollo">Project Apollo</a>, <a href="Skylab">Skylab</a> and interplanetary spacecraft from 1967 until 1981, when its antenna was moved to the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex. It was closed in and is now being dismantled.

The <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20Police">Australian Capital Territory Police</a> was created in 1927, the same year the federal government moved to the ACT, with eleven officers. The size of the force grew over subsequent decades with the development of Canberra, and oversaw law and order in the territory until 1979. In that year, the ACT Police merged with the Commonwealth Police and the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Narcotics%20%28Australia%29">Federal Narcotics Bureau</a> to form the <a href="Australian%20Federal%20Police">Australian Federal Police</a> (AFP), which then took responsibility for law and order in Canberra. Since self-government was granted in 1988, the AFP has performed this under contract to the ACT government.

The ACT was given its first federal representation in 1949, when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the <a href="Division%20of%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Division of Australian Capital Territory</a>, under the 1948 Representation Act which increased the size of the House of Representatives. The ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the Territory. In 1974, the ACT and the Northern Territory were each allocated two Senate seats. In 1974, the House of Representatives seat was divided into two, the <a href="Division%20of%20Canberra">Division of Canberra</a> and <a href="Division%20of%20Fraser%20%28Australian%20Capital%20Territory%29">Division of Fraser</a>. A third, the <a href="Division%20of%20Namadgi">Division of Namadgi</a>, was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 after an updated assessment of changes to the regional demographic distribution. Both House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, while ALP and the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party of Australia</a> have always each held one Senate seat.

In 1930, the ACT Advisory Council was established to advise the Minister for Territories on the community's concerns and from 1934 the territory had its own <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Supreme Court</a>. In 1974 the Council became a <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20House%20of%20Assembly">fully elected Legislative Assembly</a>, advising the Minister of the Capital Territory, and in 1979 this renamed the House of Assembly.

Although there was a push by residents of the ACT for a greater say in the management of the territory, this did not necessarily equate to a desire for self-governance. <a href="John%20Overall%20%28architect%29">John Overall</a>, who served as the head of the NCDC from 1957 to 1972, summarised the distinction in "Canberra: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow":

Nevertheless, there were many residents in Canberra who wanted self-government, and there were a number of forces pushing the territory in that direction. In 1973 the Minister for the Capital Territory, <a href="Gordon%20Bryant">Gordon Bryant</a>, announced that the ACT would have self-government within 12 months.

The formation of the Legislative Assembly in 1974 was intended as the significant step towards self-government, but the <a href="Whitlam%20Government">Whitlam Government</a>, under whose auspices the Assembly was formed, tended to "override or ignore its wishes." Similarly, the subsequent 1975 <a href="Fraser%20Government">Fraser Government</a> seemed uninterested in the Assembly. However, in February 1975, <a href="Tony%20Staley">Tony Staley</a> accepted the post of Minister for the Capital Territory. Staley had been a supporter of self-government for the ACT, and he proposed a model whereby Canberrans would rapidly gain control of much of the territory's administration. The model found opposition, though, in part because it failed to adequately address the funding arrangements.

Although Staley's plan did not eventuate, the next person to run the Ministry, <a href="Robert%20Ellicott">Robert Ellicott</a>, chose to hold a <a href="referendum">referendum</a> on the issue. The referendum on 27 November 1978 provided the residents of the territory with three options:
A clear majority voted for continuing with the status quo – 63.75%, as opposed to 5.72% in favour of the local government model and 30.54% supporting the "state style" self-government approach.

Overall identified a number of reasons why residents opposed self-government. Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would have felt that they already had a voice in the governance of the territory, through federal electoral representation. Canberra also had a high proportion of <a href="public%20servant">public servant</a>s who felt that they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.

In spite of the result, the referendum failed to end the debate. There were a number of pressures that continued to push the ACT towards self-government, including:
In 1988, the new minister for the ACT, <a href="Gary%20Punch">Gary Punch</a>, received a report recommending the abolition of the NCDC and the formation of a locally elected government. Punch recommended that the <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Hawke government</a> accept the report's recommendations, and subsequently <a href="Clyde%20Holding">Clyde Holding</a> introduced legislation to grant self-government to the Territory in October 1988.

The enactment on 6 December 1988 of the "<a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20%28Self-Government%29%20Act%201988">Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988</a>" established the framework for ACT Self-government. The <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20general%20election%2C%201989">first election</a> for the 17-member <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory%20Legislative%20Assembly">Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly</a> was held on 1989. The provisions of the Act establishing the ACT as a self-governing territory within the Commonwealth of Australia commenced operation on 11 May 1989, coinciding with the first sitting of the Legislative Assembly at 1 <a href="Constitution%20Avenue%2C%20Canberra">Constitution Avenue</a>, <a href="City%20Centre%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Civic</a>. The <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> formed the ACT's first government, led by <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20the%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Chief Minister</a> <a href="Rosemary%20Follett">Rosemary Follett</a>, who made history as Australia's first female head of government. Although since the commencement of self-government, ACT law has continued to apply in general to the <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a> under section 4A of the <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory%20Acceptance%20Act%201915">Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915</a>, the ACT as defined under the Self-Government Act 1988 does not include Jervis Bay, which continues to be administered by the Commonwealth. Since 1992, members of the Assembly have been elected by the <a href="Single%20Transferable%20Vote">Hare-Clark</a> proportional representation system from three multi-member electorates, which replaced the modified <a href="D%27Hondt%20method">D'Hondt method</a> used in the inaugural election, in which the 17 representatives were elected from a territory-wide electorate.

Whereas the ACT's federal electorates have been mainly held by Labor, the Liberal Party has been able to gain some footing in the ACT Assembly, and were in government for just over eight of the Assembly's 21-year history. Most of this was during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001, which ended when Labor gained a 14.1% swing at the polls. In contrast to the state elections, Labor has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberals at every federal election since 1990, and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points.

The initial years of self-government were difficult and unstable. A majority of ACT residents had opposed self-government and had it imposed upon them by the federal parliament, and at the first election, 4 of the 17 seats were won by anti-self-government single-issue parties due to a protest vote by disgruntled territorians, and a total of 8 were won by minor parties and independents. Follett and Labor won only four seats and had to form a minority government, as seven groups were represented in total. Some of the anti-self-government representatives sought to disrupt the territory's legislature from the inside, and a no-confidence motion toppled Labor after only seven months. <a href="Trevor%20Kaine">Trevor Kaine</a> and the Liberals ruled for 18 months before being deposed, and Follett's Labor returned, the third government in 25 months. In 1992, Labor won eight seats, and the minor parties and independents won only three. Stability increased, and in 1995, <a href="Kate%20Carnell">Kate Carnell</a> became the first elected Liberal chief minister. In 1998 Carnell became the first chief minister to be re-elected. She was regarded as a proactive leader but resigned in 2000 after two independents who had supported her minority government withdrew their support. At the time, she had been embroiled in controversy over the funding of the <a href="Canberra%20Stadium">Canberra Stadium</a> and an accidental fatality caused by the <a href="Royal%20Canberra%20Hospital%20implosion">Royal Canberra Hospital implosion</a>. Labor have won the three elections since 2001, and in 2004 formed the first majority government in the territory, but after the 2008 election were forced into minority government with the <a href="Australian%20Greens">Greens</a>.

In 2006, the majority Labor government made sweeping changes to the education system, shutting down 23 schools across the territory. These were made in the face of sustained public opposition, and since then, there have been campaigns from opposition parties and the community to re-open some of them. This included the 2008 election, where it was a major topic.

Since the 1993 creation of the National Native Title Tribunal, there have been four separate claims to <a href="Native%20Title">Native Title</a> lodged over alienated lands in the ACT by representatives of the <a href="Ngunnawal%20people">Ngunnawal communities</a>, in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2002. The first two of these were discontinued after reaching a Federal Court hearing, and the third was rejected as not meeting applicable provisions. The fourth claim was dismissed.

In 2001, the ACT government entered into a cooperative agreement with the Aboriginal community over the management of <a href="Namadgi%20National%20Park">Namadgi National Park</a>. The deal no longer exists.

In the 1990s, a number of activities which are or were illegal in other Australian states were legalised in the ACT. These include the sale of X-rated pornographic materials (1989) and prostitution in brothels (1992), although brothels are only permitted to operate in the suburbs of <a href="Hume%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Hume</a>, <a href="Mitchell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Mitchell</a> and <a href="Fyshwick%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Fyshwick</a>. The personal use of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a> was decriminalised in 1992 and abortion was decriminalised in 2002. In 2006, the ACT Government attempted to introduce a law recognising civil unions, but it was overturned by the federal government.

The first years of the 21st century saw a period of extended drought in the ACT region, accompanied by several bushfires that caused widespread devastation. Over the 2001 Christmas period, five separate bushfires burnt over of forest in the ACT, including millions of dollars' worth of plantation pine forest.

The drought conditions continued during the following years, and in 2003 the ACT burned again. The <a href="2003%20Canberra%20bushfires">2003 bushfires</a> damaged around 70% of the ACT's area, including 99% of the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve and significant areas of government-owned pine plantation. Four people were killed and 67 rural houses were destroyed, including 16 houses at Uriarra, 12 at Pierces Creek; 414 houses in the outer suburbs of Canberra were razed.

More than 200 other houses were damaged, and numerous buildings of historical significance were lost, including the Mount Franklin Chalet, which was built in 1937–38 for the Canberra Alpine Club and was the first club-built ski lodge in mainland Australia, and many others in the Namadgi National Park. Nil Desperandum and Rock Valley Homestead, the two historic houses at Tidbinbilla, were destroyed. Most buildings of the <a href="Mount%20Stromlo%20Observatory">Mount Stromlo Observatory</a>, operated by the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>, were destroyed, including the observatory's Oddie telescope and its dome, which had been built in 1911 and was the first federal building in the ACT.

On 7 December 2013, the ACT <a href="Marriage%20Equality%20%28Same%20Sex%29%20Act%202013">same-sex marriage act</a> came into effect, making the ACT the first legislature in Australia to allow same-sex marriages. On 12 December 2013, the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a> unanimously held this law to be invalid for inconsistency with the federal Marriage Act 1961. However, all parties to the case had agreed and the Court accepted that the federal parliament's power to make laws with respect to "marriage", Constitution s 51(21), extends to same-sex marriage. There can now be uniform federal law for marriages of any kind.
