Carmen

Carmen (; ) is an <a href="opera">opera</a> in four acts by French composer <a href="Georges%20Bizet">Georges Bizet</a>. The <a href="libretto">libretto</a> was written by <a href="Henri%20Meilhac">Henri Meilhac</a> and <a href="Ludovic%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Ludovic Halévy</a>, based on a <a href="Carmen%20%28novella%29">novella of the same title</a> by <a href="Prosper%20M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e">Prosper Mérimée</a>. The opera was first performed by the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a> in Paris on 3 March 1875, where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences.

Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance, unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years. "Carmen" has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical <a href="Western%20canon">canon</a>; the "<a href="Habanera%20%28aria%29">Habanera</a>" from act 1 and the "<a href="Toreador%20Song">Toreador Song</a>" from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias.

The opera is written in the genre of "<a href="op%C3%A9ra%20comique">opéra comique</a>" with musical numbers separated by dialogue. It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José, a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery <a href="Romani%20people">gypsy</a> Carmen. José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties, yet loses Carmen's love to the glamorous <a href="torero">torero</a> Escamillo, after which José kills her in a jealous rage. The depictions of proletarian life, immorality, and lawlessness, and the tragic death of the main character on stage, broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial.

After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French public was generally indifferent. "Carmen" initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883. Thereafter, it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that "Carmen" forms the bridge between the tradition of "opéra comique" and the realism or "<a href="verismo">verismo</a>" that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.

The music of "Carmen" has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody, harmony, atmosphere, and orchestration, and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters. After the composer's death, the score was subject to significant amendment, including the introduction of <a href="recitative">recitative</a> in place of the original dialogue; there is no standard edition of the opera, and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet's intentions. The opera has been recorded many times since the first <a href="Gramophone%20record%2378%20rpm%20disc%20developments">acoustical</a> recording in 1908, and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations.

In the Paris of the 1860s, despite being a <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a> laureate, Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed. The capital's two main state-funded opera houses—<a href="Paris%20Opera">the Opéra</a> and the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent. Bizet's professional relationship with <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Carvalho">Léon Carvalho</a>, manager of the independent <a href="Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20Lyrique">Théâtre Lyrique</a> company, enabled him to bring to the stage two full-scale operas, "<a href="Les%20p%C3%AAcheurs%20de%20perles">Les pêcheurs de perles</a>" (1863) and "<a href="La%20jolie%20fille%20de%20Perth">La jolie fille de Perth</a>" (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.

When artistic life in Paris resumed after the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870–71, Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works; his one-act opera "<a href="Djamileh">Djamileh</a>" opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances, it led to a further commission from the theatre, this time for a full-length opera for which <a href="Henri%20Meilhac">Henri Meilhac</a> and <a href="Ludovic%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Ludovic Halévy</a> would provide the libretto. Halévy, who had written the text for Bizet's student opera "<a href="Le%20docteur%20Miracle">Le docteur Miracle</a>" (1856), was a cousin of Bizet's wife, <a href="Genevi%C3%A8ve%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Geneviève</a>; he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Jacques Offenbach</a>'s operettas.

Bizet was delighted with the Opéra-Comique commission, and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in "the absolute certainty of having found my path". The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer, librettists and the Opéra-Comique management; <a href="Adolphe%20de%20Leuven">Adolphe de Leuven</a>, on behalf of the theatre, made several suggestions that were politely rejected. It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of <a href="Prosper%20M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e">Prosper Mérimée</a>'s novella "<a href="Carmen%20%28novella%29">Carmen</a>". Mérimée's story is a blend of travelogue and adventure yarn, possibly inspired by the writer's lengthy travels in Spain in 1830, and had originally been published in 1845 in the journal "<a href="Revue%20des%20deux%20Mondes">Revue des deux Mondes</a>". It may have been influenced in part by <a href="Alexander%20Pushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a>'s 1824 poem "<a href="The%20Gypsies%20%28poem%29">The Gypsies</a>", a work Mérimée had translated into French; it has also been suggested that the story was developed from an incident told to Mérimée by his friend the Countess Montijo. Bizet may first have encountered the story during his Rome sojourn of 1858–60, since his journals record Mérimée as one of the writers whose works he absorbed in those years.


"A square, in Seville. On the right, a door to the tobacco factory. At the back, a bridge. On the left, a guardhouse."

A group of soldiers relaxes in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by ("Sur la place, chacun passe"). Micaëla appears, seeking José. Moralès tells her that "José is not yet on duty" and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. José arrives with the new guard, who is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins ("Avec la garde montante").
As the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd ("La cloche a sonné"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative <a href="Habanera%20%28aria%29">habanera</a> on the untameable nature of love ("L'amour est un oiseau rebelle"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.

As the women go back to the factory, Micaëla returns and gives José a letter and a kiss from his mother ("Parle-moi de ma mère!"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as José declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance ("Tra la la... Coupe-moi, brûle-moi"); Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with José, Carmen beguiles him with a <a href="seguidilla">seguidilla</a>, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover—whoever that may be—in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, José agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. José is arrested for dereliction of duty.

"Lillas Pastia's Inn"

Two months have passed. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercédès are entertaining Zuniga and other officers ("Les tringles des sistres tintaient") in Pastia's inn. Carmen is delighted to learn of José's release from two months' detention. Outside, a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo ("Vivat, vivat le Toréro"). Invited inside, he introduces himself with the "<a href="Toreador%20Song">Toreador Song</a>" ("Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre") and sets his sights on Carmen, who brushes him aside. Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away.

When only Carmen, Frasquita and Mercédès remain, smugglers Dancaïre and Remendado arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband ("Nous avons en tête une affaire"). Frasquita and Mercédès are keen to help them, but Carmen refuses, since she wishes to wait for José. After the smugglers leave, José arrives. Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance ("Je vais danser en votre honneur ... La la la"), but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks. When José says he must return to duty, she mocks him, and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square ("La fleur que tu m'avais jetée"). Unconvinced, Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her. José refuses to desert, but as he prepares to depart, Zuniga enters looking for Carmen. He and José fight, and are separated by the returning smugglers, who restrain Zuniga. Having attacked a superior officer, José now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers ("Suis-nous à travers la campagne").

"A wild spot in the mountains"

Carmen and José enter with the smugglers and their booty ("Écoute, écoute, compagnons"); Carmen has now become bored with José and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother. Frasquita and Mercédès amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death, and José's. The women depart to suborn the customs officers who are watching the locality. José is placed on guard duty.

Micaëla enters with a guide, seeking José and determined to rescue him from Carmen ("Je dis que rien ne m'épouvante"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is José, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. José's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight ("Je suis Escamillo, toréro de Grenade"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls ("Holà, holà José"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.

"A square in Seville. At the back, the walls of an ancient amphitheatre"

Zuniga, Frasquita and Mercédès are among the crowd awaiting the arrival of the bullfighters ("Les voici ! Voici la quadrille!"). Escamillo enters with Carmen, and they express their mutual love ("Si tu m'aimes, Carmen"). As Escamillo goes into the arena, Frasquita and Mercedes warn Carmen that José is nearby, but Carmen is unafraid and willing to speak to him. Alone, she is confronted by the desperate José ("C'est toi ! C'est moi !"). While he pleads vainly for her to return to him, cheers are heard from the arena. As José makes his last entreaty, Carmen contemptuously throws down the ring he gave her and attempts to enter the arena. He then stabs her, and as Escamillo is acclaimed by the crowds, Carmen dies. José kneels and sings "Ah! Carmen! ma Carmen adorée!"; as the crowd exits the arena, José confesses to killing the woman he loved.

Meilhac and Halévy were a long-standing duo with an established division of labour: Meilhac, who was completely unmusical, wrote the dialogue and Halévy the verses. There is no clear indication of when work began on "Carmen". Bizet and the two librettists were all in Paris during 1873 and easily able to meet; thus there is little written record or correspondence relating to the beginning of the collaboration. The libretto was prepared in accordance with the conventions of "opéra comique", with dialogue separating musical numbers. It deviates from Mérimée's novella in a number of significant respects. In the original, events are spread over a much longer period of time, and much of the main story is narrated by José from his prison cell, as he awaits execution for Carmen's murder. Micaëla does not feature in Mérimée's version, and the Escamillo character is peripheral—a <a href="picador">picador</a> named Lucas who is only briefly Carmen's grand passion. Carmen has a husband called Garcia, whom José kills during a quarrel. In the novella, Carmen and José are presented much less sympathetically than they are in the opera; Bizet's biographer Mina Curtiss comments that Mérimée's Carmen, on stage, would have seemed "an unmitigated and unconvincing monster, had her character not been simplified and deepened".

With rehearsals due to begin in October 1873, Bizet began composing in or around January of that year, and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more. At that point, according to Bizet's biographer <a href="Winton%20Dean">Winton Dean</a>, "some hitch at the Opéra-Comique intervened", and the project was suspended for a while. One reason for the delay may have been the difficulties in finding a singer for the title role. Another was a split that developed between the joint directors of the theatre, <a href="Camille%20du%20Locle">Camille du Locle</a> and <a href="Adolphe%20de%20Leuven">Adolphe de Leuven</a>, over the advisability of staging the work. De Leuven had vociferously opposed the entire notion of presenting so risqué a story in what he considered a family theatre and was sure that audiences would be frightened away. He was assured by Halévy that the story would be toned down, that Carmen's character would be softened, and offset by Micaëla, described by Halévy as "a very innocent, very chaste young girl". Furthermore, the gypsies would be presented as comic characters, and Carmen's death would be overshadowed at the end by "triumphal processions, ballets and joyous fanfares". De Leuven reluctantly agreed, but his continuing hostility towards the project led to his resignation from the theatre early in 1874.
After the various delays, Bizet appears to have resumed work on "Carmen" early in 1874. He completed the draft of the composition—1,200 pages of music—in the summer, which he spent at the artists' colony at <a href="Bougival">Bougival</a>, just outside Paris. He was pleased with the result, informing a friend: "I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody". During the period of rehearsals, which began in October, Bizet repeatedly altered the music—sometimes at the request of the orchestra who found some of it impossible to perform, sometimes to meet the demands of individual singers, and otherwise in response to the demands of the theatre's management. The vocal score that Bizet published in March 1875 shows significant changes from the version of the score that he sold to the publishers, <a href="Paul%20de%20Choudens">Choudens</a>, in January 1875; the conducting score used at the premiere differs from each of these documents. There is no definitive edition, and there are differences among musicologists about which version represents the composer's true intentions. Bizet also changed the libretto, reordering sequences and imposing his own verses where he felt that the librettists had strayed too far from the character of Mérimée's original. Among other changes, he provided new words for Carmen's "Habanera", and rewrote the text of Carmen's solo in the act 3 card scene. He also provided a new opening line for the "Seguidilla" in act 1.

Most of the characters in "Carmen"—the soldiers, the smugglers, the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo—are reasonably familiar types within the "opéra comique" tradition, although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual. The two principals, José and Carmen, lie outside the genre. While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous, amoral schemer, even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of "opéra comique". They are more akin to the "<a href="verismo">verismo</a>" style that would find fuller expression in the works of <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a>.

Dean considers that José is the central figure of the opera: "It is his fate rather than Carmen's that interests us". The music characterizes his gradual decline, act by act, from honest soldier to deserter, vagabond and finally murderer. In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Micaëla; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness, the result of his experiences as a prisoner, but it is clear that by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control. Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave his cage even when the door is opened for him, ravaged by a mix of conscience, jealousy and despair. In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism: "He will make one more appeal; if Carmen refuses, he knows what to do".

Carmen herself, says Dean, is a new type of operatic heroine representing a new kind of love, not the innocent kind associated with the "spotless soprano" school, but something altogether more vital and dangerous. Her capriciousness, fearlessness and love of freedom are all musically represented: "She is redeemed from any suspicion of vulgarity by her qualities of courage and fatalism so vividly realised in the music". Curtiss suggests that Carmen's character, spiritually and musically, may be a realisation of the composer's own unconscious longing for a freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage. <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> likens Carmen to "a female Don Giovanni. She would rather die than be false to herself". The dramatic personality of the character, and the range of moods she is required to express, call for exceptional acting and singing talents. This has deterred some of opera's most distinguished exponents; <a href="Maria%20Callas">Maria Callas</a>, though she recorded the part, never performed it on stage. The musicologist <a href="Hugh%20Macdonald">Hugh Macdonald</a> observes that "French opera never produced another femme as fatale as Carmen", though she may have influenced some of <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a>'s heroines. Macdonald suggests that outside the French repertoire, <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s Salome and <a href="Alban%20Berg">Alban Berg</a>'s Lulu "may be seen as distant degenerate descendants of Bizet's temptress".

Bizet was reportedly contemptuous of the music that he wrote for Escamillo: "Well, they asked for ordure, and they've got it", he is said to have remarked about the toreador's song—but, as Dean comments, "the triteness lies in the character, not in the music". Micaëla's music has been criticised for its "Gounodesque" elements, although Dean maintains that her music has greater vitality than that of any of <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>'s own heroines.

The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured <a href="Zulma%20Bouffar">Zulma Bouffar</a>, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Offenbach</a>'s operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to <a href="Marie%20Roze">Marie Roze</a>, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to <a href="C%C3%A9lestine%20Galli-Mari%C3%A9">Célestine Galli-Marié</a>, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.

The leading tenor part of Don José was given to <a href="Paul%20Lh%C3%A9rie">Paul Lhérie</a>, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a> and <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Delibes">Delibes</a>. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> premiere of "Les pêcheurs de perles". <a href="Jacques%20Bouhy">Jacques Bouhy</a>, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>" and as <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s Figaro. <a href="Marguerite%20Chapuy">Marguerite Chapuy</a>, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>; the impresario <a href="James%20Henry%20Mapleson">James H. Mapleson</a> thought her "one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return.

Because rehearsals did not start until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated, the premiere was delayed. The final rehearsals went well, and in a generally optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875, the day on which, coincidentally, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> was formally announced. The premiere, which was conducted by <a href="Adolphe%20Deloffre">Adolphe Deloffre</a>, was attended by many of Paris's leading musical figures, including Massenet, Offenbach, Delibes and Gounod; during the performance the last-named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla's act 3 aria from him: "That melody is mine!" Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere in a letter to a friend; the first act was evidently well received, with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls. The first part of act 2 also went well, but after the toreador's song there was, Halévy noted, "coldness". In act 3 only Micaëla's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted. The final act was "glacial from first to last", and Bizet was left "only with the consolations of a few friends". The critic <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra-Comique audience was "shocked by the drastic realism of the action" and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters. According to the composer <a href="Benjamin%20Godard">Benjamin Godard</a>, Bizet retorted, in response to a compliment, "Don't you see that all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them?" In a different vein, shortly after the work had concluded, Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note: "How happy you must be at this time—it's a great success!".

The general tone of the next day's press reviews ranged from disappointment to outrage. The more conservative critics complained about "Wagnerism" and the subordination of the voice to the noise of the orchestra. There was consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue; Galli-Marié's interpretation of the role was described by one critic as "the very incarnation of vice". Others compared the work unfavourably with the traditional Opéra-Comique repertoire of <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Auber</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Adrien%20Boieldieu">Boieldieu</a>. Léon Escudier in "L'Art Musical" called "Carmen"s music "dull and obscure ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". It seemed that Bizet had generally failed to fulfill expectations, both of those who (given Halévy's and Meilhac's past associations) had expected something in the Offenbach mould, and of critics such as Adolphe Jullien who had anticipated a <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagnerian</a> music drama. Among the few supportive critics was the poet <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20de%20Banville">Théodore de Banville</a>; writing in "Le National", he applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique "puppets".

In its initial run at the Opéra-Comique, "Carmen" provoked little public enthusiasm; it shared the theatre for a while with <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>'s much more popular <a href="Requiem%20%28Verdi%29">"Requiem"</a>. "Carmen" was often performed to half-empty houses, even when the management gave away large numbers of tickets. Early on 3 June, the day after the opera's 33rd performance, Bizet died suddenly of heart disease, at the age of 36. It was his wedding anniversary. That night's performance was cancelled; the tragic circumstances brought a temporary increase in public interest during the brief period before the season ended. Du Locle brought "Carmen" back in November 1875, with the original cast, and it ran for a further 12 performances until 15 February 1876 to give a year's total for the original production of 48. Among those who attended one of these later performances was <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, who wrote to his benefactor, <a href="Nadezhda%20von%20Meck">Nadezhda von Meck</a>: ""Carmen" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word ... one of those rare creations which expresses the efforts of a whole musical epoch". After the final performance, "Carmen" was not seen in Paris again until 1883.

Shortly before his death Bizet signed a contract for a production of "Carmen" by the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna Court Opera</a>. For this version, first staged on 23 October 1875, Bizet's friend <a href="Ernest%20Guiraud">Ernest Guiraud</a> replaced the original dialogue with recitatives, to create a "<a href="grand%20opera">grand opera</a>" format. Guiraud also reorchestrated music from Bizet's <a href="L%27Arl%C3%A9sienne%20%28Bizet%29">L'Arlésienne suite</a> to provide a spectacular ballet for "Carmen"s second act. Shortly before the initial Vienna performance the Court Opera's director <a href="Franz%20von%20Jauner">Franz von Jauner</a> decided to use parts of the original dialogue along with some of Guiraud's recitatives; this hybrid and the full recitative version became the norms for productions of the opera outside France for most of the next century.

Despite its deviations from Bizet's original format, and some critical reservations, the 1875 Vienna production was a great success with the city's public, and won praise from both Wagner and <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>. The latter reportedly saw the opera 20 times, and said that he would have "gone to the ends of the earth to embrace Bizet". The Viennese triumph began the opera's rapid ascent towards worldwide fame. In February 1876 it began a run in Brussels at <a href="La%20Monnaie">La Monnaie</a>; it returned there the following year, with Galli-Marié in the title role, and thereafter became a permanent fixture in the Brussels repertory. On 17 June 1878 "Carmen" was produced in London, at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">Her Majesty's Theatre</a>, where <a href="Minnie%20Hauk">Minnie Hauk</a> began her long association with the part of Carmen. A parallel London production at Covent Garden, with <a href="Adelina%20Patti">Adelina Patti</a>, was cancelled when Patti withdrew. The successful Her Majesty's production, sung in Italian, had an equally enthusiastic reception in Dublin. On 23 October 1878 the opera received its American premiere, at the New York <a href="Academy%20of%20Music%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Academy of Music</a>, and in the same year was introduced to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>.

In the following five years performances were given in numerous American and European cities, the opera finding particular favour in Germany, where the Chancellor, <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, apparently saw it on 27 different occasions and where <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> opined that he "became a better man when Bizet speaks to me". "Carmen" was also acclaimed in numerous French provincial cities including <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>, <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> and, in 1881, <a href="Dieppe">Dieppe</a>, where Galli-Marié returned to the role. In August 1881 the singer wrote to Bizet's widow to report that "Carmen"s Spanish premiere, in Barcelona, had been "another great success". But Carvalho, who had assumed the management of the Opéra-Comique, thought the work immoral and refused to reinstate it. Meilhac and Hálevy were more prepared to countenance a revival, provided that Galli-Marié had no part in it; they blamed her interpretation for the relative failure of the opening run.

In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived "Carmen" at the Opéra-Comique, with <a href="Ad%C3%A8le%20Isaac">Adèle Isaac</a> featuring in an under-rehearsed production that removed some of the controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what had come to be regarded as a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.

On 9 January 1884, "Carmen" was given its first New York <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> performance, to a mixed critical reception. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" welcomed Bizet's "pretty and effective work", but compared <a href="Zelia%20Trebelli-Bettini">Zelia Trebelli</a>'s interpretation of the title role unfavourably with that of Minnie Hauk. Thereafter "Carmen" was quickly incorporated into the Met's regular repertory. In February 1906 <a href="Enrico%20Caruso">Enrico Caruso</a> sang José at the Met for the first time; he continued to perform in this role until 1919, two years before his death. On 17 April 1906, on tour with the Met, he sang the role at the Grand Opera House in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Afterwards he sat up until 3 am reading the reviews in the early editions of the following day's papers. Two hours later he was awakened by the first violent shocks of the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>, after which he and his fellow performers made a hurried escape from the <a href="Palace%20Hotel%2C%20San%20Francisco">Palace Hotel</a>.

The popularity of "Carmen" continued through succeeding generations of American opera-goers; by the beginning of 2011 the Met alone had performed it almost a thousand times. It enjoyed similar success in other American cities and in all parts of the world, in many different languages. Carmen's <a href="Habanera%20%28aria%29">habanera</a> from act 1, and the toreador's song "<a href="Votre%20toast">Votre toast</a>" from act 2, are among the most popular and best-known of all operatic arias, the latter "a splendid piece of swagger" according to Newman, "against which the voices and the eyebrows of purists have long been raised in vain". Most of the productions outside France followed the example created in Vienna and incorporated lavish ballet interludes and other spectacles, a practice which <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> abandoned in Vienna when he revived the work there in 1900. In 1919, Bizet's aged contemporary <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a> was still complaining about the "strange idea" of adding a ballet, which he considered "a hideous blemish in that masterpiece", and he wondered why Bizet's widow, at that time still living, permitted it.

At the Opéra-Comique, after its 1883 revival, "Carmen" was always presented in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments. By 1888, the year of the 50th anniversary of Bizet's birth, the opera had been performed there 330 times; by 1938, his centenary year, the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2,271. However, outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years; the <a href="Carl%20Rosa%20Opera%20Company">Carl Rosa Opera Company</a>'s 1947 London production, and <a href="Walter%20Felsenstein">Walter Felsenstein</a>'s 1949 staging at the Berlin <a href="Komische%20Oper%20Berlin">Komische Oper</a>, are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France. Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn, and the first American production with spoken dialogue, in Colorado in 1953, met with a similar fate.

Dean has commented on the dramatic distortions that arise from the suppression of the dialogue; the effect, he says, is that the action moves forward "in a series of jerks, rather instead of by smooth transition", and that most of the minor characters are substantially diminished. Only late in the 20th century did dialogue versions become common in opera houses outside France, but there is still no universally recognised full score. <a href="Fritz%20Oeser">Fritz Oeser</a>'s 1964 edition is an attempt to fill this gap, but in Dean's view is unsatisfactory. Oeser reintroduces material removed by Bizet during the first rehearsals, and ignores many of the late changes and improvements that the composer made immediately before the first performance; he thus, according to <a href="Susan%20McClary">Susan McClary</a>, "inadvertently preserves as definitive an early draft of the opera". In the early 21st century new editions were prepared by Robert Didion and Richard Langham-Smith, published by Schott and Peters respectively. Each departs significantly from Bizet's vocal score of March 1875, published during his lifetime after he had personally corrected the proofs; Dean believes that this vocal score should be the basis of any standard edition. Lesley Wright, a contemporary Bizet scholar, remarks that, unlike his compatriots <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a> and <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>, Bizet has not been accorded a critical edition of his principal works; should this transpire, she says, "we might expect yet another scholar to attempt to refine the details of this vibrant score which has so fascinated the public and performers for more than a century". Meanwhile, "Carmen"s popularity endures; according to Macdonald: "The memorability of Bizet's tunes will keep the music of Carmen alive in perpetuity", and its status as a popular classic is unchallenged by any other French opera.

<a href="Herv%C3%A9%20Lacombe">Hervé Lacombe</a>, in his survey of 19th-century French opera, contends that "Carmen" is one of the few works from that large repertory to have stood the test of time. While he places the opera firmly within the long "opéra comique" tradition, Macdonald considers that it transcends the genre and that its immortality is assured by "the combination in abundance of striking melody, deft harmony and perfectly judged orchestration". Dean sees Bizet's principal achievement in the demonstration of the main actions of the opera in the music, rather than in the dialogue, writing that "Few artists have expressed so vividly the torments inflicted by sexual passions and jealousy". Dean places Bizet's realism in a different category from the "verismo" of Puccini and others; he likens the composer to Mozart and Verdi in his ability to engage his audiences with the emotions and sufferings of his characters.

Bizet, who had never visited Spain, sought out appropriate ethnic material to provide an authentic Spanish flavour to his music. Carmen's habanera is based on an idiomatic song, "El Arreglito", by the Spanish composer <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Yradier">Sebastián Yradier</a> (1809–65). Bizet had taken this to be a genuine folk melody; when he learned its recent origin he added a note to the vocal score, crediting Yradier. He used a genuine folksong as the source of Carmen's defiant "Coupe-moi, brûle-moi" while other parts of the score, notably the "Seguidilla", utilise the rhythms and instrumentation associated with <a href="flamenco">flamenco</a> music. However, Dean insists that "[t]his is a French, not a Spanish opera"; the "foreign bodies", while they undoubtedly contribute to the unique atmosphere of the opera, form only a small ingredient of the complete music.
The prelude to act 1 combines three recurrent themes: the entry of the bullfighters from act 4, the refrain from the <a href="Toreador%20Song">Toreador Song</a> from act 2, and the <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a> that, in two slightly differing forms, represents both Carmen herself and the fate that she personifies. This motif, played on <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>, <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>, <a href="cornet">cornet</a> and <a href="cello">cello</a>s over <a href="tremolo">tremolo</a> strings, concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo. When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established, and pervades the opening scenes. The mock solemnities of the changing of the guard, and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls, precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen's entrance. After her provocative habanera, with its persistent insidious rhythm and changes of key, the fate motif sounds in full when Carmen throws her flower to José before departing. This action elicits from José a passionate <a href="A%20major">A major</a> solo that Dean suggests is the turning-point in his musical characterisation. The softer vein returns briefly, as Micaëla reappears and joins with José in a duet to a warm clarinet and strings accompaniment. The tranquillity is shattered by the women's noisy quarrel, Carmen's dramatic re-entry and her defiant interaction with Zuniga. After her beguiling "Seguidilla" provokes José to an exasperated high <a href="A%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">A sharp</a> shout, Carmen's escape is preceded by the brief but disconcerting reprise of a fragment from the habanera. Bizet revised this finale several times to increase its dramatic effect.

Act 2 begins with a short prelude, based on a melody that José will sing offstage before his next entry. A festive scene in the inn precedes Escamillo's tumultuous entrance, in which <a href="Brass%20instrument">brass</a> and <a href="percussion%20instrument">percussion</a> provide prominent backing while the crowd sings along. The quintet that follows is described by Newman as "of incomparable verve and musical wit". José's appearance precipitates a long mutual wooing scene; Carmen sings, dances and plays the <a href="castanets">castanets</a>; a distant cornet-call summoning José to duty is blended with Carmen's melody so as to be barely discernible. A muted reference to the fate motif on an <a href="Cor%20anglais">English horn</a> leads to José's "Flower Song", a flowing continuous melody that ends "pianissimo" on a sustained high <a href="B%E2%99%AD%20%28musical%20note%29">B-flat</a>. José's insistence that, despite Carmen's blandishments, he must return to duty leads to a quarrel; the arrival of Zuniga, the consequent fight and José's unavoidable ensnarement into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act.

The prelude to act 3 was originally intended for Bizet's <a href="L%27Arl%C3%A9sienne%20%28Bizet%29">"L'Arlésienne"</a> score. Newman describes it as "an exquisite miniature, with much dialoguing and intertwining between the woodwind instruments". As the action unfolds, the tension between Carmen and José is evident in the music. In the card scene, the lively duet for Frasquita and Mercédès turns ominous when Carmen intervenes; the fate motif underlines her premonition of death. Micaëla's aria, after her entry in search of José, is a conventional piece, though of deep feeling, preceded and concluded by horn calls. The middle part of the act is occupied by Escamillo and José, now acknowledged as rivals for Carmen's favour. The music reflects their contrasting attitudes: Escamillo remains, says Newman, "invincibly polite and ironic", while José is sullen and aggressive. When Micaëla pleads with José to go with her to his mother, the harshness of Carmen's music reveals her most unsympathetic side. As José departs, vowing to return, the fate theme is heard briefly in the woodwind. The confident, off-stage sound of the departing Escamillo singing the toreador's refrain provides a distinct contrast to José's increasing desperation.

The final act is prefaced with a lively orchestral piece derived from <a href="Manuel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20%28tenor%29">Manuel García</a>'s short operetta "El Criado Fingido". After the opening crowd scene, the bullfighters' march is led by the children's chorus; the crowd hails Escamillo before his short love scene with Carmen. The long finale, in which José makes his last pleas to Carmen and is decisively rejected, is punctuated at critical moments by enthusiastic off-stage shouts from the bullfighting arena. As José kills Carmen, the chorus sing the refrain of the Toreador Song off-stage; the fate motif, which has been suggestively present at various points during the act, is heard <a href="Dynamics%20%28music%29%23Relative%20loudness">fortissimo</a>, together with a brief reference to Carmen's card scene music. Jose's last words of love and despair are followed by a final long chord, on which the curtain falls without further musical or vocal comment.

"Carmen" has been the subject of many recordings, beginning with early <a href="Phonograph%20cylinder">wax cylinder recordings</a> of excerpts in the 1890s, a nearly complete performance in German from 1908 with <a href="Emmy%20Destinn">Emmy Destinn</a> in the title role, and a complete 1911 Opéra-Comique recording in French. Since then, many of the leading opera houses and artistes have recorded the work, in both studio and live performances. Over the years many versions have been commended and reissued. From the mid-1990s numerous video recordings have become available. These include <a href="David%20McVicar">David McVicar</a>'s <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne</a> production of 2002, and the Royal Opera productions of 2007 and 2010, each designed by <a href="Francesca%20Zambello">Francesca Zambello</a>.

After Bizet's death, his friend <a href="Ernest%20Guiraud">Ernest Guiraud</a> adapted key musical themes from "Carmen" into <a href="Carmen%20Suites%20%28Bizet/Guiraud%29">two symphonic suites</a> that are frequently programmed by orchestras.

In 1883, the Spanish violinist and composer <a href="Pablo%20de%20Sarasate">Pablo de Sarasate</a> (1844–1908) wrote a <a href="Carmen%20Fantasy%20%28Sarasate%29">"Carmen Fantasy"</a> for violin, described as "ingenious and technically difficult". <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a>'s 1920 piece, Piano Sonatina No. 6 (Fantasia da camera super Carmen), is based on themes from "Carmen". In 1967, the Russian composer <a href="Rodion%20Shchedrin">Rodion Shchedrin</a> adapted parts of the "Carmen" music into a ballet, the "<a href="Carmen%20Suite%20%28ballet%29">Carmen Suite</a>", written specifically for his wife <a href="Maya%20Plisetskaya">Maya Plisetskaya</a>, then the <a href="Bolshoi%20Ballet">Bolshoi Ballet</a>'s principal ballerina.

The character "Carmen" has been a regular subject of film treatment since the earliest days of cinema. The films were made in various languages and interpreted by several cultures, and have been created by prominent directors including <a href="Raoul%20Walsh">Raoul Walsh</a> (1915), <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> (1915), <a href="Otto%20Preminger">Otto Preminger</a> (1954) and <a href="Jean-Luc%20Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a> (1984). Preminger's "<a href="Carmen%20Jones">Carmen Jones</a>" was adapted from a 1943 <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical of the same name. The story is transposed to 1940s Chicago, and employs an all-black cast. <a href="Francesco%20Rosi">Francesco Rosi</a>'s film of 1984, with <a href="Julia%20Migenes">Julia Migenes</a> and <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a>, is generally faithful to the original story and to Bizet's music.

Mary Anning

Mary Anning (21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847) was an English <a href="fossil%20collector">fossil collector</a>, <a href="fossil%20trade">dealer</a>, and <a href="paleontology">palaeontologist</a> who became known around the world for important finds she made in <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> at <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> in the county of <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> in Southwest England. Her findings contributed to important changes in scientific thinking about <a href="prehistoric%20life">prehistoric life</a> and the <a href="Historical%20geology">history of the Earth</a>.

Anning searched for fossils in the area's <a href="Blue%20Lias">Blue Lias</a> cliffs, particularly during the winter months when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first <a href="ichthyosaur">ichthyosaur</a> skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a> skeletons found; the first <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discovery that <a href="coprolite">coprolite</a>s, known as <a href="bezoar">bezoar</a> stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that <a href="belemnoidea">belemnite</a> fossils contained fossilised <a href="ink%20sac">ink sac</a>s like those of modern <a href="cephalopods">cephalopods</a>. When geologist <a href="Henry%20De%20la%20Beche">Henry De la Beche</a> painted "<a href="Duria%20Antiquior">Duria Antiquior</a>", the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.

A <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenter</a> and a woman, Anning did not fully participate in the <a href="scientific%20community">scientific community</a> of 19th-century Britain, who were mostly <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> <a href="gentlemen">gentlemen</a>. She struggled financially for much of her life. Her family was poor, and her father, a cabinetmaker, died when she was eleven.

She became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as about collecting fossils. Nonetheless, as a woman, she was not eligible to join the <a href="Geological%20Society%20of%20London">Geological Society of London</a> and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed, she wrote in a letter: "The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone." The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Natural%20History">Magazine of Natural History</a>" in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine's editor questioning one of its claims.

After her death in 1847, her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. An uncredited author in "<a href="All%20the%20Year%20Round">All the Year Round</a>", edited by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, wrote of her in 1865 that "[t]he carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it." It has often been claimed that her story was the inspiration for the 1908 tongue-twister "She sells seashells on the seashore" by Terry Sullivan. In 2010, one hundred and sixty-three years after her death, the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.

Anning was born in <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> in Dorset, England. Her father, Richard Anning, was a <a href="cabinetmaker">cabinetmaker</a> who supplemented his income by mining the coastal cliff-side fossil beds near the town, and selling his finds to tourists. He married Mary Moore, known as Molly, on 8 August 1793 in <a href="Blandford%20Forum">Blandford Forum</a>. The couple moved to Lyme and lived in a house built on the town's bridge. They attended the <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenter</a> chapel on Coombe Street, whose worshippers initially called themselves independents and later became known as <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalists</a>. <a href="Shelley%20Emling">Shelley Emling</a> writes that the family lived so near to the sea that the same storms that swept along the cliffs to reveal the fossils sometimes flooded the Annings' home, on one occasion forcing them to crawl out of an upstairs bedroom window to avoid being drowned.

Richard and Molly had ten children. The first child, Mary, was born in 1794. She was followed by another girl, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and another son in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year, the oldest child, then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding wood shavings to the fire. The incident was reported in the "<a href="Bath%20Chronicle">Bath Chronicle</a>" on 27 December 1798: "A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some shavings ... The girl's clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death." When another daughter was born just five months later, she was named Mary after her dead sister. More children were born after her, but none of them survived more than a couple of years. Only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood. The high childhood mortality rate for the Anning family was not very unusual. Almost half the children born in Britain throughout the 19th century died before the age of 5, and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th century Lyme Regis, infant deaths from diseases like <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and <a href="measles">measles</a> were particularly common.

On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, an event occurred that became part of local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family said she had been a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.

Her education was extremely limited. She was able to attend a Congregationalist <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, unlike that of the Church of England at the time, emphasised the importance of education for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the "Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review", in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.

By the late 18th century, Lyme Regis had become a popular seaside resort, especially after 1792 when the outbreak of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a> made travel to the European mainland dangerous for the English gentry, and increasing numbers of wealthy and middle class tourists were arriving there. Even before Mary's time, locals supplemented their income by selling what were called "curios" to visitors. These were fossils with colourful local names such as "snake-stones" (<a href="Ammonoidea">ammonites</a>), "devil's fingers" (<a href="belemnite">belemnite</a>s), and "verteberries" (<a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a>), to which were sometimes attributed medicinal and mystical properties. Fossil collecting was in vogue in the late 18th and early 19th century, at first as a pastime, but gradually transforming into a science as the importance of fossils to geology and biology was understood.

The source of most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a geological formation known as the <a href="Blue%20Lias">Blue Lias</a>. This consists of alternating layers of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> and <a href="shale">shale</a>, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195 million years ago). It is one of the richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.

Their father, Richard, often took Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions to supplement the family's income. They offered their discoveries for sale to tourists on a table outside their home. This was a difficult time for England's poor; the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, and the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.

In addition, the family's status as religious dissenters—not followers of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>—attracted discrimination. Dissenters were not allowed into universities or the army, and were excluded by law from several professions. Her father had been suffering from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff. When he died in November 1810 (aged 44), he left the family with significant debts and no savings, forcing them to apply for <a href="Poor%20Relief%20Act%201662">parish relief</a>.

The family continued collecting and selling fossils together, and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.

Their first well-known find was in 1811, when Mary was 12; Joseph dug up a 4-foot <a href="ichthyosaur">ichthyosaur</a> skull, and a few months later Mary found the rest of the skeleton. Henry Hoste Henley of <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham House</a> in <a href="Sandringham%2C%20Norfolk">Sandringham, Norfolk</a>, who was lord of the manor of Colway, near Lyme Regis, paid the family about £23 for it, and in turn he sold it to <a href="William%20Bullock%20%28collector%29">William Bullock</a>, a well-known collector, who displayed it in London. There it generated considerable interest, because at a time when most people in England still believed in the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">Biblical account of creation</a>, <a href="Dating%20creation%23Biblical%20creation%20dates">which implied that the Earth was only a few thousand years old</a>, it raised questions about the history of living things and of the Earth itself. It was later sold for £45 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a "Crocodile in a Fossil State" to <a href="Charles%20Konig">Charles Konig</a>, of the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, who had already suggested the name "Ichthyosaurus" for it.

Mary's mother Molly initially ran the fossil business after Richard's death, but it is unclear how much actual fossil collecting she did herself. As late as 1821, she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an <a href="upholsterer">upholsterer</a>, but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary had assumed the leading role in the family business.

One of the family's keenest customers was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, a wealthy collector from <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became disturbed by the family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, they were at the point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist <a href="Gideon%20Mantell">Gideon Mantell</a> on 5 March that year to say that the sale was "for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost "all" the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied." The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (worth the equivalent of over £26,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.

Anning continued to support herself selling fossils. Her primary stock in trade consisted of invertebrate fossils such as <a href="ammonite">ammonite</a> and <a href="belemnoidea">belemnite</a> shells, which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings. <a href="Vertebrate">Vertebrate</a> fossils, such as ichthyosaur skeletons, sold for more, but were much rarer. Collecting them was dangerous winter work. In 1823, an article in "The Bristol Mirror" said of her:

The risks of her profession were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided being killed by a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. She wrote to a friend, <a href="Charlotte%20Murchison">Charlotte Murchison</a>, in November of that year: "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the death of my old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate."

As Anning continued to make important finds, her reputation grew. On 10 December 1823, she found the first complete "<a href="Plesiosaurus">Plesiosaurus</a>", and in 1828 the first British example of the flying reptiles known as <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s, called a flying dragon when it was displayed at the British Museum, followed by a "<a href="Squaloraja">Squaloraja</a>" fish skeleton in 1829. Despite her limited education, she read as much of the scientific literature as she could obtain, and often, laboriously hand-copied papers borrowed from others. Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan examined a copy she made of an 1824 paper by <a href="William%20Conybeare%20%28geologist%29">William Conybeare</a> on marine reptile fossils and noted that the copy included several pages of her detailed technical illustrations that he was hard pressed to tell apart from the original. She also dissected modern animals including both fish and <a href="cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a> to gain a better understanding of the anatomy of some of the fossils with which she was working. Lady Harriet Silvester, the widow of the former Recorder of the City of London, visited Lyme in 1824 and described Anning in her diary:

In 1826, at the age of 27, Anning managed to save enough money to purchase a home with a glass store-front window for her shop, "Anning's Fossil Depot". The business had become important enough that the move was covered in the local paper, which noted that the shop had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display. Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited Anning at Lyme, including the geologist <a href="George%20William%20Featherstonhaugh">George William Featherstonhaugh</a>, who called Anning a "very clever funny Creature." He purchased fossils from her for the newly opened <a href="New%20York%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">New York Lyceum of Natural History</a> in 1827. King <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20II%20of%20Saxony">Frederick Augustus II of Saxony</a> visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection. The king's physician and aide, <a href="Carl%20Gustav%20Carus">Carl Gustav Carus</a>, wrote in his journal:

Carus asked Anning to write her name and address in his pocketbook for future reference—she wrote it as "Mary Annins"—and when she handed it back to him she told him: "I am well known throughout the whole of Europe." As time passed, Anning's confidence in her knowledge grew, and in 1839 she wrote to the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Natural%20History">Magazine of Natural History</a>" to question the claim made in an article, that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark "<a href="Hybodus">Hybodus</a>" represented a new genus, as an error since she had discovered the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth many years ago. The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime. Some personal letters written by her, such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell, were published while she was alive, however.

As a woman, Anning was an outsider to the scientific community. At the time in Britain women were not allowed to vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, but increasingly influential <a href="Geological%20Society%20of%20London">Geological Society of London</a> did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests. The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opening factories.

Although Anning knew more about fossils and geology than many of the wealthy fossilists to whom she sold, it was always the gentlemen geologists who published the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found, often neglecting to mention her name. She became resentful of this. Anna Pinney, a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected, wrote: "She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains, and made a great deal of publishing works, of which she furnished the contents, while she derived none of the advantages." Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working-class people in early 19th-century scientific literature. Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman, construction worker, or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector, and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest.

Along with purchasing specimens, many geologists visited her to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. <a href="Henry%20De%20la%20Beche">Henry De la Beche</a> and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning kept in touch as he became one of Britain's leading geologists. <a href="William%20Buckland">William Buckland</a>, who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning. It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects <a href="coprolites">coprolites</a>. In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.

She also assisted <a href="Thomas%20Hawkins%20%28geologist%29">Thomas Hawkins</a> with his efforts to collect ichthyosaur fossils at Lyme in the 1830s. She was aware of his penchant to "enhance" the fossils he collected. She wrote: "he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be; and not as they are really found...". A few years later there was a public scandal when it was discovered that Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.

The Swiss palaeontologist <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a> visited Lyme Regis in 1834 and worked with Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region. He was so impressed by her and her friend <a href="Elizabeth%20Philpot">Elizabeth Philpot</a> that he wrote in his journal: "Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the icthyodorulites dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types." He thanked both of them for their help in his book, "Studies of Fossil Fish".

Another leading British geologist, <a href="Roderick%20Murchison">Roderick Murchison</a>, did some of his first field work in southwest England, including Lyme, accompanied by his wife, Charlotte. Murchison wrote that they decided Charlotte should stay behind in Lyme for a few weeks to "become a good practical fossilist, by working with the celebrated Mary Anning of that place...". Charlotte and Anning became lifelong friends and correspondents. Charlotte, who travelled widely and met many prominent geologists through her work with her husband, helped Anning build her network of customers throughout Europe, and Anning stayed with the Murchisons when she visited London in 1829.

<a href="Gideon%20Mantell">Gideon Mantell</a>, discoverer of the dinosaur <a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>, also visited her at her shop.

Anning's correspondents included <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>, who wrote to her to ask her opinion on how the sea was affecting the coastal cliffs around Lyme, as well as <a href="Adam%20Sedgwick">Adam Sedgwick</a>—one of her earliest customers—who taught geology at the University of Cambridge and who numbered <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> among his students.

By 1830, because of difficult economic conditions in Britain that reduced the demand for fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning <a href="George%20Johann%20Scharf">Georg Scharf</a> to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, "<a href="Duria%20Antiquior">Duria Antiquior</a>", portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known as <a href="deep%20time">deep time</a> to be widely circulated. In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of a new type of plesiosaur, which sold for £200.

It was around this time that she switched from attending the local Congregational church, where she had been baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church. The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery. He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was <a href="List%20of%20Christian%20thinkers%20in%20science">devoutly religious</a>, actively supported her new church as she had her old.

She suffered another serious financial setback in 1835 when she lost most of her life savings, about £300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. <a href="Deborah%20Cadbury">Deborah Cadbury</a> says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that it is not clear whether the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the <a href="British%20Science%20Association">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a> and the British government to award her an <a href="Life%20annuity">annuity</a>, known as a <a href="Civil%20List%20pension">civil list pension</a>, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.

Anning died from breast cancer at the age of 47 on 9 March 1847. Her work had tailed off during the last few years of her life because of her illness, and as some townspeople misinterpreted the effects of the increasing doses of <a href="laudanum">laudanum</a> she was taking for the pain, there had been gossip in Lyme that she had a drinking problem. The regard in which she was held by the geological community was shown in 1846 when, upon learning of her cancer diagnosis, the Geological Society raised money from its members to help with her expenses and the council of the newly created <a href="Dorset%20County%20Museum">Dorset County Museum</a> made her an honorary member. She was buried on 15 March in the churchyard of <a href="Lyme%20Regis%23Religion">St Michael's</a>, the local parish church. Members of the Geological Society contributed to a stained-glass window in her memory, unveiled in 1850. It depicts the six corporal "<a href="works%20of%20Mercy">acts of mercy</a>"—feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless, visiting prisoners and the sick, and the inscription reads: "This window is sacred to the memory of Mary Anning of this parish, who died 9 March AD 1847 and is erected by the vicar and some members of the Geological Society of London in commemoration of her usefulness in furthering the science of geology, as also of her benevolence of heart and integrity of life."
After her death, Henry De la Beche, president of the Geological Society, wrote a eulogy that he read to a meeting of the society and published in its quarterly transactions, the first such eulogy given for a woman. These were honours normally only accorded to fellows of the society, which did not admit women until 1904. The eulogy began:

I cannot close this notice of our losses by death without adverting to that of one, who though not placed among even the easier classes of society, but one who had to earn her daily bread by her labour, yet contributed by her talents and untiring researches in no small degree to our knowledge of the great <a href="Enalio-Saurians">Enalio-Saurians</a>, and other forms of organic life entombed in the vicinity of Lyme Regis ...

<a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> wrote an article about her life in February 1865 in his literary magazine "<a href="All%20the%20Year%20Round">All the Year Round</a>" that emphasised the difficulties she had overcome, especially the scepticism of her fellow townspeople. He ended the article with: "The carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it."

Anning's first famous discovery was made shortly after her father's death. In 1811 (some sources say 1810 or 1809) her brother Joseph found a skull, but failed to locate the rest of the animal. After Joseph told her to look between the cliffs at Lyme Regis and Charmouth, Mary found the skeleton— long in all—a few months later. The family hired workmen to dig it out in November that year, an event covered by the local press on 9 November, who identified the fossil as a crocodile.

Other <a href="ichthyosaur">ichthyosaur</a> remains had been discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings was the first to come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to <a href="William%20Bullock%20%28collector%29">William Bullock</a> for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">Genesis</a>, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when <a href="Sir%20Everard%20Home%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Everard Home</a> wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking it was a kind of fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the <a href="platypus">duck-billed platypus</a> (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name "Ichthyosaurus" (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.

Anning found several other ichthyosaur fossils between 1815 and 1819, including almost complete skeletons of varying sizes. In 1821 <a href="William%20Conybeare%20%28geologist%29">William Conybeare</a> and Henry De la Beche, both members of the Geological Society of London, collaborated on a paper that analysed in detail the specimens found by Anning and others. They concluded that ichthyosaurs were a previously unknown type of marine reptile, and based on differences in tooth structure, they concluded that there had been at least three species. Also in 1821, Anning found the skeleton from which the species "Ichthyosaurus platydon" (now "<a href="Temnodontosaurus%20platyodon">Temnodontosaurus platyodon</a>") would be named. In the 1980s it was determined that the first ichthyosaur specimen found by Joseph and Mary Anning was also a member of "Temnodontosaurus platyodon".

In the same 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on ichthyosaur anatomy, <a href="William%20Conybeare%20%28geologist%29">William Conybeare</a> named and described the genus "<a href="Plesiosaurus">Plesiosaurus</a>" (near lizard), called so because he thought it more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been. The description was based on a number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, a paddle and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch. Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821. If so, it would have been Anning's next major discovery, providing essential information about the newly recognised type of marine reptile. No records by Anning of the find are known. The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.
In 1823, Anning discovered a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656. When Conybeare presented his analysis of plesiosaur anatomy to a meeting of the Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>" and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles. The second fossil was named and described as "Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus" and is the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> (<a href="holotype">holotype</a>) of this species, which itself is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a>.

Conybeare's presentation followed the resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy of one of the fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.

Anning discovered yet another important and nearly complete plesiosaur skeleton in 1830. It was named "Plesiosaurus macrocephalus" by <a href="William%20Buckland">William Buckland</a> and was described in an 1840 paper by <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>. Once again Owen mentioned the wealthy gentleman who had purchased the fossil and made it available for examination, but not the woman who had discovered and prepared it.

Anning found what a contemporary newspaper article called an "unrivalled specimen" of "<a href="Dapedium">Dapedium politum</a>". This was a ray-finned fish, which would be described in 1828. In December of that same year she made an important find consisting of the partial skeleton of a <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>. In 1829 William Buckland described it as "Pterodactylus macronyx" (later renamed "<a href="Dimorphodon">Dimorphodon</a> macronyx" by Richard Owen), and unlike many other such occasions, Buckland credited Anning with the discovery in his paper.

It was the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany, and it created a public sensation when displayed at the British Museum. In December 1829 she found a fossil fish, "<a href="Squaloraja">Squaloraja</a>", which attracted attention because it had characteristics intermediate between sharks and <a href="Batoidea">rays</a>.

Vertebrate fossil finds, especially of marine reptiles, made Anning's reputation, but she made numerous other contributions to early palaeontology. In 1826 she discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a <a href="belemnoidea">belemnite</a> fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Soon other local artists were doing the same, as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the fossilised chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern <a href="squid">squid</a> and <a href="cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a>, which she had dissected to understand the anatomy of fossil <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, and this led William Buckland to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do. It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as "bezoar stones" were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons. She noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824. After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places, Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them <a href="coprolites">coprolites</a>. In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier, for which she was not credited, when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society, he mentioned Anning by name and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery.

Anning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for <a href="extinction">extinction</a>. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s such as <a href="mammoth">mammoth</a>s. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. The bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, — some, such as the <a href="plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a>, so unlike any known living creature — struck a major blow against this idea.

The ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> she found, along with the first <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> fossils which were discovered by <a href="Gideon%20Mantell">Gideon Mantell</a> and <a href="William%20Buckland">William Buckland</a> during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures very different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an "<a href="Mesozoic">age of reptiles</a>" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. This phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled "The Age of Reptiles" that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land, air, and sea. These discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived. This discipline eventually came to be called <a href="paleontology">palaeontology</a>. Illustrations of scenes from "deep time" (now known as <a href="palaeoart">palaeoart</a>), such as Henry De la Beche's ground-breaking painting "Duria Antiquior", helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. De la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> of the <a href="early%20Jurassic">Lias</a> by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites. The study of coprolites, pioneered by Anning and Buckland, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.

Throughout the 20th century, beginning with H. A. Forde and his "The Heroine of Lyme Regis: The Story of Mary Anning the Celebrated Geologist" (1925), a number of writers saw Anning's life as inspirational. According to P. J. McCartney in "Henry De la Beche: Observations on an Observer" (1978), she was the basis of Terry Sullivan's lyrics to the 1908 song which became the popular <a href="tongue%20twister">tongue twister</a>, "She Sells Seashells":

However, it has also been claimed that no evidence has ever been presented for any causal connection between Anning and the lyrics.

Much of the material written about her was aimed at children, and tended to focus on her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in "<a href="The%20French%20Lieutenant%27s%20Woman">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>" (1969) by <a href="John%20Fowles">John Fowles</a>, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer Shelley Emling noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and <a href="Roderick%20Murchison">Roderick Murchison</a>, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a>. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—"<a href="Acrodus%20anningiae">Acrodus anningiae</a>", and "Belenostomus anningiae"—and another after her friend <a href="Elizabeth%20Philpot">Elizabeth Philpot</a>. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a> "Cytherelloidea anningi", and two genera, the <a href="Therapsida">therapsid</a> reptile genus "Anningia", and the <a href="Bivalvia">bivalve</a> mollusc genus "Anningella", were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus "<a href="Anningasaura">Anningasaura</a>" was named after her, and the species "<a href="Ichthyosaurus%20anningae">Ichthyosaurus anningae</a>" was named after her in 2015.

In 1999, on the 200th anniversary of her birth, an international meeting of historians, palaeontologists, fossil collectors, and others interested in Anning's life was held in Lyme Regis. In 2005 the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> added her, alongside scientists such as <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, <a href="Dorothea%20Bate">Dorothea Bate</a>, and <a href="William%20Smith%20%28geologist%29">William Smith</a>, as one of the gallery characters it uses to patrol its display cases. In 2007 American playwright/performer <a href="Claudia%20Stevens">Claudia Stevens</a> premiered "Blue Lias, or the Fish Lizard's Whore", a solo play with music by <a href="Allen%20Shearer">Allen Shearer</a> depicting Anning in later life. Among the presenters of its thirty performances around the <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> bicentennial were the <a href="Cleveland%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Cleveland Museum of Natural History</a>, museums of natural history at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Kansas">University of Kansas</a>, and the <a href="Sam%20Noble%20Oklahoma%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History</a>. In 2009 <a href="Tracy%20Chevalier">Tracy Chevalier</a> wrote a historical novel entitled "Remarkable Creatures", in which Anning and Elizabeth Philpot were the main characters, and another historical novel about Anning, "Curiosity" by Joan Thomas, was published in March 2010. Also that month, as part of the celebration of its 350th anniversary, the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> invited a panel of experts to produce a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science. They included Anning in the list. In December 2018 it was announced that actresses <a href="Kate%20Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> and <a href="Saoirse%20Ronan">Saoirse Ronan</a> would star in an upcoming film by <a href="Francis%20Lee%20%28director%29">Francis Lee</a> entitled "<a href="Ammonite%20%28film%29">Ammonite</a>", which would be based on Anning's life and legacy and introduce a lesbian romance plot set in the 1840s.

In general, the effects include <a href="euphoria">euphoria</a>, visual and mental <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s, changes in <a href="perception">perception</a>, a distorted <a href="time%20perception">sense of time</a>, spiritual experiences, and can include possible adverse reactions such as <a href="nausea">nausea</a> and <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a>s.

Imagery found on prehistoric <a href="mural">mural</a>s and <a href="rock%20painting">rock painting</a>s of modern-day Spain and Algeria suggests that human usage of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history. In <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>, the mushrooms had long been consumed in <a href="spirituality">spiritual</a> and <a href="divination">divinatory</a> ceremonies before Spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century. In 1959, the Swiss chemist <a href="Albert%20Hofmann">Albert Hofmann</a> isolated the active principle psilocybin from the mushroom "<a href="Psilocybe%20mexicana">Psilocybe mexicana</a>". Hofmann's employer <a href="Sandoz">Sandoz</a> marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in <a href="Psychedelic%20therapy%23Psycholytic%20therapy">psychedelic psychotherapy</a>. Although the increasingly restrictive drug laws of the late 1960s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens, its popularity as an <a href="entheogen">entheogen</a> (spirituality-enhancing agent) grew in the next decade, owing largely to the increased availability of information on how to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms.

The intensity and duration of the effects of psilocybin are variable, depending on species or <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a> of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and <a href="set%20and%20setting">set and setting</a>, as was shown in experiments led by <a href="Timothy%20Leary">Timothy Leary</a> at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on <a href="serotonin%20receptor">serotonin receptor</a>s in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a> and a low harm potential. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a <a href="Single%20Convention%20on%20Narcotic%20Drugs%23Schedules%20of%20drugs">scheduled drug</a> by many national <a href="Prohibition%20of%20drugs">drug laws</a>.

The effects of psilocybin are highly variable and depend on the mindset and environment in which the user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as <a href="set%20and%20setting">set and setting</a>. In the early 1960s, <a href="Timothy%20Leary">Timothy Leary</a> and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens <a href="suggestibility">suggestibility</a>, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.

After ingesting psilocybin, a wide range of subjective effects may be experienced: feelings of <a href="disorientation">disorientation</a>, <a href="lethargy">lethargy</a>, <a href="wiktionary%3Agiddy">giddiness</a>, <a href="euphoria">euphoria</a>, joy, and <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>. About a third of users report feelings of <a href="anxiety%20%28mood%29">anxiety</a> or <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a>. Low doses of the drug can induce hallucinatory effects. <a href="Closed-eye%20hallucination">Closed-eye hallucination</a>s may occur, in which the affected individual sees multicolored geometric shapes and vivid imaginative sequences. Some individuals report experiencing <a href="synesthesia">synesthesia</a>, such as tactile sensations when viewing colors. At higher doses, psilocybin can lead to "Intensification of <a href="affect%20%28psychology%29">affective</a> responses, enhanced ability for introspection, <a href="regression%20%28psychology%29">regression</a> to primitive and childlike thinking, and activation of vivid memory traces with pronounced emotional undertones". Open-eye visual hallucinations are common, and may be very detailed although <a href="Pseudohallucination">rarely confused with reality.</a>

A 2011 <a href="prospective%20cohort">prospective study</a> by Roland R. Griffiths and colleagues suggests that a single high dosage of psilocybin can cause long-term changes in the <a href="Personality%20psychology">personality</a> of its users. About half of the study participants—described as healthy, "spiritually active", and many possessing <a href="Postgraduate%20diploma">postgraduate degrees</a>—showed an increase in the personality dimension of <a href="openness%20to%20experience">openness</a> (assessed using the <a href="Revised%20NEO%20Personality%20Inventory">Revised NEO Personality Inventory</a>), and this positive effect was apparent more than a year after the psilocybin session. According to the study authors, the finding is significant because "no study has prospectively demonstrated personality change in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event." A further study by Griffiths in 2017 found that doses of 20 to 30 mg/70 kg psilocybin inducing mystical-type experiences brought more lasting positive changes to traits including altruism, gratitude, forgiveness and feeling close to others when they were combined with a regular <a href="meditation">meditation</a> practice and an extensive spiritual practice support programme. Although other researchers have described instances of psychedelic drug usage leading to new psychological understandings and personal insights, it is not known whether these experimental results can be generalized to larger populations.

Common responses include: <a href="Midriasis">pupil dilation</a> (93%); changes in <a href="heart%20rate">heart rate</a> (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes in <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a> (84%), including <a href="hypotension">hypotension</a> (34%), <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a> (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in <a href="stretch%20reflex">stretch reflex</a> (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); <a href="tremor">tremor</a> (25%); and <a href="dysmetria">dysmetria</a> (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be a <a href="risk%20factor">risk factor</a> for users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of <a href="nightclub">club</a> goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> levels, <a href="blood%20sugar">blood sugar</a> levels, or <a href="Liver%20function%20tests">liver toxicity tests</a>.

Psilocybin is known to strongly influence the subjective experience of the <a href="time%20perception">passage of time</a>. Users often feel as if time is slowed down, resulting in the perception that "minutes appear to be hours" or "time is standing still". Studies have demonstrated that psilocybin significantly impairs subjects' ability to gauge time intervals longer than 2.5 seconds, impairs their ability to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 seconds, and reduces their preferred <a href="tapping%20rate">tapping rate</a>. These results are consistent with the drug's role in affecting <a href="prefrontal%20cortex">prefrontal cortex</a> activity, and the role that the prefrontal cortex is known to play in time perception. However, the <a href="neurochemical">neurochemical</a> basis of psilocybin's effects on the perception of time are not known with certainty.

Users having a pleasant experience can feel a sense of connection to others, nature, and the universe; other perceptions and emotions are also often intensified. Users having an unpleasant experience (a "<a href="bad%20trip">bad trip</a>") describe a reaction accompanied by fear, other unpleasant feelings, and occasionally by dangerous behavior. In general, the phrase "bad trip" is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions, not just transitory experience of such feelings. A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip, including "tripping" during an emotional or physical low or in a non-supportive environment (see: "<a href="set%20and%20setting">set and setting</a>"). Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs, including alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of a bad trip. Other than the duration of the experience, the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of LSD or mescaline. However, in the "Psychedelics Encyclopedia", author <a href="Peter%20Stafford">Peter Stafford</a> noted, "The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer, not as forceful and less isolating. It tends to build connections between people, who are generally much more in communication than when they use LSD."

Psilocybin mushrooms have been and continue to be used in indigenous New World cultures in religious, <a href="divination">divinatory</a>, or <a href="spirituality">spiritual</a> contexts. Reflecting the meaning of the word "entheogen" ("the god within"), the mushrooms are revered as powerful spiritual <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s that provide access to sacred worlds. Typically used in small group community settings, they enhance <a href="group%20cohesiveness">group cohesion</a> and reaffirm traditional values. <a href="Terence%20McKenna">Terence McKenna</a> documented the worldwide practices of psilocybin mushroom usage as part of a cultural <a href="ethos">ethos</a> relating to the Earth and mysteries of nature, and suggested that mushrooms enhanced <a href="self-awareness">self-awareness</a> and a sense of contact with a "Transcendent Other"—reflecting a deeper understanding of our connectedness with nature.

Psychedelic drugs can induce states of <a href="consciousness">consciousness</a> that have lasting personal meaning and spiritual significance in individuals who are religious or spiritually inclined; these states are called <a href="mystical%20experience">mystical experience</a>s. Some scholars have proposed that many of the qualities of a drug-induced mystical experience are indistinguishable from mystical experiences achieved through <a href="Religious%20experience%23Causes%20of%20religious%20experiences">non-drug techniques</a>, such as <a href="meditation">meditation</a> or <a href="holotropic%20breathwork">holotropic breathwork</a>. In the 1960s, <a href="Walter%20Pahnke">Walter Pahnke</a> and colleagues systematically evaluated mystical experiences (which they called "mystical consciousness") by categorizing their common features. These categories, according to Pahnke, "describe the core of a universal psychological experience, free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations", and allow researchers to assess mystical experiences on a qualitative, numerical scale.

In the 1962 <a href="Marsh%20Chapel%20Experiment">Marsh Chapel Experiment</a>, which was run by Pahnke at the <a href="Harvard%20Divinity%20School">Harvard Divinity School</a> under the supervision of Timothy Leary, almost all of the graduate degree <a href="seminary">divinity</a> student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences. One of the participants was religious scholar <a href="Huston%20Smith">Huston Smith</a>, author of several textbooks on <a href="comparative%20religion">comparative religion</a>; he later described his experience as "the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced." In a 25-year followup to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of "a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life". Psychedelic researcher <a href="Rick%20Doblin">Rick Doblin</a> considered the study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the <a href="double-blind">double-blind</a> procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, he said that the study cast "a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects". This sentiment was echoed by psychiatrist William A. Richards, who in a 2007 review stated "[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry."

A group of researchers from <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20School%20of%20Medicine">Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</a> led by Griffiths conducted a study to assess the immediate and long-term psychological effects of the psilocybin experience, using a modified version of the mystical experience questionnaire and a rigorous double-blind procedure. When asked in an interview about the similarity of his work with Leary's, Griffiths explained the difference: "We are conducting rigorous, systematic research with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions, a route which Dr. Leary abandoned in the early 1960s." The <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Drug%20Abuse">National Institute of Drug Abuse</a>-funded study, published in 2006, has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design. In the experiment, 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and <a href="methylphenidate">methylphenidate</a> (Ritalin) in separate sessions; the methylphenidate sessions served as a <a href="Scientific%20control">control</a> and psychoactive <a href="placebo">placebo</a>. The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood; 61% of subjects reported a "complete mystical experience" after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased <a href="life%20satisfaction">life satisfaction</a> and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme "experience of fear" or <a href="dysphoria">dysphoria</a> (i.e., a "bad trip") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject's sense of well-being.

A follow-up study conducted 14 months after the original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of <a href="Openness%20to%20experience">Openness/Intellect</a>; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.

In 2011, Griffiths and colleagues published the results of further studies designed to learn more about the optimum psilocybin doses needed for positive life-changing experiences, while minimizing the chance of negative reactions. In a 14-month followup, the researchers found that 94% of the volunteers rated their experiences with the drug as one of the top five most spiritually significant of their lives (44% said it was the single most significant). None of the 90 sessions that took place throughout the study were rated as decreasing well-being or life satisfaction. Moreover, 89% reported positive changes in their behaviors as a result of the experiences. The conditions of the experimental design included a single drug experience a month, on a couch, in a living-room-like setting, with eye shades and carefully chosen music (classical and world music). As an additional precaution to guide the experience, as with the 2006 study, the 2011 study included a "monitor" or "guide" whom the volunteers supposedly trusted. The monitors provided gentle reassurance when the volunteers experienced anxiety. The volunteers and monitors all remained <a href="blind%20experiment">blind</a> to the exact dosages for the purpose of the experiment.

Although psilocybin may be prepared synthetically, outside of the research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a <a href="herbal%20tea">herbal tea</a>, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts <a href="intravenous">intravenous</a>ly.

Most of the comparatively few fatal incidents reported in the literature that are associated with psychedelic mushroom usage involve the simultaneous use of other drugs, especially <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a>. Probably the most common cause of hospital admissions resulting from psychedelic mushroom usage involve "bad trips" or <a href="panic%20attack">panic reactions</a>, in which affected individuals become extremely anxious, confused, agitated, or disoriented. Accidents, <a href="Self-harm">self-injury</a>, or <a href="suicide">suicide</a> attempts can result from serious cases of acute <a href="psychosis">psychotic episodes</a>. Although no studies have linked psilocybin with <a href="birth%20defects">birth defects</a>, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid its usage.

The <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a> of psilocybin is low. In rats, the <a href="median%20lethal%20dose">median lethal dose</a> (LD) when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), approximately one and a half times that of <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a>. When administered <a href="intravenous%20injection">intravenously</a> in rabbits, psilocybin's LD is approximately 12.5 mg/kg. Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of "Psilocybe cubensis" mushrooms, and so nearly of dried mushrooms, or of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD value of rats. Based on the results of animal studies, the <a href="lethal%20dose">lethal dose</a> of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams, 1000 times greater than the <a href="effective%20dose%20%28pharmacology%29">effective dose</a> of 6 milligrams. The <a href="Registry%20of%20Toxic%20Effects%20of%20Chemical%20Substances">Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances</a> assigns psilocybin a relatively high <a href="therapeutic%20index">therapeutic index</a> of 641 (higher values correspond to a better safety profile); for comparison, the therapeutic indices of <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a> and <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a> are 199 and 21, respectively. The lethal dose from psilocybin toxicity alone is unknown at recreational or medicinal levels, and has rarely been documented—, only two cases attributed to overdosing on hallucinogenic mushrooms (without concurrent use of other drugs) have been reported in the scientific literature and may involve other factors aside from psilocybin.

Panic reactions can occur after consumption of psilocybin-containing mushrooms, especially if the ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected. Reactions characterized by violent behavior, suicidal thoughts, schizophrenia-like <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a>, and <a href="convulsion">convulsion</a>s have been reported in the literature. A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a>. Other adverse effects less frequently reported include <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a>, <a href="confusion">confusion</a>, prolonged <a href="derealization">derealization</a> (disconnection from reality), and <a href="mania">mania</a>. Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of <a href="depersonalization%20disorder">depersonalization disorder</a>. Usage by those with <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization.

Recent evidence, however, has suggested against the contention that the use of psilocybin puts one at risk for developing long lasting mental disorders. An analysis of information from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed that the use of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin is associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress, past year suicidal thinking, past year suicidal planning, and past year suicide attempt.

The similarity of psilocybin-induced symptoms to those of schizophrenia has made the drug a useful research tool in behavioral and <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a> studies of this psychotic disorder. In both cases, psychotic symptoms are thought to arise from a "deficient gating of sensory and cognitive information" in the brain that ultimately lead to "cognitive fragmentation and psychosis". <a href="Flashback%20%28psychology%29">Flashbacks</a> (spontaneous recurrences of a previous psilocybin experience) can occur long after having used psilocybin mushrooms. <a href="Hallucinogen%20persisting%20perception%20disorder">Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder</a> (HPPD) is characterized by a continual presence of visual disturbances similar to those generated by psychedelic substances. Neither flashbacks nor HPPD are commonly associated with psilocybin usage, and correlations between HPPD and psychedelics are further obscured by <a href="polydrug%20use">polydrug use</a> and other variables.

<a href="Drug%20tolerance">Tolerance</a> to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin more than about once a week can lead to diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A <a href="cross-tolerance">cross-tolerance</a> can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between psilocybin and <a href="phenethylamine">phenethylamine</a>s such as <a href="mescaline">mescaline</a> and <a href="2%2C5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine">DOM</a>.

Repeated use of psilocybin does not lead to <a href="physical%20dependence">physical dependence</a>. A 2008 study concluded that, based on US data from the period 2000–2002, adolescent-onset (defined here as ages 11–17) usage of hallucinogenic drugs (including psilocybin) did not increase the risk of <a href="substance%20dependence">drug dependence</a> in adulthood; this was in contrast to adolescent usage of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>, <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="inhalant">inhalant</a>s, <a href="anxiolytic">anxiolytic</a> medicines, and <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s, all of which were associated with "an excess risk of developing clinical features associated with drug dependence". Likewise, a 2010 Dutch study ranked the relative harm of psilocybin mushrooms compared to a selection of 19 <a href="recreational%20drugs">recreational drugs</a>, including alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, <a href="MDMA">ecstasy</a>, <a href="heroin">heroin</a>, and <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>. Psilocybin mushrooms were ranked as the illicit drug with the lowest harm, corroborating conclusions reached earlier by expert groups in the United Kingdom.

Psilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to <a href="psilocin">psilocin</a>, which is a <a href="partial%20agonist">partial agonist</a> for several <a href="serotonin%20receptors">serotonin receptors</a>, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high <a href="Affinity%20%28pharmacology%29%23Protein-ligand%20binding">affinity</a> for the <a href="5-HT2B%20receptor">5-HT</a> and <a href="5-HT2C%20receptor">5-HT</a> receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the <a href="5-HT2A%20receptor">5-HT receptor</a>. Psilocin binds with low affinity to <a href="5-HT1%20receptor">5-HT receptor</a>s, including <a href="5-HT1A%20receptor">5-HT</a> and <a href="5-HT1D%20receptor">5-HT</a>. The <a href="psychotomimetic">psychotomimetic</a> (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a <a href="Dose%20%28biochemistry%29%23Effects%20are%20dose-dependent">dose-dependent</a> fashion by the 5-HT <a href="receptor%20antagonist">antagonist</a> drug <a href="ketanserin">ketanserin</a>. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> in the <a href="basal%20ganglia">basal ganglia</a>, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by <a href="haloperidol">haloperidol</a>, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest that there may be an indirect <a href="dopaminergic">dopaminergic</a> contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for dopamine receptor D2, unlike another common 5-HT receptor agonist, LSD. 

Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a>, and are involved in a wide range of functions, including regulation of <a href="mood%20%28psychology%29">mood</a> and <a href="motivation">motivation</a>.

The effects of the drug begin 10–40 minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6 hours depending on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The <a href="biological%20half%20life">half life</a> of psilocybin is 163 ± 64 minutes when taken orally, or 74.1 ± 19.6 minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10 mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300 <a href="microgram">microgram</a>s per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50 mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50 grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5 grams of dried mushrooms. A small number of people are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2 mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.

Psilocybin is metabolized mostly in the <a href="liver">liver</a>. As it becomes converted to psilocin, it undergoes a <a href="first-pass%20effect">first-pass effect</a>, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the <a href="systemic%20circulation">systemic circulation</a>. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme <a href="monoamine%20oxidase">monoamine oxidase</a> to produce several <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a>s that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a <a href="glucuronide">glucuronide</a>; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with <a href="glucuronic%20acid">glucuronic acid</a>, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the <a href="glucuronosyltransferase">glucuronosyltransferase</a> enzymes <a href="UGT1A9">UGT1A9</a> in the liver, and by <a href="UGT1A10">UGT1A10</a> in the small intestine. Based on <a href="animal%20model">studies using animals</a>, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24 hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is <a href="excretion">excreted</a> into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the <a href="bile">bile</a> and feces. Although most of the remaining drug is eliminated in this way within 8 hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7 days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8 µg/liter within 2 hours after ingestion of a single 15 mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6 µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.

<a href="Monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">Monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a>s (MAOI) have been known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol consumption may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with <a href="biogenic%20amines">biogenic amines</a> present in the body to produce MAOIs related to <a href="tetrahydroisoquinoline">tetrahydroisoquinoline</a> and <a href="beta-carboline">β-carboline</a>. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.

Psilocybin ("O"-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-"N,N"-<a href="dimethyltryptamine">dimethyltryptamine</a>, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a <a href="prodrug">prodrug</a> that is converted into the <a href="Pharmacology">pharmacologically</a> active compound <a href="psilocin">psilocin</a> in the body by a <a href="dephosphorylation">dephosphorylation</a> reaction. This <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a> takes place under strongly <a href="acidic">acidic</a> conditions, or under <a href="physiological%20condition">physiological condition</a>s in the body, through the action of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s called <a href="alkaline%20phosphatase">alkaline phosphatase</a>s.

Psilocybin is a <a href="tryptamine">tryptamine</a> compound with a <a href="chemical%20structure">chemical structure</a> containing an <a href="indole">indole</a> ring linked to an <a href="ethylamine">ethylamine</a> <a href="substituent">substituent</a>. It is chemically related to the <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a>, and is structurally similar to the <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a>. Psilocybin is a member of the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a>s in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include <a href="N%2CN-dimethyltryptamine">dimethyltryptamine</a>, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and <a href="bufotenine">bufotenine</a>, found in the skin of <a href="psychoactive%20toads">psychoactive toads</a>.

Psilocybin is an <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a> that is <a href="solubility">soluble</a> in water, <a href="methanol">methanol</a> and <a href="Ethanol%20%28data%20page%29%23Properties%20of%20aqueous%20ethanol%20solutions">aqueous ethanol</a>, but insoluble in <a href="organic%20solvent">organic solvent</a>s like <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a> and <a href="petroleum%20ether">petroleum ether</a>. Its <a href="pKa">pKa</a> values are estimated to be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a <a href="zwitterion">zwitterion</a>ic structure.
Exposure to light is detrimental to the stability of <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a>s of psilocybin, and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical <a href="standard%20solution">standard</a>. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without <a href="chromatography">chromatographic</a> purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% <a href="yield%20%28chemistry%29">yield</a>, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like crystalline powder with a <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> between , and a slightly <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>-like taste.

Biosynthetically, the biochemical transformation from tryptophan to psilocybin involves several enzyme reactions: <a href="decarboxylation">decarboxylation</a>, <a href="methylation">methylation</a> at the N position, 4-<a href="hydroxylation">hydroxylation</a>, and "O"-<a href="phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a>. <a href="Isotopic%20labeling">Isotopic labeling</a> experiments from the 1960s suggested that tryptophan decarboxylation is the initial biosynthetic step and that "O"-phosphorylation is the final step, but recent analyses of isolated enzymes demonstrate that "O"-phosphorylation is the third step in "P. cubensis." The sequence of the intermediate enzymatic steps has been shown to involve 4 different enzymes (PsiD, PsiH, PsiK, and PsiM) in "P. cubensis" and "P. cyanescens", although the biosynthetic pathway may differ between species. These enzymes are encoded in <a href="Metabolic%20gene%20cluster">gene clusters</a> in "Psilocybe, Panaeolus," and "Gymnopilus".
Several relatively simple <a href="chemical%20test">chemical test</a>s — commercially available as <a href="Pill%20testing%23Reagent%20testing%20kits">reagent testing kits</a> — can be used to assess the presence of psilocybin in <a href="extract">extract</a>s prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the <a href="Marquis%20reagent">Marquis test</a> to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the <a href="Pill%20testing%23Reagent%20testing%20kits">Mandelin test</a>. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing <a href="Amine%23Classes%20of%20amines">primary amino</a> groups and unsubstituted <a href="benzene%20ring">benzene ring</a>s, including <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a> and <a href="methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a>. <a href="Ehrlich%27s%20reagent">Ehrlich's reagent</a> and <a href="DMACA%20reagent">DMACA reagent</a> are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after <a href="thin%20layer%20chromatography">thin layer chromatography</a>. Many modern techniques of <a href="analytical%20chemistry">analytical chemistry</a> have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used <a href="gas%20chromatography">gas chromatography</a>, the high temperature required to <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">vaporize</a> the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In <a href="forensic%20toxicology">forensic toxicology</a>, techniques involving <a href="Gas%20chromatography-mass%20spectrometry">gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry</a> (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include <a href="ion%20mobility%20spectrometry">ion mobility spectrometry</a>, <a href="capillary%20zone%20electrophoresis">capillary zone electrophoresis</a>, <a href="Ultraviolet%E2%80%93visible%20spectroscopy">ultraviolet spectroscopy</a>, and <a href="infrared%20spectroscopy">infrared spectroscopy</a>. <a href="High-performance%20liquid%20chromatography">High-performance liquid chromatography</a> (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, <a href="Fluorescence%20spectroscopy">fluorescence</a>, <a href="Electrochemistry">electrochemical</a>, and <a href="Electrospray%20ionization">electrospray</a> mass spectrometric detection methods.

Various <a href="chromatography">chromatographic</a> methods have been developed to detect psilocin in <a href="Bodily%20fluid">body fluids</a>: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a <a href="drug%20test">drug screening</a> method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and <a href="Liquid%20chromatography%E2%80%93mass%20spectrometry">liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry</a>. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in <a href="blood%20plasma">plasma</a> or <a href="blood%20serum">serum</a> requires a preliminary <a href="Liquid-liquid%20extraction">extraction</a>, followed by <a href="derivatization">derivatization</a> of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific <a href="immunoassay">immunoassay</a> has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in <a href="Clinical%20chemistry">clinical</a> settings.

Psilocybin is present in varying concentrations in over 200 species of <a href="Basidiomycota">Basidiomycota</a> mushrooms. In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms, <a href="Gast%C3%B3n%20Guzm%C3%A1n">Gastón Guzmán</a> and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following <a href="genus">genera</a>: "<a href="Psilocybe">Psilocybe</a>" (116 species), "<a href="Gymnopilus">Gymnopilus</a>" (14), "<a href="Panaeolus">Panaeolus</a>" (13), "<a href="Copelandia">Copelandia</a>" (12), "<a href="Hypholoma">Hypholoma</a>" (6), "<a href="Pluteus">Pluteus</a>" (6), "<a href="Inocybe">Inocybe</a>" (6), "<a href="Conocybe">Conocybe</a>" (4), "<a href="Panaeolina">Panaeolina</a>" (4), "<a href="Gerronema">Gerronema</a>" (2) and "<a href="Agrocybe">Agrocybe</a>", "<a href="Galerina">Galerina</a>" and "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>" (1 species each). Guzmán increased his estimate of the number of psilocybin-containing "Psilocybe" to 144 species in a 2005 review. The majority of these are found in Mexico (53 species), with the remainder distributed in the US and Canada (22), Europe (16), Asia (15), Africa (4), and Australia and associated islands (19). The diversity of psilocybian mushrooms is reported to have been increased by <a href="Horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal transfer</a> of the psilocybin <a href="Metabolic%20gene%20cluster">gene cluster</a> between unrelated mushroom species. In general, psilocybin-containing species are dark-spored, <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gilled</a> mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the <a href="subtropic">subtropic</a>s and <a href="tropics">tropics</a>, usually in soils rich in <a href="humus">humus</a> and plant debris. Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents, but the majority of species are found in <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20moist%20broadleaf%20forests">subtropical humid forests</a>. "Psilocybe" species commonly found in the tropics include "<a href="Psilocybe%20cubensis">P. cubensis</a>" and "<a href="Psilocybe%20subcubensis">P. subcubensis</a>". "<a href="Psilocybe%20semilanceata">P. semilanceata</a>" — considered by Guzmán to be the world's most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom — is found in Europe, North America, Asia, South America, Australia and New Zealand, but is entirely absent from Mexico. Although the presence or absence of psilocybin is not of much use as a <a href="chemotaxonomy">chemotaxonomical</a> marker at the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">familial</a> level or higher, it is used to classify <a href="taxon">taxa</a> of lower taxonomic groups.

Both the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> and the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> contain the psychoactive compounds, although the caps consistently contain more. The <a href="spore">spore</a>s of these mushrooms do not contain psilocybin or psilocin. The total <a href="potency%20%28pharmacology%29">potency</a> varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early in the formation of <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> or <a href="sclerotium">sclerotia</a>, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from almost nothing to 1.5% of the <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.

The psilocybin contents of dried <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> specimens of "Psilocybe semilanceata" in one study were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample: collections dated 11, 33, or 118 years old contained 0.84%, 0.67%, and 0.014% (all dry weight), respectively. Mature <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> contain some psilocybin, while young mycelia (recently <a href="germination">germinated</a> from spores) lack appreciable amounts. Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds <a href="baeocystin">baeocystin</a> and <a href="norbaeocystin">norbaeocystin</a>, chemicals thought to be biogenic <a href="precursor%20%28chemistry%29">precursors</a>. Although most species of psilocybin-containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the <a href="Redox">oxidization</a> of phenolic compounds, this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom's potency.

There is evidence to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Murals dated 9000 to 7000 <a href="BCE">BCE</a> found in the <a href="Sahara%20desert">Sahara desert</a> in southeast <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> depict horned beings dressed as dancers, clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs, and holding mushroom-like objects. Parallel lines extend from the mushroom shapes to the center of the dancers' heads. 6,000-year-old <a href="pictographs">pictographs</a> discovered near the Spanish town of <a href="Villar%20del%20Humo">Villar del Humo</a> illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as "<a href="Psilocybe%20hispanica">Psilocybe hispanica</a>", a hallucinogenic species native to the area.

Archaeological <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, as well as the so-called <a href="Maya%20architecture">Mayan</a> "mushroom stones" of <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> have also been interpreted by some scholars as evidence for ritual and ceremonial usage of psychoactive mushrooms in the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayan</a> and <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> cultures of <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>. In <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a>, the language of the Aztecs, the mushrooms were called "teonanácatl", or "God's flesh". Following the arrival of Spanish explorers to the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> in the 16th century, chroniclers reported the use of mushrooms by the natives for ceremonial and religious purposes. According to the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican</a> friar <a href="Diego%20Dur%C3%A1n">Diego Durán</a> in "The History of the Indies of New Spain" (published c. 1581), mushrooms were eaten in festivities conducted on the occasion of the accession to the throne of Aztec emperor <a href="Moctezuma%20II">Moctezuma II</a> in 1502. The <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> friar <a href="Bernardino%20de%20Sahag%C3%BAn">Bernardino de Sahagún</a> wrote of witnessing mushroom usage in his <a href="Florentine%20Codex">Florentine Codex</a> (published 1545–1590), and described how some merchants would celebrate upon returning from a successful business trip by consuming mushrooms to evoke revelatory visions. After the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Aztec%20Empire">defeat of the Aztecs</a>, the Spanish forbade traditional religious practices and rituals that they considered "pagan idolatry", including ceremonial mushroom use. For the next four centuries, the Indians of Mesoamerica hid their use of <a href="entheogens">entheogens</a> from the Spanish authorities.

Although dozens of species of psychedelic mushrooms are found in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, there is little documented usage of these species in <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> history besides the use of "<a href="Amanita%20muscaria">Amanita muscaria</a>" among Siberian peoples. The few existing historical accounts about psilocybin mushrooms typically lack sufficient information to allow species identification, and usually refer to the nature of their effects. For example, Flemish botanist <a href="Carolus%20Clusius">Carolus Clusius</a> (1526–1609) described the "bolond gomba" (crazy mushroom), used in rural Hungary to prepare love potions. English botanist <a href="John%20Parkinson%20%28botanist%29">John Parkinson</a> included details about a "foolish mushroom" in his 1640 <a href="herbal">herbal</a> "Theatricum Botanicum". The first reliably documented report of intoxication with "Psilocybe semilanceata"—Europe's most common and widespread psychedelic mushroom—involved a British family in 1799, who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in London's <a href="Green%20Park">Green Park</a>.

American banker and amateur <a href="Ethnomycology">ethnomycologist</a> <a href="R.%20Gordon%20Wasson">R. Gordon Wasson</a> and his wife <a href="Valentina%20Pavlovna%20Wasson">Valentina P. Wasson</a>, a physician, studied the ritual use of psychoactive mushrooms by the native population in the <a href="Mazatec%20people">Mazatec</a> village <a href="Huautla%20de%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Huautla de Jiménez</a>, Mexico. In 1957, Wasson described the psychedelic visions that he experienced during these rituals in "<a href="Seeking%20the%20Magic%20Mushroom">Seeking the Magic Mushroom</a>", an article published in the popular American weekly "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine. Later the same year they were accompanied on a follow-up expedition by French mycologist <a href="Roger%20Heim">Roger Heim</a>, who identified several of the mushrooms as "Psilocybe" species. Heim cultivated the mushrooms in France, and sent samples for analysis to <a href="Albert%20Hofmann">Albert Hofmann</a>, a chemist employed by the Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company <a href="Sandoz">Sandoz</a> (now Novartis). Hofmann, who had in 1938 created <a href="LSD">LSD</a>, led a research group that isolated and identified the psychoactive compounds from "<a href="Psilocybe%20mexicana">Psilocybe mexicana</a>". Hofmann was aided in the discovery process by his willingness to ingest mushroom <a href="Liquid-liquid%20extraction">extracts</a> to help verify the presence of the active compounds. He and his colleagues later <a href="chemical%20synthesis">synthesized</a> a number of compounds chemically related to the naturally occurring psilocybin, to see how <a href="chemical%20structure">structural</a> changes would affect psychoactivity. The new molecules differed from psilocybin in the position of the <a href="phosphoryl">phosphoryl</a> or <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> group at the top of the <a href="indole%20ring">indole ring</a>, and in the numbers of <a href="methyl">methyl</a> groups (CH) and other additional <a href="carbon%20chain">carbon chain</a>s.

Two diethyl <a href="structural%20analog">analogs</a> (containing two <a href="Ethyl%20group">ethyl</a> groups in place of the two methyl groups) of psilocybin and psilocin were synthesized by Hofmann: <a href="Ethocybin">4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine</a>, called CEY-19, and <a href="4-HO-DET">4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine</a>, called CZ-74. Because their physiological effects last only about three and a half hours (about half as long as psilocybin), they proved more manageable in European clinics using "<a href="Psychedelic%20therapy%23Psycholytic%20therapy">psycholytic therapy</a>"—a form of <a href="psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> involving the controlled use of psychedelic drugs. Sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin under the name Indocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide. There were no reports of serious complications when psilocybin was used in this way.

In the early 1960s, <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> became a testing ground for psilocybin, through the efforts of <a href="Timothy%20Leary">Timothy Leary</a> and his associates <a href="Ralph%20Metzner">Ralph Metzner</a> and Richard Alpert (who later changed his name to <a href="Ram%20Dass">Ram Dass</a>). Leary obtained synthesized psilocybin from Hofmann through Sandoz pharmaceutical. Some studies, such as the <a href="Concord%20Prison%20Experiment">Concord Prison Experiment</a>, suggested promising results using psilocybin in <a href="clinical%20psychiatry">clinical psychiatry</a>. According to a 2008 review of safety guidelines in human hallucinogenic research, however, Leary and Alpert's well-publicized termination from Harvard and later advocacy of hallucinogen use "further undermined an objective scientific approach to studying these compounds". In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public, psilocybin and other hallucinogenic drugs suffered negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws. In the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs; Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year. Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the <a href="Schedule%20I%20%28US%29%23Schedule%20I%20drugs">Schedule I category</a> of illicit drugs in 1970. Subsequent restrictions on the use of these drugs in human research made <a href="research%20funding">funding</a> for such projects difficult to obtain, and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being "professionally marginalized".

Despite the legal restrictions on psilocybin use, the 1970s witnessed the emergence of psilocybin as the "entheogen of choice". This was due in large part to a wide dissemination of information on the topic, which included works such as those by author <a href="Carlos%20Castaneda">Carlos Castaneda</a>, and several books that taught the technique of growing psilocybin mushrooms. One of the most popular of this latter group was published in 1976 under the pseudonyms O.T. Oss and O.N. Oeric by Jeremy Bigwood, <a href="Dennis%20Jon%20McKenna">Dennis J. McKenna</a>, K. Harrison McKenna, and <a href="Terence%20McKenna">Terence McKenna</a>, entitled "Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide". Over 100,000 copies were sold by 1981. As ethnobiologist <a href="Jonathan%20Ott">Jonathan Ott</a> explains, "These authors adapted San Antonio's technique (for producing edible mushrooms by casing <a href="mycelium">mycelial</a> cultures on a rye grain substrate; San Antonio 1971) to the production of "Psilocybe [Stropharia] cubensis". The new technique involved the use of ordinary kitchen implements, and for the first time the layperson was able to produce a potent entheogen in his own home, without access to sophisticated technology, equipment or chemical supplies."

Because of a lack of clarity about laws about psilocybin mushrooms, retailers in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) commercialized and marketed them in <a href="smartshop">smartshop</a>s in the Netherlands and the UK, and online. Several websites emerged that have contributed to the accessibility of information on description, use, effects and exchange of experiences among users. Since 2001, six <a href="European%20Union">EU</a> countries have tightened their legislation on psilocybin mushrooms in response to concerns about their prevalence and increasing usage. In the 1990s, hallucinogens and their effects on human consciousness were again the subject of scientific study, particularly in Europe. Advances in <a href="neuropharmacology">neuropharmacology</a> and <a href="neuropsychology">neuropsychology</a>, and the availability of <a href="Neuroimaging">brain imaging</a> techniques have provided impetus for using drugs like psilocybin to probe the "neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations". Recent studies in the United States have attracted attention from the popular press and thrust psilocybin back into the limelight.

In the United States, psilocybin (and psilocin) were first subjected to federal regulation by the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965, a product of a <a href="Bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bill</a> sponsored by Senator <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Dodd">Thomas J. Dodd</a>. The law—passed in July 1965 and effected on February 1, 1966—was an amendment to the federal <a href="Food%2C%20Drug%20and%20Cosmetic%20Act">Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act</a> and was intended to regulate the unlicensed "possession, manufacture, or sale of depressant, stimulant and hallucinogenic drugs". The <a href="statute">statute</a>s themselves, however, did not list the "hallucinogenic drugs" that were being regulated. Instead, the term "hallucinogenic drugs" was meant to refer to those substances believed to have a "hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system".

Despite the seemingly strict provisions of the law, many people were exempt from prosecution. The statutes "permit[ted] … people to possess such drugs so long as they were for the personal use of the possessor, [for] a member of his household, or for administration to an animal". The federal law that specifically banned psilocybin and psilocin was enacted on October 24, 1968. The substances were said to have "a high potential for abuse", "no currently accepted medical use," and "a lack of accepted safety". On October 27, 1970, both psilocybin and psilocin became classified as <a href="Controlled%20Substances%20Act%23Schedule%20I%20controlled%20substances">Schedule I</a> drugs and were simultaneously labeled "hallucinogens" under a section of the <a href="Comprehensive%20Drug%20Abuse%20Prevention%20and%20Control%20Act%20of%201970">Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act</a> known as the <a href="Controlled%20Substances%20Act">Controlled Substances Act</a>. Schedule I drugs are illicit drugs that are claimed to have no known therapeutic benefit.

The <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="Convention%20on%20Psychotropic%20Substances">Convention on Psychotropic Substances</a> (adopted in 1971) requires its members to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions. However, the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention, due largely to pressure from the <a href="Mexican%20government">Mexican government</a>.

Most national <a href="Prohibition%20%28drugs%29">drug laws</a> have been amended to reflect the terms of the convention; examples include the UK <a href="Misuse%20of%20Drugs%20Act%201971">Misuse of Drugs Act 1971</a>, the US <a href="Psychotropic%20Substances%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Psychotropic Substances Act</a> of 1978, Australia <a href="Standard%20for%20the%20Uniform%20Scheduling%20of%20Medicines%20and%20Poisons">Poisons Standard</a> (October 2015), the Canadian <a href="Controlled%20Drugs%20and%20Substances%20Act">Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</a> of 1996, and the Japanese Narcotics and Psychotropics Control Law of 2002. The possession and use of psilocybin is prohibited under almost all circumstances, and often carries severe legal penalties.

Possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including the bluing species of "Psilocybe", is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, there has been a great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of <a href="selective%20enforcement">selective enforcement</a> in some places. Most US <a href="State%20court%20%28United%20States%29">state courts</a> have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the illicit drugs, and therefore illegal. A <a href="loophole">loophole</a> further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active <a href="underground%20economy">underground economy</a> involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the illicit activity.

A 2009 national survey of drug use by the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services">US Department of Health and Human Services</a> concluded that the number of first-time psilocybin mushroom users in the United States was roughly equivalent to the number of first-time users of <a href="cannabis%20%28drug%29">cannabis</a>. In European countries, the lifetime prevalence estimates of psychedelic mushroom usage among young adults (15–34 years) range from 0.3% to 14.1%.

In modern Mexico, traditional ceremonial use survives among several indigenous groups, including the <a href="Nahua%20people">Nahuas</a>, the <a href="Matlatzinca%20people">Matlatzinca</a>, the <a href="Totonacs">Totonacs</a>, the <a href="Mazatecs">Mazatecs</a>, <a href="Mixe%20people">Mixes</a>, <a href="Zapotec%20peoples">Zapotecs</a>, and the <a href="Chatino">Chatino</a>. Although hallucinogenic "Psilocybe" species are abundant in low-lying areas of Mexico, most ceremonial use takes places in mountainous areas of elevations greater than . Guzmán suggests this is a vestige of Spanish colonial influence from several hundred years earlier, when mushroom use was persecuted by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>.

Psilocybin has been a subject of preliminary research since the early 1960s, when the <a href="Harvard%20Psilocybin%20Project">Harvard Psilocybin Project</a> evaluated the <a href="Psilocybin%20therapy">potential therapeutic value of psilocybin</a> for <a href="personality%20disorders">personality disorders</a>. Beginning in the 2000s decade, research on <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>s, <a href="major%20depression">major depression</a>, and various <a href="addiction">addiction</a>s was conducted. Psilocybin has been tested for its potential for developing <a href="prescription%20drug">prescription drug</a>s to treat <a href="drug%20dependence">drug dependence</a>, <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a> or <a href="mood%20disorder">mood disorder</a>s.

In 2018 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for psilocybin-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>.

Frog

A frog is any member of a diverse and largely <a href="Carnivore">carnivorous</a> group of short-bodied, tailless <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s composing the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> Anura (literally "without tail" in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>). The <a href="Triadobatrachus">oldest fossil "proto-frog"</a> appeared in the <a href="early%20Triassic">early Triassic</a> of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, but <a href="molecular%20clock">molecular clock dating</a> suggests their origins may extend further back to the <a href="Permian">Permian</a>, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the <a href="tropics">tropics</a> to <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> regions, but the greatest concentration of <a href="species%20diversity">species diversity</a> is in <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> orders. Warty frog species tend to be called <a href="toad">toad</a>s, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not from <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> or evolutionary history.

An adult frog has a stout body, protruding <a href="eye">eye</a>s, cleft <a href="tongue">tongue</a>, limbs folded underneath, and no <a href="tail">tail</a>. Frogs have <a href="gland">gland</a>ular skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skins varies in colour from well-<a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>d dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and <a href="Aposematism">ward off predators</a>. Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some species are adapted for living underground or in trees.

Frogs typically lay their <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic <a href="larva">larva</a>e called <a href="tadpole">tadpole</a>s that have tails and internal <a href="gill">gill</a>s. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>, <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a> or <a href="planktivore">planktivorous</a> diets. The <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a> is completed when they <a href="Metamorphosis">metamorphose</a> into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for <a href="Predation">predators</a> and part of the <a href="food%20web">food web</a> dynamics of many of the world's <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s. The skin is <a href="semi-permeable">semi-permeable</a>, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of <a href="Animal%20communication">vocalizations</a>, particularly in their <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>, and exhibit many different kinds of complex <a href="Ethology">behaviours</a> to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.

Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion. Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be <a href="Threatened%20species">threatened</a> with <a href="extinct">extinct</a>ion and over 120 are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging <a href="fungus">fungal</a> disease, <a href="chytridiomycosis">chytridiomycosis</a>, has spread around the world. <a href="Conservation%20biology">Conservation biologists</a> are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.

The use of the common names "frog" and "<a href="toad">toad</a>" has no taxonomic justification. From a classification perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family <a href="Bufonidae">Bufonidae</a> are considered "true toads". The use of the term "frog" in common names usually refers to species that are aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term "toad" generally refers to species that are terrestrial with dry, warty skins. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The <a href="European%20fire-bellied%20toad">European fire-bellied toad</a> ("Bombina bombina") has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery habitat whereas the <a href="Panamanian%20golden%20frog">Panamanian golden frog</a> ("Atelopus zeteki") is in the toad family Bufonidae and has a smooth skin.

The origin of the order name "Anura" — and its original spelling "Anoures" — is the <a href="ancient%20greek">Ancient Greek</a> "<a href="alpha%20privative">alpha privative</a>" prefix () "without", and (), meaning "animal tail". It refers to the tailless character of these amphibians.

The origins of the word "frog" are uncertain and debated. The word is first attested in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> as "frogga", but the usual Old English word for the frog was "frosc" (with variants such as "frox" and "forsc"), and it is agreed that the word "frog" is somehow related to this. Old English "frosc" remained in dialectal use in English as "frosh" and "frosk" into the nineteenth century, and is paralleled widely in other <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a>, with examples in the modern languages including German "Frosch", Icelandic "froskur", and Dutch "(kik)vors". These words allow us to reconstruct a <a href="Proto-Germanic%20language">Common Germanic</a> ancestor *"froskaz". The third edition of the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" finds that the etymology of *"froskaz" is uncertain, but agrees with arguments that it could plausibly derive from a <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> base along the lines of *"preu" = "jump".

How Old English "frosc" gave rise to "frogga" is, however, uncertain, as the development does not involve a regular <a href="Sound%20change">sound-change</a>. Instead, it seems that there was a trend in Old English to coin nicknames for animals ending in -"g", with examples—themselves all of uncertain etymology—including "dog", "hog", "pig, stag", and "(ear)wig". "Frog" appears to have been adapted from "frosc" as part of this trend.

Meanwhile, the word "toad", first attested as Old English "tādige", is unique to English and is likewise of uncertain etymology. It is the basis for the word "tadpole", first attested as <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> "taddepol", apparently meaning 'toad-head'.

About 88% of <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a> species are <a href="Biological%20classification">classified</a> in the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> Anura. These include around 4,810 species in 33 <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, of which the <a href="Leptodactylidae">Leptodactylidae</a> (1,100 spp.), <a href="Hylidae">Hylidae</a> (800 spp.) and <a href="Ranidae">Ranidae</a> (750 spp.) are the <a href="Species%20richness">richest in species</a>.

The Anura include all modern frogs and any <a href="fossil">fossil</a> species that fit within the anuran definition. The characteristics of anuran adults include: 9 or fewer presacral vertebrae, the presence of a urostyle formed of fused vertebrae, no tail, a long and forward-sloping ilium, shorter fore limbs than hind limbs, <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a> fused, <a href="tibia">tibia</a> and <a href="fibula">fibula</a> fused, elongated <a href="ankle%20bone">ankle bone</a>s, absence of a prefrontal bone, presence of a <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid plate</a>, a <a href="Mandible">lower jaw</a> without teeth (with the exception of "<a href="Gastrotheca%20guentheri">Gastrotheca guentheri</a>") consisting of three pairs of bones (angulosplenial, dentary, and mentomeckelian, with the last pair being absent in <a href="Pipoidea">Pipoidea</a>), an unsupported tongue, <a href="lymph">lymph</a> spaces underneath the skin, and a muscle, the protractor lentis, attached to the <a href="Lens%20%28anatomy%29">lens of the eye</a>. The anuran larva or tadpole has a single central respiratory <a href="spiracle">spiracle</a> and mouthparts consisting of <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ous beaks and <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a>.

Frogs and toads are broadly classified into three suborders: <a href="Archaeobatrachia">Archaeobatrachia</a>, which includes four families of primitive frogs; <a href="Mesobatrachia">Mesobatrachia</a>, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and <a href="Neobatrachia">Neobatrachia</a>, by far the largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies <a href="Hyloidea">Hyloidea</a> and <a href="Ranoidea">Ranoidea</a>. This classification is based on such <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a>, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.

Some species of anurans <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridize</a> readily. For instance, the <a href="edible%20frog">edible frog</a> ("Pelophylax esculentus") is a hybrid between the <a href="pool%20frog">pool frog</a> ("P. lessonae") and the <a href="marsh%20frog">marsh frog</a> ("P. ridibundus"). The fire-bellied toads "Bombina bombina" and "<a href="Yellow-bellied%20toad">B. variegata</a>" are similar in forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving rise to a <a href="hybrid%20zone">hybrid zone</a> where the hybrids are prevalent.
The origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians are hotly debated. A <a href="molecular%20phylogeny">molecular phylogeny</a> based on <a href="Ribosomal%20DNA">rDNA</a> analysis dating from 2005 suggests that <a href="salamanders">salamanders</a> and <a href="caecilian">caecilian</a>s are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs and the <a href="Genetic%20divergence">divergence</a> of the three groups took place in the <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> or early <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> before the breakup of the supercontinent <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a> and soon after their divergence from the <a href="Sarcopterygii">lobe-finned fishes</a>. This would help account for the relative scarcity of amphibian fossils from the period before the groups split. Another molecular phylogenetic analysis conducted about the same time concluded that <a href="lissamphibian">lissamphibian</a>s first appeared about 330 million years ago and that the <a href="Temnospondyli">temnospondyl-origin</a> hypothesis is more credible than other theories. The <a href="neobatrachia">neobatrachia</a>ns seemed to have originated in Africa/India, the salamanders in East Asia and the caecilians in tropical Pangaea. Other researchers, while agreeing with the main thrust of this study, questioned the choice of calibration points used to synchronise the data. They proposed that the date of lissamphibian diversification should be placed in the <a href="Permian">Permian</a>, rather less than 300 million years ago, a date in better agreement with the palaeontological data. A further study in 2011 using both extinct and living taxa sampled for morphological, as well as molecular data, came to the conclusion that Lissamphibia is <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a> and that it should be nested within <a href="Lepospondyli">Lepospondyli</a> rather than within <a href="Temnospondyli">Temnospondyli</a>. The study postulated that Lissamphibia originated no earlier than the late <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a>, some 290 to 305 million years ago. The split between Anura and <a href="Caudata">Caudata</a> was estimated as taking place 292 million years ago, rather later than most molecular studies suggest, with the caecilians splitting off 239 million years ago.
In 2008, "<a href="Gerobatrachus%20hottoni">Gerobatrachus hottoni</a>", a <a href="Temnospondyli">temnospondyl</a> with many frog- and salamander-like characteristics, was discovered in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. It dated back 290 million years and was hailed as a <a href="Transitional%20fossil">missing link</a>, a <a href="Stem%20group">stem</a> batrachian close to the <a href="common%20ancestor">common ancestor</a> of frogs and salamanders, consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that frogs and salamanders are more closely related to each other (forming a <a href="clade">clade</a> called Batrachia) than they are to caecilians. However, others have suggested that "Gerobatrachus hottoni" was only a <a href="Dissorophoidea">dissorophoid</a> temnospondyl unrelated to extant amphibians.

<a href="Salientia">Salientia</a> (Latin "salere" ("salio"), "to jump") is the name of the total group that includes modern frogs in the order Anura as well as their close fossil relatives, the "proto-frogs" or "stem-frogs". The common features possessed by these proto-frogs include 14 <a href="Vertebral%20column">presacral vertebrae</a> (modern frogs have eight or 9), a long and forward-sloping <a href="Ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> in the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>, the presence of a <a href="Parietal%20bone">frontoparietal bone</a>, and a <a href="Mandible">lower jaw</a> without teeth. The earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are "<a href="Triadobatrachus%20massinoti">Triadobatrachus massinoti</a>", from the early <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> (about 250 million years ago), and "<a href="Czatkobatrachus%20polonicus">Czatkobatrachus polonicus</a>", from the Early Triassic of <a href="Poland">Poland</a> (about the same age as "Triadobatrachus"). The skull of "Triadobatrachus" is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs. These include a longer body with more <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a>. The tail has separate vertebrae unlike the fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frogs. The tibia and fibula bones are also separate, making it probable that "Triadobatrachus" was not an efficient leaper.

The earliest known "true frogs" that fall into the anuran lineage proper all lived in the early <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> period. One such early frog species, "<a href="Prosalirus%20bitis">Prosalirus bitis</a>", was discovered in <a href="1995%20in%20paleontology">1995</a> in the <a href="Kayenta%20Formation">Kayenta Formation</a> of <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and dates back to the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a> epoch (199.6 to 175 million years ago), making "Prosalirus" somewhat more recent than "Triadobatrachus". Like the latter, "Prosalirus" did not have greatly enlarged legs, but had the typical three-pronged <a href="pelvic">pelvic</a> structure of modern frogs. Unlike "Triadobatrachus", "Prosalirus" had already lost nearly all of its tail and was well adapted for jumping. Another Early Jurassic frog is "<a href="Vieraella%20herbsti">Vieraella herbsti</a>", which is known only from <a href="dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> and <a href="ventral">ventral</a> impressions of a single animal and was estimated to be from snout to vent. "<a href="Notobatrachus%20degiustoi">Notobatrachus degiustoi</a>" from the middle Jurassic is slightly younger, about 155–170 million years old. The main evolutionary changes in this species involved the shortening of the body and the loss of the tail. The evolution of modern Anura likely was complete by the Jurassic period. Since then, evolutionary changes in <a href="Ploidy">chromosome numbers</a> have taken place about 20 times faster in mammals than in frogs, which means <a href="speciation">speciation</a> is occurring more rapidly in mammals.

According to genetic studies, the families <a href="Hyloidea">Hyloidea</a>, <a href="Microhylidae">Microhylidae</a>, and the clade <a href="Natatanura">Natatanura</a> (comprising about 88% of living frogs) diversified simultaneously some 66 million years ago, soon after the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20extinction%20event">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</a> associated with the <a href="Chicxulub%20impactor">Chicxulub impactor</a>. All origins of arboreality (e.g. in Hyloidea and Natatanura) follow from that time and the resurgence of forest that occurred afterwards.

Frog fossils have been found on all continents except <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, but <a href="biogeography">biogeographic</a> evidence suggests they also inhabited Antarctica in an earlier era when the climate was warmer.
A <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> showing the relationships of the different <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">families</a> of frogs in the clade Anura can be seen in the table above. This diagram, in the form of a <a href="Phylogenetic%20tree">tree</a>, shows how each frog family is related to other families, with each node representing a point of common ancestry. It is based on Frost "et al." (2006), Heinicke "et al." (2009) and Pyron and Wiens (2011).

Frogs have no tail, except as larvae, and most have long hind legs, elongated ankle bones, webbed toes, no claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have short vertebral columns, with no more than 10 free vertebrae and fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx). Like other amphibians, <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> can pass through their highly permeable skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins. The ribs are poorly developed, so the lungs are filled by <a href="buccal%20pumping">buccal pumping</a> and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them. For the skin to serve as a respiratory organ, it must remain moist. This makes frogs susceptible to various substances they may encounter in the environment, some of which may be toxic and can dissolve in the water film and be passed into their bloodstream. This may be one of the causes of the worldwide <a href="decline%20in%20amphibian%20populations">decline in frog populations</a>.

Frogs range in size from the recently discovered "<a href="Paedophryne%20amauensis">Paedophryne amauensis</a>" of <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> to the <a href="goliath%20frog">goliath frog</a> ("Conraua goliath") of <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>. The skin hangs loosely on the body because of the lack of <a href="loose%20connective%20tissue">loose connective tissue</a>. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. They have a <a href="tympanum%20%28zoology%29">tympanum</a> on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. True toads completely lack teeth, but most frogs have them, specifically <a href="pedicellate%20teeth">pedicellate teeth</a> in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and <a href="vomerine%20teeth">vomerine teeth</a> are also on the roof of their mouths. No teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place till swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head. The African bullfrog ("<a href="Pyxicephalus">Pyxicephalus</a>"), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.

The structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily on the ground, in water, in trees or in burrows. Frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the <a href="musculoskeletal">musculoskeletal</a> <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> modified for this purpose. The tibia, fibula, and <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsals</a> have been fused into a single, strong <a href="bone">bone</a>, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs (which must absorb the impact on landing). The <a href="metatarsals">metatarsals</a> have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on take-off. The <a href="illium">illium</a> has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> which, in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred from the legs to the body during a leap.

The muscular system has been similarly modified. The hind limbs of ancestral frogs presumably contained pairs of muscles which would act in opposition (one muscle to flex the knee, a different muscle to extend it), as is seen in most other limbed animals. However, in modern frogs, almost all muscles have been modified to contribute to the action of jumping, with only a few small muscles remaining to bring the limb back to the starting position and maintain posture. The muscles have also been greatly enlarged, with the main leg muscles accounting for over 17% of the total mass of frogs.

Many frogs have webbed feet and the degree of webbing is directly proportional to the amount of time the species spends in the water. The completely aquatic <a href="African%20dwarf%20frog">African dwarf frog</a> ("Hymenochirus" sp.) has fully webbed toes, whereas those of <a href="White%27s%20tree%20frog">White's tree frog</a> ("Litoria caerulea"), an arboreal species, are only a quarter or half webbed.

<a href="Tree%20frog">Arboreal frogs</a> have pads located on the ends of their toes to help grip vertical surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through <a href="Capillarity">surface tension</a>. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.

In many arboreal frogs, a small "intercalary structure" on each toe increases the surface area touching the <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. Furthermore, since hopping through trees can be dangerous, many arboreal frogs have hip joints to allow both hopping and walking. Some frogs that live high in trees even possess an elaborate degree of webbing between their toes. This allows the frogs to "parachute" or make a controlled glide from one position in the canopy to another.

Ground-dwelling frogs generally lack the adaptations of aquatic and arboreal frogs. Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing frogs such as <a href="Couch%27s%20Spadefoot%20Toad">Couch's spadefoot</a> ("Scaphiopus couchii") have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ised <a href="tubercle">tubercle</a> often referred to as a spade, that helps them to burrow.

Sometimes during the tadpole stage, one of the developing rear legs is eaten by a predator such as a <a href="dragonfly%20nymph">dragonfly nymph</a>. In some cases, the full leg still grows, but in others it does not, although the frog may still live out its normal lifespan with only three limbs. Occasionally, a parasitic <a href="flatworm">flatworm</a> ("<a href="Ribeiroia%20ondatrae">Ribeiroia ondatrae</a>") digs into the rear of a tadpole, causing a rearrangement of the limb bud cells and the frog develops an extra leg or two.

A frog's skin is protective, has a respiratory function, can absorb water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, particularly on the head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (<a href="Skin">granular glands</a>). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits down the middle of the back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.

Being cold-blooded, frogs have to adopt suitable behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, they can move into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into the shade or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture is also used to prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The <a href="Grey%20Foam-nest%20Treefrog">grey foam-nest tree frog</a> ("Chiromantis xerampelina") is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.

Many frogs are able to absorb water and oxygen directly through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in <a href="amplexus">amplexus</a>. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Other frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. <a href="Woodhouse%27s%20toad">Woodhouse's toad</a> ("Bufo woodhousii"), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male <a href="Hairy%20Frog">hairy frog</a> ("Trichobatrachus robustus") has <a href="dermal%20papillae">dermal papillae</a> projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase the area of the skin available for respiration.

Some species have <a href="Osteoderm">bony plates</a> embedded in their skin, a trait that appears to have evolved independently several times. In certain other species, the skin at the top of the head is compacted and the connective tissue of the dermis is co-ossified with the bones of the skull (<a href="exostosis">exostosis</a>).

<a href="Camouflage">Camouflage</a> is a common defensive mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out a position where they can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog ("Litoria caerulea") varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the <a href="Pacific%20tree%20frog">Pacific tree frog</a> ("Pseudacris regilla") has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and <a href="skin%20fold">skin fold</a>s are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.
The skin of a frog is permeable to <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, as well as to water. There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater, oxygen diffuses directly into the blood. When not submerged, a frog breathes by a process known as <a href="buccal%20pumping">buccal pumping</a>. Its lungs are similar to those of humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and no <a href="rib">rib</a>s or <a href="diaphragm%20%28anatomy%29">diaphragm</a> exist to help move air in and out. Instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. When the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs. The fully aquatic <a href="Bornean%20flat-headed%20frog">Bornean flat-headed frog</a> ("Barbourula kalimantanensis") is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.

Frogs have three-chambered <a href="heart">heart</a>s, a feature they share with <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s. Oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the <a href="Respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiring</a> tissues enter the heart through separate <a href="atrium%20%28anatomy%29">atria</a>. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common <a href="Ventricle%20%28heart%29">ventricle</a> before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the <a href="aorta">aorta</a> for oxygenated blood and <a href="pulmonary%20artery">pulmonary artery</a> for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of the two types of blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active than would otherwise be possible.

Some species of frog have adaptations that allow them to survive in oxygen deficient water. The <a href="Titicaca%20water%20frog">Titicaca water frog</a> ("Telmatobius culeus") is one such species and has wrinkly skin that increases its surface area to enhance gas exchange. It normally makes no use of its rudimentary lungs but will sometimes raise and lower its body rhythmically while on the lake bed to increase the flow of water around it.

Frogs have maxillary teeth along their upper jaw which are used to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue normally lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food as they can be retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>.

Although adapted to terrestrial life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in their inability to conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation from the skin. The excretory system is similar to that of mammals and there are two <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as <a href="urea">urea</a>, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a>. The urine passes along paired <a href="ureter">ureter</a>s to the <a href="urinary%20bladder">urinary bladder</a> from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.

In the male frog, the two <a href="Testis">testes</a> are attached to the kidneys and <a href="semen">semen</a> passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called <a href="efferent%20ducts">efferent ducts</a>. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.

When frogs mate, the male climbs on the back of the female and wraps his fore limbs round her body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. This position is called <a href="amplexus">amplexus</a> and may be held for several days. The male frog has certain hormone-dependent <a href="secondary%20sexual%20characteristic">secondary sexual characteristic</a>s. These include the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold. The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn. In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have <a href="vocal%20sac">vocal sac</a>s to amplify the sound.

Frogs have a highly developed nervous system that consists of a brain, spinal cord and nerves. Many parts of frog brains correspond with those of humans. It consists of two olfactory lobes, two cerebral hemispheres, a pineal body, two optic lobes, a cerebellum and a medulla oblongata. Muscular coordination and posture are controlled by the <a href="cerebellum">cerebellum</a>, and the <a href="medulla%20oblongata">medulla oblongata</a> regulates respiration, digestion and other automatic functions. The relative size of the <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a> in frogs is much smaller than it is in humans. Frogs have ten pairs of <a href="cranial%20nerves">cranial nerves</a> which pass information from the outside directly to the brain, and ten pairs of <a href="spinal%20nerves">spinal nerves</a> which pass information from the extremities to the brain through the spinal cord. By contrast, all <a href="amniotes">amniotes</a> (mammals, birds and reptiles) have twelve pairs of cranial nerves.

The eyes of most frogs are located on either side of the head near the top and project outwards as hemispherical bulges. They provide <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a> over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a> which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family <a href="Pipidae">Pipidae</a> have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a>es come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The <a href="common%20toad">common toad</a> ("Bufo bufo") has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the <a href="Agalychnis%20callidryas">red-eyed tree frog</a> ("Agalychnis callidryas") has vertical slit pupils, the <a href="Phyllobates">poison dart frog</a> has dark irises, the <a href="fire-bellied%20toad">fire-bellied toad</a> ("Bombina spp.") has triangular pupils and the <a href="Dyscophus%20antongilii">tomato frog</a> ("Dyscophus spp.") has circular ones. The irises of the <a href="southern%20toad">southern toad</a> ("Anaxyrus terrestris") are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.

The distant vision of a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an intruder or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Whether a frog sees in colour is debatable but it has been shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.

Frogs can hear both in the air and below water. They do not have <a href="Pinnae">external ears</a>; the eardrums (<a href="Tympanum%20%28anatomy%29">tympanic membranes</a>) are directly exposed or may be covered by a layer of skin and are visible as a circular area just behind the eye. The size and distance apart of the eardrums is related to the frequency and wavelength at which the frog calls. In some species such as the bullfrog, the size of the tympanum indicates the sex of the frog; males have tympani that are larger than their eyes while in females, the eyes and tympani are much the same size. A noise causes the tympanum to vibrate and the sound is transmitted to the middle and inner ear. The middle ear contains semicircular canals which help control balance and orientation. In the inner ear, the auditory hair cells are arranged in two areas of the cochlea, the basilar papilla and the amphibian papilla. The former detects high frequencies and the latter low frequencies. Because the cochlea is short, frogs use <a href="electrical%20tuning">electrical tuning</a> to extend their range of audible frequencies and help discriminate different sounds. This arrangement enables detection of the territorial and breeding calls of their <a href="Conspecificity">conspecifics</a>. In some species that inhabit arid regions, the sound of thunder or heavy rain may arouse them from a dormant state. A frog may be startled by an unexpected noise but it will not usually take any action until it has located the source of the sound by sight.

The call or croak of a frog is unique to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the <a href="larynx">larynx</a> in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified by one or more vocal sacs, membranes of skin under the throat or on the corner of the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away. Additionally, some species have been found to use man-made structures such as drain pipes for artificial amplification of their call.

Frogs in the genera "<a href="Heleioporus">Heleioporus</a>" and "<a href="Neobatrachus">Neobatrachus</a>" lack vocal sacs but can still produce a loud call. Their <a href="mouth">buccal cavity</a> is enlarged and dome-shaped, acting as a <a href="resonance%20chamber">resonance chamber</a> that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and that do not have a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They need to use an alternative means to communicate. The <a href="Ascaphus%20truei">coastal tailed frog</a> ("Ascaphus truei") lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.

The main reason for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate. Males may call individually or there may be a chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. Females of many frog species, such as the <a href="Common%20Tree%20Frog">common tree frog</a> ("Polypedates leucomystax"), reply to the male calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony. Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.

A different call is emitted by a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and is accompanied by a vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used to drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.

Many species of frog have deep calls. The croak of the <a href="American%20bullfrog">American bullfrog</a> ("Rana catesbiana") is sometimes written as "jug o' rum". The <a href="Pacific%20Tree%20Frog">Pacific tree frog</a> ("Pseudacris regilla") produces the <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a> "ribbit" often heard in films. Other renderings of frog calls into speech include "brekekekex koax koax", the call of the marsh frog ("<a href="Pelophylax%20ridibundus">Pelophylax ridibundus</a>") in "The Frogs", an Ancient Greek comic drama by <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>.

During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a state of <a href="torpor">torpor</a> and remain inactive for months. In colder regions, many species of frog <a href="Hibernation">hibernate</a> in winter. Those that live on land such as the <a href="American%20toad">American toad</a> ("Bufo americanus") dig a burrow and make a <a href="Hibernaculum%20%28zoology%29">hibernaculum</a> in which to lie <a href="Dormancy">dormant</a>. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in dead leaves. Aquatic species such as the <a href="American%20bullfrog">American bullfrog</a> ("Rana catesbeiana") normally sink to the bottom of the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.

At the other extreme, the <a href="striped%20burrowing%20frog">striped burrowing frog</a> ("Cyclorana alboguttata") regularly <a href="Aestivation">aestivates</a> during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state without access to food and water for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective <a href="Cocoon%20%28silk%29">cocoon</a> formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the <a href="University%20of%20Queensland">University of Queensland</a> have found that during aestivation, the <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a> is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious for an extended period of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.

Different species of frog use a number of methods of moving around including <a href="jumping">jumping</a>, <a href="running">running</a>, <a href="walking">walking</a>, <a href="aquatic%20locomotion">swimming</a>, <a href="burrow">burrow</a>ing, <a href="climbing">climbing</a> and <a href="Flying%20frog">gliding</a>.
Frogs are generally recognized as exceptional jumpers and, relative to their size, the best jumpers of all vertebrates. The <a href="striped%20rocket%20frog">striped rocket frog</a>, "Litoria nasuta", can leap over , a distance that is more than fifty times its body length of . There are tremendous differences between species in jumping capability. Within a species, jump distance increases with increasing size, but relative jumping distance (body-lengths jumped) decreases. The <a href="Euphlyctis%20cyanophlyctis">Indian skipper frog</a> ("Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis") has the ability to leap out of the water from a position floating on the surface. The tiny <a href="northern%20cricket%20frog">northern cricket frog</a> ("Acris crepitans") can "skitter" across the surface of a pond with a series of short rapid jumps.

Slow-motion photography shows that the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog is still in the crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position for the duration of the jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the <a href="Cuban%20tree%20frog">Cuban tree frog</a> ("Osteopilus septentrionalis") and the <a href="northern%20leopard%20frog">northern leopard frog</a> ("Rana pipiens"), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a <a href="catapult">catapult</a> to produce a powerful acceleration beyond the limits of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in <a href="locust">locust</a>s and <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s.


Frogs in the families Bufonidae, <a href="Rhinophrynidae">Rhinophrynidae</a>, and <a href="Microhylidae">Microhylidae</a> have short back legs and tend to walk rather than jump. When they try to move rapidly, they speed up the rate of movement of their limbs or resort to an ungainly hopping gait. The <a href="Great%20Plains%20narrow-mouthed%20toad">Great Plains narrow-mouthed toad</a> ("Gastrophryne olivacea") has been described as having a gait that is "a combination of running and short hops that are usually only an inch or two in length". In an experiment, <a href="Bufo%20fowleri">Fowler's toad</a> ("Bufo fowleri") was placed on a treadmill which was turned at varying speeds. By measuring the toad's uptake of oxygen it was found that hopping was an inefficient use of resources during sustained locomotion but was a useful strategy during short bursts of high-intensity activity.

The <a href="Kassina%20maculata">red-legged running frog</a> ("Kassina maculata") has short, slim hind limbs unsuited to jumping. It can move fast by using a running gait in which the two hind legs are used alternately. Slow-motion photography shows, unlike a horse that can trot or gallop, the frog's gait remained similar at slow, medium, and fast speeds. This species can also climb trees and shrubs, and does so at night to catch insects. The Indian skipper frog ("Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis") has broad feet and can run across the surface of the water for several metres (yards).


Frogs that live in or visit water have adaptations that improve their swimming abilities. The hind limbs are heavily muscled and strong. The webbing between the toes of the hind feet increases the area of the foot and helps propel the frog powerfully through the water. Members of the family <a href="Pipidae">Pipidae</a> are wholly aquatic and show the most marked specialization. They have inflexible vertebral columns, flattened, streamlined bodies, <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a> systems, and powerful hind limbs with large webbed feet. Tadpoles mostly have large tail fins which provide thrust when the tail is moved from side to side.

Some frogs have become adapted for burrowing and a life underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme example of this is the <a href="purple%20frog">purple frog</a> ("Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis") from southern India which feeds on <a href="termite">termite</a>s and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> to mate and breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this <a href="fossorial">fossorial</a> existence, it was <a href="Species%20description">first described</a> in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.
The spadefoot toads of North America are also adapted to underground life. The <a href="Plains%20spadefoot%20toad">Plains spadefoot toad</a> ("Spea bombifrons") is typical and has a flap of keratinised bone attached to one of the <a href="Metatarsus">metatarsals</a> of the hind feet which it uses to dig itself backwards into the ground. As it digs, the toad wriggles its hips from side to side to sink into the loose soil. It has a shallow burrow in the summer from which it emerges at night to forage. In winter, it digs much deeper and has been recorded at a depth of . The tunnel is filled with soil and the toad hibernates in a small chamber at the end. During this time, urea accumulates in its tissues and water is drawn in from the surrounding damp soil by <a href="osmosis">osmosis</a> to supply the toad's needs. Spadefoot toads are "explosive breeders", all emerging from their burrows at the same time and converging on temporary pools, attracted to one of these by the calling of the first male to find a suitable breeding location.

The burrowing frogs of Australia have a rather different lifestyle. The <a href="western%20spotted%20frog">western spotted frog</a> ("Heleioporus albopunctatus") digs a burrow beside a river or in the bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage. Mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow. The eggs partially develop there, but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall. The tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development. Madagascan burrowing frogs are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter. One of these, the <a href="Scaphiophryne%20marmorata">green burrowing frog</a> ("Scaphiophryne marmorata"), has a flattened head with a short snout and well-developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation. It also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes. It breeds in temporary pools that form after rains.

Tree frogs live high in the <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>, where they scramble around on the branches, twigs, and leaves, sometimes never coming down to earth. The "true" tree frogs belong to the family Hylidae, but members of other frog families have independently adopted an arboreal habit, a case of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. These include the <a href="glass%20frogs">glass frogs</a> (Centrolenidae), the <a href="Hyperoliidae">bush frogs</a> (Hyperoliidae), some of the narrow-mouthed frogs (Microhylidae), and the <a href="Rhacophoridae">shrub frogs</a> (Rhacophoridae). Most tree frogs are under in length, with long legs and long toes with adhesive pads on the tips. The surface of the toe pads is formed from a closely packed layer of flat-topped, hexagonal <a href="epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermal</a> cells separated by grooves into which glands secrete <a href="mucus">mucus</a>. These toe pads, moistened by the mucus, provide the grip on any wet or dry surface, including glass. The forces involved include <a href="boundary%20friction">boundary friction</a> of the toe pad epidermis on the surface and also <a href="surface%20tension">surface tension</a> and <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>. Tree frogs are very acrobatic and can catch insects while hanging by one toe from a twig or clutching onto the blade of a windswept reed. Some members of the subfamily <a href="Phyllomedusinae">Phyllomedusinae</a> have <a href="Opposable%20thumb%23Opposition%20and%20apposition">opposable toes</a> on their feet. The <a href="Phyllomedusa%20ayeaye">reticulated leaf frog</a> ("Phyllomedusa ayeaye") has a single opposed <a href="Digit%20%28anatomy%29">digit</a> on each fore foot and two opposed digits on its hind feet. This allows it to grasp the stems of bushes as it clambers around in its riverside habitat.

During the evolutionary history of frogs, several different groups have independently taken to the air. Some frogs in the tropical rainforest are specially adapted for gliding from tree to tree or parachuting to the forest floor. Typical of them is <a href="Rhacophorus%20nigropalmatus">Wallace's flying frog</a> ("Rhacophorus nigropalmatus") from Malaysia and Borneo. It has large feet with the fingertips expanded into flat adhesive discs and the digits fully webbed. Flaps of skin occur on the lateral margins of the limbs and across the tail region. With the digits splayed, the limbs outstretched, and these flaps spread, it can glide considerable distances, but is unable to undertake powered flight. It can alter its direction of travel and navigate distances of up to between trees.

Like other amphibians, the life cycle of a frog normally starts in water with an egg that hatches into a limbless larva with gills, commonly known as a <a href="tadpole">tadpole</a>. After further growth, during which it develops limbs and lungs, the tadpole undergoes <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> in which its appearance and internal organs are rearranged. After this it is able to leave the water as a miniature, air-breathing frog.

Two main types of reproduction occur in frogs, prolonged breeding and explosive breeding. In the former, adopted by the majority of species, adult frogs at certain times of year assemble at a pond, lake or stream to breed. Many frogs return to the bodies of water in which they developed as larvae. This often results in annual migrations involving thousands of individuals. In explosive breeders, mature adult frogs arrive at breeding sites in response to certain trigger factors such as rainfall occurring in an arid area. In these frogs, mating and spawning take place promptly and the speed of larval growth is rapid in order to make use of the ephemeral pools before they dry up.

Among prolonged breeders, males usually arrive at the breeding site first and remain there for some time whereas females tend to arrive later and depart soon after they have spawned. This means that males outnumber females at the water's edge and defend territories from which they expel other males. They advertise their presence by calling, often alternating their croaks with neighbouring frogs. Larger, stronger males tend to have deeper calls and maintain higher quality territories. Females select their mates at least partly on the basis of the depth of their voice. In some species there are satellite males who have no territory and do not call. They may intercept females that are approaching a calling male or take over a vacated territory. Calling is an energy-sapping activity. Sometimes the two roles are reversed and a calling male gives up its territory and becomes a satellite.

In explosive breeders, the first male that finds a suitable breeding location, such as a temporary pool, calls loudly and other frogs of both sexes converge on the pool. Explosive breeders tend to call in unison creating a chorus that can be heard from far away. The spadefoot toads ("<a href="Scaphiopus">Scaphiopus</a> spp.") of North America fall into this category. Mate selection and courtship is not as important as speed in reproduction. In some years, suitable conditions may not occur and the frogs may go for two or more years without breeding. Some female <a href="New%20Mexico%20Spadefoot%20Toad">New Mexico spadefoot toads</a> ("Spea multiplicata") only spawn half of the available eggs at a time, perhaps retaining some in case a better reproductive opportunity arises later.

At the breeding site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, <a href="amplexus">amplexus</a> takes place in the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is <a href="external%20fertilization">external</a>. In many species such as the <a href="Great%20Plains%20toad">Great Plains toad</a> ("Bufo cognatus"), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus "<a href="Nimbaphrynoides">Nimbaphrynoides</a>" are unique among frogs in that they are <a href="Viviparity">viviparous</a>; "<a href="Limnonectes%20larvaepartus">Limnonectes larvaepartus</a>", "<a href="Eleutherodactylus%20jasperi">Eleutherodactylus jasperi</a>" and members of the <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>n genus "<a href="Nectophrynoides">Nectophrynoides</a>" are the only frogs known to be <a href="Ovoviviparity">ovoviviparous</a>. In these species, fertilization is <a href="Internal%20fertilization">internal</a> and females give birth to fully developed juvenile frogs, except "L. larvaepartus", which give birth to tadpoles.

Frogs' embryos are typically surrounded by several layers of gelatinous material. When several eggs are clumped together, they are collectively known as <a href="wikt%3Afrogspawn">frogspawn</a>. The jelly provides support and protection while allowing the passage of oxygen, <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and ammonia. It absorbs moisture and swells on contact with water. After fertilization, the innermost portion liquifies to allow free movement of the developing embryo. In certain species, such as the <a href="Northern%20red-legged%20frog">Northern red-legged frog</a> ("Rana aurora") and the <a href="wood%20frog">wood frog</a> ("Rana sylvatica"), <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> unicellular green algae are present in the gelatinous material. It is thought that these may benefit the developing larvae by providing them with extra oxygen through <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Most eggs are black or dark brown and this has the advantage of absorbing warmth from the sun which the insulating capsule retains. The interior of globular egg clusters of the <a href="Wood%20Frog">wood frog</a> ("Rana sylvatica") has been found to be up to 6 °C (11 °F) warmer than the surrounding water and this speeds up the development of the larvae.

The shape and size of the egg mass is characteristic of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny <a href="Yellow-Striped%20Pygmy%20Eleuth">yellow-striped pygmy eleuth</a> ("Eleutherodactylus limbatus") lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The <a href="Smoky%20Jungle%20Frog">smoky jungle frog</a> ("Leptodactylus pentadactylus") makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog ("Agalychnis callidryas") deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s released by the developing larvae.

The larvae that emerge from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or occasionally polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, but at least one species ("<a href="Nannophrys%20ceylonensis">Nannophrys ceylonensis</a>") has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, <a href="lateral%20line%20system">lateral line system</a>s, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.

From early in its development, a gill pouch covers the tadpole's gills and front legs. The lungs soon start to develop and are used as an accessory breathing organ. Some species go through metamorphosis while still inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. Tadpoles lack true teeth, but the jaws in most species have two elongated, parallel rows of small, <a href="keratin">keratin</a>ized structures called keradonts in their upper jaws. Their lower jaws usually have three rows of keradonts surrounded by a horny beak, but the number of rows can vary and the exact arrangements of mouth parts provide a means for species identification. In the Pipidae, with the exception of "<a href="Hymenochirus">Hymenochirus</a>", the tadpoles have paired anterior barbels, which make them resemble small <a href="catfish">catfish</a>. Their tails are stiffened by a <a href="notochord">notochord</a>, but does not contain any bony or cartilaginous elements except for a few vertebrae at the base which forms the urostyle during metamorphosis. This has been suggested as an adaptation to their lifestyles; because the transformation into frogs happens very fast, the tail is made of soft tissue only, as bone and cartilage take a much longer time to be broken down and absorbed. The tail fin and tip is fragile and will easily tear, which is seen as an adaptation to escape from predators which tries to grasp them by the tail.

Tadpoles are typically <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a>, feeding mostly on <a href="alga">alga</a>e, including <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s filtered from the water through the <a href="gill">gill</a>s. Some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage, eating insects, smaller tadpoles, and fish. The Cuban tree frog ("Osteopilus septentrionalis") is one of a number of species in which the tadpoles can be <a href="Cannibalism">cannibalistic</a>. Tadpoles that develop legs early may be eaten by the others, so late developers may have better long-term survival prospects.

Tadpoles are highly vulnerable to being eaten by fish, <a href="newt">newt</a>s, predatory <a href="diving%20beetle">diving beetle</a>s, and birds, such as <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a>s. Some tadpoles, including those of the <a href="cane%20toad">cane toad</a> ("Bufo marinus"), are poisonous. The tadpole stage may be as short as a week in explosive breeders or it may last through one or more winters followed by metamorphosis in the spring.

At the end of the tadpole stage, a frog undergoes metamorphosis in which its body makes a sudden transition into the adult form. This metamorphosis typically lasts only 24 hours, and is initiated by production of the <a href="hormone">hormone</a> <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a>. This causes different tissues to develop in different ways. The principal changes that take place include the development of the lungs and the disappearance of the gills and gill pouch, making the front legs visible. The lower jaw transforms into the big mandible of the carnivorous adult, and the long, spiral gut of the herbivorous tadpole is replaced by the typical short gut of a predator. The nervous system becomes adapted for hearing and stereoscopic vision, and for new methods of locomotion and feeding. The eyes are repositioned higher up on the head and the eyelids and associated glands are formed. The eardrum, middle ear, and inner ear are developed. The skin becomes thicker and tougher, the lateral line system is lost, and skin glands are developed. The final stage is the disappearance of the tail, but this takes place rather later, the tissue being used to produce a spurt of growth in the limbs. Frogs are at their most vulnerable to predators when they are undergoing metamorphosis. At this time, the tail is being lost and locomotion by means of limbs is only just becoming established.

After metamorphosis, young adults may disperse into terrestrial habitats or continue to live in water. Almost all frog species are <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> as adults, preying on invertebrates, including <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, <a href="annelid">worms</a>, <a href="gastropoda">snails</a>, and <a href="slug">slug</a>s. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, and <a href="fish">fish</a>. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog "<a href="Xenohyla%20truncata">Xenohyla truncata</a>" is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, "<a href="Leptodactylus%20mystaceus">Leptodactylus mystaceus</a>" has been found to eat plants, and <a href="folivory">folivory</a> occurs in "<a href="Euphlyctis%20hexadactylus">Euphlyctis hexadactylus</a>", with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The <a href="northern%20leopard%20frog">northern leopard frog</a> ("Rana pipiens") is eaten by <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, fish, large <a href="salamanders">salamanders</a>, <a href="snake">snake</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s, <a href="skunk">skunk</a>s, <a href="mink">mink</a>, bullfrogs, and other animals.
Frogs are primary predators and an important part of the <a href="food%20web">food web</a>. Being <a href="Ectotherm">cold-blooded</a>, they make efficient use of the food they eat with little energy being used for metabolic processes, while the rest is transformed into <a href="biomass%20%28ecology%29">biomass</a>. They are themselves eaten by secondary predators and are the primary terrestrial consumers of invertebrates, most of which feed on plants. By reducing herbivory, they play a part in increasing the growth of plants and are thus part of a delicately balanced ecosystem.

Little is known about the longevity of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. <a href="Skeletochronology">Skeletochronology</a> is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of <a href="mountain%20yellow-legged%20frog">mountain yellow-legged frog</a>s ("Rana muscosa") were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad ("Bufo bufo"). The cane toad ("Bufo marinus") has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog ("Rana catesbeiana") 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog ("Rana sylvatica").

Although care of offspring is poorly understood in frogs, up to an estimated 20% of amphibian species may care for their young in some way. The <a href="evolution%20of%20biparental%20care%20in%20tropical%20frogs">evolution of parental care</a> in frogs is driven primarily by the size of the water body in which they breed. Those that breed in smaller water bodies tend to have greater and more complex parental care behaviour. Because predation of eggs and larvae is high in large water bodies, some frog species started to lay their eggs on land. Once this happened, the desiccating terrestrial environment demands that one or both parents keep them moist to ensure their survival. The subsequent need to transport hatched tadpoles to a water body required an even more intense form of parental care.

In small pools, predators are mostly absent and competition between tadpoles becomes the variable that constrains their survival. Certain frog species avoid this competition by making use of smaller <a href="phytotelma">phytotelma</a>ta (water-filled leaf <a href="wikt%3Aaxil">axils</a> or small woody cavities) as sites for depositing a few tadpoles. While these smaller rearing sites are free from competition, they also lack sufficient nutrients to support a tadpole without parental assistance. Frog species that changed from the use of larger to smaller phytotelmata have evolved a strategy of providing their offspring with nutritive but unfertilized eggs. The female <a href="strawberry%20poison-dart%20frog">strawberry poison-dart frog</a> ("Oophaga pumilio") lays her eggs on the forest floor. The male frog guards them from predation and carries water in his cloaca to keep them moist. When they hatch, the female moves the tadpoles on her back to a water-holding <a href="bromeliad">bromeliad</a> or other similar water body, depositing just one in each location. She visits them regularly and feeds them by laying one or two unfertilized eggs in the phytotelma, continuing to do this until the young are large enough to undergo metamorphosis. The <a href="granular%20poison%20frog">granular poison frog</a> ("Oophaga granulifera") looks after its tadpoles in a similar way.

Many other diverse forms of parental care are seen in frogs. The tiny male "<a href="Colostethus%20subpunctatus">Colostethus subpunctatus</a>" stands guard over his egg cluster, laid under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, he transports the tadpoles on his back to a temporary pool, where he partially immerses himself in the water and one or more tadpoles drop off. He then moves on to another pool. The male <a href="common%20midwife%20toad">common midwife toad</a> ("Alytes obstetricans") carries the eggs around with him attached to his hind legs. He keeps them damp in dry weather by immersing himself in a pond, and prevents them from getting too wet in soggy vegetation by raising his hindquarters. After three to six weeks, he travels to a pond and the eggs hatch into tadpoles. The <a href="tungara%20frog">tungara frog</a> ("Physalaemus pustulosus") builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs from predation. The foam is made from <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="lectin">lectin</a>s, and seems to have antimicrobial properties. Several pairs of frogs may form a colonial nest on a previously built raft. The eggs are laid in the centre, followed by alternate layers of foam and eggs, finishing with a foam capping.

Some frogs protect their offspring inside their own bodies. Both male and female <a href="pouched%20frog">pouched frog</a>s ("Assa darlingtoni") guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female <a href="gastric-brooding%20frog">gastric-brooding frog</a> ("Rheobatrachus" sp.) from <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting <a href="stomach%20acid">stomach acid</a>. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female <a href="Darwin%27s%20frog">Darwin's frog</a> ("Rhinoderma darwinii") from <a href="Chile">Chile</a> lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.

At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless because of their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of defensive structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.

The skin of many frogs contains mild toxic substances called <a href="bufotoxin">bufotoxin</a>s to make them unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the <a href="parotoid%20gland">parotoid gland</a>s, located on the sides of their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies. These glands secrete mucus and a range of toxins that make frogs slippery to hold and distasteful or poisonous. If the noxious effect is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape. If the effect develops more slowly, the predator may learn to avoid that species in future. Poisonous frogs tend to advertise their toxicity with bright colours, an adaptive strategy known as <a href="aposematism">aposematism</a>. The poison dart frogs in the family Dendrobatidae do this. They are typically red, orange, or yellow, often with contrasting black markings on their bodies. "<a href="Allobates%20zaparo">Allobates zaparo</a>" is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of two different toxic species with which it shares a common range in an effort to deceive predators. Other species, such as the <a href="European%20Fire-bellied%20Toad">European fire-bellied toad</a> ("Bombina bombina"), have their warning colour underneath. They "flash" this when attacked, adopting a pose that exposes the vivid colouring on their bellies.
Some frogs, such as the <a href="poison%20dart%20frog">poison dart frog</a>s, are especially toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their <a href="Dart%20%28missile%29">weapons</a> for hunting, although few species are toxic enough to be used for this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America ("<a href="Eleutherodactylus">Eleutherodactylus gaigei</a>" and "<a href="Lithodytes%20lineatus">Lithodytes lineatus</a>") <a href="Batesian%20mimicry">mimic</a> the colouration of dart poison frogs for self-protection. Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat. Others, such as the Australian <a href="corroboree%20frog">corroboree frog</a>s ("Pseudophryne corroboree" and "Pseudophryne pengilleyi"), can synthesize the <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s themselves. The chemicals involved may be irritants, <a href="hallucinogen">hallucinogen</a>s, <a href="seizure">convulsants</a>, <a href="neurotoxin">nerve poisons</a> or <a href="vasoconstrictor">vasoconstrictor</a>s. Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.

Some frogs use bluff or deception. The European common toad ("Bufo bufo") adopts a characteristic stance when attacked, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. The bullfrog ("Rana catesbeiana") crouches down with eyes closed and head tipped forward when threatened. This places the parotoid glands in the most effective position, the other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and the most vulnerable parts of its body are protected. Another tactic used by some frogs is to "scream", the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator. The gray tree frog ("<a href="Hyla%20versicolor">Hyla versicolor</a>") makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew "<a href="Blarina%20brevicauda">Blarina brevicauda</a>". Although toads are avoided by many predators, the <a href="Common%20Garter%20Snake">common garter snake</a> ("Thamnophis sirtalis") regularly feeds on them. The strategy employed by juvenile American toads ("<a href="Bufo%20americanus">Bufo americanus</a>") on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile. This is usually successful, with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected. If it is encountered by the snake's head, however, the toad hops away before crouching defensively.

Frogs live on all the continents except Antarctica, but they are not present on certain islands, especially those far away from continental land masses. Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers. Usually, a greater diversity of frogs occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe. Some frogs inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus "<a href="Cyclorana">Cyclorana</a>" bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to <a href="aestivation">aestivate</a> during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other frogs, so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The <a href="wood%20frog">wood frog</a> ("Rana sylvatica"), whose habitat extends into the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a>, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.

In 2006, of 4,035 species of amphibians that depend on water during some lifecycle stage, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened. This is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which evidence was insufficient to assess their status. Frog populations have declined dramatically since the 1950s. More than one-third of frog species are considered to be threatened with <a href="extinction">extinction</a>, and more than 120 species are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. Among these species are the gastric-brooding frogs of Australia and the <a href="golden%20toad">golden toad</a> of Costa Rica. The latter is of particular concern to scientists because it inhabited the pristine <a href="Monteverde%20Cloud%20Forest%20Reserve">Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve</a> and its population crashed in 1987, along with about 20 other frog species in the area. This could not be linked directly to human activities, such as deforestation, and was outside the range of normal fluctuations in population size. Elsewhere, habitat loss is a significant cause of frog population decline, as are pollutants, climate change, increased <a href="ultraviolet">UVB</a> radiation, and the introduction of <a href="Indigenous%20%28ecology%29">non-native</a> predators and competitors. A Canadian study conducted in 2006 suggested heavy traffic in their environment was a larger threat to frog populations than was habitat loss. Emerging infectious diseases, including <a href="chytridiomycosis">chytridiomycosis</a> and <a href="ranavirus">ranavirus</a>, are also devastating populations.

Many environmental scientists believe amphibians, including frogs, are good biological <a href="indicator%20species">indicators</a> of broader <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> health because of their intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults). It appears that species with both aquatic eggs and larvae are most affected by the decline, while those with direct development are the most resistant.
<a href="Frog%20mutations%20and%20genetic%20defects">Frog mutations and genetic defects</a> have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes have been identified or hypothesized, including an increase in <a href="Ultraviolet">ultraviolet radiation</a> affecting the spawn on the surface of ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the <a href="trematode">trematode</a> "<a href="Ribeiroia%20ondatrae">Ribeiroia ondatrae</a>". Probably all these are involved in a complex way as <a href="stressor">stressor</a>s, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An increase in the number of frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the <a href="Planorbidae">ramshorn snail</a> and several intermediate hosts such as birds.

In a few cases, captive breeding programs have been established and have largely been successful. The <a href="World%20Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums">World Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> named 2008 as the "Year of the Frog" in order to draw attention to the conservation issues faced by them.

The <a href="cane%20toad">cane toad</a> ("Bufo marinus") is a very adaptable species native to South and Central America. In the 1930s, it was introduced into Puerto Rico, and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region, as a <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a> agent. In 1935, 3000 toads were liberated in the <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a> fields of Queensland, Australia, in an attempt to control <a href="cane%20beetle">cane beetle</a>s such as "Dermolepida albohirtum", the larvae of which damage and kill the canes. Initial results in many of these countries were positive, but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments. They bred freely, competed with native frog species, ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates, had few predators in their adopted habitats, and poisoned pets, carnivorous birds, and mammals. In many of these countries, they are now regarded both as pests and <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them.

<a href="Frog%20legs">Frog legs</a> are eaten by humans in many parts of the world. French "cuisses de grenouille" or frog legs dish is a traditional dish particularly served in the region of the <a href="Dombes">Dombes</a> ("<a href="d%C3%A9partement%20in%20France">département</a>" of <a href="Ain">Ain</a>). The dish is also common in French-speaking parts of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, particularly the <a href="Cajun">Cajun</a> areas of Southern Louisiana as well as <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, United States. In Asia, frog legs are consumed in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. <a href="Chinese%20edible%20frog">Chinese edible frog</a> and <a href="Pig%20Frog">pig frogs</a> are farmed and consumed on a large scale in some areas of China. Frog legs are part of Chinese <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> and <a href="Cantonese%20cuisine">Cantonese cuisine</a>. In <a href="Indonesian%20cuisine">Indonesia</a>, frog-leg soup is known as "<a href="swikee">swikee</a>" or "swike". Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of frog meat, exporting more than 5,000 tonnes of frog meat each year, mostly to France, Belgium and Luxembourg.

Originally, they were supplied from local wild populations, but overexploitation led to a diminution in the supply. This resulted in the development of <a href="Aquaculture">frog farming</a> and a global trade in frogs. The main importing countries are France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United States, while the chief exporting nations are Indonesia and China. The annual global trade in the <a href="American%20bullfrog">American bullfrog</a> ("Rana catesbeiana"), mostly farmed in China, varies between 1200 and 2400 tonnes.

The <a href="Leptodactylus%20fallax">mountain chicken frog</a>, so-called as it tastes of chicken is now endangered, in part due to human consumption and was a major food choice of the <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a>ns.

Coon, possum, partridges, prairie hen, and frogs were among the fare <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> recorded as part of American cuisine.

Frogs are used for <a href="dissection">dissection</a>s in high school and university anatomy classes, often first being injected with coloured substances to enhance contrasts among the <a href="biological%20system">biological system</a>s. This practice is declining due to <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a> concerns, and "digital frogs" are now available for virtual dissection.

Frogs have served as <a href="Animal%20testing">experimental animals</a> throughout the history of science. Eighteenth-century biologist <a href="Luigi%20Galvani">Luigi Galvani</a> discovered the link between <a href="electricity">electricity</a> and the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a <a href="Stannius%20ligature">Stannius ligature</a> to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The <a href="African%20clawed%20frog">African clawed frog</a> or platanna ("Xenopus laevis") was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests in the first half of the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>, a discovery made by English zoologist <a href="Lancelot%20Hogben">Lancelot Hogben</a>. This is because a hormone, <a href="human%20chorionic%20gonadotropin">human chorionic gonadotropin</a>, is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, <a href="Robert%20William%20Briggs">Robert Briggs</a> and <a href="Thomas%20J.%20King">Thomas J. King</a> cloned a frog by <a href="somatic%20cell%20nuclear%20transfer">somatic cell nuclear transfer</a>. This same technique was later used to create <a href="Dolly%20%28sheep%29">Dolly the sheep</a>, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.

Frogs are used in cloning research and other branches of <a href="embryology">embryology</a>. Although alternative pregnancy tests have been developed, biologists continue to use "Xenopus" as a <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> in <a href="developmental%20biology">developmental biology</a> because their embryos are large and easy to manipulate, they are readily obtainable, and can easily be kept in the laboratory. "Xenopus laevis" is increasingly being displaced by its smaller relative, "<a href="Xenopus%20tropicalis">Xenopus tropicalis</a>", which reaches its reproductive age in five months rather than the one to two years for "X. laevis", thus facilitating faster studies across generations. The <a href="genome">genome</a> of "X. tropicalis" is being sequenced.

Because frog toxins are extraordinarily diverse, they have raised the interest of biochemists as a "natural pharmacy". The alkaloid <a href="epibatidine">epibatidine</a>, a painkiller 200 times more potent than <a href="morphine">morphine</a> is made by some species of poison dart frogs, although it can also cause death by lung paralysis. Other chemicals isolated from the skins of frogs may offer resistance to <a href="HIV">HIV</a> infection. Dart poisons are under active investigation for their potential as therapeutic drugs.

It has long been suspected that pre-Columbian <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>ns used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a <a href="hallucinogen">hallucinogen</a>, but more likely they used substances secreted by the <a href="Colorado%20River%20toad">Colorado River toad</a> ("Bufo alvarius"). These contain <a href="bufotenin">bufotenin</a> (5-MeO-DMT), a <a href="psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive compound</a> that has been used in modern times as a <a href="recreational%20drug">recreational drug</a>. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. Illicit drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an <a href="urban%20myth">urban myth</a>.
Exudations from the skin of the <a href="golden%20poison%20frog">golden poison frog</a> ("Phyllobates terribilis") are traditionally used by native Colombians to poison the darts they use for hunting. The tip of the projectile is rubbed over the back of the frog and the dart is launched from a <a href="blowgun">blowgun</a>. The combination of the two alkaloid toxins <a href="batrachotoxin">batrachotoxin</a> and <a href="homobatrachotoxin">homobatrachotoxin</a> is so powerful, one frog contains enough poison to kill an estimated 22,000 mice. Two other species, the <a href="Kokoe%20poison%20dart%20frog">Kokoe poison dart frog</a> ("Phyllobates aurotaenia") and the <a href="black-legged%20dart%20frog">black-legged dart frog</a> ("Phyllobates bicolor") are also used for this purpose. These are less toxic and less abundant than the golden poison frog. They are impaled on pointed sticks and may be heated over a fire to maximise the quantity of poison that can be transferred to the dart.

Frogs feature prominently in <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>s, and popular culture. They tend to be portrayed as benign, ugly, and clumsy, but with hidden talents. Examples include <a href="Michigan%20J.%20Frog">Michigan J.

The <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> cartoon "<a href="One%20Froggy%20Evening">One Froggy Evening</a>" features Michigan J. Frog, that will only dance and sing for the demolition worker who opens his time capsule, but will not perform in public. "The Frog Prince" is a fairy tale about a frog that turns into a handsome prince after he has rescued a princess's golden ball and she has taken him into her palace. Kermit the Frog is a conscientious and disciplined character from "<a href="The%20Muppet%20Show">The Muppet Show</a>" and "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>"; while openly friendly and greatly talented, he is often portrayed as cringing at the fanciful behavior of more flamboyant characters.

The <a href="Moche%20%28culture%29">Moche</a> people of ancient <a href="Peru">Peru</a> worshipped animals, and often depicted frogs in their art. In <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, local legend held that good fortune would come to anyone who spotted a <a href="Panamanian%20golden%20frog">Panamanian golden frog</a>.

Texas Revolution

The Texas Revolution (October 2, 1835 – April 21, 1836) was a rebellion of colonists from the United States and <a href="Tejano">Tejano</a>s (Texas Mexicans) in putting up armed resistance to the <a href="Centralist%20Republic%20of%20Mexico">centralist government</a> of Mexico. While the uprising was part of a larger one that included other provinces opposed to the regime of President <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a>, the Mexican government believed the United States had instigated the Texas insurrection with the goal of annexation. The Mexican Congress passed the <a href="Tornel%20Decree">Tornel Decree</a>, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops "will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag." Only the province of Texas succeeded in breaking with Mexico, establishing the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>, and eventually being annexed by the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

The revolution began in October 1835, after a decade of political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the increasingly large population of American settlers in Texas. The Mexican government had become increasingly <a href="centralized%20government">centralized</a> and the rights of its citizens had become increasingly curtailed, particularly regarding immigration from the United States. Colonists and Tejanos disagreed on whether the ultimate goal was independence or a return to the <a href="1824%20Constitution%20of%20Mexico">Mexican Constitution of 1824</a>. While delegates at the <a href="Consultation%20%28Texas%29">Consultation</a> (provisional government) debated the war's motives, <a href="Texians">Texians</a> and a flood of volunteers from the United States defeated the small garrisons of Mexican soldiers by mid-December 1835. The Consultation declined to declare independence and installed an interim government, whose infighting led to political paralysis and a dearth of effective governance in Texas. An ill-conceived proposal to <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">invade Matamoros</a> siphoned much-needed volunteers and provisions from the fledgling <a href="Texian%20Army">Texian Army</a>. In March 1836, a second <a href="convention%20of%201836">political convention</a> declared independence and appointed leadership for the new <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>.

Determined to avenge Mexico's honor, Santa Anna vowed to personally retake Texas. His Army of Operations entered Texas in mid-February 1836 and found the Texians completely unprepared. Mexican General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> led a contingent of troops on the <a href="Goliad%20Campaign">Goliad Campaign</a> up the Texas coast, defeating all Texian troops in his path and executing most of those who surrendered. Santa Anna led a larger force to <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio de Béxar</a> (or Béxar), where his troops defeated the Texian garrison in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">Battle of the Alamo</a>, killing almost all of the defenders. 

A newly created Texian army under the command of <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> was constantly on the move, while terrified civilians fled with the army, in a melee known as the <a href="Runaway%20Scrape">Runaway Scrape</a>. On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing on the <a href="Brazos%20River">Brazos River</a>, and for the next two weeks, the Texians received rigorous military training. Becoming complacent and underestimating the strength of his foes, Santa Anna further subdivided his troops. On April 21, Houston's army staged a surprise assault on Santa Anna and his vanguard force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a>. The Mexican troops were quickly routed, and vengeful Texians executed many who tried to surrender. Santa Anna was taken hostage; in exchange for his life, he ordered the Mexican army to retreat south of the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>. Mexico refused to recognize the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two countries continued into the 1840s. The <a href="Texas%20annexation">annexation of Texas</a> as the 28th state of the United States, in 1845, led directly to the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>.

After a failed attempt by France to <a href="French%20colonization%20of%20Texas">colonize Texas</a> in the late 17th century, Spain developed a plan to settle the region. On its southern edge, along the <a href="Medina%20River">Medina</a> and <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a>s, <a href="Spanish%20Texas">Spanish Texas</a> was bordered by the province of <a href="Coahuila">Coahuila</a>. On the east, Texas bordered <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana</a>. Following the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> of 1803, the United States also claimed the land west of the <a href="Sabine%20River%20%28Texas%E2%80%93Louisiana%29">Sabine River</a>, all the way to the Rio Grande. From 1812 to 1813 anti-Spanish republicans and U.S. <a href="filibuster%20%28military%29">filibusters</a> rebelled against the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a> in what is known today as the <a href="Guti%C3%A9rrez%E2%80%93Magee%20Expedition">Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition</a> during the <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">Mexican War of Independence</a>. They won battles in the beginning and captured many Texas cities from the Spanish that led to a declaration of independence of the state of Texas as part of the Mexican Republic on April 17, 1813. The new Texas government and army met their doom in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Medina">Battle of Medina</a> in August 1813, 20 miles south of <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, where 1,300 of the 1,400 rebel army were killed in battle or executed shortly afterwards by royalist soldiers. It was the deadliest single battle in Texas history. 300 republican government officials in San Antonio were captured and executed by the Spanish royalists shortly after the battle. What is significant is a Spanish royalist lieutenant named <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> fought in this battle and followed his superiors' orders to take no prisoners. Another interesting note is two founding fathers of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> and future signers of the <a href="Texas%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Texas Declaration of Independence</a> in 1836, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Navarro">José Antonio Navarro</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Francisco%20Ruiz">José Francisco Ruiz</a>, took part in the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition. Although the United States officially renounced that claim as part of the <a href="Transcontinental%20Treaty">Transcontinental Treaty</a> with Spain in 1819, many Americans continued to believe that Texas should belong to their nation, and over the next decade the United States made several offers to purchase the region.

Following the <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">Mexican War of Independence</a>, Texas became part of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. Under the <a href="1824%20Constitution%20of%20Mexico">Constitution of 1824</a>, which defined the country as a <a href="federal%20republic">federal republic</a>, the provinces of Texas and Coahuila were combined to become the state <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. Texas was granted only a single seat in the state legislature, which met in <a href="Saltillo">Saltillo</a>, hundreds of miles away. After months of grumbling by "<a href="Tejano">Tejano</a>s" (Mexican-born residents of Texas) outraged at the loss of their political autonomy, state officials agreed to make Texas a <a href="Department%20%28country%20subdivision%29">department</a> of the new state, with a "de facto" capital in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio de Béxar</a>.

Texas was very sparsely populated, with fewer than 3,500 residents, and only about 200 soldiers, which made it extremely vulnerable to attacks by native tribes and American <a href="Filibuster%20%28military%29">filibusters</a>. In the hopes that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the bankrupt Mexican government liberalized immigration policies for the region. Finally able to settle legally in Texas, <a href="Anglo%23United%20States">Anglo</a>s from the United States soon vastly outnumbered the "Tejanos". Most of the immigrants came from the <a href="southern%20United%20States">southern United States</a>. Many were slave owners, and most brought with them significant prejudices against other races, attitudes often applied to the "Tejanos". Mexico's official religion was Roman Catholicism, yet the majority of the immigrants were Protestants who distrusted Catholics.
Mexican authorities became increasingly concerned about the stability of the region. The colonies teetered at the brink of revolt in 1829, after Mexico abolished slavery. In response, President <a href="Anastasio%20Bustamante">Anastasio Bustamante</a> implemented the <a href="Law%20of%20April%206%2C%201830">Laws of April 6, 1830</a>, which, among other things, prohibited further immigration to Texas from the United States, increased taxes, and reiterated the ban on slavery. Settlers simply circumvented or ignored the laws. By 1834, an estimated 30,000 Anglos lived in Coahuila y Tejas, compared to only 7,800 Mexican-born residents. By the end of 1835, almost 5,000 enslaved Africans and African Americans lived in Texas, making up 13 percent of the non-Indian population.

In 1832, <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> led a revolt to overthrow Bustamante. Texians, or English-speaking settlers, used the rebellion as an excuse to take up arms. By mid-August, all Mexican troops had been expelled from east Texas. Buoyed by their success, Texians held two political conventions to persuade Mexican authorities to weaken the Laws of April 6, 1830. In November 1833, the Mexican government attempted to address some of the concerns, repealing some sections of the law and granting the colonists further concessions, including increased representation in the state legislature. <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>, who had brought the first American settlers to Texas, wrote to a friend that "Every evil complained of has been remedied." Mexican authorities were quietly watchful, concerned that the colonists were maneuvering towards secession.

Santa Anna soon revealed himself to be a centralist, transitioning the Mexican government to a <a href="centralized%20government">centralized government</a>. In 1835, the 1824 Constitution was overturned; state legislatures were dismissed, militias disbanded. Federalists throughout Mexico were appalled. Citizens in the states of <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a> and <a href="Zacatecas">Zacatecas</a> took up arms. After Santa Anna's troops subdued the rebellion in Zacatecas in May, he gave his troops two days to pillage the city; over 2,000 noncombatants were killed. The governor of Coahuila y Tejas, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Viesca">Agustín Viesca</a>, refused to dissolve the legislature, instead ordering that the session reconvene in Béxar, further from the influence of the Mexican army. Although prominent "Tejano" <a href="Juan%20Segu%C3%ADn">Juan Seguín</a> raised a militia company to assist the governor, the Béxar "ayuntamiento" (city council) ordered him not to interfere, and Viesca was arrested before he reached Texas.

Public opinion in Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating complete independence for Texas. After several men staged a minor revolt against customs duties in <a href="Anahuac%2C%20Texas">Anahuac</a> in June, local leaders began calling for a public meeting to determine whether a majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo. Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step towards revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the <a href="Consultation%20%28Texas%29">Consultation</a>, scheduled for October 15.

As early as April 1835, military commanders in Texas began requesting reinforcements, fearing the citizens would revolt. Mexico was ill-prepared for a large civil war, but continued unrest in Texas posed a significant danger to the power of Santa Anna and of Mexico. If the people of Coahuila also took up arms, Mexico faced losing a large portion of its territory. Without the northeastern province to act as a buffer, it was likely that United States influence would spread, and the Mexican territories of <a href="Santa%20Fe%20de%20Nuevo%20M%C3%A9xico">Nuevo Mexico</a> and <a href="Alta%20California">Alta California</a> would be at risk of future American encroachment. Santa Anna had no wish to tangle with the United States, and he knew that the unrest needed to be subdued before the United States could be convinced to become involved. In early September, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Perfecto%20de%20Cos">Martín Perfecto de Cos</a>, to lead 500 soldiers to Texas to quell any potential rebellion. Cos and his men landed at the port of <a href="Copano%2C%20Texas">Copano</a> on September 20. Austin called on all municipalities to raise militias to defend themselves.

In the early 1830s, the army loaned the citizens of <a href="Gonzales%2C%20Texas">Gonzales</a> a small cannon for protection against Indian raids. After a Mexican soldier bludgeoned a Gonzales resident on September 10, 1835, tensions rose even further, and Mexican authorities felt it unwise to leave the settlers with a weapon. Colonel <a href="Domingo%20de%20Ugartechea">Domingo de Ugartechea</a>, commander of all Mexican military forces in Texas, sent a small detachment of troops to retrieve the cannon. After settlers escorted the group from town without the cannon, Ugartechea sent 100 <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s with Lieutenant <a href="Francisco%20de%20Casta%C3%B1eda">Francisco de Castañeda</a> to demand compliance, with orders to avoid force if possible.

Many of the settlers believed Mexican authorities were manufacturing an excuse to attack the town and eliminate the militia. Texians stalled Castañeda's attempts to negotiate the cannon's return for several days as they waited for reinforcements from other colonies. In the early hours of October 2, approximately 140 Texian volunteers attacked Castañeda's force. After a brief skirmish, Castañeda requested a meeting with Texian leader <a href="John%20Henry%20Moore%20%28Texas%29">John Henry Moore</a>. Castañeda revealed that he shared their federalist leanings, but that he was honor-bound to follow orders. As Moore returned to camp, the Texians raised a homemade white banner with an image of the cannon painted in black in the center, over the words "<a href="Come%20and%20take%20it">Come and Take It</a>". Realizing that he was outnumbered and outgunned, Castañeda led his troops back to Béxar. In this first battle of the revolution, two Mexican soldiers were killed, and one Texian was injured when he fell off his horse. Although the event was, as characterized by historian <a href="William%20C.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">William C. Davis</a>, "an inconsequential skirmish in which one side did not try to fight", Texians soon declared it a victory over Mexican troops. News of the skirmish spread throughout the United States, encouraging many adventurers to come to Texas to join the fight.

Volunteers continued to arrive in Gonzales. On October 11, the troops unanimously elected Austin, who had no official military experience, the leader of the group he had dubbed the <a href="Texian%20Army">Army of the People</a>. From the beginning, the volunteer army proved to have little discipline. Austin's first official order was to remind his men that they were expected to obey their commanding officers. Buoyed by their victory, the Texians were determined to drive the Mexican army out of Texas, and they began preparing to march to Béxar.

After learning that Texian troops had attacked Castañeda at Gonzales, Cos made haste for Béxar. Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on <a href="Presidio%20La%20Bah%C3%ADa">Presidio La Bahía</a> in <a href="Goliad%2C%20Texas">Goliad</a> to kidnap him and steal the $50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 "Tejanos", <a href="battle%20of%20Goliad">stormed the presidio</a>. The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.

The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain <a href="Philip%20Dimmitt">Philip Dimmitt</a>, who immediately sent all the local "Tejano" volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under <a href="Ira%20Westover">Ira Westover</a> to engage the Mexican garrison at <a href="Fort%20Lipantitl%C3%A1n">Fort Lipantitlán</a>, near <a href="San%20Patricio%2C%20Texas">San Patricio</a>. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the "ayuntamiento". After a <a href="battle%20of%20Lipantitl%C3%A1n">thirty-minute skirmish</a>, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.

On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca. After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison, as many supported the governor. Dimmitt declared martial law and soon alienated most of the local residents. Over the next few months, the area between Goliad and <a href="Refugio%2C%20Texas">Refugio</a> descended into civil war. Goliad native <a href="Carlos%20de%20la%20Garza%20%28Texas%29">Carlos de la Garza</a> led a guerrilla warfare campaign against the Texian troops. According to historian Paul Lack, the Texian "antiguerilla tactics did too little to crush out opposition but quite enough to sway the uncommitted toward the centralists."

While Dimmitt supervised the Texian forces along the Gulf Coast, Austin led his men towards Béxar to engage Cos and his troops. Confident that they would quickly rout the Mexican troops, many Consultation delegates chose to join the military. Unable to reach a quorum, the Consultation was postponed until November 1. On October 16, the Texians paused from Béxar. Austin sent a messenger to Cos giving the requirements the Texians would need to lay down their arms and "avoid the sad consequences of the Civil War which unfortunately threatens Texas". Cos replied that Mexico would not "yield to the dictates of foreigners".
The approximately 650 Mexican troops quickly built barricades throughout the town. Within days the Texian army, about 450 strong, initiated a <a href="siege%20of%20B%C3%A9xar">siege of Béxar</a>, and gradually moved their camp nearer Béxar. On October 27, an advance party led by <a href="James%20Bowie">James Bowie</a> and <a href="James%20Fannin">James Fannin</a> chose <a href="Mission%20Concepci%C3%B3n">Mission Concepción</a> as the next campsite and sent for the rest of the Texian army. On learning that the Texians were temporarily divided, Ugartechea led troops to engage Bowie and Fannin's men. The Mexican cavalry was unable to fight effectively in the wooded, riverbottom terrain, and the weapons of the Mexican infantry had a much shorter range than those of the Texians. After three Mexican infantry attacks were repulsed, Ugartechea called for a retreat. One Texian soldier had died, and between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed. Although <a href="Texas%20Tech%20University">Texas Tech University</a> <a href="professor%20emeritus">professor emeritus</a> <a href="Alwyn%20Barr">Alwyn Barr</a> noted that the <a href="battle%20of%20Concepci%C3%B3n">battle of Concepción</a> "should have taught ... lessons on Mexican courage and the value of a good defensive position", Texas history expert <a href="Stephen%20Hardin">Stephen Hardin</a> believes that "the relative ease of the victory at Concepción instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies".

As the weather turned colder and rations grew smaller, groups of Texians began to leave, most without permission. Morale was boosted on November 18, when the first group of volunteers from the United States, the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Greys">New Orleans Greys</a>, joined the Texian army. Unlike the majority of the Texian volunteers, the Greys looked like soldiers, with uniforms, well-maintained rifles, adequate ammunition, and some semblance of discipline.

After Austin resigned his command to become a commissioner to the United States, soldiers elected <a href="Edward%20Burleson">Edward Burleson</a> as their new commander. On November 26, Burleson received word that a Mexican <a href="packhorse">pack train</a> of mules and horses, accompanied by 50–100 Mexican soldiers, was within of Béxar. After a near mutiny, Burleson sent Bowie and William H. Jack with cavalry and infantry to intercept the supplies. In the subsequent skirmish, the Mexican forces were forced to retreat to Béxar, leaving their cargo behind. To the disappointment of the Texians, the saddlebags contained only fodder for the horses; for this reason the battle was later known as the <a href="Grass%20Fight">Grass Fight</a>. Although the victory briefly uplifted the Texian troops, morale continued to fall as the weather turned colder and the men grew bored. After several proposals to take Béxar by force were voted down by the Texian troops, on December 4 Burleson proposed that the army lift the siege and retreat to Goliad until spring. In a last effort to avoid a retreat, Colonel <a href="Ben%20Milam">Ben Milam</a> personally recruited units to participate in an attack. The following morning, Milam and Colonel <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a> led several hundred Texians into the city. Over the next four days, Texians fought their way from house to house towards the fortified plazas near the center of town.

Cos received 650 reinforcements on December 8, but to his dismay most of them were raw recruits, including many convicts still in chains. Instead of being helpful, the reinforcements were mainly a drain on the dwindling food supplies. Seeing few other options, on December 9, Cos and the bulk of his men withdrew into the <a href="Alamo%20Mission">Alamo Mission</a> on the outskirts of Béxar. Cos presented a plan for a counterattack; cavalry officers believed that they would be surrounded by Texians and refused their orders. Possibly 175 soldiers from four of the cavalry companies left the mission and rode south; Mexican officers later claimed the men misunderstood their orders and were not deserting. The following morning, Cos surrendered. Under the terms of the surrender, Cos and his men would leave Texas and no longer fight against supporters of the Constitution of 1824. With his departure, there was no longer an organized garrison of Mexican troops in Texas, and many of the Texians believed that the war was over. Burleson resigned his leadership of the army on December 15 and returned to his home. Many of the men did likewise, and Johnson assumed command of the 400 soldiers who remained.

According to Barr, the large number of American volunteers in Béxar "contributed to the Mexican view that Texian opposition stemmed from outside influences". In reality, of the 1,300 men who volunteered to fight for the Texian army in October and November 1835, only 150–200 arrived from the United States after October 2. The rest were residents of Texas with an average immigration date of 1830. Volunteers came from every municipality, including those that were partially occupied by Mexican forces. However, as residents returned to their homes following Cos's surrender, the Texian army composition changed dramatically. Of the volunteers serving from January through March 1836, 78 percent had arrived from the United States after October 2, 1835.

The Consultation finally convened on November 3 in <a href="San%20Felipe%20de%20Austin">San Felipe</a> with 58 of the 98 elected delegates. After days of bitter debate, the delegates voted to create a provisional government based on the principles of the Constitution of 1824. Although they did not declare independence, the delegates insisted they would not rejoin Mexico until federalism had been reinstated. The new government would consist of a governor and a General Council, with one representative from each municipality. Under the assumption that these two branches would cooperate, there was no <a href="Separation%20of%20powers">system of checks and balances</a>.

On November 13, delegates voted to create a <a href="regular%20army">regular army</a> and named <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> its commander-in-chief. In an effort to attract volunteers from the United States, soldiers would be granted land bounties. This provision was significant, as all public land was owned by the state or the federal government, indicating that the delegates expected Texas to eventually declare independence. Houston was given no authority over the volunteer army led by Austin, which predated the Consultation. Houston was also appointed to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs. Three men, including Austin, were asked to go to the United States to gather money, volunteers, and supplies. The delegates elected <a href="Henry%20Smith%20%28Texas%20Governor%29">Henry Smith</a> as governor. On November 14, the Consultation adjourned, leaving Smith and the Council in charge.

The new Texas government had no funds, so the military was granted the authority to impress supplies. This policy soon resulted in an almost universal hatred of the Council, as food and supplies became scarce, especially in the areas around Goliad and Béxar, where Texian troops were stationed. Few of the volunteers agreed to join Houston's regular army. The "<a href="Telegraph%20and%20Texas%20Register">Telegraph and Texas Register</a>" noted that "some are not willing, under the present government, to do any duty ... That our government is bad, all acknowledge, and no one will deny."

Leaders in Texas continued to debate whether the army was fighting for independence or a return to federalism. On December 22, Texian soldiers stationed at La Bahía issued the <a href="Goliad%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Goliad Declaration of Independence</a>. Unwilling to decide the matter themselves, the Council called for another election, for delegates to the <a href="Convention%20of%201836">Convention of 1836</a>. The Council specifically noted that all free white males could vote, as well as Mexicans who did not support centralism. Smith tried to veto the latter requirement, as he believed even "Tejanos" with federalist leanings should be denied suffrage.

Leading federalists in Mexico, including former governor Viesca, <a href="Lorenzo%20de%20Zavala">Lorenzo de Zavala</a>, and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Mex%C3%ADa">José Antonio Mexía</a>, were advocating a plan to attack centralist troops in <a href="Matamoros%2C%20Tamaulipas">Matamoros</a>. Council members were taken with the idea of a <a href="Matamoros%20Expedition">Matamoros Expedition</a>. They hoped it would inspire other federalist states to revolt and keep the bored Texian troops from deserting the army. Most importantly, it would move the war zone outside Texas. The Council officially approved the plan on December 25, and on December 30 Johnson and his aide Dr. <a href="James%20Grant%20%28Texas%29">James Grant</a> took the bulk of the army and almost all of the supplies to Goliad to prepare for the expedition. Historian Stuart Reid posits that Grant was a British secret agent, and that his plan to take Matamoros, and thus tie Texas more tightly to Mexico, may have been an unofficial scheme to advance British interests in the region.

Petty bickering between Smith and the Council members increased dramatically, and on January 9, 1836, Smith threatened to dismiss the Council unless they agreed to revoke their approval of the Matamoros Expedition. Two days later the Council voted to impeach Smith and named <a href="James%20W.%20Robinson%20%28Texas%20and%20California%29">James W. Robinson</a> the Acting Governor. It was unclear whether either side actually had the authority to dismiss the other. By this point, Texas was essentially in anarchy.

Under orders from Smith, Houston successfully dissuaded all but 70 men from continuing to follow Johnson. With his own authority in question following Smith's impeachment, Houston washed his hands of the army and journeyed to <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches</a> to negotiate a treaty with <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> leaders. Houston vowed that Texas would recognize Cherokee claims to land in East Texas as long as the Indians refrained from attacking settlements or assisting the Mexican army. In his absence, Fannin, as the highest-ranking officer active in the regular army, led the men who did not want to go to Matamoros to Goliad.

The Council had neglected to provide specific instructions on how to structure the February vote for convention delegates, leaving it up to each municipality to determine how to balance the desires of the established residents against those of the volunteers newly arrived from the United States. Chaos ensued; in Nacogdoches, the election judge turned back a company of 40 volunteers from Kentucky who had arrived that week. The soldiers drew their weapons; Colonel <a href="Sidney%20Sherman">Sidney Sherman</a> announced that he "had come to Texas to fight for it and had as soon commence in the town of Nacogdoches as elsewhere". Eventually, the troops were allowed to vote. With rumors that Santa Anna was preparing a large army to advance into Texas, rhetoric degenerated into framing the conflict as a race war between Anglos defending their property against, in the words of <a href="David%20G.%20Burnet">David G. Burnet</a>, a "mongrel race of degenerate Spaniards and Indians more depraved than they".

News of the armed uprising at Gonzales reached Santa Anna on October 23. Aside from the ruling elite and members of the army, few in Mexico knew or cared about the revolt. Those with knowledge of the events blamed the Anglos for their unwillingness to conform to the laws and culture of their new country. Anglo immigrants had forced a war on Mexico, and Mexican honor insisted that the usurpers be defeated. Santa Anna transferred his presidential duties to <a href="Miguel%20Barrag%C3%A1n">Miguel Barragán</a> in order to personally lead troops to put an end to the Texian revolt. Santa Anna and his soldiers believed that the Texians would be quickly cowed. The Mexican Secretary of War, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Tornel">José María Tornel</a>, wrote: "The superiority of the Mexican soldier over the mountaineers of Kentucky and the hunters of Missouri is well known. Veterans seasoned by 20 years of wars can't be intimidated by the presence of an army ignorant of the art of war, incapable of discipline, and renowned for insubordination."

At this time, there were only 2,500 soldiers in the Mexican interior. This was not enough to crush a rebellion and provide security—from attacks by both Indians and federalists—throughout the rest of the country. According to author Will Fowler, Santa Anna financed the Texas expedition with three loans; one from the city of <a href="San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD">San Luis Potosí</a>, and the other two loans from individuals Cayetano Rubio and Juan N. Errazo. Santa Anna had guaranteed at least a portion of the repayments with his own financial holdings. He began to assemble a new army, which he dubbed the Army of Operations in Texas. A majority of the troops had been <a href="conscript">conscript</a>ed or were convicts who chose service in the military over jail. The Mexican officers knew that the <a href="Brown%20Bess">Brown Bess</a> muskets they carried lacked the range of the Texian weapons, but Santa Anna was convinced that his superior planning would nonetheless result in an easy victory. Corruption was rampant, and supplies were not plentiful. Almost from the beginning, rations were short, and there were no medical supplies or doctors. Few troops were issued heavy coats or blankets for the winter.

In late December, at Santa Anna's behest, the Mexican Congress passed the <a href="Tornel%20Decree">Tornel Decree</a>, declaring that any foreigners fighting against Mexican troops "will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag." In the early nineteenth century, captured pirates were executed immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican army permission to take no prisoners in the war against the Texians. This information was not widely distributed, and it is unlikely that most of the American recruits serving in the Texian army were aware that there would be no <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners-of-war</a>.

By December 1835, 6,019 soldiers had begun their march towards Texas. Progress was slow. There were not enough mules to transport all of the supplies, and many of the <a href="teamster">teamster</a>s, all civilians, quit when their pay was delayed. The large number of "<a href="soldaderas">soldaderas</a>"—women and children who followed the army—reduced the already scarce supplies. In Saltillo, Cos and his men from Béxar joined Santa Anna's forces. Santa Anna regarded Cos's promise not to take up arms in Texas as meaningless because it had been given to rebels.

From Saltillo, the army had three choices: advance along the coast on the Atascocita Road from Matamoros to Goliad, or march on Béxar from the south, along the Laredo road, or from the west, along the <a href="El%20Camino%20Real%20de%20los%20Tejas%20National%20Historic%20Trail">Camino Real</a>. Santa Anna ordered General <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Urrea">José de Urrea</a> to lead 550 troops to Goliad. Although several of Santa Anna's officers argued that the entire army should advance along the coast, where supplies could be gained via sea, Santa Anna instead focused on Béxar, the political center of Texas and the site of Cos's defeat. His brother-in-law's surrender was seen as a blow to the honor of his family and to Mexico; Santa Anna was determined to restore both. Santa Anna may also have thought Béxar would be easier to defeat, as his spies had informed him that most of the Texian army was along the coast, preparing for the Matamoros Expedition. Santa Anna led the bulk of his men up the Camino Real to approach Béxar from the west, confounding the Texians, who had expected any advancing troops to approach from the south. On February 17, they crossed the Nueces River, officially entering Texas.

Temperatures reached record lows, and by February 13 an estimated of snow had fallen. A large number of the new recruits were from the tropical climate of the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán</a> and had been unable to acclimate to the harsh winter conditions. Some of them died of <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>, and others contracted <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. Soldiers who fell behind were sometimes killed by <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a> raiding parties. Nevertheless, the army continued to march towards Béxar. As they progressed, settlers in their path in <a href="South%20Texas">South Texas</a> evacuated northward. The Mexican army ransacked and occasionally burned the vacant homes. Santa Anna and his commanders received timely intelligence on Texian troop locations, strengths, and plans, from a network of "Tejano" spies organized by de la Garza.

Fewer than 100 Texian soldiers remained at the Alamo Mission in Béxar, under the command of Colonel <a href="James%20C.%20Neill">James C. Neill</a>. Unable to spare the number of men necessary to mount a successful defense of the sprawling facility, in January Houston sent Bowie with 30 men to remove the artillery and destroy the complex. In a letter to Governor Smith, Bowie argued that "the salvation of Texas depends in great measure on keeping Béxar out of the hands of the enemy. It serves as the frontier <a href="picket%20%28military%29">picquet</a> guard, and if it were in the possession of Santa Anna, there is no stronghold from which to repel him in his march towards the Sabine." The letter to Smith ended, "Colonel Neill and myself have come to the solemn resolution that we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy." Few reinforcements were authorized; cavalry officer <a href="William%20B.%20Travis">William B. Travis</a> arrived in Béxar with 30 men on February 3 and five days later, a small group of volunteers arrived, including the famous frontiersman <a href="Davy%20Crockett">Davy Crockett</a>. On February 11, Neill left to recruit additional reinforcements and gather supplies. In his absence, Travis and Bowie shared command.

When scouts brought word on February 23 that the Mexican advance guard was in sight, the unprepared Texians gathered what food they could find in town and fell back to the Alamo. By late afternoon, Béxar was occupied by about 1,500 Mexican troops, who quickly raised a blood-red flag signifying <a href="no%20quarter">no quarter</a>. For the next 13 days, the Mexican army <a href="Siege%20of%20the%20Alamo">besieged the Alamo</a>. Several small skirmishes gave the defenders much-needed optimism, but had little real impact. Bowie fell ill on February 24, leaving Travis in sole command of the Texian forces. The same day, Travis sent messengers with a letter <a href="To%20the%20People%20of%20Texas%20%26amp%3B%20All%20Americans%20in%20the%20World">To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World</a>, begging for reinforcements and vowing "victory or death"; this letter was reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe. Texian and American volunteers began to gather in Gonzales, waiting for Fannin to arrive and lead them to reinforce the Alamo. After days of indecision, on February 26 Fannin prepared to march his 300 troops to the Alamo; they turned back the next day. Fewer than 100 Texian reinforcements reached the fort.

Approximately 1,000 Mexican reinforcements arrived on March 3. The following day, a local woman, likely Bowie's relative <a href="Juana%20Navarro%20Alsbury">Juana Navarro Alsbury</a>, was rebuffed by Santa Anna when she attempted to negotiate a surrender for the Alamo defenders. This visit increased Santa Anna's impatience, and he scheduled an assault for early on March 6. Many of his officers were against the plan; they preferred to wait until the artillery had further damaged the Alamo's walls and the defenders were forced to surrender. Santa Anna was convinced that a decisive victory would improve morale and sound a strong message to those still agitating in the interior and elsewhere in Texas.
In the early hours of March 6, the Mexican army attacked the fort. Troops from Béxar were excused from the front lines, so that they would not be forced to fight their families and friends. In the initial moments of the assault the Mexican troops were at a disadvantage. Although their column formation allowed only the front rows of soldiers to fire safely, inexperienced recruits in the back also discharged their weapons; many Mexican soldiers were unintentionally killed by their own comrades. As Mexican soldiers swarmed over the walls, at least 80 Texians fled the Alamo and were cut down by Mexican cavalry. Within an hour, almost all of the <a href="List%20of%20Alamo%20defenders">Texian defenders</a>, estimated at 182–257 men, were killed. Between four and seven Texians, possibly including Crockett, surrendered. Although General <a href="Manuel%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Castrill%C3%B3n">Manuel Fernández Castrillón</a> attempted to intercede on their behalf, Santa Anna insisted that the prisoners be executed immediately.

Most Alamo historians agree that 400–600 Mexicans were killed or wounded. This would represent about one-third of the Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault, which historian Timothy Todish remarks is "a tremendous casualty rate by any standards". The battle was militarily insignificant, but had an enormous political impact. Travis had succeeded in buying time for the Convention of 1836, scheduled for March 1, to meet. If Santa Anna had not paused in Béxar for two weeks, he would have reached San Felipe by March 2 and very likely would have captured the delegates or caused them to flee.

<a href="List%20of%20Texian%20survivors%20of%20the%20Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">The survivors</a>, primarily women and children, were questioned by Santa Anna and then released. <a href="Susanna%20Dickinson">Susanna Dickinson</a> was sent with Travis's slave Joe to Gonzales, where she lived, to spread the news of the Texian defeat. Santa Anna assumed that knowledge of the disparity in troop numbers and the fate of the Texian soldiers at the Alamo would quell the resistance, and that Texian soldiers would quickly leave the territory.

Urrea reached Matamoros on January 31. A committed federalist himself, he soon convinced other federalists in the area that the Texians' ultimate goal was secession and their attempt to spark a federalist revolt in Matamoros was just a method of diverting attention from themselves. Mexican double agents continued to assure Johnson and Grant that they would be able to take Matamoros easily. While Johnson waited in San Patricio with a small group of men, Grant and between 26 and 53 others roamed the area between the Nueces River and Matamoros. Although they were ostensibly searching for more horses, it is likely Grant was also attempting to contact his sources in Matamoros to further coordinate an attack.

Just after midnight on February 27, Urrea's men <a href="battle%20of%20San%20Patricio">surprised Johnson's forces</a>. Six Texians, including Johnson, escaped; the remainder were captured or killed. After learning of Grant's whereabouts from local spies, Mexican dragoons ambushed the Texians <a href="battle%20of%20Agua%20Dulce">at Agua Dulce Creek</a> on March 2. Twelve Texians were killed, including Grant, four were captured, and six escaped. Although Urrea's orders were to execute those captured, he instead sent them to Matamoros as prisoners.
On March 11, Fannin sent Captain <a href="Amon%20B.%20King">Amon B. King</a> to help evacuate settlers from the mission in Refugio. King and his men instead spent a day searching local ranches for centralist sympathizers. They returned to the mission on March 12 and were soon besieged by Urrea's advance guard and de la Garza's <a href="Victoriana%20Guardes">Victoriana Guardes</a>. That same day, Fannin received orders from Houston to destroy Presidio La Bahía (by then renamed Fort Defiance) and march to Victoria. Unwilling to leave any of his men behind, Fannin sent <a href="William%20Ward%20%28Texas%29">William Ward</a> with 120 men to help King's company. Ward's men drove off the troops besieging the church, but rather than return to Goliad, they delayed a day to conduct further raids on local ranches.

Urrea arrived with almost 1,000 troops on March 14. At the <a href="battle%20of%20Refugio">battle of Refugio</a>, an engagement markedly similar to the battle of Concepción, the Texians repulsed several attacks and inflicted heavy casualties, relying on the greater accuracy and range of their rifles. By the end of the day, the Texians were hungry, thirsty, tired, and almost out of ammunition. Ward ordered a retreat, and under cover of darkness and rain the Texian soldiers slipped through Mexican lines, leaving several severely wounded men behind. Over the next several days, Urrea's men, with the help of local centralist supporters, rounded up many of the Texians who had escaped. Most were executed, although Urrea pardoned a few after their wives begged for their lives, and Mexican Colonel <a href="Juan%20Jos%C3%A9%20Holzinger">Juan José Holzinger</a> insisted that all of the non-Americans be spared.

By the end of the day on March 16, the bulk of Urrea's forces began marching to Goliad to corner Fannin. Still waiting for word from King and Ward, Fannin continued to delay his evacuation from Goliad. As they prepared to leave on March 18, Urrea's advance guard arrived. For the rest of the day, the two cavalries skirmished aimlessly, succeeding only in exhausting the Texian oxen, which had remained hitched to their wagons with no food or water throughout the day.

The Texians began their retreat on March 19. The pace was unhurried, and after travelling only , the group stopped for an hour to rest and allow the oxen to graze. Urrea's troops caught up to the Texians later that afternoon, while Fannin and his force of about 300 men were crossing a prairie. Having learned from the fighting at Refugio, Urrea was determined that the Texians would not reach the cover of timber approximately ahead, along Coleto Creek. As Mexican forces surrounded them, the Texians formed a tight hollow square for defense. They repulsed three charges during this <a href="battle%20of%20Coleto">battle of Coleto</a>, resulting in about nine Texians killed and 51 wounded, including Fannin. Urrea lost 50 men, with another 140 wounded. Texians had little food, no water, and declining supplies of ammunition, but voted to not try to break for the timber, as they would have had to leave the wounded behind.

The following morning, March 20, Urrea paraded his men and his newly arrived artillery. Seeing the hopelessness of their situation, the Texians with Fannin surrendered. Mexican records show that the Texians <a href="Unconditional%20surrender%23Surrender%20at%20discretion">surrendered at discretion</a>; Texian accounts claim that Urrea promised the Texians would be treated as prisoners-of-war and granted passage to the United States. Two days later, a group of Urrea's men surrounded Ward and the last of his group less than from Victoria. Over Ward's vehement objections, his men voted to surrender, later recalling they were told they would be sent back to the United States.

On <a href="Palm%20Sunday">Palm Sunday</a>, March 27, Fannin, Ward, Westover, and their men were marched out of the presidio and shot. Mexican cavalry were stationed nearby to chase down any who tried to escape. Approximately 342 Texians died, and 27 either escaped or were spared by Mexican troops. Several weeks after the <a href="Goliad%20massacre">Goliad massacre</a>, the Mexican Congress granted an official reprieve to any Texas prisoners who had incurred capital punishment.

The Convention of 1836 in <a href="Washington-on-the-Brazos%2C%20Texas">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a> on March 1 attracted 45 delegates, representing 21 municipalities. Within an hour of the convention's opening, <a href="George%20C.%20Childress">George C. Childress</a> submitted a proposed <a href="Texas%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Texas Declaration of Independence</a>, which passed overwhelmingly on March 2. On March 6, hours after the Alamo had fallen, Travis's final dispatch arrived. His distress was evident; delegate <a href="Robert%20Potter%20%28U.S.%20politician%29">Robert Potter</a> immediately moved that the convention be adjourned and all delegates join the army. Houston convinced the delegates to remain, and then left to take charge of the army. With the backing of the Convention, Houston was now commander-in-chief of all regular, volunteer, and militia forces in Texas.

Over the next ten days, delegates prepared a <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Texas">constitution for the Republic of Texas</a>. Parts of the document were copied verbatim from the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>; other articles were paraphrased. The new nation's government was structured similarly to that of the United States, with a bicameral legislature, a chief executive, and a supreme court. In a sharp departure from its model, the new constitution expressly permitted impressment of goods and forced housing for soldiers. It also explicitly legalized slavery and recognized the people's right to revolt against government authority. After adopting the constitution on March 17, delegates elected interim officers to govern the country and then adjourned. David G. Burnet, who had not been a delegate, was elected president. The following day, Burnet announced the government was leaving for <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Texas">Harrisburg</a>.

On March 11, Santa Anna sent one column of troops to join Urrea, with instructions to move to Brazoria once Fannin's men had been neutralized. A second set of 700 troops under General <a href="Antonio%20Gaona">Antonio Gaona</a> would advance along the Camino Real to <a href="Bastrop%2C%20Texas">Mina</a>, and then on to Nacogdoches. General <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20y%20Sesma">Joaquín Ramírez y Sesma</a> would take an additional 700 men to San Felipe. The Mexican columns were thus moving northeast on roughly parallel paths, separated by .
The same day that Mexican troops departed Béxar, Houston arrived in Gonzales and informed the 374 volunteers (some without weapons) gathered there that Texas was now an independent republic. Just after on March 13, Susanna Dickinson and Joe brought news that the Alamo garrison had been defeated and the Mexican army was marching towards Texian settlements. A hastily convened council of war voted to evacuate the area and retreat. The evacuation commenced at midnight and happened so quickly that many Texian scouts were unaware the army had moved on. Everything that could not be carried was burned, and the army's only two cannon were thrown into the Guadalupe River. When Ramírez y Sesma reached Gonzales the morning of March 14, he found the buildings still smoldering.

Most citizens fled on foot, many carrying their small children. A cavalry company led by Seguín and <a href="Salvador%20Flores">Salvador Flores</a> were assigned as rear guard to evacuate the more isolated ranches and protect the civilians from attacks by Mexican troops or Indians. The further the army retreated, the more civilians joined the flight. For both armies and the civilians, the pace was slow; torrential rains had flooded the rivers and turned the roads into mud pits.

As news of the Alamo's fall spread, volunteer ranks swelled, reaching about 1,400 men on March 19. Houston learned of Fannin's defeat on March 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent Texas. Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would only be good for one battle and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops. By March 28, the Texian army had retreated across the <a href="Navidad%20River">Navidad</a> and <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28Texas%29">Colorado River</a>s. Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward.

On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly north of San Felipe. Two companies that refused to retreat further than San Felipe were assigned to guard the crossings on the Brazos River. For the next two weeks, the Texians rested, recovered from illness, and, for the first time, began practicing military drills. While there, two cannons, known as the Twin Sisters, arrived from <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. Interim Secretary of War <a href="Thomas%20Rusk">Thomas Rusk</a> joined the camp, with orders from Burnet to replace Houston if he refused to fight. Houston quickly persuaded Rusk that his plans were sound. Secretary of State <a href="Samuel%20P.%20Carson">Samuel P. Carson</a> advised Houston to continue retreating all the way to the Sabine River, where more volunteers would likely flock from the United States and allow the army to counterattack. Unhappy with everyone involved, Burnet wrote to Houston: "The enemy are laughing you to scorn. You must fight them. You must retreat no further. The country expects you to fight. The salvation of the country depends on your doing so." Complaints within the camp became so strong that Houston posted notices that anyone attempting to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.

Santa Anna and a smaller force had remained in Béxar. After receiving word that the acting president, <a href="Miguel%20Barrag%C3%A1n">Miguel Barragán</a>, had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position. Fear that Urrea's victories would position him as a political rival convinced Santa Anna to remain in Texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign. He left on March 29 to join Ramírez y Sesma, leaving only a small force to hold Béxar. At dawn on April 7, their combined force marched into San Felipe and captured a Texian soldier, who informed Santa Anna that the Texians planned to retreat further if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos River. Unable to cross the Brazos due to the small company of Texians barricaded at the river crossing, on April 14 a frustrated Santa Anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim Texas government. Government officials fled mere hours before Mexican troops arrived in Harrisburg, and Santa Anna sent Colonel <a href="Juan%20Almonte">Juan Almonte</a> with 50 cavalry to intercept them in New Washington. Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston Island</a>. Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet's family.

At this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes. The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting. He determined to block the Texian army's retreat and put a decisive end to the war. Almonte's scouts incorrectly reported that Houston's army was going to Lynchburg Crossing, on <a href="Buffalo%20Bayou">Buffalo Bayou</a>, in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburg burned and pressed on towards <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Texas">Lynchburg</a>.

The Texian army had resumed their march eastward. On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburg. Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg. They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army's departure. That same day, <a href="Deaf%20Smith">Deaf Smith</a> and <a href="Henry%20Karnes">Henry Karnes</a> captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas. Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to "Remember the Alamo" and "Remember Goliad". His army then raced towards Lynchburg. Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the "Tejanos" in Seguín's company, Houston originally ordered Seguín and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly. After loud protests from Seguín and <a href="Antonio%20Menchaca">Antonio Menchaca</a>, the order was rescinded, provided the "Tejanos" wear a piece of cardboard in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.

The area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes. This type of terrain was familiar to the Texians and quite alien to the Mexican soldiers. Houston's army, comprising 900 men, reached Lynch's Ferry mid-morning on April 20; Santa Anna's 700-man force arrived a few hours later. The Texians made camp in a wooded area along the bank of Buffalo Bayou; while the location provided good cover and helped hide their full strength, it also left the Texians no room for retreat. Over the protests of several of his officers, Santa Anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location, a plain near the San Jacinto River, bordered by woods on one side, marsh and lake on another. The two camps were approximately apart, separated by a grassy area with a slight rise in the middle. Colonel Pedro Delgado later wrote that "the camping ground of His Excellency's selection was in all respects, against military rules. Any youngster would have done better."
Over the next several hours, two brief skirmishes occurred. Texians won the first, forcing a small group of dragoons and the Mexican artillery to withdraw. Mexican dragoons then forced the Texian cavalry to withdraw. In the melee, Rusk, on foot to reload his rifle, was almost captured by Mexican soldiers, but was rescued by newly arrived Texian volunteer <a href="Mirabeau%20B.%20Lamar">Mirabeau B. Lamar</a>. Over Houston's objections, many infantrymen rushed onto the field. As the Texian cavalry fell back, Lamar remained behind to rescue another Texian who had been thrown from his horse; Mexican officers "reportedly applauded" his bravery. Houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given Santa Anna a better estimate of their strength; the men were equally upset that Houston hadn't allowed a full battle.

Throughout the night, Mexican troops worked to fortify their camp, creating <a href="breastworks">breastworks</a> out of everything they could find, including saddles and brush. At on April 21, Cos arrived with 540 reinforcements, bringing the Mexican force to 1,200 men, which outnumbered the Texians. Cos's men were raw recruits rather than experienced soldiers, and they had marched steadily for more than 24 hours, with no rest and no food. As the morning wore on with no Texian attack, Mexican officers lowered their guard. By afternoon, Santa Anna had given permission for Cos's men to sleep; his own tired troops also took advantage of the time to rest, eat, and bathe.

Not long after the Mexican reinforcements arrived, Houston ordered Smith to destroy <a href="Vince%27s%20Bridge">Vince's Bridge</a>, away, to slow down any further Mexican reinforcements. At the Texians began creeping quietly through the tall grass, pulling the cannon behind them. The Texian cannon fired at 4:30, beginning the <a href="battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">battle of San Jacinto</a>. After a single volley, Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Mexican soldiers were taken completely by surprise. Santa Anna, Castrillón, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense. Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives. The killing lasted for hours.

Many Mexican soldiers retreated through the marsh to Peggy Lake. Texian riflemen stationed themselves on the banks and shot at anything that moved. Many Texian officers, including Houston and Rusk, attempted to stop the slaughter, but they were unable to gain control of the men. Texians continued to chant "Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!" while frightened Mexican infantry yelled "Me no Alamo!" and begged for mercy to no avail. In what historian Davis called "one of the most one-sided victories in history", 650 Mexican soldiers were killed and 300 captured. Eleven Texians died, with 30 others, including Houston, wounded.

Although Santa Anna's troops had been thoroughly vanquished, they did not represent the bulk of the Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General <a href="Vicente%20Filisola">Vicente Filisola</a>. Texians had won the battle due to mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola. As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners were led into camp. Houston initially mistook the group for Mexican reinforcements and shouted out that all was lost.

Santa Anna had successfully escaped towards Vince's Bridge. Finding the bridge destroyed, he hid in the marsh and was captured the following day. He was brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded. Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general's immediate execution. Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away. In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that "yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter" and ordered his troops to retreat to Béxar and await further instructions.

Urrea urged Filisola to continue the campaign. He was confident that he could successfully challenge the Texian troops. According to Hardin, "Santa Anna had presented Mexico with one military disaster; Filisola did not wish to risk another." Spring rains ruined the ammunition and rendered the roads almost impassable, with troops sinking to their knees in mud. Mexican troops were soon out of food, and began to fall ill from dysentery and other diseases. Their supply lines had completely broken down, leaving no hope of further reinforcements. Filisola later wrote that "Had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances, on the only road that was left, no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion".

For several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet. Santa Anna suggested two treaties, a public version of promises made between the two countries, and a private version that included Santa Anna's personal agreements. The <a href="Treaties%20of%20Velasco">Treaties of Velasco</a> required that all Mexican troops retreat south of the Rio Grande and that all private property—code for slaves—be respected and restored. Prisoners-of-war would be released unharmed, and Santa Anna would be given passage to Veracruz immediately. He secretly promised to persuade the Mexican Congress to acknowledge the Republic of Texas and to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between the two countries.

When Urrea began marching south in mid-May, many families from San Patricio who had supported the Mexican army went with him. When Texian troops arrived in early June, they found only 20 families remaining. The area around San Patricio and Refugio suffered a "noticeable depopulation" in the Republic of Texas years. Although the treaty had specified that Urrea and Filisola would return any slaves their armies had sheltered, Urrea refused to comply. Many former slaves followed the army to Mexico, where they could be free. By late May the Mexican troops had crossed the Nueces. Filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake Texas.

When Mexican authorities received word of Santa Anna's defeat at San Jacinto, flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning. Denouncing any agreements signed by Santa Anna, a prisoner of war, the Mexican authorities refused to recognize the Republic of Texas. Filisola was derided for leading the retreat and quickly replaced by Urrea. Within months, Urrea gathered 6,000 troops in Matamoros, poised to reconquer Texas. However, the renewed Mexican invasion of Texas never materialized as Urrea's army was redirected to address continued federalist rebellions in other state regions in Mexico.

Most in Texas assumed the Mexican army would return quickly. So many American volunteers flocked to the Texian army in the months after the victory at San Jacinto that the Texian government was unable to maintain an accurate list of enlistments. Out of caution, Béxar remained under martial law throughout 1836. Rusk ordered that all "Tejanos" in the area between the Guadalupe and Nueces Rivers migrate either to east Texas or to Mexico. Some residents who refused to comply were forcibly removed. New Anglo settlers moved in and used threats and legal maneuvering to take over the land once owned by "Tejanos". Over the next several years, hundreds of "Tejano" families resettled in Mexico.

For years, Mexican authorities used the reconquering of Texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation. Only sporadic skirmishes resulted. Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, out of fear that those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country. The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Rio%20Grande">Republic of the Rio Grande</a> in 1839. The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas. In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.

On June 1, 1836 Santa Anna boarded a ship to travel back to Mexico. For the next two days, crowds of Texian soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution. Lamar, by now promoted to Secretary of War, gave a speech insisting that "Mobs must not intimidate the government. We want no <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> in Texas!", but on June 4 soldiers seized Santa Anna and put him under military arrest. According to Lack, "the shock of having its foreign policy overturned by popular rebellion had weakened the interim government irrevocably". A group of soldiers staged an unsuccessful coup in mid-July. In response, Burnet called for elections to ratify the constitution and elect a Congress, the sixth set of leaders for Texas in a twelve-month period. Voters overwhelmingly chose Houston the first <a href="President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Texas">president</a>, ratified the constitution drawn up by the Convention of 1836, and approved a resolution to request annexation to the United States. Houston issued an executive order sending Santa Anna to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and from there he was soon sent home.

During his absence, Santa Anna had been deposed. Upon his arrival, the Mexican press wasted no time in attacking him for his cruelty towards those prisoners executed at Goliad. In May 1837, Santa Anna requested an inquiry into the event. The judge determined the inquiry was only for fact-finding and took no action; press attacks in both Mexico and the United States continued. Santa Anna was disgraced until the following year, when he became a hero of the <a href="Pastry%20War">Pastry War</a>.

The first Texas Legislature declined to ratify the treaty Houston had signed with the Cherokee, declaring he had no authority to make any promises. Although the Texian interim governments had vowed to eventually compensate citizens for goods that were impressed during the war efforts, for the most part livestock and horses were not returned. Veterans were guaranteed land bounties; in 1879, surviving Texian veterans who served more than three months from October 1, 1835 through January 1, 1837 were guaranteed an additional in public lands. Over 1.3 million acres (559 thousand ha) of land were granted; some of this was in <a href="Greer%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Greer County</a>, which was later determined to be part of <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>.

Republic of Texas policies changed the status of many living in the region. The constitution forbade free blacks from living in Texas permanently. Individual slaves could only be freed by congressional order, and the newly emancipated person would then be forced to leave Texas. Women also lost significant legal rights under the new constitution, which substituted English common law practices for the traditional Spanish law system. Under common law, the idea of <a href="community%20property">community property</a> was eliminated, and women no longer had the ability to act for themselves legally – to sign contracts, own property, or sue. Some of these rights were restored in 1845, when Texas added them to the new state constitution. During the Republic of Texas years, "Tejanos" likewise faced much discrimination.

Mexican authorities blamed the loss of Texas on United States intervention. Although the United States remained officially neutral, 40 percent of the men who enlisted in the Texian army from October 1 through April 21 arrived from the United States after hostilities began. More than 200 of the volunteers were members of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>; none were punished when they returned to their posts. American individuals also provided supplies and money to the cause of Texian independence. For the next decade, Mexican politicians frequently denounced the United States for the involvement of its citizens.

The United States agreed to recognize the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory. The fledgling republic now attempted to persuade European nations to agree to recognition. In late 1839 France recognized the Republic of Texas after being convinced it would make a fine trading partner.

For several decades, official British policy was to maintain strong ties with Mexico in the hopes that the country could stop the United States from expanding further. When the Texas Revolution erupted, Great Britain had declined to become involved, officially expressing confidence that Mexico could handle its own affairs. In 1840, after years in which the Republic of Texas was neither annexed by the United States nor reabsorbed into Mexico, Britain signed a treaty to recognize the nation and act as a mediator to help Texas gain recognition from Mexico.

The United States voted to <a href="annexation%20of%20Texas">annex Texas</a> as the 28th state in March 1845. Two months later, Mexico agreed to recognize the Republic of Texas as long as there was no annexation to the United States. On July 4, 1845, Texians voted for annexation. This prompted the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, in which Mexico lost almost 55 percent of its territory to the United States and formally relinquished its claim on Texas.

Although no new fighting techniques were introduced during the Texas Revolution, casualty figures were quite unusual for the time. Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three. From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian. The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.

During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance. Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation. Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own. Over the next decade, the <a href="Texas%20Ranger%20Division">Texas Rangers</a> borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the <a href="western%20saddle">Spanish saddle</a> and spurs, the <a href="riata">riata</a>, and the bandana.

The <a href="Texas%20Veterans%20Association">Texas Veterans Association</a>, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans. In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the <a href="San%20Jacinto%20Monument">San Jacinto Monument</a>, the tallest stone column monument in the world. In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a <a href="Alamo%20Cenotaph">cenotaph</a> designed by <a href="Pompeo%20Coppini">Pompeo Coppini</a> which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle. More than 2.5 million people visit the Alamo every year.

The Texas Revolution has been the subject of poetry and of many books, plays and films. Most English-language treatments reflect the perspectives of the Anglos and are centered primarily on the battle of the Alamo. From the first novel depicting events of the revolution, 1838's "Mexico versus Texas", through the mid-20th century, most works contained themes of <a href="anticlericalism">anticlericalism</a> and racism, depicting the battle as a fight for freedom between good (Anglo Texian) and evil (Mexican). In both English- and Spanish-language literature, the Alamo is often compared to the <a href="battle%20of%20Thermopylae">battle of Thermopylae</a>. The 1950s <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> miniseries "<a href="Davy%20Crockett%20%28miniseries%29">Davy Crockett</a>", which was largely based on myth, created a worldwide craze for everything Alamo-related. Within several years, <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> directed and starred in one of the best-known and perhaps least historically accurate film versions, "<a href="The%20Alamo%20%281960%20film%29">The Alamo</a>" (1960). Notably, this version made the first attempt to leave behind racial stereotypes; it was still banned in Mexico. In the late 1970s, works about the Alamo began to explore "Tejano" perspectives, which had been all but extinguished even from textbooks about the revolution, and to explore the revolution's links to slavery.

Harry R. Truman

Harry R. Truman (October 30, 1896 – May 18, 1980) was a resident of the U.S. state of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> who lived near <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a>. He was the owner and caretaker of Mount St. Helens Lodge at <a href="Spirit%20Lake%20%28Washington%29">Spirit Lake</a> near the foot of the mountain, and he came to fame as a folk hero in the months preceding the volcano's <a href="1980%20eruption%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Helens">1980 eruption</a> after he refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders. Truman is presumed to have been killed by a that overtook his lodge and buried the site under of volcanic debris.

After Truman's death, his family and friends reflected on his love for the mountain. In 1981, <a href="Art%20Carney">Art Carney</a> portrayed Truman in the <a href="docudrama">docudrama</a> film "<a href="St.%20Helens%20%28film%29">St. Helens</a>". He was commemorated in a book by his niece and a number of musical pieces, including songs by <a href="Headgear%20%28band%29">Headgear</a> and <a href="Billy%20Jonas">Billy Jonas</a>.

Truman was born to foresters in <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> in October 1896. He did not know his exact date of birth, though he gave it as October 30, 1896. Some non-contemporaneous sources have given his middle name as Randall, but Truman stated that he did not know his middle name, just the initial R.

Truman's family moved west to <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> state, drawn to the promise of cheap land and the successful timber industry in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>; they settled on of farmland in the eastern portion of <a href="Lewis%20County%2C%20Washington">Lewis County, Washington</a>. He attended high school in the city of <a href="Mossyrock%2C%20Washington">Mossyrock, Washington</a>, then enlisted in the Army as a private in August 1917. He was assigned to the <a href="100th%20Aero%20Squadron">100th Aero Squadron</a>, 7th Squad and trained as an aeromechanic and served in France during . During his service, he sustained injuries due to his audacious and independent nature. While en route to Europe, his troopship, <a href="SS%20Tuscania%20%281914%29">"Tuscania"</a>, was sunk by a German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> in a torpedo attack off the coast of Ireland. He was honorably discharged in June 1919, and he began prospecting, but failed to achieve his goal of becoming rich. He later became a bootlegger, smuggling alcohol from <a href="San%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BFrancisco">San Francisco</a> to Washington during <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>. At some point, he returned to <a href="Chehalis%2C%20Washington">Chehalis, Washington</a>, where he ran an automotive service and gasoline station called Harry's Sudden Service. He also married the daughter of a sawmill owner; they had one daughter.
Truman grew tired of civilization after a few years and leased from the <a href="Northern%20Pacific%20Railroad%20Company">Northern Pacific Railroad Company</a> overlooking Spirit Lake in the wilderness near <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a>, a <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> located in <a href="Skamania%20County%2C%20Washington">Skamania County, Washington</a>. He settled at the foot of the mountain and opened a gas station and a grocery store; he eventually opened the Mount St. Helens Lodge, close to the outlet of Spirit Lake, which he operated for 52 years.
During the 1930s, Truman divorced his wife; he remarried in 1935. The second marriage was short, as he reportedly attempted to win arguments by throwing his wife into Spirit Lake, despite her inability to swim. He began dating a local girl, though he eventually married her sister Edna, whom he called Eddie. They remained married, operating the Mount St. Helens Lodge together until Edna's death from a heart attack in 1978.

In the Mount St. Helens area, Truman became notorious for his antics, once getting a forest ranger drunk so that he could burn a pile of brush. He poached, stole gravel from the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>, and fished on American Indian land with a fake game warden badge. Despite their knowledge of these criminal activities, local rangers failed to catch him in the act. The <a href="Government%20of%20Washington%20%28state%29">Washington state government</a> later changed the state sales tax, but Truman kept charging the same rate. A tax agency employee rented a boat from him but refused to pay his tax rate, so Truman pushed him into Spirit Lake.

Truman was a fan of the cocktail drink <a href="Schenley%20Industries">Schenley</a> whiskey and <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>. He owned a pink 1957 <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a>, and he swore frequently. He loved discussing politics and reportedly hated <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>, hippies, young children, and especially old people. He once refused to allow Supreme Court Justice <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a> to stay at his lodge, dismissing him as an "old coot". He changed his mind when he learned Douglas's identity, chased him for , and convinced him to stay.

When his wife Edna died in 1978, Truman closed his lodge and afterward only rented out a handful of boats and cabins during the summer.

Truman became a minor celebrity during the two months of volcanic activity preceding the , giving interviews to reporters and expressing his opinion that the danger was exaggerated. "I don't have any idea whether it will blow," he said, "but I don't believe it to the point that I'm going to pack up." Truman displayed little concern about the volcano and his situation: "If the mountain goes, I'm going with it. This area is heavily timbered, Spirit Lake is in between me and the mountain, and the mountain is a mile away, the mountain ain't gonna hurt me." Law enforcement officials were incensed by his refusal to evacuate because media representatives kept entering the restricted zone near the volcano to interview him, endangering themselves in the process. Still, Truman remained steadfast. "You couldn't pull me out with a mule team. That mountain's part of Truman and Truman's part of that mountain."

Truman told reporters that he was knocked from his bed by precursor earthquakes, so he responded by moving his mattress to the basement. He claimed to wear spurs to bed to cope with the earthquakes while he slept. He scoffed at the public's concern for his safety, responding to scientists' claims about the threat of the volcano that "the mountain has shot its wad and it hasn't hurt my place a bit, but those goddamn <a href="Geology">geologists</a> with their hair down to their butts wouldn't pay no attention to ol' Truman."

As a result of his defiant commentary, Truman became something of a folk hero and was the subject of many songs and poems by children. One group of children from <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem, Oregon</a>, sent him banners inscribed "Harry – We Love You", which moved him so much that he took a helicopter trip (paid for by "<a href="National%20Geographic">National Geographic</a>") to visit them on May 14. He also received many fan letters, including several marriage proposals. A group of fifth graders from <a href="Grand%20Blanc%2C%20Michigan">Grand Blanc, Michigan</a>, wrote letters that brought him to tears. In return, he sent them a letter and volcanic ash, which the students later sold to buy flowers for his family after the eruption.

He caused a media frenzy, appearing on the front page of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Examiner">The San Francisco Examiner</a>" and attracting the attention of "National Geographic", <a href="United%20Press%20International">United Press International</a>, and "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">The Today Show</a>". Many major magazines composed profiles, including "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>", "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>", "<a href="Field%20%26amp%3B%20Stream">Field & Stream</a>", and "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>". A historian named Richard W. Slatta wrote that "his fiery attitude, brash speech, love of the outdoors, and fierce independence… made him a folk hero the media could adore." Slatta pointed to Truman's "unbendable character and response to the forces of nature" as a source of his rise to fame, and the interviews with him added "color" to reports about the events at Mount St. Helens. Truman was immortalized, according to Slatta, "with many of the embellished qualities of the western hero", and the media spotlight created a persona that was "in some ways quite different from his true character."

As the likelihood of eruption increased, state officials tried to evacuate the area with the exception of a few scientists and security officials. On May 17, they attempted one final time to persuade Truman to leave, to no avail. The volcano erupted the next morning, and its entire northern flank collapsed. Truman was alone at his lodge with his 16 cats, and is presumed to have died in the eruption on May 18. The largest <a href="landslide">landslide</a> in recorded history and a <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a> traveling atop the landslide engulfed the Spirit Lake area almost simultaneously, destroying the lake and burying the site of his lodge under of volcanic landslide debris. Authorities never found Truman's remains. Truman's cats are presumed to have died with him; he considered them family and mentioned them in almost all public statements.

Friends hoped that Truman might have survived, as he had claimed to have provisioned an abandoned mine shaft with food and liquor in case of an eruption, but the lack of immediate warning of the oncoming eruption may have prevented him from escaping to the shaft before the pyroclastic flow reached his lodge (less than a minute after it began). His sister Geraldine said that she found it hard to accept the reality of his death. "I don't think he made it, but I thought if they would let me fly over and see for myself that Harry's lodge is gone, then maybe I'd believe it for sure." Truman's niece Shirley Rosen added that her uncle thought he could escape the volcano but was not expecting the lateral eruption. She stated that her sister took him a bottle of Bourbon whiskey to persuade him to evacuate, but he was too afraid to drink alcohol at the time because he was unsure whether the shaking was coming from his body or the earthquakes. His possessions were auctioned off as keepsakes to admirers in September 1980.

Truman emerged as a folk hero for his resistance to the evacuation efforts. "<a href="The%20Columbian">The Columbian</a>" wrote: "With his 10-dollar name and hell-no-I-won’t-go attitude, Truman was a made-for-prime-time folk hero." His friends and family commented: "He was a very opinionated person." Truman's friend John Garrity added, "The mountain and the lake were his life. If he'd left and then saw what the mountain did to his lake, it would have killed him anyway. He always said he wanted to die at Spirit Lake. He went the way he wanted to go." Truman's niece Shirley stated, "He used to say that's my mountain and my lake and he would say those are my arms and my legs. If he would have seen it the way it is now, I don't think he would have survived." Truman's cousin Richard Ice commented that Truman's short period as a celebrity was "the peak of his life."

Truman was the subject of the books "Truman of St. Helens: The Man and His Mountain" by his niece Shirley Rosen, and "The Legend of Harry Truman" by his sister Geri Whiting. He was portrayed by <a href="Art%20Carney">Art Carney</a>, his favorite actor, in the 1981 docudrama "<a href="St.%20Helens%20%28film%29">St. Helens</a>". Memorabilia were sold in the area surrounding Mount St. Helens, including Harry Truman hats, pictures, posters, and postcards. A restaurant opened in <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage, Alaska</a>, named after him, serving dishes such as Harry's Hot Molten Chili. According to "<a href="The%20Washington%20Star">The Washington Star</a>", more than 100 songs had been composed in Truman's honor by 1981, in addition to a commemorative album titled "The Musical Legend Of Harry Truman — A Very Special Collection Of Mount St. Helens’ Volcano Songs". He is the subject of the 2007 song "Harry Truman" written and recorded by Irish band <a href="Headgear%20%28band%29">Headgear</a>. Lula Belle Garland wrote "The Legend of Harry And The Mountain," which was recorded in 1980 by Ron Shaw & The Desert Wind Band. Musicians Ron Allen and Steve Asplund wrote a country rock song in 1980 called "Harry Truman, Your Spirit Still Lives On". <a href="Billy%20Jonas">Billy Jonas</a> included Truman's narrative in his song "Old St. Helen" in 1993.

Truman Trail and Harry's Ridge in the Mount St. Helens region are named after him. The Harry R. Truman Memorial Park was named in his honor in <a href="Castle%20Rock%2C%20Washington">Castle Rock</a>, Washington, though it later was renamed Castle Rock Lions Club Volunteer Park.

Rolls-Royce Merlin

The Rolls-Royce Merlin is a British <a href="Coolant%23Liquids">liquid-cooled</a> <a href="V12%20engine">V-12</a> <a href="Reciprocating%20engine">piston</a> <a href="aero%20engine">aero engine</a> of 27-<a href="litre">litre</a>s (1,650 <a href="cubic%20inch">cu in</a>) <a href="Engine%20displacement">capacity</a>. <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Limited">Rolls-Royce</a> designed the engine and first ran it in 1933 as a private venture. Initially known as the PV-12, it was later called "<a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">Merlin</a>" following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>.

After several modifications, the first production variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the <a href="Fairey%20Battle">Fairey Battle</a>, <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> and <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>. The Merlin remains most closely associated with the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bomber. A series of rapidly applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000 hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800 hp, and the very latest version as used in the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Hornet">de Havilland Hornet</a> over 2,000 hp. 

One of the most successful aircraft engines of the World War II era, some 50 marks of Merlin were built by Rolls-Royce in <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, <a href="Crewe">Crewe</a> and <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, as well as by <a href="Ford%20of%20Britain">Ford of Britain</a> at their <a href="Ford%20Trafford%20Park%20Factory">Trafford Park factory</a>, near <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. A de-rated version was also the basis of the successful <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Meteor">Rolls-Royce/Rover Meteor</a> tank engine. Post-war, the Merlin was largely superseded by the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Griffon">Rolls-Royce Griffon</a> for military use, with most Merlin variants being designed and built for <a href="airliner">airliner</a>s and <a href="military%20transport%20aircraft">military transport aircraft</a>. Production ceased in 1956 with the fulfilment of an order for 170 Merlins for the Spanish Air Force's <a href="CASA%202.111">CASA 2.111</a> and <a href="Hispano%20Aviaci%C3%B3n%20HA-1112">Hispano Aviación HA-1112</a> aircraft, after 160,000 engines had been delivered. In addition, the <a href="Packard%20V-1650">Packard V-1650</a> was a version of the Merlin built in the United States, itself produced in numbers upwards of 55,000 examples, and was the principal engine used in the <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>.

Merlin engines remain in <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> service today with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20Memorial%20Flight">Battle of Britain Memorial Flight</a>, and power many restored aircraft in private ownership worldwide.

In the early 1930s, Rolls-Royce started planning its future aero-engine development programme and realised there was a need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296 cu in) <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Kestrel">Kestrel</a> which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for "Private Venture, 12-cylinder", as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a <a href="Hawker%20Hart">Hawker Hart</a> biplane (<a href="United%20Kingdom%20military%20aircraft%20serials">serial number</a> "K3036") on 21 February 1935. The engine was originally designed to use the <a href="Radiator%20%28engine%20cooling%29%23Evaporative%20cooling">evaporative cooling</a> system then in vogue. This proved unreliable and when <a href="ethylene%20glycol">ethylene glycol</a> from the U.S. became available, the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid-cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin <a href="testbed">testbed</a>, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.

In 1935, the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> issued a specification, <a href="List%20of%20Air%20Ministry%20specifications">F10/35</a>, for new <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> with a minimum airspeed of . Fortunately, two designs had been developed: the <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> and the <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>; the latter designed in response to another specification, F36/34. Both were designed around the PV-12 instead of the Kestrel, and were the only contemporary British fighters to have been so developed. Production contracts for both aircraft were placed in 1936, and development of the PV-12 was given top priority as well as government funding. Following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey, Rolls-Royce named the engine the "<a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">Merlin</a>" after a small, Northern Hemisphere falcon ("Falco columbarius").

Two more Rolls-Royce engines developed just prior to the war were added to the company's range. The <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Peregrine">Rolls-Royce Peregrine</a> was an updated, <a href="supercharged">supercharged</a> development of their V-12 Kestrel design, while the 42-litre (2,560 cu in) <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Vulture">Rolls-Royce Vulture</a> used four Kestrel-sized <a href="cylinder%20block">cylinder block</a>s fitted to a single <a href="crankcase">crankcase</a> and driving a common crankshaft, forming an <a href="X24%20engine">X-24</a> layout. This was to be used in larger aircraft such as the <a href="Avro%20Manchester">Avro Manchester</a>.

Although the Peregrine appeared to be a satisfactory design, it was never allowed to mature since Rolls-Royce's priority was refining the Merlin. As a result, the Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft: the <a href="Westland%20Whirlwind%20%28fixed%20wing%29">Westland Whirlwind</a> fighter and one of the <a href="Gloster%20F.9/37">Gloster F.9/37</a> prototypes. The Vulture was fitted to the <a href="Avro%20Manchester">Avro Manchester</a> bomber, but proved unreliable in service and the planned fighter using it – the <a href="Hawker%20Tornado">Hawker Tornado</a> – was cancelled as a result. With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the range, the Peregrine and Vulture were both cancelled in 1943, and by mid-1943 the Merlin was supplemented in service by the larger <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Griffon">Griffon</a>. The Griffon incorporated several design improvements and ultimately superseded the Merlin.

Initially the new engine was plagued with problems, such as failure of the accessory gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the <a href="camshafts">camshafts</a> and <a href="crankshaft">crankshaft</a> <a href="main%20bearing">main bearing</a>s.

The prototype, developmental, and early production engine types were the:



The Merlin II and III series were the first main production versions of the engine. The Merlin III was the first version to incorporate a "universal" propeller shaft, allowing either <a href="de%20Havilland%20Propellers">de Havilland</a> or <a href="Dowty%20Rotol">Rotol</a> manufactured propellers to be used.

The first major version to incorporate changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, which was designed to run on 100 <a href="Octane%20rating">octane</a> fuel. This fuel allowed higher <a href="manifold%20pressure">manifold pressure</a>s, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the <a href="centrifugal%20supercharger">centrifugal supercharger</a>. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable <a href="ethylene%20glycol">ethylene glycol</a>, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.

The process of improvement continued, with later versions running on higher octane ratings, delivering more power. Fundamental design changes were also made to all key components, again increasing the engine's life and reliability. By the end of the war the "little" engine was delivering over 1,600 horsepower (1,200 kW) in common versions, and as much as 2,030 horsepower (1,540 kW) in the Merlin 130/131 versions specifically designed for the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Hornet">de Havilland Hornet</a>. Ultimately, during tests conducted by Rolls-Royce at <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, an RM.17.SM (the high altitude version of the Merlin 100-Series) achieved 2,640 horsepower (1,969 kW) at 36 lb boost (103"Hg) on 150 octane fuel with water injection.

With the end of the war, work on improving Merlin power output was halted and the development effort was concentrated on civil derivatives of the Merlin. Development of what became the "Transport Merlin" (TML) commenced with the Merlin 102 (the first Merlin to complete the new civil <a href="Type%20certificate">type-test</a> requirements) and was aimed at improving reliability and service overhaul periods for airline operators using airliner and transport aircraft such as the <a href="Avro%20Lancastrian">Avro Lancastrian</a>, <a href="Avro%20York">Avro York</a> (Merlin 500-series), <a href="Avro%20Tudor">Avro Tudor</a> II & IV (Merlin 621), Tudor IVB & V (Merlin 623), <a href="Trans-Canada%20Air%20Lines">TCA</a> <a href="Canadair%20North%20Star">Canadair North Star</a> (Merlin 724) and <a href="British%20Overseas%20Airways%20Corporation">BOAC</a> <a href="Canadair%20North%20Star">Argonaut</a> (Merlin 724-IC). By 1951 the <a href="time%20between%20overhauls">time between overhauls</a> (TBO) was typically 650–800 hours depending on use. By then single-stage engines had accumulated 2,615,000 engine hours in civil operation, and two-stage engines 1,169,000.

In addition, an exhaust system to reduce noise levels to below those from ejector exhausts was devised for the North Star/Argonaut. This "cross-over" system took the exhaust flow from the inboard bank of cylinders up-and-over the engine before discharging the exhaust stream on the outboard side of the <a href="Power-egg%23United%20Kingdom">UPP</a> nacelle. As a result, sound levels were reduced by between 5 and 8 <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s. The modified exhaust also conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of , resulting in a 5 knot improvement in true air speed. Still-air range of the aircraft was also improved by around 4 per cent. The modified engine was designated the "TMO" and the modified exhaust system was supplied as kit that could be installed on existing engines either by the operator or by Rolls-Royce.

Power ratings for the civil Merlin 600, 620, and 621-series was continuous cruising at , and for take-off. Merlins 622–626 were rated at continuous cruising at , and for take-off. Engines were available with single-stage, two-speed supercharging (500-series), two-stage, two-speed supercharging (600-series), and with full intercooling, or with half intercooling/charge heating, charge heating being employed for cold area use such as in Canada. Civil Merlin engines in airline service flew 7,818,000 air miles in 1946, 17,455,000 in 1947, and 24,850,000 miles in 1948.

"From Jane's":

Most of the Merlin's technical improvements resulted from more efficient <a href="supercharger">supercharger</a>s, designed by <a href="Stanley%20Hooker">Stanley Hooker</a>, and the introduction of aviation fuel with increased <a href="octane%20rating">octane rating</a>s. Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to the engine to withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.

The Merlin consumed an enormous volume of air at full power (equivalent to the volume of a <a href="single-decker%20bus">single-decker bus</a> per minute), and with the exhaust gases exiting at 1,300 mph (2,100 km/h) it was realised that useful <a href="thrust">thrust</a> could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting sideways.

During tests, 70 <a href="pounds-force">pounds-force</a> (310 <a href="newton%20%28unit%29">N</a>; 32 <a href="kilogram-force">kgf</a>) thrust at , or roughly 70 horsepower (52 kW) was obtained which increased the level maximum speed of the Spitfire by to . The first versions of the ejector exhausts featured round outlets, while subsequent versions of the system used "fishtail" style outlets which marginally increased thrust and reduced exhaust glare for night flying.

In September 1937 the Spitfire prototype, "<a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire%20%28early%20Merlin%20powered%20variants%29%23Prototype%20K5054%20%28Supermarine%20Type%20300%29">K5054</a>," was fitted with ejector type exhausts. Later marks of the Spitfire used a variation of this exhaust system fitted with forward-facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing-mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high <a href="altitude">altitude</a>s, replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator. The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air <a href="Lapse%20rate">temperatures are lower</a>. Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin-powered aircraft.

Central to the success of the Merlin was the supercharger. <a href="Cyril%20Lovesey">A.C. Lovesey</a>, an engineer who was a key figure in the design of the Merlin, delivered a lecture on the development of the Merlin in 1946; in this extract he explained the importance of the supercharger:
As the Merlin evolved so too did the supercharger; the latter fitting into three broad categories:

The Merlin supercharger was originally designed to allow the engine to generate maximum power at an <a href="altitude">altitude</a> of about . In 1938 Stanley Hooker, an <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> graduate in applied mathematics, explained "... I soon became very familiar with the construction of the Merlin supercharger and carburettor ... Since the supercharger was at the rear of the engine it had come in for pretty severe design treatment, and the air intake duct to the impeller looked very squashed ..." Tests conducted by Hooker showed the original intake design was inefficient, limiting the performance of the supercharger. Hooker subsequently designed a new air intake duct with improved flow characteristics which increased maximum power at a higher altitude of over ; and also improved the design of both the impeller, and the diffuser which controlled the airflow to it. These modifications led to the development of the single-stage Merlin XX and 45 series.

A significant advance in supercharger design was the incorporation in 1938 of a two-speed drive (designed by the French company <a href="Farman%20Aviation%20Works">Farman</a>) to the impeller of the Merlin X. The later Merlin XX incorporated the two-speed drive as well as several improvements that enabled the production rate of Merlins to be increased. The low-ratio gear, which operated from takeoff to an altitude of , drove the impeller at 21,597 rpm and developed 1,240 horsepower (925 kW) at that height; while the high gear's (25,148 rpm) power rating was 1,175 horsepower (876 kW) at . These figures were achieved at 2,850 rpm engine speed using +9 <a href="pounds%20per%20square%20inch">pounds per square inch</a> (1.66 <a href="Atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atm</a>) (48") boost.

In 1940, after receiving a request in March of that year from the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Aircraft%20Production">Ministry of Aircraft Production</a> for a high-rated () Merlin for use as an alternative engine to the turbocharged <a href="Bristol%20Hercules">Hercules VIII</a> used in the prototype high-altitude <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington V</a> bomber, Rolls-Royce started experiments on the design of a two-stage supercharger and an engine fitted with this was bench-tested in April 1941, eventually becoming the Merlin 60. The basic design used a modified Vulture supercharger for the first stage while a Merlin 46 supercharger was used for the second. A liquid-cooled <a href="intercooler">intercooler</a> on top of the supercharger casing was used to prevent the compressed air/fuel mixture from becoming too hot. Also considered was an exhaust-driven <a href="turbocharger">turbocharger</a> but, although a lower fuel consumption was an advantage the added weight and the need to add extra ducting for the exhaust flow and waste-gates, meant that this option was rejected in favour of the two-stage supercharger. Fitted with the two-stage two-speed supercharger, the Merlin 60 series gained 300 horsepower (224 kW) at over the Merlin 45 series, at which altitude a Spitfire IX was nearly faster than a Spitfire V.

The two-stage Merlin family was extended in 1943 with the Merlin 66 which had its supercharger geared for increased power ratings at low altitudes, and the Merlin 70 series that were designed to deliver increased power at high altitudes.

While the design of the two-stage supercharger forged ahead, Rolls-Royce also continued to develop the single-stage supercharger, resulting in 1942 in the development of a smaller "cropped" impeller for the Merlin 45M and 55M; both of these engines developed greater power at low altitudes. In squadron service the LF.V variant of the Spitfire fitted with these engines became known as the "clipped, clapped, and cropped Spitty" to indicate the shortened <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a>, the less-than-perfect condition of the used <a href="airframe">airframe</a>s, and the cropped supercharger impeller.

The use of <a href="Carburetor">carburettors</a> was calculated to give a higher <a href="Power%20density">specific power</a> output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's float controlled carburettor meant that if <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfires</a> or <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hurricanes</a> were to <a href="Flight%20dynamics%20%28aircraft%29">pitch</a> nose down into a steep dive, negative <a href="g-force">"g"-force</a> ("g") produced temporary fuel starvation causing the engine to cut-out momentarily. By comparison, the contemporary <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Bf 109E</a>, which had <a href="Gasoline%20direct%20injection%23Early%20systems">direct fuel injection</a>, could "bunt" straight into a high-power dive to escape attack. RAF fighter pilots soon learned to avoid this with a "half-roll" of their aircraft before diving in pursuit. A restrictor in the fuel supply line together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber, jocularly nicknamed "<a href="Miss%20Shilling%27s%20orifice">Miss Shilling's orifice</a>", after its inventor, went some way towards curing fuel starvation in a dive by containing fuel under negative G; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet from the bottom of the <a href="SU%20carburetor">S.U. carburettor</a> to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.

Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw the introduction of a <a href="Bendix%20Corporation">Bendix-Stromberg</a> <a href="pressure%20carburetor">pressure carburettor</a> that injected fuel at 5 <a href="pounds%20per%20square%20inch">pounds per square inch</a> (34 <a href="kilopascal">kPa</a>; 0.34 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">bar</a>) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and was fitted to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which was fitted to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. <a href="Fuel%20injection%23Throttle%20body%20injection">injection carburettor</a> that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.

At the start of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then standard 87 octane <a href="avgas">aviation spirit</a> and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750 kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-<a href="cubic%20inch">cu in</a>) displacement: the maximum <a href="Turbocharger%23Pressure%20increase">boost</a> pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141 kPa; 1.44 <a href="Atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atm</a>). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a>, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943 kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400 m), 1,285 horsepower (958 kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800 m) and 1,320 horsepower (984 kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857 kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700 m) and 1,160 horsepower (865 kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100 m).

From late 1939, 100 octane fuel became available from the U.S., <a href="Aruba">West Indies</a>, <a href="Abadan%20Refinery">Persia</a>, and, in smaller quantities, domestically, consequently, "... in the first half of 1940 the RAF transferred all Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons to 100 octane fuel." Small modifications were made to Merlin II and III series engines, allowing an increased (emergency) boost pressure of +12 pounds per square inch (183 kPa; 1.85 atm). At this power setting these engines were able to produce 1,310 horsepower (977 kW) at while running at 3,000 revolutions per minute. Increased boost could be used indefinitely as there was no mechanical time limit mechanism but pilots were advised not to use increased boost for more than a maximum of five minutes and it was considered a "definite overload condition on the engine"; if the pilot resorted to emergency boost he had to report this on landing, when it was noted in the engine log book, while the engineering officer was required to examine the engine and reset the throttle gate. Later versions of the Merlin ran only on 100 octane fuel and the five-minute combat limitation was raised to +18 pounds per square inch (224 kPa; 2.3 atm).

In late 1943 trials were run of a new "100/150" grade (150 octane) fuel, recognised by its bright-green colour and "awful smell". Initial tests were conducted using of <a href="tetraethyllead">tetraethyllead</a> (T.E.L.) for every one <a href="imperial%20gallon">imperial gallon</a> of 100 octane fuel (or 1.43 cc/L or 0.18 U.S. fl oz/U.S. gal), but this mixture resulted in a build-up of lead in the combustion chambers, causing excessive fouling of the <a href="spark%20plug">spark plug</a>s. Better results were achieved by adding 2.5% <a href="N-Methylaniline">mono methyl aniline</a> (M.M.A.) to 100 octane fuel. The new fuel allowed the five-minute boost rating of the Merlin 66 to be raised to +25 pounds per square inch (272 kPa; 2.7 atm). With this boost rating the Merlin 66 generated 2,000 hp (1,491 Kw) at sea-level and 1,860 hp (1,387 Kw) at .

Starting in March 1944, the Merlin 66-powered Spitfire IXs of two <a href="Air%20Defence%20of%20Great%20Britain">Air Defence of Great Britain</a> (ADGB) squadrons were cleared to use the new fuel for operational trials, and it was put to good use in the summer of 1944 when it enabled Spitfire L.F. Mk. IXs to intercept <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a>s coming in at low altitudes. 100/150 grade fuel was also used by <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a> night fighters of the ADGB to intercept V-1s. In early February 1945, Spitfires of the <a href="RAF%20Second%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Second Tactical Air Force</a> (2TAF) also began using 100/150 grade fuel. This fuel was also offered to the USAAF where it was designated "PPF 44-1" and informally known as "Pep".

Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin was driven by the forethought and determination of <a href="Ernest%20Hives%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hives">Ernest Hives</a>, who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> and local authority officials. Hives was an advocate of <a href="British%20shadow%20factories">shadow factories</a>, and, sensing the imminent outbreak of war, pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of uninterrupted production, several factories were affected by <a href="industrial%20action">industrial action</a>. By the end of its production run in 1950, 168,176 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 55,000 under licence in the U.S.

The existing Rolls-Royce facilities at <a href="Osmaston%2C%20Derby">Osmaston, Derby</a> were not suitable for large-scale engine production although the <a href="Area">floor space</a> had been increased by some 25% between 1935 and 1939; nevertheless, Hives planned to build the first two- or three hundred engines there until engineering teething troubles had been resolved. To fund this expansion, the Air Ministry had provided a total of ₤1,927,000 by December 1939. Having a workforce that consisted mainly of design engineers and highly skilled men, the Derby factory carried out the majority of development work on the Merlin, with flight testing carried out at nearby <a href="Hucknall%20Airfield">RAF Hucknall</a>. All the Merlin-engined aircraft taking part in the Battle of Britain had their engines assembled in the Derby factory.

Total Merlin production at Derby was 32,377.

The original factory closed in March 2008, but <a href="Rolls-Royce%20plc">Rolls-Royce plc</a> still maintains a large presence in Derby.

To meet the increasing demand for Merlin engines, Rolls-Royce started building work on a <a href="Bentley%20Crewe">new factory</a> at <a href="Crewe">Crewe</a> in May 1938, with engines leaving the factory in 1939. The Crewe factory had convenient road and rail links to their existing facilities at Derby. Production at Crewe was originally planned to use unskilled labour and <a href="sub-contractor">sub-contractor</a>s with which Hives felt there would be no particular difficulty, but the number of required sub-contracted parts such as crankshafts, camshafts and cylinder liners eventually fell short and the factory was expanded to manufacture these parts "in house".

Initially the local authority promised to build 1,000 new houses to accommodate the workforce by the end of 1938, but by February 1939 it had only awarded a contract for 100. Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation, but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation. In 1940 a <a href="Strike%20action">strike</a> took place when women replaced men on <a href="Turret%20lathe">capstan lathes</a>, the workers' <a href="Trade%20union">union</a> insisting this was a skilled labour job; however, the men returned to work after 10 days.

Total Merlin production at Crewe was 26,065.

The factory was used postwar for the production of Rolls-Royce and <a href="Bentley">Bentley</a> motor cars and military fighting vehicle power plants. In 1998 <a href="Volkswagen%20AG">Volkswagen AG</a> bought the Bentley marque and the factory. Today it is known as Bentley Crewe.

Hives further recommended that a factory be built near <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> to take advantage of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers. In September 1939, the <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> allocated ₤4,500,000 for a new Shadow factory. This <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government">government</a>-funded and -operated factory was built at <a href="Hillington%2C%20Scotland">Hillington</a> starting in June 1939 with workers moving into the premises in October, one month after the outbreak of war. The factory was fully occupied by September 1940. A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in.

With 16,000 employees, the Glasgow factory was one of the largest industrial operations in Scotland. Unlike the Derby and Crewe plants which relied significantly on external <a href="subcontractor">subcontractor</a>s, it produced almost all the Merlin's components itself. Engines began to leave the production line in November 1940, and by June 1941 monthly output had reached 200, increasing to more than 400 per month by March 1942. In total 23,675 engines were produced. Worker <a href="absenteeism">absenteeism</a> became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of <a href="air-raid%20shelter">air-raid shelter</a>s. It was agreed to cut the punishing working hours slightly to 82 hours a week, with one half-Sunday per month awarded as holiday. Record production is reported to have been 100 engines in one day.

Immediately after the war the site repaired and overhauled Merlin and Griffon engines, and continued to manufacture spare parts. Finally, following the production of the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Avon">Rolls-Royce Avon</a> <a href="turbojet">turbojet</a> and others, the factory was closed in 2005.

The <a href="Ford%20of%20Britain">Ford Motor Company</a> was asked to produce Merlins at <a href="Trafford%20Park">Trafford Park</a>, <a href="Stretford">Stretford</a>, near <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, and building work on a new factory was started in May 1940 on a site. Built with two distinct sections to minimise potential bomb damage, it was completed in May 1941 and bombed in the same month. At first, the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour, and large numbers of women, youths and untrained men had to be taken on. Despite this, the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month later and it was building the engine at a rate of 200 per week by 1943, at which point the joint factories were producing 18,000 Merlins per year. In his autobiography "Not much of an Engineer", Sir Stanley Hooker states: "... once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production, Merlins came out like shelling peas ...".

Some 17,316 people worked at the Trafford Park plant, including 7,260 women and two resident doctors and nurses. Merlin production started to run down in August 1945, and finally ceased on 23 March 1946.

Total Merlin production at Trafford Park was 30,428.

As the Merlin was considered to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the U.S. or Canada. <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the <a href="Packard%20Motor%20Car%20Company">Packard Motor Car Company</a> was subsequently selected to take on the <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>130,000,000 Merlin order (equivalent to $ in dollars). Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.
Total Merlin production by Packard was 55,523.

Six development engines were also made by <a href="Continental%20Motors%2C%20Inc.">Continental Motors, Inc.</a>

This is a list of representative Merlin variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Merlin. Engines of the same power output were typically assigned different model numbers based on supercharger or propeller gear ratios, differences in cooling system or carburettors, engine block construction, or arrangement of engine controls. Power ratings quoted are usually maximum "military" power. All but the Merlin 131 and 134 engines were "right-hand tractor", "i.e." the propeller rotated clockwise when viewed from the rear. In addition to the mark numbers, Merlin engines were allocated experimental numbers by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> (MoS) – e.g.: RM 8SM for the Merlin 61 and some variants – while under development; these numbers are noted where possible. Merlin engines used in <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfires</a>, apart from the Merlin 61, used a propeller reduction ratio of .477:1. Merlins used in bombers and other fighters used a ratio of .42:1.

"Data from Bridgman (Jane's) unless otherwise noted:"















In chronological order, the first operational aircraft powered by the Merlin to enter service were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, and Supermarine Spitfire. Although the engine is most closely associated with the Spitfire, the four-engined Avro Lancaster was the most numerous application, followed by the twin-engined de Havilland Mosquito.

"List from Lumsden 2003"


At the end of World War II, new versions of the Merlin (the 600- and 700-series) were designed and produced for use in commercial airliners such as the <a href="Avro%20Tudor">Avro Tudor</a>, <a href="military%20transport%20aircraft">military transport aircraft</a> such as the <a href="Avro%20York">Avro York</a>, and the <a href="Canadair%20North%20Star">Canadair North Star</a> which performed in both roles. These engines were basically military specification with some minor changes to suit the different operating environment.

A Spanish-built version of the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> G-2, the 1954 <a href="Hispano%20Aviaci%C3%B3n%20HA-1112">Hispano Aviación HA-1112-M1L "Buchon"</a>, was built in <a href="Hispano%20Aviaci%C3%B3n">Hispano's</a> factory in <a href="Seville">Seville</a> with the Rolls-Royce Merlin 500/45 engine of  – a fitting powerplant for the last-produced version of the famous Messerschmitt fighter, as the Bf 109 V1 prototype aircraft had been powered by the Rolls-Royce Kestrel V-12 engine in 1935.

The <a href="CASA%202.111">CASA 2.111</a> was another Spanish-built version of a German aircraft, the <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a>, that was adapted to use the Merlin after the supply of <a href="Junkers%20Jumo%20211">Junkers Jumo 211</a>F-2 engines ran out at the end of the war. A similar situation existed with the <a href="Fiat%20G.55%23GY">Fiat G.59</a> when available stocks of the Italian licence-built version of the <a href="Daimler-Benz%20DB%20605">Daimler-Benz DB 605</a> engine ran short.

The Australian built <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a> from A73-51 used Australian built <a href="Commonwealth%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation</a> Merlin 102s.
A total of 108 CAC Merlins were built by the time production ended.

A non-supercharged version of the Merlin using a larger proportion of steel and iron components was produced for use in <a href="tank">tank</a>s. This engine, the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Meteor">Rolls-Royce Meteor</a>, in turn led to the smaller <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Meteorite">Rolls-Royce Meteorite</a>. In 1943, further Meteor development was handed over to <a href="Rover%20Company">Rover</a>, in exchange for Rover's <a href="Rover%20Company%23Second%20World%20War%20and%20gas%20turbines">gas turbine</a> interests.

In 1938, Rolls-Royce started work on modifying some Merlins which were later to be used in British <a href="Motor%20Torpedo%20Boat">MTBs</a>, <a href="Motor%20Gun%20Boat">MGBs</a>, and RAF Air-Sea Rescue Launches. For these the superchargers were modified single-stage units and the engine was re-engineered for use in a marine environment. Some 70 engines were converted before priority was given to producing aero engines.

Experiments were carried out by the <a href="Irish%20Army">Irish Army</a> involving replacing the Bedford engine of a <a href="Churchill%20tank">Churchill tank</a> with a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine salvaged from an <a href="Irish%20Air%20Corps">Irish Air Corps</a> <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Seafire</a> aircraft. The experiment was not a success, although the reasons are not recorded.

One of the most successful of the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> era aircraft engines, the Merlin continues to be used in many restored World War II vintage aircraft all over the world. The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain%20Memorial%20Flight">Battle of Britain Memorial Flight</a> is a notable current operator of the Merlin. In England the <a href="Shuttleworth%20Collection">Shuttleworth Collection</a> owns and operates a Merlin-powered Hawker Sea Hurricane IB and a Supermarine Spitfire VC – the Hurricane can be seen flying at home displays throughout the summer months, while the Spitfire is currently undergoing a major restoration.

Preserved examples of the Rolls-Royce Merlin are on display at the following <a href="Aviation%20museum">museums</a>:

J. Robert Oppenheimer

Julius Robert Oppenheimer (; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physicist</a> and professor of physics at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Oppenheimer was the wartime head of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> and is among those who are credited with being the "father of the atomic bomb" for their role in the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> undertaking that developed the first <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. The first atomic bomb was successfully detonated on July 16, 1945, in the <a href="Trinity%20test">Trinity test</a> in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Oppenheimer later remarked that it brought to mind words from the "<a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>": "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." In August 1945, the weapons were used in the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>, which resulted in Japan's unconditional surrender.

After the war ended, Oppenheimer became chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a>. He used that position to lobby for international control of <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> to avert <a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> and a <a href="nuclear%20arms%20race">nuclear arms race</a> with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the <a href="Second%20Red%20Scare">Second Red Scare</a>, he suffered the revocation of his <a href="security%20clearance%23United%20States">security clearance</a> in a much-publicized <a href="Oppenheimer%20security%20hearing">hearing</a> in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> awarded (and <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> presented) him with the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Award">Enrico Fermi Award</a> as a gesture of <a href="political%20rehabilitation">political rehabilitation</a>.

Oppenheimer's achievements in physics included the <a href="Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%20approximation">Born–Oppenheimer approximation</a> for molecular <a href="wave%20function">wave function</a>s, work on the theory of <a href="electron">electron</a>s and <a href="positron">positron</a>s, the <a href="Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Phillips%20process">Oppenheimer–Phillips process</a> in <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>, and the first prediction of <a href="quantum%20tunneling">quantum tunneling</a>. With his students he also made important contributions to the modern theory of <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s and <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s, as well as to <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>, and the interactions of <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s. As a teacher and promoter of science, he is remembered as a founding father of the American school of theoretical physics that gained world prominence in the 1930s. After World War II, he became director of the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>.

Oppenheimer was born in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Julius Oppenheimer, a wealthy <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish textile importer who had immigrated to the United States from Germany in 1888, and Ella Friedman, a painter. Julius came to America with no money, no baccalaureate studies, and no knowledge of the English language. He got a job in a textile company and within a decade was an executive with the company. Ella was from Baltimore. The Oppenheimers were non-observant <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a>. In 1912 the family moved to an apartment on the 11th floor of 155 <a href="Riverside%20Drive%20%28Manhattan%29">Riverside Drive</a>, near West 88th Street, <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses. Their art collection included works by <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href="%C3%89douard%20Vuillard">Édouard Vuillard</a>, and at least three original paintings by <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a>. Robert had a younger brother, <a href="Frank%20Oppenheimer">Frank</a>, who also became a physicist.

Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory School, and in 1911, he entered the <a href="Ethical%20Culture%20Fieldston%20School">Ethical Culture Society School</a>. This had been founded by <a href="Felix%20Adler%20%28Society%20for%20Ethical%20Culture%29">Felix Adler</a> to promote a form of ethical training based on the <a href="Ethical%20Culture">Ethical Culture</a> movement, whose motto was "Deed before Creed". His father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its board of trustees from 1907 to 1915. Oppenheimer was a versatile scholar, interested in English and French literature, and particularly in <a href="mineralogy">mineralogy</a>. He completed the third and fourth grades in one year, and skipped half the eighth grade. During his final year, he became interested in chemistry. He entered <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> one year after graduation, at age 18, because he suffered an attack of <a href="ulcerative%20colitis">colitis</a> while <a href="prospecting">prospecting</a> in <a href="Joachimstal">Joachimstal</a> during a family summer vacation in Europe. To help him recover from the illness, his father enlisted the help of his English teacher Herbert Smith who took him to New Mexico, where Oppenheimer fell in love with horseback riding and the southwestern United States.

Oppenheimer majored in chemistry, but Harvard required science students to also study history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. He compensated for his late start by taking six courses each term and was admitted to the undergraduate <a href="honor%20society">honor society</a> <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. In his first year, he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he was not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> that was taught by <a href="Percy%20Williams%20Bridgman">Percy Bridgman</a>. He graduated <a href="summa%20cum%20laude">summa cum laude</a> in three years.

In 1924, Oppenheimer was informed that he had been accepted into <a href="Christ%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Christ's College, Cambridge</a>. He wrote to <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> requesting permission to work at the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a>. Bridgman provided Oppenheimer with a recommendation, which conceded that Oppenheimer's clumsiness in the laboratory made it apparent his forte was not experimental but rather theoretical physics. Rutherford was unimpressed, but Oppenheimer went to Cambridge in the hope of landing another offer. He was ultimately accepted by <a href="J.%20J.%20Thomson">J. J. Thomson</a> on condition that he complete a basic laboratory course. He developed an antagonistic relationship with his tutor, <a href="Patrick%20Blackett%2C%20Baron%20Blackett">Patrick Blackett</a>, who was only a few years his senior. While on vacation, as recalled by his friend <a href="Francis%20Fergusson">Francis Fergusson</a>, Oppenheimer once confessed that he had left an apple doused with noxious chemicals on Blackett's desk. While Fergusson's account is the only detailed version of this event, Oppenheimer's parents were alerted by the university authorities who considered placing him on probation, a fate prevented by his parents successfully lobbying the authorities.

Oppenheimer was a tall, thin <a href="Chain%20smoking">chain smoker</a>, who often neglected to eat during periods of intense thought and concentration. Many of his friends described him as having self-destructive tendencies. A disturbing event occurred when he took a vacation from his studies in Cambridge to meet up with Fergusson in Paris. Fergusson noticed that Oppenheimer was not well. To help distract him from his depression, Fergusson told Oppenheimer that he (Fergusson) was to marry his girlfriend Frances Keeley. Oppenheimer did not take the news well. He jumped on Fergusson and tried to strangle him. Although Fergusson easily fended off the attack, the episode convinced him of Oppenheimer's deep psychological troubles. Throughout his life, Oppenheimer was plagued by periods of depression, and he once told his brother, "I need physics more than friends".

In 1926, Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a> to study under <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a>. Göttingen was one of the world's leading centers for theoretical physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a>, <a href="Pascual%20Jordan">Pascual Jordan</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a>, <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that <a href="Maria%20Goeppert">Maria Goeppert</a> presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.

He obtained his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> degree in March 1927 at age 23, supervised by Born. After the oral exam, <a href="James%20Franck">James Franck</a>, the professor administering, reportedly said, "I'm glad that's over. He was on the point of questioning "me"." Oppenheimer published more than a dozen papers at Göttingen, including many important contributions to the new field of quantum mechanics. He and Born published a famous paper on the <a href="Born%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%20approximation">Born–Oppenheimer approximation</a>, which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in the mathematical treatment of molecules, allowing nuclear motion to be neglected to simplify calculations. It remains his most <a href="citation">cited</a> work.

Oppenheimer was awarded a <a href="United%20States%20National%20Research%20Council">United States National Research Council</a> fellowship to the <a href="California%20Institute%20of%20Technology">California Institute of Technology</a> (Caltech) in September 1927. Bridgman also wanted him at Harvard, so a compromise was reached whereby he split his fellowship for the 1927–28 academic year between Harvard in 1927 and Caltech in 1928. At Caltech he struck up a close friendship with <a href="Linus%20Pauling">Linus Pauling</a>, and they planned to mount a joint attack on the nature of the <a href="chemical%20bond">chemical bond</a>, a field in which Pauling was a pioneer, with Oppenheimer supplying the mathematics and Pauling interpreting the results. Both the collaboration and their friendship were nipped in the bud when Pauling began to suspect Oppenheimer of becoming too close to his wife, <a href="Ava%20Helen%20Pauling">Ava Helen Pauling</a>. Once, when Pauling was at work, Oppenheimer had arrived at their home and invited Ava Helen to join him on a tryst in Mexico. Though she refused and reported the incident to her husband, the invitation, and her apparent nonchalance about it, disquieted Pauling and he ended his relationship with Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer later invited him to become head of the Chemistry Division of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, but Pauling refused, saying he was a pacifist.

In the autumn of 1928, Oppenheimer visited <a href="Paul%20Ehrenfest">Paul Ehrenfest</a>'s institute at the <a href="University%20of%20Leiden">University of Leiden</a>, the Netherlands, where he impressed by giving lectures in Dutch, despite having little experience with the language. There he was given the nickname of "Opje", later anglicized by his students as "Oppie". From Leiden he continued on to the <a href="ETH">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH)</a> in Zurich to work with <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> on <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> and the <a href="continuous%20spectrum">continuous spectrum</a>. Oppenheimer respected and liked Pauli and may have emulated his personal style as well as his critical approach to problems.
On returning to the United States, Oppenheimer accepted an associate professorship from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, where <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Birge">Raymond T. Birge</a> wanted him so badly that he expressed a willingness to share him with Caltech.

Before he began his Berkeley professorship, Oppenheimer was diagnosed with a mild case of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and spent some weeks with his brother Frank at a New Mexico ranch, which he leased and eventually purchased. When he heard the ranch was available for lease, he exclaimed, "Hot dog!", and later called it "Perro Caliente", literally "hot dog" in Spanish. Later he used to say that "physics and desert country" were his "two great loves". He recovered from tuberculosis and returned to Berkeley, where he prospered as an advisor and collaborator to a generation of physicists who admired him for his intellectual virtuosity and broad interests. His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one that saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other that saw him as a pretentious and insecure poseur. His students almost always fell into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages. <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a> said of him:

He worked closely with <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize</a>-winning experimental physicist <a href="Ernest%20O.%20Lawrence">Ernest O. Lawrence</a> and his <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> pioneers, helping them understand the data their machines were producing at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. In 1936, Berkeley promoted him to full professor at a salary of $3,300 a year (). In return he was asked to curtail his teaching at Caltech, so a compromise was reached whereby Berkeley released him for six weeks each year, enough to teach one term at Caltech.

Oppenheimer did important research in <a href="theoretical%20astronomy">theoretical astronomy</a> (especially as related to <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> and nuclear theory), <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>, <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a>, and <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>, including its extension into <a href="quantum%20electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a>. The <a href="Formalism%20%28mathematics%29">formal mathematics</a> of <a href="special%20relativity">relativistic</a> <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> also attracted his attention, although he doubted its validity. His work predicted many later finds, which include the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>, <a href="meson">meson</a> and <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>.

Initially, his major interest was the theory of the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its <a href="transition%20probabilities">transition probabilities</a>. He calculated the <a href="photoelectric%20effect">photoelectric effect</a> for <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="X-rays">X-rays</a>, obtaining the <a href="absorption%20coefficient">absorption coefficient</a> at the <a href="K-edge">K-edge</a>. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.
Oppenheimer also made important contributions to the theory of <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a> showers and started work that eventually led to descriptions of <a href="quantum%20tunneling">quantum tunneling</a>. In 1931, he co-wrote a paper on the "Relativistic Theory of the Photoelectric Effect" with his student Harvey Hall, in which, based on empirical evidence, he correctly disputed Dirac's assertion that two of the <a href="energy%20level">energy level</a>s of the <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atom have the same energy. Subsequently, one of his doctoral students, <a href="Willis%20Lamb">Willis Lamb</a>, determined that this was a consequence of what became known as the <a href="Lamb%20shift">Lamb shift</a>, for which Lamb was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1955.

Oppenheimer worked with his first doctoral student, a woman named <a href="Melba%20Phillips">Melba Phillips</a>, on calculations of artificial radioactivity under bombardment by <a href="deuterons">deuterons</a>. When <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a> and <a href="Edwin%20McMillan">Edwin McMillan</a> bombarded <a href="Atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> with deuterons they found the results agreed closely with the predictions of <a href="George%20Gamow">George Gamow</a>, but when higher energies and heavier nuclei were involved, the results did not conform to the theory. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips worked out a theory—now known as the <a href="Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Phillips%20process">Oppenheimer–Phillips process</a>—to explain the results; this theory is still in use today.

As early as 1930, Oppenheimer wrote a paper that essentially predicted the existence of the <a href="positron">positron</a>. This was after a paper by <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a> proposed that electrons could have both a positive charge and negative energy. Dirac's paper introduced an equation, known as the <a href="Dirac%20equation">Dirac equation</a>, which unified quantum mechanics, <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> and the then-new concept of electron <a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>, to explain the <a href="Zeeman%20effect">Zeeman effect</a>. Oppenheimer, drawing on the body of experimental evidence, rejected the idea that the predicted positively charged electrons were <a href="proton">proton</a>s. He argued that they would have to have the same mass as an electron, whereas experiments showed that protons were much heavier than electrons. Two years later, <a href="Carl%20David%20Anderson">Carl David Anderson</a> discovered the positron, for which he received the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics.

In the late 1930s, Oppenheimer became interested in <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>, most likely through his friendship with <a href="Richard%20Tolman">Richard Tolman</a>, resulting in a series of papers. In the first of these, a 1938 paper co-written with <a href="Robert%20Serber">Robert Serber</a> entitled "On the Stability of Stellar Neutron Cores", Oppenheimer explored the properties of <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s. This was followed by a paper co-written with one of his students, <a href="George%20Volkoff">George Volkoff</a>, "On Massive Neutron Cores", in which they demonstrated that there was a limit, the so-called <a href="Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff%20limit">Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit</a>, to the <a href="mass">mass</a> of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as <a href="neutron%20stars">neutron stars</a> and would undergo gravitational collapse. Finally, in 1939, Oppenheimer and another of his students, <a href="Hartland%20Snyder">Hartland Snyder</a>, produced a paper "On Continued Gravitational Attraction", which predicted the existence of what are today known as <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s. After the Born–Oppenheimer approximation paper, these papers remain his most cited, and were key factors in the rejuvenation of astrophysical research in the United States in the 1950s, mainly by <a href="John%20A.%20Wheeler">John A. Wheeler</a>.

Oppenheimer's papers were considered difficult to understand even by the standards of the abstract topics he was expert in. He was fond of using elegant, if extremely complex, mathematical techniques to demonstrate physical principles, though he was sometimes criticized for making mathematical mistakes, presumably out of haste. "His physics was good", said his student Snyder, "but his arithmetic awful".

Oppenheimer published only five scientific papers, one of which was in biophysics, after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and none after 1950. <a href="Murray%20Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a>, a later Nobelist who, as a visiting scientist, worked with him at the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in 1951, offered this opinion: 

Oppenheimer's diverse interests sometimes interrupted his focus on science. In 1933, he learned <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> and met the Indologist <a href="Arthur%20W.%20Ryder">Arthur W. Ryder</a> at Berkeley. He read the "<a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>" in the original Sanskrit, and later he cited it as one of the books that most shaped his philosophy of life. His close confidant and colleague, Nobel Prize winner <a href="Isidor%20Rabi">Isidor Rabi</a>, later gave his own interpretation:

In spite of this, observers such as Nobel Prize-winning physicist <a href="Luis%20Walter%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a> have suggested that if he had lived long enough to see his predictions substantiated by experiment, Oppenheimer might have won a Nobel Prize for his work on <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a>, concerning neutron stars and black holes. In retrospect, some physicists and historians consider this to be his most important contribution, though it was not taken up by other scientists in his own lifetime. The physicist and historian <a href="Abraham%20Pais">Abraham Pais</a> once asked Oppenheimer what he considered to be his most important scientific contributions; Oppenheimer cited his work on electrons and positrons, not his work on gravitational contraction. Oppenheimer was nominated for the Nobel Prize for physics three times, in 1945, 1951 and 1967, but never won.

During the 1920s, Oppenheimer remained uninformed on worldly matters. He claimed that he did not read newspapers or listen to the radio and had only learned of the <a href="Wall%20Street%20crash%20of%201929">Wall Street crash of 1929</a> while he was on a walk with Ernest Lawrence some six months after the crash occurred. He once remarked that he never cast a vote until the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201936">1936 presidential election</a>. However, from 1934 on, he became increasingly concerned about politics and international affairs. In 1934, he earmarked three percent of his annual salary—about $100 ()—for two years to support German physicists fleeing from <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. During the <a href="1934%20West%20Coast%20Waterfront%20Strike">1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike</a>, he and some of his students, including Melba Phillips and Bob Serber, attended a longshoremen's rally. Oppenheimer repeatedly attempted to get Serber a position at Berkeley but was blocked by <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Birge">Birge</a>, who felt that "one Jew in the department was enough".
Oppenheimer's mother died in 1931, and he became closer to his father who, although still living in New York, became a frequent visitor in California. When his father died in 1937 leaving $392,602 to be divided between Oppenheimer and his brother Frank, Oppenheimer immediately wrote out a will that left his estate to the University of California to be used for graduate scholarships. Like many young intellectuals in the 1930s, he supported social reforms that were later alleged to be <a href="Communism">communist</a> ideas. He donated to many progressive efforts that were later branded as "<a href="leftist">left-wing</a>" during the <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">McCarthy</a> era. The majority of his allegedly radical work consisted of hosting fundraisers for the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Republican</a> cause in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> and other <a href="anti-fascist">anti-fascist</a> activity. He never openly joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party</a>, though he did pass money to <a href="Liberalism">liberal</a> causes by way of acquaintances who were alleged to be Party members. In 1936, Oppenheimer became involved with <a href="Jean%20Tatlock">Jean Tatlock</a>, the daughter of a Berkeley literature professor and a student at <a href="Stanford%20University%20School%20of%20Medicine">Stanford University School of Medicine</a>. The two had similar political views; she wrote for the "Western Worker", a Communist Party newspaper.

Tatlock broke up with Oppenheimer in 1939, after a tempestuous relationship. In August of that year, he met <a href="Katherine%20Oppenheimer">Katherine ("Kitty") Puening</a>, a radical Berkeley student and former Communist Party member. Kitty had been married before. Her first marriage lasted only a few months. Her second, <a href="common-law%20marriage">common-law marriage</a> husband was Joe Dallet, an active member of the Communist party, who was killed in the Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned to the United States where she obtained a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in <a href="botany">botany</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. There she married Richard Harrison, a physician and medical researcher, in 1938. In June 1939 Kitty and Harrison moved to <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she enrolled as a graduate student at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a>. Oppenheimer and Kitty created a minor scandal by sleeping together after one of Tolman's parties. In the summer of 1940 she stayed with Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. She finally asked Harrison for a divorce when she found out she was pregnant. When he refused, she obtained an instant divorce in <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno, Nevada</a>, and took Oppenheimer as her fourth husband on November 1, 1940.

Their first child Peter was born in May 1941, and their second child, Katherine ("Toni"), was born in <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>, on December 7, 1944. During his marriage, Oppenheimer continued his affair with Jean Tatlock. Later their continued contact became an issue in his security clearance hearings because of Tatlock's Communist associations. Many of Oppenheimer's closest associates were active in the Communist Party in the 1930s or 1940s. They included his brother Frank, Frank's wife Jackie, Kitty, Jean Tatlock, his landlady Mary Ellen Washburn, and several of his graduate students at Berkeley.

When he joined the Manhattan Project in 1942, Oppenheimer wrote on his personal security questionnaire that he [Oppenheimer] had been "a member of just about every Communist Front organization on the West Coast". Years later he claimed that he did not remember saying this, that it was not true, and that if he had said anything along those lines, it was "a half-jocular overstatement". He was a subscriber to the "<a href="People%27s%20World">People's World</a>", a Communist Party organ, and he testified in 1954, "I was associated with the Communist movement." From 1937 to 1942, Oppenheimer was a member at Berkeley of what he called a "discussion group", which was later identified by fellow members, <a href="Haakon%20Chevalier">Haakon Chevalier</a> and Gordon Griffiths, as a "closed" (secret) unit of the Communist Party for Berkeley faculty.

The <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941. It recorded that he attended a meeting in December 1940 at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman, and its treasurer <a href="Isaac%20Folkoff">Isaac Folkoff</a>. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, which it considered a Communist front organization. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its <a href="Custodial%20Detention%20Index">Custodial Detention Index</a>, for arrest in case of national emergency. Debates over Oppenheimer's Party membership or lack thereof have turned on very fine points; almost all historians agree he had strong left-wing sympathies during this time and interacted with Party members, though there is considerable dispute over whether he was officially a member of the Party. At his 1954 security clearance hearings, he denied being a member of the Communist Party, but identified himself as a <a href="fellow%20traveler">fellow traveler</a>, which he defined as someone who agrees with many of the goals of Communism, but without being willing to blindly follow orders from any Communist party apparatus.

Throughout the development of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer was under investigation by both the FBI and the Manhattan Project's internal security arm for his past left-wing associations. He was followed by Army security agents during a trip to <a href="California">California</a> in June 1943 to visit his former girlfriend, Jean Tatlock, who was suffering from <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>. Oppenheimer spent the night in her apartment. Tatlock committed suicide on January 4, 1944, which left Oppenheimer deeply grieved. In August 1943, he volunteered to Manhattan Project security agents that George Eltenton, whom he did not know, had solicited three men at Los Alamos for nuclear secrets on behalf of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. When pressed on the issue in later interviews, Oppenheimer admitted that the only person who had approached him was his friend Haakon Chevalier, a Berkeley professor of French literature, who had mentioned the matter privately at a dinner at Oppenheimer's house. <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, the director of the Manhattan Project, thought Oppenheimer was too important to the project to be ousted over this suspicious behavior. On July 20, 1943, he wrote to the Manhattan Engineer District:

On October 9, 1941, two months before the United States entered World War II, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> approved a crash program to develop an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>. In May 1942, <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> Chairman <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a>, who had been one of Oppenheimer's lecturers at Harvard, invited Oppenheimer to take over work on fast neutron calculations, a task that Oppenheimer threw himself into with full vigor. He was given the title "Coordinator of Rapid Rupture", which specifically referred to the propagation of a fast neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to host a summer school for bomb theory at his building in Berkeley. The mix of European physicists and his own students—a group including Robert Serber, <a href="Emil%20Konopinski">Emil Konopinski</a>, <a href="Felix%20Bloch">Felix Bloch</a>, <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a> and <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>—kept themselves busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make the bomb.
In June 1942, the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a> established the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> to handle its part in the atom bomb project and began the process of transferring responsibility from the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> to the military. In September, Groves was appointed director of what became known as the Manhattan Project. He selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret weapons laboratory. This was a choice that surprised many because Oppenheimer had left-wing political views and no record as a leader of large projects. Groves was concerned by the fact that Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize and might not have had the prestige to direct fellow scientists. However, he was impressed by Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of designing and constructing an atomic bomb, and by the breadth of his knowledge. As a <a href="military%20engineer">military engineer</a>, Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve not just physics, but chemistry, <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>, <a href="explosive%20weapon">ordnance</a> and <a href="engineering">engineering</a>. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many others did not, an "overweening ambition" that Groves reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful conclusion. Isidor Rabi considered the appointment "a real stroke of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally considered to be a genius".

Oppenheimer and Groves decided that for security and cohesion they needed a centralized, secret research laboratory in a remote location. Scouting for a site in late 1942, Oppenheimer was drawn to New Mexico, not far from his ranch. On November 16, 1942, Oppenheimer, Groves and others toured a prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel <a href="claustrophobic">claustrophobic</a>, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. He then suggested and championed a site that he knew well: a flat <a href="mesa">mesa</a> near <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>, which was the site of a private boys' school called the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Ranch%20School">Los Alamos Ranch School</a>. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road and the water supply, but otherwise felt that it was ideal. The <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> was built on the site of the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many new buildings were erected in great haste. At the laboratory, Oppenheimer assembled a group of the top physicists of the time, which he referred to as the "luminaries".

Los Alamos was initially supposed to be a military laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at , diagnosed his chronic cough as <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and were concerned about his chronic <a href="lumbosacral%20joint">lumbosacral joint</a> pain. The plan to commission scientists fell through when <a href="Robert%20Bacher">Robert Bacher</a> and Isidor Rabi balked at the idea. Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a>. It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely underestimated the magnitude of the project; Los Alamos grew from a few hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945.

Oppenheimer at first had difficulty with the organizational division of large groups, but rapidly learned the art of large-scale administration after he took up permanent residence on the mesa. He was noted for his mastery of all scientific aspects of the project and for his efforts to control the inevitable cultural conflicts between scientists and the military. He was an iconic figure to his fellow scientists, as much a symbol of what they were working toward as a scientific director. <a href="Victor%20Weisskopf">Victor Weisskopf</a> put it thus:

In 1943 development efforts were directed to a <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> <a href="gun-type%20fission%20weapon">gun-type fission weapon</a> called "<a href="Thin%20Man%20%28nuclear%20bomb%29">Thin Man</a>". Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a>-generated <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, which was extremely pure but could only be created in tiny amounts. When Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> in April 1944 a problem was discovered: reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of <a href="plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a>, making it unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. In July 1944, Oppenheimer abandoned the gun design in favor of an <a href="Nuclear%20weapon%20design">implosion-type</a> weapon. Using chemical <a href="explosive%20lens">explosive lens</a>es, a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form. The metal needed to travel only very short distances, so the critical mass would be assembled in much less time. In August 1944 Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. He concentrated the development efforts on the gun-type device, a simpler design that only had to work with <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a>, in a single group, and this device became <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> in February 1945. After a mammoth research effort, the more complex design of the implosion device, known as the "Christy gadget" after <a href="Robert%20Christy">Robert Christy</a>, another student of Oppenheimer's, was finalized in a meeting in Oppenheimer's office on February 28, 1945.

In May 1945 an <a href="Interim%20Committee">Interim Committee</a> was created to advise and report on wartime and postwar policies regarding the use of nuclear energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.

The joint work of the scientists at Los Alamos resulted in the world's first <a href="nuclear%20explosion">nuclear explosion</a>, near <a href="Alamogordo%2C%20New%20Mexico">Alamogordo, New Mexico</a> on July 16, 1945. Oppenheimer had given the site the codename "<a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity</a>" in mid-1944 and said later that it was from one of <a href="John%20Donne">John Donne</a>'s <a href="Holy%20Sonnets">Holy Sonnets</a>. According to the historian Gregg Herken, this naming could have been an allusion to Jean Tatlock, who had committed suicide a few months previously and had in the 1930s introduced Oppenheimer to Donne's work. Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the "Bhagavad Gita" (XI,12): "divi sūrya-sahasrasya bhaved yugapad utthitā yadi bhāḥ sadṛṥī sā syād bhāsas tasya mahāḥmanaḥ" 

Years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time: namely, the famous verse:
"" (XI,32), which he translated as "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

In 1965, he was persuaded to quote again for a television broadcast:

Brigadier General <a href="Thomas%20Farrell%20%28general%29">Thomas Farrell</a>, who was present in the control bunker at the site with Oppenheimer, summarized his reaction as follows:

Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: "I'll never forget his walk; I'll never forget the way he stepped out of the car ... his walk was like "High Noon" ... this kind of strut. He had done it." At an assembly at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a>), Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his hands together "like a prize-winning boxer" while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he and many of the project staff were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War <a href="Henry%20L.%20Stimson">Henry L. Stimson</a> expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman and put an end to the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State <a href="Dean%20Acheson">Dean Acheson</a> "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again."

For his services as director of Los Alamos, Oppenheimer was awarded the <a href="Medal%20for%20Merit">Medal for Merit</a> from President <a href="Harry%20S%20Truman">Harry S Truman</a> in 1946.

The Manhattan Project was top secret and did not become public knowledge until after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer became a national spokesman for science who was emblematic of a new type of technocratic power. He became a household name and his portrait appeared on the covers of "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>". Nuclear physics became a powerful force as all governments of the world began to realize the strategic and political power that came with nuclear weapons. Like many scientists of his generation, he felt that security from atomic bombs would come only from a transnational organization such as the newly formed <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, which could institute a program to stifle a <a href="nuclear%20arms%20race">nuclear arms race</a>.

In November 1945, Oppenheimer left Los Alamos to return to Caltech, but he soon found that his heart was no longer in teaching. In 1947, he accepted an offer from <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a> to take up the directorship of the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>. This meant moving back east and leaving Ruth Tolman, the wife of his friend Richard Tolman, with whom he had begun an affair after leaving Los Alamos. The job came with a salary of $20,000 per annum, plus rent-free accommodation in the director's house, a 17th-century manor with a cook and <a href="groundskeeper">groundskeeper</a>, surrounded by of woodlands.
Oppenheimer brought together intellectuals at the height of their powers and from a variety of disciplines to answer the most pertinent questions of the age. He directed and encouraged the research of many well-known scientists, including <a href="Freeman%20Dyson">Freeman Dyson</a>, and the duo of <a href="Chen%20Ning%20Yang">Chen Ning Yang</a> and <a href="Tsung-Dao%20Lee">Tsung-Dao Lee</a>, who won a Nobel Prize for their discovery of <a href="Parity%20%28physics%29">parity</a> non-conservation. He also instituted temporary memberships for scholars from the humanities, such as <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> and <a href="George%20F.%20Kennan">George F. Kennan</a>. Some of these activities were resented by a few members of the mathematics faculty, who wanted the institute to stay a bastion of pure scientific research. Abraham Pais said that Oppenheimer himself thought that one of his failures at the institute was being unable to bring together scholars from the natural sciences and the humanities.

During a series of conferences in New York from 1947 through 1949, physicists switched back from war work to theoretical issues. Under Oppenheimer's direction, physicists tackled the greatest outstanding problem of the pre-war years: infinite, divergent, and non-sensical expressions in the <a href="quantum%20electrodynamics">quantum electrodynamics</a> of <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s. <a href="Julian%20Schwinger">Julian Schwinger</a>, <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> and <a href="Shin%27ichiro%20Tomonaga">Shin'ichiro Tomonaga</a> tackled the problem of <a href="Regularization%20%28physics%29">regularization</a>, and developed techniques which became known as <a href="renormalization">renormalization</a>. Freeman Dyson was able to prove that their procedures gave similar results. The problem of meson absorption and <a href="Hideki%20Yukawa">Hideki Yukawa</a>'s theory of <a href="meson">meson</a>s as the carrier particles of the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong nuclear force</a> were also tackled. Probing questions from Oppenheimer prompted <a href="Robert%20Marshak">Robert Marshak</a>'s innovative two-<a href="meson">meson</a> <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a>: that there were actually two types of mesons, <a href="pion">pion</a>s and <a href="muon">muon</a>s. This led to <a href="Cecil%20Frank%20Powell">Cecil Frank Powell</a>'s breakthrough and subsequent Nobel Prize for the discovery of the pion.

As a member of the Board of Consultants to a committee appointed by Truman, Oppenheimer strongly influenced the <a href="Acheson%E2%80%93Lilienthal%20Report">Acheson–Lilienthal Report</a>. In this report, the committee advocated creation of an international Atomic Development Authority, which would own all fissionable material and the means of its production, such as mines and laboratories, and atomic power plants where it could be used for peaceful energy production. <a href="Bernard%20Baruch">Bernard Baruch</a> was appointed to translate this report into a proposal to the United Nations, resulting in the <a href="Baruch%20Plan">Baruch Plan</a> of 1946. The Baruch Plan introduced many additional provisions regarding enforcement, in particular requiring inspection of the Soviet Union's uranium resources. The Baruch Plan was seen as an attempt to maintain the United States' nuclear monopoly and was rejected by the Soviets. With this, it became clear to Oppenheimer that an arms race was unavoidable, due to the mutual suspicion of the United States and the Soviet Union, which even Oppenheimer was starting to distrust.
After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) came into being in 1947 as a civilian agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the Chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position he advised on a number of nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded. As Chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race. When the government questioned whether to pursue a crash program to develop an atomic weapon based on <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>—the <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>—Oppenheimer initially recommended against it, though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during the Manhattan Project. He was motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets, resulting in millions of deaths. He was also motivated by practical concerns, however, as at the time there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons. He and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to <a href="tritium">tritium</a> production. They were overridden by Truman, who announced a crash program after the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949. Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially <a href="James%20Bryant%20Conant">James Conant</a>, felt personally shunned and considered retiring from the committee. They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known.

In 1951, however, <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a> and mathematician <a href="Stanislaw%20Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a> developed what became known as the <a href="Teller-Ulam%20design">Teller-Ulam design</a> for a hydrogen bomb. This new design seemed technically feasible and Oppenheimer changed his opinion about developing the weapon. As he later recalled:

The FBI under <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> had been following Oppenheimer since before the war, when he showed Communist sympathies as a professor at Berkeley and had been close to members of the Communist Party, including his wife and brother. He had been under close surveillance since the early 1940s, his home and office bugged, his phone tapped and his mail opened. The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political enemies with incriminating evidence about his Communist ties. These enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier; regarding Strauss's opposition to the export of radioactive isotopes to other nations, Oppenheimer had memorably categorized these as "less important than electronic devices but more important than, let us say, vitamins".
On June 7, 1949, Oppenheimer testified before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s. He testified that some of his students, including <a href="David%20Bohm">David Bohm</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Rossi%20Lomanitz">Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz</a>, <a href="Philip%20Morrison">Philip Morrison</a>, Bernard Peters and Joseph Weinberg, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Frank Oppenheimer and his wife Jackie testified before the HUAC and admitted that they had been members of the Communist Party. Frank was subsequently fired from his <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> position. Unable to find work in physics for many years, he became instead a cattle rancher in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>. He later taught high school physics and was the founder of the San Francisco <a href="Exploratorium">Exploratorium</a>.

Oppenheimer had found himself in the middle of more than one controversy and power struggle in the years from 1949 to 1953. Edward Teller, who had been so uninterested in work on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos during the war that Oppenheimer had given him time instead to work on his own project of the hydrogen bomb, had eventually left Los Alamos in 1951 to help found, in 1952, a second laboratory at what would become the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a>. There, he could be free of Los Alamos control to develop the hydrogen bomb. Long-range thermonuclear "strategic" weapons delivered by jet bombers would necessarily be under control of the new <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF). Oppenheimer had for some years pushed for smaller "tactical" nuclear weapons which would be more useful in a limited theater against enemy troops and which would be under control of the Army. The two services fought for control of nuclear weapons, often allied with different political parties. The USAF, with Teller pushing its program, gained ascendance in the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>-controlled administration following the election of <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> as president in 1952.

Strauss and Senator <a href="Brien%20McMahon">Brien McMahon</a>, author of the 1946 <a href="McMahon%20Act">McMahon Act</a>, pushed Eisenhower to revoke Oppenheimer's security clearance. On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, pending resolution of a series of charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from <a href="Kenneth%20D.%20Nichols">Kenneth D. Nichols</a>, General Manager of the AEC. The hearing that followed in April–May 1954, which was initially confidential and not made public, focused on Oppenheimer's past Communist ties and his association during the Manhattan Project with suspected disloyal or Communist scientists. The US <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">Department of Energy</a> made public the full text of the transcript in October 2014.
One of the key elements in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.

Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that: 

This led to outrage by the scientific community and Teller's virtual expulsion from academic science. Ernest Lawrence refused to testify on the grounds that he was suffering from an attack of <a href="ulcerative%20colitis">ulcerative colitis</a>, but an interview transcript in which he condemned Oppenheimer was presented as evidence in his absence. Groves, threatened by the FBI as having been potentially part of a coverup about the Chevalier contact in 1943, likewise testified against Oppenheimer. Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Inconsistencies in his testimony and his erratic behavior on the stand, at one point saying he had given a "cock and bull story" and that this was because he "was an idiot", convinced some that he was unstable, unreliable and a possible security risk. Oppenheimer's clearance was revoked one day before it was due to lapse anyway. Isidor Rabi's comment was that Oppenheimer was merely a government consultant at the time anyway and that if the government "didn't want to consult the guy, then don't consult him".

During his hearing, Oppenheimer testified willingly on the left-wing behavior of many of his scientific colleagues. Had Oppenheimer's clearance not been stripped then he might have been remembered as someone who had "named names" to save his own reputation. As it happened, Oppenheimer was seen by most of the scientific community as a martyr to <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, an eclectic liberal who was unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific creativity from academia into the military. <a href="Wernher%20von%20Braun">Wernher von Braun</a> summed up his opinion about the matter with a quip to a Congressional committee: "In England, Oppenheimer would have been knighted."

In a seminar at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, based on an extensive analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, <a href="John%20Earl%20Haynes">John Earl Haynes</a>, <a href="Harvey%20Klehr">Harvey Klehr</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Vassiliev">Alexander Vassiliev</a> confirmed that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviet Union. The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but was never successful; Oppenheimer did not betray the United States. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union. Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev also state Oppenheimer "was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s". According to biographer Ray Monk: "He was, in a very practical and real sense, a supporter of the Communist Party. Moreover, in terms of the time, effort and money spent on Party activities, he was a very committed supporter".

Starting in 1954, Oppenheimer lived for several months of the year on the island of <a href="Saint%20John%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint John</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>. In 1957, he purchased a tract of land on <a href="Gibney%20Beach">Gibney Beach</a>, where he built a spartan home on the beach. He spent a considerable amount of time sailing with his daughter Toni and wife Kitty.
Oppenheimer was increasingly concerned about the potential danger that scientific inventions could pose to humanity. He joined with <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Rotblat">Joseph Rotblat</a> and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually, in 1960, become the <a href="World%20Academy%20of%20Art%20and%20Science">World Academy of Art and Science</a>. Significantly, after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the <a href="Russell%E2%80%93Einstein%20Manifesto">Russell–Einstein Manifesto</a> of 1955, nor, though invited, did he attend the first <a href="Pugwash%20Conferences%20on%20Science%20and%20World%20Affairs">Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs</a> in 1957.

In his speeches and public writings, Oppenheimer continually stressed the difficulty of managing the power of knowledge in a world in which the freedom of science to exchange ideas was more and more hobbled by political concerns. Oppenheimer delivered the <a href="Reith%20Lectures">Reith Lectures</a> on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in 1953, which were subsequently published as "Science and the Common Understanding". In 1955 Oppenheimer published "The Open Mind", a collection of eight lectures that he had given since 1946 on the subject of nuclear weapons and popular culture. Oppenheimer rejected the idea of nuclear gunboat diplomacy. "The purposes of this country in the field of foreign policy", he wrote, "cannot in any real or enduring way be achieved by coercion". In 1957 the philosophy and psychology departments at Harvard invited Oppenheimer to deliver the <a href="William%20James%20Lectures">William James Lectures</a>. An influential group of Harvard alumni led by Edwin Ginn that included <a href="Archibald%20Roosevelt">Archibald Roosevelt</a> protested against the decision. Some 1,200 people packed into <a href="Sanders%20Theatre">Sanders Theatre</a> to hear Oppenheimer's six lectures, entitled "The Hope of Order". Oppenheimer delivered the <a href="Whidden%20Lectures">Whidden Lectures</a> at <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a> in 1962, and these were published in 1964 as "The Flying Trapeze: Three Crises for Physicists".
Deprived of political power, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write and work on physics. He toured Europe and Japan, giving talks about the history of science, the role of science in society, and the nature of the universe. In September 1957, France made him an Officer of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honor">Legion of Honor</a>, and on May 3, 1962, he was elected a <a href="Foreign%20Member%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Foreign Member of the Royal Society</a> in Britain. At the urging of many of Oppenheimer's political friends who had ascended to power, President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> awarded Oppenheimer the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Award">Enrico Fermi Award</a> in 1963 as a gesture of political rehabilitation. Edward Teller, the winner of the previous year's award, had also recommended Oppenheimer receive it, in the hope that it would heal the rift between them. A little over a week after <a href="Kennedy%27s%20assassination">Kennedy's assassination</a>, his successor, President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a>, presented Oppenheimer with the award, "for contributions to theoretical physics as a teacher and originator of ideas, and for leadership of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the atomic energy program during critical years". Oppenheimer told Johnson: "I think it is just possible, Mr. President, that it has taken some charity and some courage for you to make this award today."

The rehabilitation implied by the award was partly symbolic, as Oppenheimer still lacked a security clearance and could have no effect on official policy, but the award came with a $50,000 tax-free stipend, and its award outraged many prominent Republicans in Congress. The late President Kennedy's widow <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis">Jacqueline</a>, still living in the White House, made it a point to meet with Oppenheimer to tell him how much her husband had wanted him to have the medal. While still a senator in 1959, Kennedy had been instrumental in voting to narrowly deny Oppenheimer's enemy Lewis Strauss a coveted government position as <a href="Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Secretary of Commerce</a>, effectively ending Strauss's political career. This was partly due to lobbying by the scientific community on behalf of Oppenheimer.

Oppenheimer was a <a href="Chain%20smoking">chain smoker</a> who was diagnosed with <a href="Head%20and%20neck%20cancer">throat cancer</a> in late 1965. After inconclusive surgery, he underwent unsuccessful radiation treatment and <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> late in 1966. He fell into a <a href="coma">coma</a> on February 15, 1967, and died at his home in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a>, on February 18, aged 62. A memorial service was held a week later at <a href="Alexander%20Hall%20%28Princeton%20University%29">Alexander Hall</a> on the campus of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. The service was attended by 600 of his scientific, political and military associates that included Bethe, Groves, Kennan, Lilienthal, Rabi, Smyth and Wigner. His brother Frank and the rest of his family were also there, as was the historian <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%2C%20Jr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.</a>, the novelist <a href="John%20O%27Hara">John O'Hara</a>, and <a href="George%20Balanchine">George Balanchine</a>, the director of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Ballet">New York City Ballet</a>. Bethe, Kennan and Smyth gave brief eulogies. Oppenheimer's body was <a href="cremated">cremated</a> and its ashes were placed into an urn. His wife Kitty took the ashes to St. John and dropped the urn into the sea, within sight of the beach house.

In October 1972, Kitty died at age 62 from an intestinal infection that was complicated by a <a href="pulmonary%20embolism">pulmonary embolism</a>. Oppenheimer's ranch in New Mexico was then inherited by their son Peter, and the beach property was inherited by their daughter Katherine "Toni" Oppenheimer Silber. Toni was refused security clearance for her chosen vocation as a United Nations translator after the FBI brought up the old charges against her father. In January 1977 (three months after the end of her second marriage), she committed suicide at age 32; her ex-husband found her hanging from a beam in her family beach house. She left the property to "the people of St. John for a public park and recreation area". The original house was built too close to the coast and succumbed to a <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>. Today the Virgin Islands Government maintains a Community Center in the area.

When Oppenheimer was stripped from his position of political influence in 1954, he symbolized for many the folly of scientists thinking they could control how others would use their research. He has also been seen as symbolizing the dilemmas involving the moral responsibility of the scientist in the nuclear world. The hearings were motivated both by politics, as Oppenheimer was seen as a representative of the previous administration and by personal considerations stemming from his enmity with Lewis Strauss. The ostensible reason for the hearing and the issue that aligned Oppenheimer with the liberal intellectuals, Oppenheimer's opposition to hydrogen bomb development, was based as much on technical grounds as on moral ones. Once the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Teller%E2%80%93Ulam%20design">technical considerations were resolved</a>, he supported Teller's hydrogen bomb because he believed that the Soviet Union would inevitably construct one too. Rather than consistently oppose the "Red-baiting" of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Oppenheimer testified against some of his former colleagues and students, both before and during his hearing. In one incident, his damning testimony against former student Bernard Peters was selectively leaked to the press. Historians have interpreted this as an attempt by Oppenheimer to please his colleagues in the government and perhaps to divert attention from his own previous left-wing ties and those of his brother. In the end it became a liability when it became clear that if Oppenheimer had really doubted Peters' loyalty, his recommending him for the Manhattan Project was reckless, or at least contradictory.
Popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of weapons of mass destruction. The question of the scientists' responsibility toward humanity inspired <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>'s drama "<a href="Galileo%20%28play%29">Galileo</a>" (1955), left its imprint on <a href="Friedrich%20D%C3%BCrrenmatt">Friedrich Dürrenmatt</a>'s "<a href="Die%20Physiker">Die Physiker</a>", and is the basis of the opera "<a href="Doctor%20Atomic">Doctor Atomic</a>" by <a href="John%20Adams%20%28composer%29">John Adams</a> (2005), which was commissioned to portray Oppenheimer as a modern-day <a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>. Heinar Kipphardt's play "In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer", after appearing on West German television, had its theatrical release in Berlin and Munich in October 1964. Oppenheimer's objections resulted in an exchange of correspondence with Kipphardt, in which the playwright offered to make corrections but defended the play. It premiered in New York in June 1968, with <a href="Joseph%20Wiseman">Joseph Wiseman</a> in the Oppenheimer role. "New York Times" theater critic <a href="Clive%20Barnes%20%28critic%29">Clive Barnes</a> called it an "angry play and a partisan play" that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed the scientist as a "tragic fool and genius". Oppenheimer had difficulty with this portrayal. After reading a transcript of Kipphardt's play soon after it began to be performed, Oppenheimer threatened to sue the playwright, decrying "improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved".
Later Oppenheimer told an interviewer:

The 1980 <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a> TV serial "<a href="Oppenheimer%20%28TV%20miniseries%29">Oppenheimer</a>", starring <a href="Sam%20Waterston">Sam Waterston</a>, won three <a href="BAFTA%20Television%20Awards">BAFTA Television Awards</a>. "<a href="The%20Day%20After%20Trinity">The Day After Trinity</a>", a 1980 documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer and the building of the atomic bomb, was nominated for an <a href="53rd%20Academy%20Awards%20nominees%20and%20winners">Academy Award</a> and received a <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a>. Oppenheimer's life has been explored in the play "<a href="Oppenheimer%20%28play%29">Oppenheimer</a>" by <a href="Tom%20Morton-Smith">Tom Morton-Smith</a>. In addition to his use by authors of fiction, there are numerous biographies, including "" (2005) by <a href="Kai%20Bird">Kai Bird</a> and <a href="Martin%20J.%20Sherwin">Martin J. Sherwin</a> which won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Biography%20or%20Autobiography">Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography</a> for 2006. A centennial conference and exhibit were held in 2004 at Berkeley, with the proceedings of the conference published in 2005 as "Reappraising Oppenheimer: Centennial Studies and Reflections". His papers are in the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>.

As a scientist, Oppenheimer is remembered by his students and colleagues as being a brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing to the theory of black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, <a href="67085%20Oppenheimer">67085 Oppenheimer</a>, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater <a href="Oppenheimer%20%28crater%29">Oppenheimer</a>.

As a military and public policy advisor, Oppenheimer was a <a href="Technocracy%20%28bureaucratic%29">technocratic</a> leader in a shift in the interactions between science and the military and the emergence of "<a href="Big%20Science">Big Science</a>". During World War II, scientists became involved in military research to an unprecedented degree. Because of the threat <a href="fascism">fascism</a> posed to Western civilization, they volunteered in great numbers both for technological and organizational assistance to the Allied effort, resulting in such powerful tools as <a href="radar">radar</a>, the <a href="proximity%20fuse">proximity fuse</a> and <a href="operations%20research">operations research</a>. As a cultured, intellectual, theoretical physicist who became a disciplined military organizer, Oppenheimer represented the shift away from the idea that scientists had their "head in the clouds" and that knowledge on such previously esoteric subjects as the composition of the atomic nucleus had no "real-world" applications.

Two days before the Trinity test, Oppenheimer expressed his hopes and fears in a quotation from the "<a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>":

Hanford Site

The Hanford Site is a decommissioned <a href="Nuclear%20technology">nuclear</a> production complex operated by the United States federal government on the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> in <a href="Benton%20County%2C%20Washington">Benton County</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. The site has been known by many names, including Hanford Project, Hanford Works, Hanford Engineer Works and Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Established in 1943 as part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> in <a href="Hanford%2C%20Washington">Hanford</a>, south-central Washington, the site was home to the <a href="B%20Reactor">B Reactor</a>, the first full-scale <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> production <a href="Nuclear%20reactor%20technology">reactor</a> in the world. Plutonium manufactured at the site was used in the first <a href="Nuclear%20weapon">nuclear bomb</a>, tested at the <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity site</a>, and in <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>, the bomb <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">detonated</a> over <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, Japan.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the project expanded to include nine nuclear reactors and five large <a href="Nuclear%20reprocessing">plutonium processing</a> complexes, which produced plutonium for most of the more than 60,000 weapons built for the <a href="Nuclear%20weapons%20and%20the%20United%20States">U.S. nuclear arsenal</a>. <a href="Nuclear%20technology">Nuclear technology</a> developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of <a href="radioactive%20contamination">radioactive materials</a> into the air and the Columbia River.

In 1989, the State of Washington (Dept. of Ecology), US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the US Department of Energy (DOE) entered into the Tri-Party Agreement which sets targets, or milestones, for cleanup. EPA and Ecology share regulatory oversight based on <a href="Superfund">CERCLA</a> (Superfund) and <a href="Resource%20Conservation%20and%20Recovery%20Act">RCRA</a>.

The weapons production reactors were decommissioned at the end of the Cold War, and decades of manufacturing left behind of <a href="high%20level%20waste">high-level radioactive waste</a> stored within 177 storage tanks, an additional of solid radioactive waste, and areas of heavy Technetium-99 and uranium contaminated groundwater beneath three tank farms on the site as well as the potential for future groundwater contamination beneath currently contaminated soils. In 2011, DOE the federal agency charged with overseeing the site, "interim stabilized" 149 single-shell tanks by pumping nearly all of the liquid waste out into 28 newer double-shell tanks. Solids, known as salt cake and sludge, remained. DOE later found water intruding into at least 14 single-shell tanks and that one of them had been leaking about per year into the ground since about 2010. In 2012, DOE discovered a leak also from a double-shell tank caused by construction flaws and corrosion in the bottom, and that 12 double-shell tanks have similar construction flaws. Since then, the DOE changed to monitoring single-shell tanks monthly and double-shell tanks every three years, and also changed monitoring methods. In March 2014, the DOE announced further delays in the construction of the Waste Treatment Plant, which will affect the schedule for removing waste from the tanks. Intermittent discoveries of undocumented contamination have slowed the pace and raised the cost of cleanup.

In 2007, the Hanford site represented 60% of high-level radioactive waste by volume managed by the US Department of Energy and 7-9% of all nuclear waste in the United States (the DOE manages 15% of nuclear waste in the US, with the remaining 85% being commercial spent nuclear fuel). Hanford is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States and is the focus of the nation's largest <a href="Environmental%20remediation">environmental cleanup</a>. Besides the cleanup project, Hanford also hosts a commercial nuclear power plant, the <a href="Columbia%20Generating%20Station">Columbia Generating Station</a>, and various centers for scientific research and development, such as the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest%20National%20Laboratory">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a> and the <a href="LIGO">LIGO Hanford Observatory</a>.

On November 10, 2015, it was designated as part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project%20National%20Historical%20Park">Manhattan Project National Historical Park</a> alongside other sites in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge</a> and <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos</a>.

The Hanford Site occupies —roughly equivalent to half of the total area of <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>—within <a href="Benton%20County%2C%20Washington">Benton County, Washington</a>. This land is closed to the general public. It is a <a href="desert">desert</a> environment receiving under 10 inches of annual precipitation, covered mostly by <a href="shrub-steppe">shrub-steppe</a> vegetation. The <a href="Columbia%20river">Columbia River</a> flows along the site for approximately , forming its northern and eastern boundary. The original site was and included buffer areas across the river in <a href="Grant%20County%2C%20Washington">Grant</a> and <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Washington">Franklin</a> counties. Some of this land has been returned to private use and is now covered with orchards, vineyards, and irrigated fields. In 2000, large portions of the site were turned over to the <a href="Hanford%20Reach%20National%20Monument">Hanford Reach National Monument</a>. The site is divided by function into three main areas. The nuclear reactors were located along the river in an area designated as the 100 Area; the chemical separations complexes were located inland in the Central Plateau, designated as the 200 Area; and various support facilities were located in the southeast corner of the site, designated as the <a href="300%20Area">300 Area</a>.

The site is bordered on the southeast by the <a href="Tri-Cities%2C%20Washington">Tri-Cities</a>, a metropolitan area composed of <a href="Richland%2C%20Washington">Richland</a>, <a href="Kennewick%2C%20Washington">Kennewick</a>, <a href="Pasco%2C%20Washington">Pasco</a>, and smaller communities, and home to over 230,000 residents. Hanford is a primary economic base for these cities.

The confluence of the <a href="Yakima%20River">Yakima</a>, <a href="Snake%20River">Snake</a>, and Columbia rivers has been a meeting place for <a href="Indigenous%20peoples">native peoples</a> for centuries. The archaeological record of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> habitation of this area stretches back over ten thousand years. Tribes and nations including the <a href="Yakama">Yakama</a>, <a href="Nez%20Perce%20people">Nez Perce</a>, and <a href="Umatilla%20%28tribe%29">Umatilla</a> used the area for hunting, fishing, and gathering plant foods. Hanford <a href="Archaeology">archaeologists</a> have identified numerous Native American sites, including "pit house villages, open campsites, fish farming sites, hunting/kill sites, <a href="game%20drive%20complex">game drive complex</a>es, quarries, and spirit quest sites", and two archaeological sites were listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1976. Native American use of the area continued into the 20th century, even as the tribes were relocated to <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservations</a>. The <a href="Wanapum">Wanapum</a> people were never forced onto a reservation, and they lived along the Columbia River in the <a href="Priest%20Rapids">Priest Rapids Valley</a> until 1943. Settlers moved into the region in the 1860s, initially along the Columbia River south of Priest Rapids. They established farms and orchards supported by small-scale irrigation projects and railroad transportation, with small town centers at <a href="Hanford%2C%20Washington">Hanford</a>, <a href="White%20Bluffs%2C%20Washington">White Bluffs</a>, and <a href="Richland%2C%20Washington">Richland</a>.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="S-1%20Section">S-1 Section</a> of the federal <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD) sponsored an intensive research project on plutonium. The research contract was awarded to scientists at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago%20Metallurgical%20Laboratory">University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory</a> (Met Lab). At the time, plutonium was a rare element that had only recently been isolated in a <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> laboratory. The Met Lab researchers worked on producing chain-reacting "piles" of <a href="uranium">uranium</a> to convert it to plutonium and finding ways to separate plutonium from uranium. The program was accelerated in 1942, as the United States government became concerned that scientists in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> were developing a nuclear weapons program.

In September 1942, the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> placed the newly formed <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> under the command of <a href="Leslie%20Groves">Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves</a>, charging him with the construction of industrial-size plants for manufacturing plutonium and uranium. Groves recruited the <a href="DuPont">DuPont Company</a> to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont recommended that it be located far away from the existing uranium production facility at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>. The ideal site was described by these criteria:


In December 1942, Groves dispatched his assistant <a href="Franklin%20Matthias">Colonel Franklin T. Matthias</a> and DuPont engineers to scout potential sites. Matthias reported that Hanford was "ideal in virtually all respects", except for the farming towns of <a href="White%20Bluffs%2C%20Washington">White Bluffs</a> and <a href="Hanford%2C%20Washington">Hanford</a>. General Groves visited the site in January 1943 and established the Hanford Engineer Works, codenamed "Site W". The federal government quickly acquired the land under its war powers authority and relocated some 1,500 residents of Hanford, White Bluffs, and nearby settlements, as well as the Wanapum people, Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Nez Perce Tribe.

The Hanford Engineer Works (HEW) broke ground in March 1943 and immediately launched a massive and technically challenging construction project. DuPont advertised for workers in newspapers for an unspecified "war construction project" in southeastern Washington, offering "attractive scale of wages" and living facilities.

The construction workers (who reached a peak of 44,900 in June 1944) lived in a construction camp near the old Hanford townsite. The administrators and engineers lived in the government town established at Richland Village, which eventually had accommodation in 4,300 family units and 25 dormitories.

Construction of the nuclear facilities proceeded rapidly. Before the end of the war in August 1945, the HEW built 554 buildings at Hanford, including three nuclear reactors (105-B, 105-D, and 105-F) and three plutonium processing canyons (221-T, 221-B, and 221-U), each long.

To receive the radioactive wastes from the chemical separations process, the HEW built "tank farms" consisting of 64 single-shell underground waste tanks (241-B, 241-C, 241-T, and 241-U). The project required of roads, of railway, and four electrical substations. The HEW used of concrete and 40,000 short tons (36,000 <a href="Tonne">t</a>) of structural steel and consumed $230 million between 1943 and 1946.

The <a href="B%20Reactor">B Reactor</a> (105-B) at Hanford was the first large-scale plutonium production reactor in the world. It was designed and built by <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> based on an experimental design by <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>, and originally operated at 250 <a href="Watt%23Electrical%20and%20thermal%20watts">megawatts (thermal)</a>. The reactor was <a href="graphite">graphite</a> moderated and water cooled. It consisted of a , graphite cylinder lying on its side, penetrated through its entire length horizontally by 2,004 aluminium tubes. (180 t) of uranium slugs, diameter by long, sealed in aluminium cans went into the tubes. <a href="Cooling%20water">Cooling water</a> was pumped through the aluminium tubes around the uranium slugs at the rate of per minute.

Construction on B Reactor began in August 1943 and was completed on September 13, 1944. The reactor went <a href="critical%20mass">critical</a> in late September and, after overcoming <a href="neutron%20poison">neutron poison</a>ing, produced its first plutonium on November 6, 1944. Plutonium was produced in the Hanford reactors when a <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> atom in a fuel slug absorbed a <a href="neutron">neutron</a> to form <a href="uranium-239">uranium-239</a>. U-239 rapidly undergoes <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> to form <a href="neptunium-239">neptunium-239</a>, which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>. The irradiated fuel slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called "canyons" that were about away. A series of chemical processing steps separated the small amount of plutonium that was produced from the remaining uranium and the fission waste products. This first batch of plutonium was refined in the 221-T plant from December 26, 1944, to February 2, 1945, and delivered to the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20National%20Laboratory">Los Alamos laboratory</a> in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> on February 5, 1945.
The material was used in <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity</a>, the first nuclear explosion, on July 16, 1945.

Two identical reactors, D Reactor and F reactor, came online in December 1944 and February 1945, respectively. By April 1945, shipments of plutonium were headed to Los Alamos every five days, and Hanford soon provided enough material for the bombs tested at <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity</a> and dropped over <a href="Fat%20Man">Nagasaki</a>. Throughout this period, the Manhattan Project maintained a top secret classification. Until news arrived of the bomb dropped on <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">Hiroshima</a>, fewer than one percent of Hanford's workers knew they were working on a nuclear weapons project. General Groves noted in his memoirs that "We made certain that each member of the project thoroughly understood his part in the total effort; that, and nothing more."

Initially six reactors or "piles" were proposed, when the plutonium was to be used in the gun-type <a href="Thin%20Man%20%28nuclear%20bomb%29">Thin Man</a> bomb. In mid-1944 a simple gun-type bomb was found to be impractical for plutonium, and the more advanced <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a> bomb, an implosion device, required less plutonium. The number of piles was reduced to four and then three; and the number of chemical separation plants from four to three.

In the short time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford engineers produced many significant technological advances. As no one had ever built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> engineers installed <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>-based <a href="refrigeration">refrigeration</a> systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.

Another difficulty the engineers struggled with was how to deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: <a href="Polytetrafluoroethylene">Teflon</a>, used as a gasket material, and <a href="closed-circuit%20television">closed-circuit television</a>, used to give the crane operator a better view of the process.

In September 1946, the <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric Company</a> assumed management of the Hanford Works under the supervision of the newly created <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a>. As the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> began, the United States faced a new strategic threat in the rise of the <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project">Soviet nuclear weapons program</a>. In August 1947, the Hanford Works announced funding for the construction of two new weapons reactors and research to develop a new chemical separations process, entering a new phase of expansion.

By 1963, the Hanford Site was home to nine nuclear reactors along the Columbia River, five reprocessing plants on the central plateau, and more than 900 support buildings and radiological laboratories around the site. Extensive modifications and upgrades were made to the original three World War II reactors, and a total of 177 underground waste tanks were built. Hanford was at its peak production from 1956 to 1965. Over the entire 40 years of operations, the site produced about of plutonium, supplying the majority of the 60,000 weapons in the U.S. arsenal. <a href="Uranium-233">Uranium-233</a> was also produced.

In 1976, a Hanford technician named <a href="Harold%20McCluskey">Harold McCluskey</a> received the largest recorded dose of <a href="americium">americium</a> following a laboratory accident. Due to prompt medical intervention, he survived the incident and died eleven years later of natural causes.

Most of the reactors were shut down between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, <a href="N%20Reactor">N Reactor</a>, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the <a href="Washington%20Public%20Power%20Supply%20System">Washington Public Power Supply System</a> (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1992, 
and some historians advocated converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> on August 19, 2008.

The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> assumed control of the Hanford Site in 1977. Although uranium enrichment and plutonium breeding were slowly phased out, the nuclear legacy left an indelible mark on the Tri-Cities. Since World War II, the area had developed from a small farming community to a booming "Atomic Frontier" to a powerhouse of the nuclear-industrial complex. Decades of federal investment created a community of highly skilled scientists and engineers. As a result of this concentration of specialized skills, the Hanford Site was able to diversify its operations to include scientific research, test facilities, and commercial nuclear power production.

, operational facilities located at the Hanford Site included:

The Department of Energy and its contractors offer tours of the site. The tours are free, can be reserved in advance via the department's web site, and are limited to U.S. citizens at least 18 years of age. Between 2009 and 2018, approximately 80,000 people visited the site, bringing an estimated annual tourist income of two million dollars to the surrounding area.

On the morning of May 9, 2017, a section of a tunnel caved-in. It was used to store contaminated materials and was located next to the Plutonium Uranium Extraction (<a href="PUREX">PUREX</a>) Facility in the 200 East Area in the center of the Hanford Site. All non-essential personnel were placed under a take cover alarm on the site. Some 53 truckloads (about ) of soil were used to fill in the hole.

A huge volume of water from the Columbia River was required to dissipate the heat produced by Hanford's nuclear reactors.
As much as 75,000 gallons per minute was diverted from the Columbia River to cool the reactor.

From 1944 to 1971, pump systems drew cooling water from the river and, after treating this water for use by the reactors, returned it to the river. Before its release into the river, the used water was held in large tanks known as <a href="retention%20basin">retention basin</a>s for up to six hours. Longer-lived <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s were not affected by this retention, and several <a href="becquerel">terabecquerels</a> entered the river every day. The federal government kept knowledge about these radioactive releases secret. Radiation was later measured downstream as far west as the Washington and <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> coasts.

The plutonium separation process resulted in the release of radioactive isotopes into the air, which were carried by the wind throughout southeastern Washington and into parts of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. <a href="Downwinders">Downwinders</a> were exposed to <a href="radionuclides">radionuclides</a>, particularly <a href="iodine-131">iodine-131</a>, with the heaviest releases during the period from 1945 to 1951. These radionuclides entered the food chain via <a href="dairy%20cows">dairy cows</a> grazing on contaminated fields; hazardous fallout was ingested by communities who consumed radioactive food and milk. Most of these airborne releases were a part of Hanford's routine operations, while a few of the larger releases occurred in isolated incidents. In 1949, an intentional release known as the "<a href="Green%20Run">Green Run</a>" released 8,000 curies of iodine-131 over two days. Another source of contaminated food came from Columbia River fish, an impact felt disproportionately by <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> communities who depended on the river for their customary diets. A U.S. government report released in 1992 estimated that 685,000 curies of radioactive iodine-131 had been released into the river and air from the Hanford site between 1944 and 1947.
Beginning in the 1960s, scientists with the <a href="United%20States%20Public%20Health%20Service">U.S. Public Health Service</a> published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, and there were protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to an article in the Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000 pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The <a href="Washington%20State%20Department%20of%20Health">Washington State Department of Health</a> collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases, particularly forms of <a href="Thyroid%20disease">Thyroid disease</a>. A <a href="mass%20tort">mass tort</a> lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government spent many years in the court system. In 2005, two of six plaintiffs who went to trial were awarded $500,000 in damages.
In October 2015, the Department of Energy resolved the final cases. They paid more than $60 million in legal fees and $7 million in damages.
Since 2003, radioactive materials are known to be leaking from Hanford into the environment: "The highest tritium concentration detected in riverbank springs during 2002 was 58,000 pCi/L (2,100 Bq/L) at the Hanford Townsite. The highest iodine-129 concentration of 0.19 pCi/L (0.007 Bq/L) was also found in a Hanford Townsite spring. The WHO guidelines for radionuclides in drinking-water limits levels of iodine-129 at 1 Bq/L, and tritium at 10,000 Bq/L. Concentrations of radionuclides including tritium, technetium-99, and iodine-129 in riverbank springs near the Hanford Townsite have generally been increasing since 1994. This is an area where a major <a href="Groundwater%23Pollution">groundwater plume</a> from the 200 East Area intercepts the river ... Detected radionuclides include strontium-90, technetium-99, iodine-129, uranium-234, −235, and −238, and tritium. Other detected contaminants include arsenic, chromium, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, and sulfate."

In February 2013, Governor <a href="Jay%20Inslee">Jay Inslee</a> announced that a tank storing <a href="radioactive%20waste">radioactive waste</a> at the site had been leaking liquids on average of 150 to 300 gallons per year. He said that though the leak posed no immediate health risk to the public, it should not be an excuse for not doing anything. On February 22, 2013, the Governor stated that "6 more tanks at Hanford site" were "leaking radioactive waste"
, there are 177 tanks at Hanford, 149 of which have a single shell. Historically single shell tanks were used for storing radioactive liquid waste and designed to last 20 years. By 2005, some liquid waste was transferred from single shell tanks to (safer) double shell tanks. A substantial amount of residue remains in the older single shell tanks with one containing an estimated 447,000 gallons (1,700 m) of radioactive sludge, for example. It is believed that up to six of these "empty" tanks are leaking. Two tanks are reportedly leaking at a rate of 300 gallons (1,136 liters) per year each, while the remaining four tanks are leaking at a rate of 15 gallons (57 liters) per year each.

Since 1987, workers have reported exposure to harmful vapors after working around underground nuclear storage tanks, with no solution found. More than 40 workers in 2014 alone reported smelling vapors and became ill with "nosebleeds, headaches, watery eyes, burning skin, contact dermatitis, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, coughing, sore throats, expectorating, dizziness and nausea, ... Several of these workers have long-term disabilities." Doctors checked workers and cleared them to return to work. Monitors worn by tank workers have found no samples with chemicals close to the federal limit for occupational exposure.

In August 2014, <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">OSHA</a> ordered the facility to rehire a contractor and pay $220,000 in back wages for firing them for <a href="whistleblowing">whistleblowing</a> on safety concerns at the site.

On November 19, 2014, <a href="Washington%20Attorney%20General">Washington Attorney General</a> Bob Ferguson said the state planned to sue the DOE and its contractor to protect workers from hazardous vapors at Hanford. A 2014 report by the DOE <a href="Savannah%20River%20National%20Laboratory">Savannah River National Laboratory</a> initiated by 'Washington River Protection Solutions' found that DOE's methods to study vapor releases were inadequate, particularly, that they did not account for short but intense vapor releases. They recommended "proactively sampling the air inside tanks to determine its chemical makeup; accelerating new practices to prevent worker exposures; and modifying medical evaluations to reflect how workers are exposed to vapors".

On June 25, 1988, the Hanford site was divided into four areas and proposed for inclusion on the <a href="National%20Priorities%20List">National Priorities List</a>. On May 15, 1989, the <a href="Washington%20Department%20of%20Ecology">Washington Department of Ecology</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a>, and the Department of Energy entered into the Tri-Party Agreement, which provides a legal framework for environmental remediation at Hanford. the agencies are engaged in the world's largest environmental cleanup, with many challenges to be resolved in the face of overlapping technical, political, regulatory, and cultural interests. The cleanup effort is focused on three outcomes: restoring the Columbia River corridor for other uses, converting the central plateau to long-term waste treatment and storage, and preparing for the future. The cleanup effort is managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the two regulatory agencies. A citizen-led Hanford Advisory Board provides recommendations from community stakeholders, including local and state governments, regional environmental organizations, business interests, and Native American tribes. Citing the 2014 Hanford Lifecycle Scope Schedule and Cost report, the 2014 estimated cost of the remaining Hanford clean up is $113.6 billion – more than $3 billion per year for the next six years, with a lower cost projection of approximately $2 billion per year until 2046. About 11,000 workers are on site to consolidate, clean up, and mitigate waste, contaminated buildings, and contaminated soil. Originally scheduled to be complete within thirty years, the cleanup was less than half finished by 2008. Of the four areas that were formally listed as <a href="Superfund">Superfund</a> sites on October 4, 1989, only one has been removed from the list following cleanup.

While major releases of radioactive material ended with the reactor shutdown in the 1970s and many of the most dangerous wastes are contained, there are continued concerns about contaminated groundwater headed toward the Columbia River and about workers' health and safety.

The most significant challenge at Hanford is stabilizing the of high-level radioactive waste stored in 177 underground tanks. By 1998, about a third of these tanks had leaked waste into the soil and groundwater. , most of the liquid waste had been transferred to more secure double-shelled tanks; however, of liquid waste, together with of salt cake and sludge, remains in the single-shelled tanks. DOE lacks information about the extent to which the 27 double-shell tanks may be susceptible to corrosion. Without determining the extent to which the factors that contributed to the leak in AY-102 were similar to the other 27 double-shell tanks, DOE cannot be sure how long its double-shell tanks can safely store waste. That waste was originally scheduled to be removed by 2018. , the revised deadline was 2040. Nearby aquifers contain an estimated of contaminated groundwater as a result of the leaks. , of radioactive waste is traveling through the groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50 years if cleanup does not proceed on schedule. The site includes of solid radioactive waste.
Under the Tri-Party Agreement, lower-level hazardous wastes are buried in huge lined pits that will be sealed and monitored with sophisticated instruments for many years. Disposal of plutonium and other high-level wastes is a more difficult problem that continues to be a subject of intense debate. As an example, plutonium-239 has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 24,100 years, and a decay of ten half-lives is required before a sample is considered to cease its radioactivity. In 2000, the Department of Energy awarded a $4.3 billion contract to <a href="Bechtel">Bechtel</a>, a San Francisco-based construction and engineering firm, to build a <a href="Radioactive%20waste%23Vitrification">vitrification</a> plant to combine the dangerous wastes with glass to render them stable. Construction began in 2002. The plant was originally scheduled to be operational by 2011, with vitrification completed by 2028. According to a 2012 study by the <a href="General%20Accounting%20Office">General Accounting Office</a>, there were a number of serious unresolved technical and managerial problems. estimated costs were $13.4 billion with commencement of operations estimated to be in 2022 and about 3 decades of operation.

In May 2007, state and federal officials began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as <a href="groundwater%20remediation">groundwater remediation</a>. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600 million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy was in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.
During excavations from 2004 to 2007 a sample of purified plutonium was uncovered inside a safe in a waste trench, and has been dated to about the 1940s, making it the second-oldest sample of purified plutonium known to exist. Analyses published in 2009 concluded that the sample originated at Oak Ridge, and was one of several sent to Hanford for optimization tests of the T-Plant until Hanford could produce its own plutonium. Documents refer to such a sample, belonging to "Watt's group", which was disposed of in its safe when a radiation leak was suspected.

Some of the radioactive waste at Hanford was supposed to be stored in the planned <a href="Yucca%20Mountain%20nuclear%20waste%20repository">Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a>, but after that project was suspended, Washington State sued, joined by South Carolina. Their first suit was dismissed in July 2011. In a subsequent suit, federal authorities were ordered to either approve or reject plans for the Yucca Mountain storage site.

A potential radioactive leak was reported in 2013; the clean up was estimated to have cost $40 billion with $115 billion more required.

The Hanford site operations were initially directed by Colonel <a href="Franklin%20Matthias">Franklin Matthias</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a>. Postwar the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> took over, and then the <a href="Energy%20Research%20and%20Development%20Administration">Energy Research and Development Administration</a>. Since 1977, Hanford operations are directed by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Energy">U.S. Department of Energy</a>. It has been operated under government contract by various private companies over the years, as summarized in the table through 2000.

Spiro Agnew

Spiro Theodore Agnew (; November 9, 1918 – September 17, 1996) was the 39th <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president of the United States</a> from 1969 until his resignation in 1973. He is the second and most recent vice president to resign the position, the other being <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a> in 1832. Unlike Calhoun, Agnew resigned as a result of scandal.

Agnew was born in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> to an American-born mother and a Greek immigrant father. He attended <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, and graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Baltimore%20School%20of%20Law">University of Baltimore School of Law</a>. He worked as an aide to <a href="U.S.%20Representative">U.S. Representative</a> <a href="James%20Devereux">James Devereux</a> before he was appointed to the <a href="Baltimore%20County">Baltimore County</a> Board of Zoning Appeals in 1957. In 1962, he was elected <a href="Baltimore%20County%20Executive">Baltimore County Executive</a>. In 1966, Agnew was elected <a href="Governor%20of%20Maryland">Governor of Maryland</a>, defeating his <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> opponent <a href="George%20P.%20Mahoney">George P. Mahoney</a> and independent candidate <a href="Hyman%20A.%20Pressman">Hyman A. Pressman</a>.

At the <a href="1968%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1968 Republican National Convention</a>, <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> asked Agnew to place his name in nomination, and named him as running mate. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon; the <a href="law%20and%20order%20%28politics%29">law and order</a> stance he had taken in the wake of civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as <a href="Pat%20Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a>. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket of incumbent Vice President <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> and his running mate, Senator <a href="Edmund%20Muskie">Edmund Muskie</a>. As vice president, Agnew was often called upon to attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201972">presidential election of 1972</a>, Nixon and Agnew were re-elected for a second term, defeating Senator <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a> and his running mate <a href="Sargent%20Shriver">Sargent Shriver</a>.

In 1973, Agnew was investigated by the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Maryland">United States Attorney for the District of Maryland</a> on suspicion of criminal conspiracy, bribery, extortion and tax fraud. Agnew took kickbacks from contractors during his time as Baltimore County Executive and Governor of Maryland. The payments had continued into his time as vice president. After months of maintaining his innocence, Agnew pleaded <a href="no%20contest">no contest</a> to a single felony charge of <a href="tax%20evasion">tax evasion</a> and resigned from office. Nixon replaced him with House Republican leader <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>. Agnew spent the remainder of his life quietly, rarely making public appearances. He wrote a novel and a memoir that both defended his actions. Historians have named Agnew as one of the worst Vice Presidents in U.S. history.

Spiro Agnew's father was born Theophrastos Anagnostopoulos in about 1877, in the Greek town of <a href="Gargalianoi">Gargalianoi</a>. The family may have been involved in olive growing and been impoverished during a crisis in the industry in the 1890s. Anagnostopoulos emigrated to the United States in 1897 (some accounts say 1902) and settled in <a href="Schenectady%2C%20New%20York">Schenectady, New York</a>, where he changed his name to Theodore Agnew and opened a <a href="diner">diner</a>. A passionate self-educator, Agnew maintained a lifelong interest in philosophy; one family member recalled that "if he wasn't reading something to improve his mind, he wouldn't read." Around 1908, he moved to <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, where he purchased a restaurant. Here he met William Pollard, who was the city's <a href="Federal%20Meat%20Inspection%20Act">federal meat inspector</a>. The two became friends; Pollard and his wife Margaret were regular customers of the restaurant. After Pollard died in April 1917, Agnew and Margaret Pollard began a courtship which led to their marriage on December 12, 1917. Spiro Agnew was born 11 months later, on November 9, 1918.

Margaret Pollard, born Margaret Marian Akers in <a href="Bristol%2C%20Virginia">Bristol, Virginia</a>, in 1883, was the youngest in a family of 10 children. As a young adult she moved to Washington, D.C., and found employment in various government offices before marrying Pollard and moving to Baltimore. The Pollards had one son, Roy, who was 10 years old when Pollard died. After the marriage to Agnew in 1917 and Spiro's birth the following year, the new family settled in a small apartment at 226 West Madison Street, near downtown Baltimore.

In accordance with his mother's wishes, the infant Spiro was baptized as an <a href="Episcopalian">Episcopalian</a>, rather than into the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox Church</a> of his father. Nevertheless, Agnew senior was the dominant figure within the family, and a strong influence on his son. When in 1969, after his Vice Presidential inauguration, Baltimore's Greek community endowed a scholarship in Theodore Agnew's name, Spiro Agnew told the gathering: "I am proud to say that I grew up in the light of my father. My beliefs are his."

During the early 1920s, the Agnews prospered. Theodore acquired a larger restaurant, the Piccadilly, and moved the family to a house in the <a href="Forest%20Park%2C%20Baltimore">Forest Park</a> northwest section of the city, where Spiro attended Garrison Junior High School and later <a href="Forest%20Park%20High%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">Forest Park High School</a>. This period of affluence ended with the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">crash of 1929</a>, and the restaurant closed. In 1931 the family's savings were wiped out when a local bank failed, forcing them to sell the house and move to a small apartment. Agnew later recalled how his father responded to these misfortunes: "He just shrugged it off and went to work with his hands without complaint." Theodore Agnew sold fruit and vegetables from a roadside stall, while the youthful Spiro helped the family's budget with part-time jobs, delivering groceries and distributing leaflets. As he grew up, Spiro was increasingly influenced by his peers, and began to distance himself from his Greek background. He refused his father's offer to pay for Greek language lessons, and preferred to be known by a nickname, "Ted".

In February 1937, Agnew entered <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> at their new <a href="Homewood%20Campus%20of%20Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Homewood</a> campus in north Baltimore, as a chemistry major. After a few months, he found the pressure of the academic work increasingly stressful, and was distracted by the family's continuing financial problems and worries about the international situation, in which war seemed likely. In 1939 he decided that his future lay in law rather than chemistry, left Johns Hopkins and began night classes at the <a href="University%20of%20Baltimore%20School%20of%20Law">University of Baltimore School of Law</a>. To support himself, he took a day job as an insurance clerk with the Maryland Casualty Company at their "Rotunda" building on 40th Street in <a href="Roland%20Park%2C%20Baltimore">Roland Park</a>.

During the three years Agnew spent at the company he rose to the position of assistant underwriter. At the office, he met a young filing clerk, <a href="Judy%20Agnew">Elinor Judefind</a>, known as "Judy". She had grown up in the same part of the city as Agnew, but the two had not previously met. They began dating, became engaged, and were married in Baltimore on May 27, 1942. They had four children; Pamela Lee, James Rand, Susan Scott, and Elinor Kimberly.

By the time of the marriage, Agnew had been <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">drafted</a> into the U.S. Army. Shortly after the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor attack</a> in December 1941, he began basic training at Camp Croft in South Carolina. There, he met people from a variety of backgrounds: "I had led a very sheltered life – I became unsheltered very quickly." He eventually was sent to the <a href="Officer%20Candidate%20School%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Officer Candidate School</a> at <a href="Fort%20Knox">Fort Knox</a>, Kentucky, and on May 24, 1942 (three days before his wedding) he was commissioned as a <a href="Second%20lieutenant%23United%20States">second lieutenant</a>.

After a two-day honeymoon, Agnew returned to Fort Knox. He served there, or at nearby <a href="Fort%20Campbell">Fort Campbell</a>, for nearly two years in a variety of administrative roles, before being sent to England in March 1944 as part of the pre-<a href="D-Day">D-Day</a> build-up. He remained on standby in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> until late in the year, when he was posted to the <a href="54th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">54th Armored Infantry Battalion</a> in France as a replacement officer. After briefly serving as a rifle platoon leader, Agnew commanded the battalion's service company. The battalion became part of 10th Armored Combat Command "B", which saw action in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>, including the <a href="siege%20of%20Bastogne">siege of Bastogne</a> – in all, "thirty-nine days in the hole of the doughnut", as one of Agnew's men put it. Thereafter, the 54th battalion fought its way into Germany, seeing action at <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a>, <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a> and <a href="Crailsheim">Crailsheim</a>, before reaching <a href="Garmisch-Partenkirchen">Garmisch-Partenkirchen</a> in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> as the war concluded. Agnew returned home for discharge in November 1945, having been awarded the <a href="Combat%20Infantryman%20Badge">Combat Infantryman Badge</a> and the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star</a>.

On his return to civilian life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured a job as a law clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett. Until now, Agnew had been largely apolitical; his nominal allegiance had been to the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, following his father's beliefs. The firm's senior partner, Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if he wanted a career in politics he should become a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>. There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of <a href="Lutherville%2C%20Maryland">Lutherville</a> in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.

In 1947 Agnew graduated as <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> and passed the Maryland bar examination. He started his own law practice in downtown Baltimore, but was not successful, and took a job as an insurance investigator. A year later, he moved to Schreiber's, a supermarket chain, where his main role was that of a store detective. He stayed there for four years, a period briefly interrupted in 1951 by a recall to the army after the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. He resigned from Schreiber's in 1952, and resumed his legal practice, specializing in labor law.

In 1955, Lester Barrett was appointed a judge in <a href="Towson">Towson</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Baltimore%20County">Baltimore County</a>. Agnew moved his office there; at the same time he moved his family from Lutherville to <a href="Loch%20Raven%2C%20Baltimore">Loch Raven</a>, also in Baltimore County. There, he led a typical suburban lifestyle, serving as president of the local school's <a href="Parent-Teacher%20Association">PTA</a>, joining the <a href="Kiwanis">Kiwanis</a> and participating in a range of social and community activities. Historian <a href="William%20Manchester">William Manchester</a> sums up the Agnew of those days: "His favorite musician was <a href="Lawrence%20Welk">Lawrence Welk</a>. His leisure interests were all : watching the <a href="Baltimore%20Colts">Baltimore Colts</a> on television, listening to <a href="Mantovani">Mantovani</a>, and reading the sort of prose the "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" <a href="Reader%27s%20Digest%20Condensed%20Books">liked to condense</a>. He was a lover of order and an almost compulsive conformist."

Agnew made his first bid for political office in 1956, when he sought to be a Republican candidate for Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local party leaders, but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected Republican majority on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals, at a salary of $3,600 per year. This <a href="quasi-judicial">quasi-judicial</a> post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958 he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term, and became its chairman.

In the November 1960 elections Agnew decided to seek election to the county <a href="Maryland%20Circuit%20Courts">circuit court</a>, against the local tradition that sitting judges seeking re-election were not opposed. He was unsuccessful, finishing last of five candidates. This failed attempt raised his profile, and he was regarded by his Democratic opponents as a Republican on the rise. The 1960 elections saw the Democrats win control of the county council, and one of their first actions was to remove Agnew from the Zoning Appeals Board. According to Agnew's biographer, <a href="Jules%20Witcover">Jules Witcover</a>, "The publicity generated by the Democrats' crude dismissal of Agnew cast him as the honest servant wronged by the machine." Seeking to capitalize on this mood, Agnew asked to be nominated as the Republican candidate in the 1962 U.S. Congressional elections, in <a href="Maryland%27s%202nd%20congressional%20district">Maryland's 2nd congressional district</a>. The party chose the more experienced <a href="J.%20Fife%20Symington%20Jr.">J. Fife Symington</a>, but wanted to take advantage of Agnew's local support. He accepted their invitation to run for county executive, the county's chief executive officer, a post which the Democrats had held since 1895.

Agnew's chances in 1962 were boosted by a feud in the Democrat ranks, as the retired former county executive, Michael Birmingham, fell out with his successor and defeated him in the Democratic primary. By contrast with his elderly opponent, Agnew was able to campaign as a "White Knight" promising change; his program included an anti-discrimination bill requiring public amenities such as parks, bars and restaurants be open to all races, policies that neither Birmingham nor any Maryland Democrat could have introduced at that time without angering supporters. In the November election, despite an intervention by Vice President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> on Birmingham's behalf, Agnew beat his opponent by 78,487 votes to 60,993. When Symington lost to Democrat <a href="Clarence%20Long">Clarence Long</a> in his congressional race, Agnew became the highest-ranking Republican in Maryland.

Agnew's four-year term as county executive saw a moderately progressive administration, which included the building of new schools, increases to teachers' salaries, reorganization of the police department, and improvements to the water and sewer systems. His anti-discrimination bill passed, and gave him a reputation as a liberal, but its impact was limited in a county where the population was 97 percent white. His relations with the increasingly militant <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> were sometimes troubled. In a number of desegregation disputes involving private property, Agnew appeared to prioritize law and order, showing a particular aversion to any kind of demonstration. His reaction to the <a href="16th%20Street%20Baptist%20Church%20bombing">16th Street Baptist Church bombing</a> in Alabama, in which four children died, was to refuse to attend a memorial service at a Baltimore church, and to denounce a planned demonstration in support of the victims.

As county executive, Agnew was sometimes criticized for being too close to rich and influential businessmen, and was accused of cronyism after bypassing the normal bidding procedures and designating three of his Republican friends as the county's insurance brokers of record, ensuring them large commissions. Agnew's standard reaction to such criticisms was to display moral indignation, denounce his opponents' "outrageous distortions", deny any wrongdoing and insist on his personal integrity; tactics which, Cohen and Witcover note, were to be seen again as he defended himself against the corruption allegations that ended his vice presidency.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964 presidential election</a>, Agnew was opposed to the Republican frontrunner, the conservative <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a>, initially supporting the moderate California senator <a href="Thomas%20Kuchel">Thomas Kuchel</a>, a candidacy that, Witcover remarks, "died stillborn". After the failure of moderate Pennsylvania Governor <a href="William%20Scranton">William Scranton</a>'s candidacy at the <a href="1964%20Republican%20National%20Convention">party convention</a>, Agnew gave his reluctant support to Goldwater, but privately opined that the choice of so extremist a candidate had cost the Republicans any chance of victory.

As his four-year term as executive neared its end, Agnew knew that his chances of re-election were slim, given that the county's Democrats had healed their rift. Instead, in 1966 he sought the Republican nomination for governor, and with the backing of party leaders won the April primary by a wide margin.

In the Democratic party, three candidates—a moderate, a liberal and an outright segregationist—battled for their party's <a href="gubernatorial">gubernatorial</a> nomination, which to general surprise was won by the segregationist, <a href="George%20P.%20Mahoney">George P. Mahoney</a>, a perennially unsuccessful candidate for office. Mahoney's candidacy split his party, provoking a third-party candidate, <a href="Comptroller%20of%20Baltimore%20City">Comptroller of Baltimore City</a> <a href="Hyman%20A.%20Pressman">Hyman A. Pressman</a>. In <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery County</a>, the state's wealthiest area, a "Democrats for Agnew" organization flourished, and liberals statewide flocked to the Agnew standard. Mahoney, a fierce opponent of integrated housing, exploited racial tensions with the slogan: "Your Home is Your Castle. Protect it!" Agnew painted him as the candidate of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, and said voters must choose "between the bright, pure, courageous flame of righteousness and the fiery cross". In the November election Agnew, helped by 70 percent of the black vote, beat Mahoney by 455,318 votes (49.5 percent) to 373,543, with Pressman taking 90,899 votes.

After the campaign, it emerged that Agnew had failed to report three alleged attempts to bribe him that had been made on behalf of the slot-machine industry, involving sums of $20,000, $75,000 and $200,000, if he would promise not to veto legislation keeping the machines legal in <a href="Southern%20Maryland">Southern Maryland</a>. He justified his silence on the grounds that no actual offer had been made: "Nobody sat down in front of me with a suitcase of money." Agnew was also criticized over his part-ownership of land close to the site of a planned, but never-built second bridge over <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. Opponents claimed a conflict of interest, since some of Agnew's partners in the venture were simultaneously involved in business deals with the county. Agnew denied any conflict or impropriety, saying that the property involved was outside Baltimore County and his jurisdiction. Nevertheless, he sold his interest.

Agnew's term as governor was marked by an agenda which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and the repeal of laws against interracial marriage. Community health programs were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those on low incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew's <a href="fair%20housing">fair housing</a> legislation was limited, applying only to new projects above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the <a href="Mason%E2%80%93Dixon%20line">Mason–Dixon line</a>. Agnew's attempt to adopt a new state constitution was rejected by the voters in a referendum.

For the most part, Agnew remained somewhat aloof from the state legislature, preferring the company of businessmen. Some of these had been associates in his county executive days, such as Lester Matz and Walter Jones, who had been among the first to encourage him to seek the governorship. Agnew's close ties to the business community were noted by officials in the state capital of <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a>: "There always seemed to be people around him who were in business." Some suspected that, while not himself corrupt, he "allowed himself to be used by the people around him."
Agnew publicly supported civil rights, but deplored the militant tactics used by some black leaders. During the 1966 election, his record had won him the endorsement of <a href="Roy%20Wilkins">Roy Wilkins</a>, leader of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP). In mid-1967, racial tension was rising nationally, fueled by black discontent and an increasingly assertive civil rights leadership. Several cities exploded in violence, and there were riots in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Maryland">Cambridge, Maryland</a>, after an incendiary speech there on July 24, 1967, by radical student leader <a href="H.%20Rap%20Brown">H. Rap Brown</a>. Agnew's principal concern was to maintain law and order, and he denounced Brown as a professional agitator, saying, "I hope they put him away and throw away the key." When the <a href="Kerner%20Commission">Kerner Commission</a>, appointed by President Johnson to investigate the causes of the unrest, reported that the principal factor was institutional white racism, Agnew dismissed these findings, blaming the "permissive climate and misguided compassion" and adding: "It is not the centuries of racism and deprivation that have built to an explosive crescendo, but ... that lawbreaking has become a socially acceptable and occasionally stylish form of dissent". In March 1968, when faced with a student boycott at <a href="Bowie%20State%20College">Bowie State College</a>, a <a href="historically%20black%20institution">historically black institution</a>, Agnew again blamed <a href="outside%20agitators">outside agitators</a> and refused to negotiate with the students. When a student committee came to Annapolis and demanded a meeting, Agnew closed the college and ordered more than 200 arrests.

Following the <a href="assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.</a> on April 4, 1968, there was widespread <a href="King%20assassination%20riots">rioting and disorder</a> across the US. The trouble reached Baltimore on April 6, and for the next three days and nights the city burned. Agnew declared a state of emergency and called out the <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a>. When order was restored there were six dead, more than 4,000 were under arrest, the fire department had responded to 1,200 fires, and there had been widespread looting. On April 11, Agnew summoned more than 100 moderate black leaders to the <a href="Maryland%20State%20Capitol">state capitol</a>, where instead of the expected constructive dialogue he delivered a speech roundly castigating them for their failure to control more radical elements, and accused them of a cowardly retreat or even complicity. One of the delegates, the Rev. Sidney Daniels, rebuked the governor: "Talk to us like we are ladies and gentlemen", he said, before walking out. Others followed him; the remnant was treated to further accusations as Agnew rejected all socio-economic explanations for the disturbances. Many white suburbanites applauded Agnew's speech: over 90 percent of the 9,000 responses by phone, letter or telegram supported him, and he won tributes from leading Republican conservatives such as <a href="Jack%20Williams%20%28American%20politician%29">Jack Williams</a>, governor of Arizona, and former senator <a href="William%20Knowland">William Knowland</a> of California. To members of the black community the April 11 meeting was a turning point. Having previously welcomed Agnew's stance on civil rights, they now felt betrayed, one state senator observing: "He has sold us out ... he thinks like <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, he talks like George Wallace".

At least until the April 1968 disturbances, Agnew's image was that of a liberal Republican. Since 1964 he had supported the presidential ambitions of Governor <a href="Nelson%20Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> of New York, and early in 1968, with that year's elections looming, he became chairman of the "Rockefeller for President" citizens' committee. When in a televised speech on March 21, 1968, Rockefeller shocked his supporters with an apparently unequivocal withdrawal from the race, Agnew was dismayed and humiliated; despite his very public role in the Rockefeller campaign, he had received no advance warning of the decision. He took this as a personal insult and as a blow to his credibility.

Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew was being wooed by supporters of the former vice president <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as <a href="Pat%20Buchanan">Pat Buchanan</a>, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a "formidable candidate" but did not commit his support: "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal ... I think I've got to take another look at this situation".

In mid-May, Nixon, interviewed by <a href="David%20Broder">David Broder</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", mentioned the Maryland governor as a possible running mate. As Agnew continued to meet with Nixon and with the candidate's senior aides, there was a growing impression that he was moving into the Nixon camp. At the same time, Agnew denied any political ambitions beyond serving his full four-year term as governor.

As Nixon prepared for the August <a href="1968%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1968 Republican National Convention</a> in <a href="Miami%20Beach">Miami Beach</a>, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, the conservative <a href="Governor%20of%20California">Governor of California</a>; and the more liberal <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a>, <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a>. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending to go to the convention with his Maryland delegation as a <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a>, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.

At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew abandoned his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination on the first ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: <a href="Strom%20Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a>, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates was little more than a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.

In his acceptance speech, Agnew told the convention he had "a deep sense of the improbability of this moment". Agnew was not yet a national figure, and a widespread reaction to the nomination was "Spiro who?" In <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, three pedestrians gave their reactions to the name when interviewed on television: "It's some kind of disease"; "It's some kind of egg"; "He's a Greek that owns that shipbuilding firm."

In 1968, the Nixon-Agnew ticket faced two principal opponents. The Democrats, at <a href="1968%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">a convention</a> marred by violent demonstrations, had nominated Vice President <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> and Maine Senator <a href="Edmund%20Muskie">Edmund Muskie</a> as their standard-bearers. The segregationist former <a href="Governor%20of%20Alabama">Governor of Alabama</a>, <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, ran as a third-party candidate, and was expected to do well in the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a>. Nixon, mindful of the restrictions he had labored under as <a href="Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a>'s running mate in 1952 and 1956, was determined to both give Agnew a much freer rein and to make it clear his running mate had his support. Agnew could also usefully play an "attack dog" role, as Nixon had in 1952.

Initially, Agnew played the centrist, pointing to his civil rights record in Maryland. As the campaign developed, he quickly adopted a more belligerent approach, with strong law-and-order rhetoric, a style which alarmed the party's Northern liberals but played well in the South. <a href="John%20N.%20Mitchell">John Mitchell</a>, Nixon's campaign manager, was impressed, some other party leaders less so; Senator <a href="Thruston%20Morton">Thruston Morton</a> described Agnew as an "asshole".

Throughout September, Agnew was in the news, generally as a result of what one reporter called his "offensive and sometimes dangerous banality". He used the derogatory term "Polack" to describe Polish-Americans, referred to a Japanese-American reporter as "the fat Jap", and appeared to dismiss poor socio-economic conditions by stating that "if you've seen one slum you've seen them all." He attacked Humphrey as soft on communism, an appeaser like Britain's prewar prime minister <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>. Agnew was mocked by his Democratic opponents; a Humphrey commercial displayed the message "Agnew for Vice President?" against a soundtrack of prolonged hysterical laughter that degenerated into a painful cough, before a final message: "This would be funny if it weren't so serious..." Agnew's comments outraged many, but Nixon did not rein him in; such right-wing populism had a strong appeal in the Southern states and was an effective counter to Wallace. Agnew's rhetoric was also popular in some Northern areas, and helped to galvanize "white backlash" into something less racially defined, more attuned to the suburban ethic defined by historian Peter B. Levy as "orderliness, personal responsibility, the sanctity of hard work, the nuclear family, and law and order".

In late October, Agnew survived an exposé in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that questioned his financial dealings in Maryland, with Nixon denouncing the paper for "the lowest kind of gutter politics". In the election on November 5, the Republicans were victorious, with a narrow popular vote plurality – 500,000 out of a total of 73 million votes cast. The Electoral College result was more decisive: Nixon 301, Humphrey 191 and Wallace 46. The Republicans narrowly lost Maryland, but Agnew was credited by pollster <a href="Louis%20Harris">Louis Harris</a> with helping his party to victory in several <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border</a> and <a href="Upper%20South">Upper South</a> states that might easily have fallen to Wallace – South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky – and with bolstering Nixon's support in suburbs nationally. Had Nixon lost those five states, he would have had only the minimum number of electoral votes needed, 270, and any defection by an elector would have thrown the election to the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives.

Immediately after the 1968 election, Agnew was still uncertain what Nixon would expect of him as vice president. He met with Nixon several days after the election in <a href="Key%20Biscayne%2C%20Florida">Key Biscayne, Florida</a>. Nixon, vice president himself for eight years under Eisenhower, wanted to spare Agnew the boredom and lack of a role he had sometimes experienced in that office. Nixon gave Agnew an office in the West Wing of the White House, a first for a vice president. When they stood before the press after the meeting, Nixon pledged that Agnew would not have to undertake the ceremonial roles usually undertaken by the holders of the vice presidency, but would have "new duties beyond what any vice president has previously assumed". Nixon told the press that he planned to make full use of Agnew's experience as county executive and as governor in dealing with matters of federal-state relations and in urban affairs.

Nixon established transition headquarters in New York, but Agnew was not invited to meet with him there until November 27, when the two met for an hour. When Agnew spoke to reporters afterwards, he stated that he felt "exhilarated" with his new responsibilities, but did not explain what those were. During the transition period, Agnew traveled extensively, enjoying his new status. He vacationed on <a href="St.%20Croix">St. Croix</a>, where he played a round of golf with Humphrey and Muskie. He went to Memphis for the <a href="1968%20Liberty%20Bowl">1968 Liberty Bowl</a>, and to New York to attend the wedding of Nixon's daughter <a href="Julie%20Nixon%20Eisenhower">Julie</a> to <a href="David%20Eisenhower">David Eisenhower</a>. Agnew was a fan of the Baltimore Colts; in January, he was the guest of team owner <a href="Carroll%20Rosenbloom">Carroll Rosenbloom</a> at <a href="Super%20Bowl%20III">Super Bowl III</a>, and watched <a href="Joe%20Namath">Joe Namath</a> and the <a href="History%20of%20the%20New%20York%20Jets%23Super%20Bowl%20III">New York Jets</a> upset the Colts, 16–7. There was as yet no official residence for the vice president, and Spiro and Judy Agnew secured a suite at the <a href="The%20St.%20Regis%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">Sheraton Hotel</a> in Washington formerly occupied by <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Johnson</a> while vice president. Only one of their children, Kim, the youngest daughter, moved there with them, the others remaining in Maryland.

During the transition, Agnew hired a staff, choosing several aides who had worked with him as county executive and as governor. He hired <a href="Charles%20Stanley%20Blair">Charles Stanley Blair</a> as chief of staff; Blair had been a member of the House of Delegates and served as Maryland Secretary of State under Agnew. <a href="Arthur%20Sohmer">Arthur Sohmer</a>, Agnew's long-time campaign manager, became his political advisor, and <a href="Herb%20Thompson">Herb Thompson</a>, a former journalist, became press secretary.

Agnew was sworn in along with Nixon on January 20, 1969; as was customary, he sat down immediately after being sworn in, and did not make a speech. Soon after the inauguration, Nixon appointed Agnew as head of the <a href="White%20House%20Office%20of%20Intergovernmental%20Affairs">Office of Intergovernmental Relations</a>, to head government commissions such as the <a href="National%20Space%20Council">National Space Council</a> and assigned him to work with state governors to bring down crime. It became clear that Agnew would not be in the inner circle of advisors. The new president preferred to deal directly with only a trusted handful, and was annoyed when Agnew tried to call him about matters Nixon deemed trivial. After Agnew shared his opinions on a foreign policy matter in a cabinet meeting, an angry Nixon sent <a href="Bob%20Haldeman">Bob Haldeman</a> to warn Agnew to keep his opinions to himself. Nixon complained that Agnew had no idea how the vice presidency worked, but did not meet with Agnew to share his own experience of the office. <a href="Herb%20Klein%20%28journalist%29">Herb Klein</a>, director of communications in the Nixon White House, later wrote that Agnew had allowed himself to be pushed around by senior aides such as Haldeman and John Mitchell, and that Nixon's "inconsistent" treatment of Agnew had left the vice president exposed.

Agnew's pride had been stung by the negative news coverage of him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual for the vice president to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a>, who held that role under <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>. The first postwar vice president not to have previously been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from <a href="Parliamentarian%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">the parliamentarian</a> and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a>s, with the vice president only formally the head.

The public image of Agnew as an uncompromising critic of the violent protests that had marked 1968 persisted into his vice presidency, and at first, he tried to take a more conciliatory tone, in line with Nixon's own speeches after taking office. Still, he urged a firm line against violence, stating in a speech in Honolulu on May 2, 1969, that "we have a new breed of self-appointed vigilantes arising—the counterdemonstrators—taking the law into their own hands because officials fail to call law enforcement authorities. We have a vast faceless majority of the American public in quiet fury over the situation—"and with good reason"."

On October 14, 1969, the day before the anti-war <a href="Moratorium%20to%20End%20the%20War%20in%20Vietnam">Moratorium</a>, North Vietnamese premier <a href="Pham%20Van%20Dong">Pham Van Dong</a> released a letter supporting demonstrations in the United States. Nixon resented this, but on the advice of his aides, thought it best to say nothing, and instead had Agnew give a press conference at the White House, calling upon the Moratorium protesters to disavow the support of the North Vietnamese. Agnew handled the task well, and Nixon tasked Agnew with attacking the Democrats generally, while remaining above the fray himself. This was analogous to the role Nixon had performed as vice president in the Eisenhower White House, thus Agnew was dubbed "Nixon's Nixon". Agnew had finally found a role in the Nixon administration, one he enjoyed very much.

Nixon had Agnew deliver a series of speeches attacking their political opponents. In New Orleans on October 19, Agnew blamed liberal elites for condoning violence by demonstrators, "a spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals". The following day, in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, Agnew told a Republican dinner, "for too long the South has been the punching bag for those who characterize themselves as liberal intellectuals ... their course is a course that will ultimately weaken and erode the very fiber of America." Agnew, though he denied Republicans had a <a href="Southern%20Strategy">Southern Strategy</a>, stressed that the administration and Southern whites had much in common, including the disapproval of the elites. Levy argued that such remarks were designed to attract Southern whites to the Republican Party to help secure the re-election of Nixon and Agnew in 1972, and that Agnew's rhetoric "could have served as the blueprint for the culture wars of the next twenty-to-thirty years, including the claim that Democrats were soft on crime, unpatriotic, and favored flag burning rather than flag waving". The attendees at the speeches were enthusiastic, but other Republicans, especially from the cities, complained to the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> that Agnew's attacks were overbroad.

In the wake of these remarks, Nixon delivered his <a href="Silent%20Majority">Silent Majority</a> speech on November 3, 1969, calling on "the great silent majority of my fellow Americans" to support the administration's policy in Vietnam. The speech was well received by the public, but less so by the press, who strongly attacked Nixon's allegations that only a minority of Americans opposed the war. Nixon speechwriter Pat Buchanan penned a speech in response, to be delivered by Agnew on November 13 in <a href="Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines, Iowa</a>. The White House worked to assure the maximum exposure for Agnew's speech, and the networks covered it live, making it a nationwide address, a rarity for vice presidents. According to Witcover, "Agnew made the most of it".

Historically, the press had enjoyed considerable prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon's speech, "his words and policies were subjected to instant analysis and querulous criticism ... by a small band of network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed in one way or another their hostility to what he had to say ... It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance." Agnew continued, "I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men ... and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit their own set of biases".

Agnew thus put into words feelings that many Republicans and conservatives had long felt about the news media. Television network executives and commentators responded with outrage. <a href="Julian%20Goodman">Julian Goodman</a>, president of <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, stated that Agnew had made an "appeal to prejudice ... it is regrettable that the Vice President of the United States should deny to TV freedom of the press". <a href="Frank%20Stanton%20%28executive%29">Frank Stanton</a>, head of <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, <a href="Walter%20Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a>, agreed. The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right. Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments.

On November 20 in <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>, Agnew reinforced his earlier speech with an attack on "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", again originated by Buchanan. Both papers had enthusiastically endorsed Agnew's candidacy for governor in 1966 but had castigated him as unfit for the vice presidency two years later. The "Post" in particular had been hostile to Nixon since the <a href="Alger%20Hiss">Hiss</a> case in the 1940s. Agnew accused the papers of sharing a narrow viewpoint alien to most Americans. Agnew alleged that the newspapers were trying to circumscribe his First Amendment right to speak of what he believed, while demanding unfettered freedom for themselves, and warned, "the day when the network commentators and even the gentlemen of "The New York Times" enjoyed a form of diplomatic immunity from comment and criticism of what they said is over."

After Montgomery, Nixon sought a détente with the media, and Agnew's attacks ended. Agnew's approval rating soared to 64 percent in late November, and the "Times" called him "a formidable political asset" to the administration. The speeches gave Agnew a power base among conservatives, and boosted his presidential chances for the 1976 election.

Agnew's strong attacks on the administration's opponents, and the flair with which he made his addresses, made him popular as a speaker at Republican fundraising events. He traveled over on behalf of the Republican National Committee in early 1970, speaking at a number of <a href="Lincoln%20Day">Lincoln Day</a> events, and supplanted Reagan as the party's leading fundraiser. Agnew's involvement had Nixon's strong support. In his Chicago speech, the vice president attacked "supercilious sophisticates", while in Atlanta, he promised to continue speaking out lest he break faith with "the Silent Majority, the everyday law-abiding American who believes his country needs a strong voice to articulate his dissatisfaction with those who seek to destroy our heritage of liberty and our system of justice".

Agnew continued to try to increase his influence with Nixon, against the opposition of Haldeman, who was consolidating his power as the second most powerful person in the administration. Agnew was successful in being heard at an April 22, 1970, meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Security%20Council">National Security Council</a>. An impediment to Nixon's plan for <a href="Vietnamization">Vietnamization</a> of the war in Southeast Asia was increasing <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> control of parts of Cambodia, beyond the reach of South Vietnamese troops and used as sanctuaries. Feeling that Nixon was getting overly dovish advice from Secretary of State <a href="William%20P.%20Rogers">William P. Rogers</a> and Secretary of Defense <a href="Melvin%20Laird">Melvin Laird</a>, Agnew stated that if the sanctuaries were a threat, they should be attacked and neutralized. Nixon chose to attack the Viet Cong positions in Cambodia, a decision that had Agnew's vigorous support, and that he remained convinced was correct after his resignation.

The continuing student protests against the war brought Agnew's scorn. In a speech on April 28 in Hollywood, Florida, Agnew stated that responsibility of the unrest lay with those who failed to guide them, and suggested that the alumni of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> fire its president, <a href="Kingman%20Brewster">Kingman Brewster</a>. The Cambodia incursion brought more demonstrations on campus, and on May 3, Agnew went on "<a href="Face%20the%20Nation">Face the Nation</a>" to defend the policy. Reminded that Nixon, in his inaugural address, had called for the lowering of voices in political discourse, Agnew commented, "When a fire takes place, a man doesn't run into the room and whisper ... he yells, 'Fire!' and I am yelling 'Fire!' because I think 'Fire!' needs to be called here". The <a href="Kent%20State%20shootings">Kent State shootings</a> took place the following day, but Agnew did not tone down his attacks on demonstrators, alleging that he was responding to "a general malaise that argues for violent confrontation instead of debate". Nixon had Haldeman tell Agnew to avoid remarks about students; Agnew strongly disagreed and stated that he would only refrain if Nixon directly ordered it.

Nixon's agenda had been impeded by the fact that Congress was controlled by Democrats and he hoped to take control of the Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain above the fray and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.

On September 10 in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>, speaking on behalf of Republican Senator <a href="Ralph%20Tyler%20Smith">Ralph Smith</a>, Agnew began his campaign, which would be noted for harsh rhetoric and memorable phrases. Agnew attacked the "pusillanimous pussyfooting" of the liberals, including those in Congress, who Agnew said cared nothing for the blue- and white-collar workers, the "Forgotten Man of American politics". Addressing the California Republican Convention in San Diego, Agnew targeted "the nattering <a href="nabob">nabob</a>s of negativism. They have formed their own <a href="4-H%20Club">4-H Club</a>—the 'Hopeless, Hysterical, Hypochondriacs of History'." He warned that candidates of any party who espoused radical views should be voted out, a reference to New York Senator <a href="Charles%20Goodell">Charles Goodell</a>, who was on the ballot that November, and who opposed the Vietnam War. Believing that the strategy was working, Nixon met with Agnew at the White House on September 24, and urged him to continue.

Nixon wanted to get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been appointed by Governor Rockefeller after the <a href="assassination%20of%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination of Robert F. Kennedy</a>, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20New%20York%20State">Conservative Party</a> candidate, <a href="James%20L.%20Buckley">James Buckley</a>, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the <a href="Scranton%20Commission">Scranton Commission</a> on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser <a href="Murray%20Chotiner">Murray Chotiner</a> disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on the campaign trail for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor <a href="Marvin%20Mandel">Marvin Mandel</a>, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.

Through 1971, it was uncertain if Agnew would be retained on the ticket as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary <a href="John%20Connally">John Connally</a>, a Democrat and former <a href="Governor%20of%20Texas">Governor of Texas</a>. For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid at the start of 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.
Nixon instructed Agnew to avoid personal attacks on the press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a>, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the <a href="1972%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1972 Republican National Convention</a> in <a href="Miami%20Beach">Miami Beach</a>, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting <a href="busing">busing</a>, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The <a href="Watergate">Watergate</a> break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from <a href="Jeb%20Magruder">Jeb Magruder</a> that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator <a href="Thomas%20Eagleton">Thomas Eagleton</a>, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, Nixon renewed those instructions for former ambassador <a href="Sargent%20Shriver">Sargent Shriver</a>, who had become the new candidate for Vice President.

Nixon took the high road in the campaign, but still wanted McGovern attacked for his positions, and the task fell in part to Agnew. The vice president told the press he was anxious to discard the image he had earned as a partisan campaigner in 1968 and 1970, and wanted to be perceived as conciliatory. He defended Nixon on Watergate, and when McGovern alleged that the Nixon administration was the most corrupt in history, made a speech in South Dakota, describing McGovern as a "desperate candidate who can't seem to understand that the American people don't want a philosophy of defeat and self-hate put upon them".

The race was never close, as the McGovern/Shriver ticket's campaign was effectively over before it even began, and the Nixon/Agnew ticket won 49 states and over 60 percent of the vote in gaining re-election; Massachusetts and the District of Columbia being alone in the Nixon/Agnew ticket not carrying them. Trying to position himself as the front-runner for 1976, Agnew campaigned widely for Republican candidates, something Nixon would not do. Despite Agnew's efforts, Democrats easily held both houses of Congress, gaining two seats in the Senate, though the Republicans gained twelve in the House.

In early 1973, shortly after assuming the role of <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Maryland">United States Attorney for the District of Maryland</a>, <a href="George%20Beall%20%28attorney%29">George Beall</a> opened an investigation of corruption in Baltimore County, involving public officials, architects, engineering firms, and paving contractors. Beall's target was the current political leadership in Baltimore County. There were rumors that Agnew might be involved, which Beall initially discounted; Agnew had not been county executive since December 1966, and any misdeeds done then would be past the <a href="statute%20of%20limitations">statute of limitations</a>. As part of the investigation, Lester Matz's engineering firm was served with a <a href="subpoena%20duces%20tecum">subpoena for documents</a>, and through his counsel he sought immunity in exchange for cooperation in the investigation. Matz had been <a href="Kickback%20%28bribery%29">kicking back</a> to Agnew five percent of the value of contracts received through his influence, first county contracts during his term in Towson, and subsequently state contracts while Agnew was governor.

Investigative reporters and Democratic operatives had pursued rumors that Agnew had been corrupt during his years as a Maryland official, but they had not been able to substantiate them. In February 1973, Agnew heard of the investigation and had Attorney General <a href="Richard%20Kleindienst">Richard Kleindienst</a> contact Beall. The vice president's personal attorney, George White, visited Beall, who stated that Agnew was not under investigation, and that prosecutors would do their best to protect Agnew's name. In June, Matz's attorney disclosed to Beall that his client could show that Agnew not only had been corrupt, but that payments to him had continued into his vice presidency. These later payments would not be barred by the statute of limitations; Agnew could be prosecuted. On July 3, Beall informed the new Attorney General, <a href="Elliot%20Richardson">Elliot Richardson</a>, and at the end of the month Nixon, through his <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">chief of staff</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Haig">Alexander Haig</a>, was informed. Agnew had already met with both Nixon and Haig to assert his innocence. On August 1, Beall sent a letter to Agnew's attorney, formally advising that the vice president was under investigation for tax fraud and corruption. Matz was prepared to testify that he had met with Agnew at the White House and given him $10,000 in cash. Another witness, Jerome B. Wolff, head of Maryland's road commission, had extensive documentation that detailed, as Beall put it, "every corrupt payment he participated in with then-Governor Agnew".

Richardson, whom Nixon had ordered to take personal responsibility for the investigation, met with Agnew and his attorneys on August 6 to outline the case, but Agnew denied culpability, saying the selection of Matz's firm had been routine, and the money campaign contributions. The story broke in "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" later that day. Agnew publicly proclaimed his innocence and on August 8 held a press conference at which he called the stories "damned lies". Nixon, at a meeting on August 7, assured Agnew of his complete confidence, but Haig visited Agnew at his office and suggested that if the charges could be sustained, Agnew might want to take action prior to his indictment. By this time, the Watergate investigation that would lead to Nixon's resignation was well advanced, and for the next two months, fresh revelations in each scandal were almost daily fare in the newspapers.

Under increasing pressure to resign, Agnew took the position that a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House <a href="Carl%20Albert">Carl Albert</a> on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded that it would be improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a>, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.

On October 10, 1973, Agnew appeared before the federal court in Baltimore, and pleaded <a href="nolo%20contendere">nolo contendere</a> (no contest) to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed that there would be no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, Agnew submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the United States. <a href="House%20Minority%20Leader">House Minority Leader</a> <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he heard the news while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.

Soon after his resignation, Agnew moved to his summer home at <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City</a>. To cover urgent tax and legal bills, and living expenses, he borrowed $200,000 from his friend <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>. He had hoped he could resume a career as a lawyer, but in 1974, the <a href="Maryland%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Maryland Court of Appeals</a> disbarred him, calling him "morally obtuse". To earn his living, he founded a business consultancy, Pathlite Inc., which in the following years attracted a widespread international clientele. Describing his business methods, Agnew said: "I have one utility, and that's the ability to penetrate to the top people." One deal concerned a contract for the supply of uniforms to the Iraqi Army, involving negotiations with <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> and <a href="Nicolae%20Ceau%C5%9Fescu">Nicolae Ceauşescu</a> of Romania.

Agnew pursued other business interests: an unsuccessful land deal in Kentucky, and an equally fruitless partnership with golfer <a href="Doug%20Sanders">Doug Sanders</a> over a beer distributionship in Texas. In 1976 he published a novel, "The Canfield Decision", about an American vice president's troubled relationship with his president. The book received mixed reviews, but was commercially successful, with Agnew receiving $100,000 for serialization rights alone. The book landed Agnew in controversy; his fictional counterpart, George Canfield, refers to "Jewish cabals and Zionist lobbies" and their hold over the American media, a charge which Agnew, while on a book tour, asserted was true in real life. This brought complaints from Seymour Graubard, of the Anti-Defamation League of <a href="B%27nai%20B%27rith">B'nai B'rith</a>, and a rebuke from President Ford, then campaigning for re-election. Agnew denied any antisemitism or bigotry: "My contention is that routinely the American news media ... favors the Israeli position and does not in a balanced way present the other equities".

In 1976, Agnew announced that he was establishing a charitable foundation "Education for Democracy", but nothing more was heard of this after B'nai B'rith accused it of being a front for Agnew's anti-Israeli views. Agnew was now wealthy enough to move in 1977 to a new home at The Springs Country Club in <a href="Rancho%20Mirage%2C%20California">Rancho Mirage, California</a>, and shortly afterwards to repay the Sinatra loan. That year, in <a href="The%20Nixon%20Interviews">a series of televised interviews</a> with British TV host <a href="David%20Frost">David Frost</a>, Nixon claimed that he had had no direct role in the processes that had led to Agnew's resignation and implied that his vice president had been hounded by the liberal media: "He made mistakes ... but I do not think for one minute that Spiro Agnew consciously felt that he was violating the law". In 1980, Agnew published a memoir, "Go Quietly ... or Else". In it, he protested his total innocence of the charges that had brought his resignation, and claimed that he had been coerced by the White House to "go quietly" or face an unspoken threat of possible assassination, a suggestion that Agnew biographer Joseph P. Coffey describes as "absurd". Agnew's assertions of innocence were undermined when his former lawyer George White testified that his client had admitted statehouse bribery to him, saying it had been going on "for a thousand years".

After the publication of "Go Quietly", Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. Students of Professor <a href="John%20F.%20Banzhaf%20III">John F. Banzhaf III</a> from the <a href="George%20Washington%20University%20Law%20School">George Washington University Law School</a> found four residents of the state of Maryland willing to put their names on a case that sought to have Agnew repay the state $268,482, the amount it was said he had taken in bribes, including interest and penalties, as a public employee. After two appeals by Agnew, he finally paid the sum in 1983. In 1989, Agnew applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible.

Agnew also was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.

When Nixon died in 1994, his daughters invited Agnew to attend the funeral at <a href="Yorba%20Linda">Yorba Linda</a>, California. At first he refused, still bitter over how he had been treated by the White House in his final days as vice president; over the years he had rejected various overtures from the Nixon camp to mend fences. He was persuaded to accept the invitation, and received a warm welcome there from his former colleagues. "I decided after twenty years of resentment to put it aside", he said. A year later, Agnew appeared at the Capitol in Washington for the dedication of a bust of him, to be placed with those of other vice presidents. Agnew commented: "I am not blind or deaf to the fact that some people feel that ... the Senate by commissioning this bust is giving me an honor I don't deserve. I would remind these people that ... this ceremony has less to do with Spiro Agnew than with the office I held".

On September 16, 1996, Agnew collapsed at his summer home in <a href="Ocean%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ocean City, Maryland</a>. He was taken to <a href="Atlantic%20General%20Hospital">Atlantic General Hospital</a>, where he died the following evening. The cause of death was undiagnosed acute <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a>. Agnew remained fit and active into his seventies, playing golf and tennis regularly, and was scheduled to play tennis with a friend on the day of his death. The funeral, at <a href="Timonium%2C%20Maryland">Timonium, Maryland</a>, was mainly confined to family; Buchanan and some of Agnew's former Secret Service guards also attended to pay their final respects. In recognition of his service as vice president, an honor guard of the combined military services fired a 21-gun salute at the graveside. Agnew's wife Judith survived him by 16 years, dying at Rancho Mirage on June 20, 2012.

At the time of his death, Agnew's legacy was perceived largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians—<a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter Mondale</a>, <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, <a href="Lloyd%20Bentsen">Lloyd Bentsen</a>, <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>, <a href="Jack%20Kemp">Jack Kemp</a>, <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a>, <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> and <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>—some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.

Some recent historians have seen Agnew as important in the development of the <a href="New%20Right%23United%20States">New Right</a>, arguing that he should be honored alongside the acknowledged founding fathers of the movement such as Goldwater and Reagan; Victor Gold, Agnew's former press secretary, considered him the movement's "<a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>". Goldwater's crusade in 1964, at the height of Johnsonian liberalism, came too early, but by the time of Agnew's election, liberalism was on the wane, and as Agnew moved to the right after 1968, the country moved with him. Agnew's fall shocked and saddened conservatives, but it did not inhibit the growth of the New Right. Agnew, the first suburban politician to achieve high office, helped to popularize the view that much of the national media was controlled by elitist and effete liberals. Levy noted, "He helped recast the Republicans as a Party of 'Middle Americans' and, even in disgrace, reinforced the public’s distrust of government."

For Agnew himself, despite his rise from his origins in Baltimore to next in line to the presidency, "there could be little doubt that history's judgment was already upon him, the first Vice President of the United States to have resigned in disgrace. All that he achieved or sought to achieve in his public life ... had been buried in that tragic and irrefutable act". In October 2018, <a href="Rachel%20Maddow">Rachel Maddow</a> wrote and produced a seven part miniseries, "The Bagman", documenting bribery throughout much of Agnew's public career, and the bargain by which he avoided prison. Levy sums up the "might-have-been" of Agnew's career thus:
It is not a far stretch to imagine that if Agnew had contested corruption charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives wanted him to – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern conservatism.

Dengue fever

Dengue fever is a <a href="mosquito-borne%20disease">mosquito-borne</a> <a href="tropical%20disease">tropical disease</a> caused by the <a href="dengue%20virus">dengue virus</a>. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high <a href="fever">fever</a>, <a href="headache">headache</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, <a href="myalgia">muscle</a> and <a href="arthralgia">joint pains</a>, and a characteristic <a href="skin%20rash">skin rash</a>. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in <a href="bleeding">bleeding</a>, <a href="thrombocytopenia">low levels of blood platelets</a> and <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a> leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where <a href="Shock%20%28circulatory%29">dangerously low blood pressure</a> occurs.
Dengue is spread by several species of female <a href="mosquito">mosquitoes</a> of the "<a href="Aedes">Aedes</a>" <a href="genus">type</a>, principally "<a href="Aedes%20aegypti">A. aegypti</a>". The virus has five types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a> to the virus or its <a href="RNA">RNA</a>.
A <a href="dengue%20fever%20vaccine">vaccine for dengue fever</a> has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries. Other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or <a href="Intravenous%20therapy">intravenously</a> for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases, <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a> may be required. About half a million people require hospital admission every year. <a href="Paracetamol">Paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) is recommended instead of <a href="nonsteroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a>s (NSAIDs) for <a href="antipyretic">fever reduction</a> and <a href="analgesic">pain relief</a> in dengue due to an increased risk of bleeding from NSAID use.
Dengue has become a global problem since the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> and is <a href="endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">common</a> in more than 110 countries, mainly in <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. Each year between 50 and 528 million people are infected and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die. The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779. Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century. Apart from eliminating the mosquitos, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus. It is classified as a <a href="neglected%20tropical%20disease">neglected tropical disease</a>.

Typically, people infected with dengue virus are <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> (80%) or have only mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever. Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening. The <a href="incubation%20period">incubation period</a> (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days. Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving home. Children often experience symptoms similar to those of the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a> and <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> (vomiting and diarrhea) and have a greater risk of severe complications, though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever.

The characteristic symptoms of dengue are sudden-onset fever, headache (typically located behind the eyes), muscle and joint pains, and a rash. The alternative name for dengue, "breakbone fever", comes from the associated muscle and joint pains. The course of infection is divided into three phases: febrile, critical, and recovery.

The febrile phase involves high fever, potentially over , and is associated with generalized pain and a headache; this usually lasts two to seven days. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. A rash occurs in 50–80% of those with symptoms in the first or second day of symptoms as <a href="erythema">flushed skin</a>, or later in the course of illness (days 4–7), as a <a href="morbilliform">measles-like</a> rash. A rash described as "islands of white in a sea of red" has also been observed. Some <a href="petechia">petechia</a>e (small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed, which are caused by broken <a href="capillary">capillaries</a>) can appear at this point, as may some mild bleeding from the <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a>s of the mouth and nose. The fever itself is classically <a href="fever%23Types">biphasic</a> or saddleback in nature, breaking and then returning for one or two days.

In some people, the disease proceeds to a critical phase as fever resolves. During this period, there is leakage of plasma from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days. This may result in fluid accumulation in the <a href="thoracic%20cavity">chest</a> and <a href="abdominal%20cavity">abdominal cavity</a> as well as <a href="hypovolemia">depletion of fluid from the circulation</a> and <a href="hypoperfusion">decreased blood supply to vital organs</a>. There may also be organ dysfunction and severe <a href="bleeding">bleeding</a>, typically from the <a href="Human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal tract</a>. <a href="Shock%20%28circulatory%29">Shock</a> (dengue shock syndrome) and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, however those who have previously been infected with other <a href="serotype">serotype</a>s of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.

The recovery phase occurs next, with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream. This usually lasts two to three days. The improvement is often striking, and can be accompanied with severe <a href="itch">itch</a>ing and a <a href="Bradycardia">slow heart rate</a>. Another rash may occur with either a <a href="maculopapular%20rash">maculopapular</a> or a <a href="vasculitis">vasculitic</a> appearance, which is followed by peeling of the skin. During this stage, a <a href="fluid%20overload">fluid overload</a> state may occur; if it <a href="cerebral%20edema">affects the brain</a>, it may cause a <a href="altered%20level%20of%20consciousness">reduced level of consciousness</a> or <a href="Epileptic%20seizure">seizures</a>. A feeling of <a href="fatigue%20%28medical%29">fatigue</a> may last for weeks in adults.

Dengue can occasionally affect several other <a href="biological%20system">body systems</a>, either in isolation or along with the classic dengue symptoms. A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5–6% of severe cases, which is attributable either to <a href="encephalitis">inflammation of the brain by the virus</a> or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs, for example, the <a href="hepatic%20encephalopathy">liver</a>.

Other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of dengue, such as <a href="transverse%20myelitis">transverse myelitis</a> and <a href="Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9%20syndrome">Guillain–Barré syndrome</a>. <a href="Myocarditis">Infection of the heart</a> and <a href="acute%20liver%20failure">acute liver failure</a> are among the rarer complications.

A pregnant woman who develops dengue may be at a higher risk of <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a> as well as <a href="low%20birth%20weight">low birth weight</a> and <a href="Preterm%20birth">premature birth</a>.

Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an <a href="RNA%20virus">RNA virus</a> of the family "<a href="Flaviviridae">Flaviviridae</a>"; genus "<a href="Flavivirus">Flavivirus</a>". Other members of the same genus include <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever virus</a>, <a href="West%20Nile%20virus">West Nile virus</a>, <a href="Zika">Zika virus</a>, <a href="St.%20Louis%20encephalitis">St. Louis encephalitis virus</a>, <a href="Japanese%20encephalitis">Japanese encephalitis virus</a>, <a href="tick-borne%20encephalitis%20virus">tick-borne encephalitis virus</a>, <a href="Kyasanur%20forest%20disease">Kyasanur forest disease virus</a>, and <a href="Omsk%20hemorrhagic%20fever">Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus</a>. Most are transmitted by <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s (mosquitos or <a href="tick">tick</a>s), and are therefore also referred to as <a href="arbovirus">arbovirus</a>es ("ar"thropod-"bo"rne viruses).

The dengue virus <a href="genome">genome</a> (genetic material) contains about 11,000 <a href="nucleotide%20base">nucleotide base</a>s, which <a href="Genetic%20code">code</a> for the three different types of protein molecules (C, prM and E) that form the <a href="Virion">virus particle</a> and seven other non-structural protein molecules (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5) that are found in infected host cells only and are required for replication of the virus. There are five strains of the virus, called <a href="serovar">serotype</a>s, of which the first four are referred to as DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. The fifth type was announced in 2013. The distinctions between the serotypes are based on their <a href="antigenicity">antigenicity</a>.

Dengue virus is primarily transmitted by "<a href="Aedes">Aedes</a>" mosquitos, particularly "<a href="Aedes%20aegypti">A. aegypti</a>". These mosquitos usually live between the <a href="latitude">latitude</a>s of 35° North and 35° South below an <a href="elevation">elevation</a> of . They typically bite during the early morning and in the evening, but they may bite and thus spread infection at any time of day. Other "Aedes" species that transmit the disease include "<a href="Aedes%20albopictus">A. albopictus</a>", "<a href="Aedes%20polynesiensis">A. polynesiensis</a>" and "<a href="Aedes%20scutellaris">A. scutellaris</a>". Humans are the primary <a href="Host%20%28biology%29">host</a> of the virus, but it also circulates in nonhuman <a href="primate">primate</a>s. An infection can be acquired via a single bite. A female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever, during the initial 2- to 10-day febrile period, becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut. About 8–10 days later, the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito's <a href="salivary%20gland">salivary gland</a>s and is subsequently released into its saliva. The virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito, which remains infected for life. "Aedes aegypti" is particularly involved, as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers, to live in close proximity to humans, and to feed on people rather than other <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s.

Dengue can also be transmitted via infected <a href="blood%20products">blood products</a> and through <a href="organ%20donation">organ donation</a>. In countries such as <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, where dengue is endemic, the risk is estimated to be between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 <a href="blood%20transfusions">transfusions</a>. <a href="Vertical%20transmission">Vertical transmission</a> (from mother to child) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported. Other person-to-person modes of transmission have also been reported, but are very unusual. The genetic variation in dengue viruses is region specific, suggestive that establishment into new territories is relatively infrequent, despite dengue emerging in new regions in recent decades.

Severe disease is more common in babies and young children, and in contrast to many other infections, it is more common in children who are relatively well nourished. Other <a href="risk%20factor">risk factor</a>s for severe disease include female sex, high <a href="body%20mass%20index">body mass index</a>, and <a href="viral%20load">viral load</a>. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is a risk factor. Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with <a href="chronic%20disease">chronic disease</a>s such as <a href="diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a> and <a href="asthma">asthma</a>.

<a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">Polymorphisms</a> (normal variations) in particular <a href="gene">gene</a>s have been linked with an increased risk of severe dengue complications. Examples include the genes coding for the proteins known as <a href="Tumor%20necrosis%20factor-alpha">TNFα</a>, <a href="mannan-binding%20lectin">mannan-binding lectin</a>, <a href="CTLA4">CTLA4</a>, <a href="Transforming%20growth%20factor%20beta">TGFβ</a>, <a href="DC-SIGN">DC-SIGN</a>, <a href="PLCE1">PLCE1</a>, and particular <a href="allele">forms</a> of <a href="human%20leukocyte%20antigen">human leukocyte antigen</a> from gene variations of <a href="HLA-B">HLA-B</a>. A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as <a href="glucose-6-phosphate%20dehydrogenase%20deficiency">glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</a>, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in the genes for the <a href="Calcitriol%20receptor">vitamin D receptor</a> and <a href="Fc%20receptor%23Fc-gamma%20receptors">FcγR</a> seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.

When a mosquito carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as <a href="cytokines">cytokines</a> and <a href="interferons">interferons</a>, which are responsible for many of the symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the <a href="liver">liver</a> and the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a>) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to <a href="capillary%20permeability">capillary permeability</a>. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the <a href="stromal%20cell">stromal cell</a>s leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.

Once inside the skin, dengue virus binds to <a href="Langerhans%20cell">Langerhans cell</a>s (a population of <a href="dendritic%20cell">dendritic cell</a>s in the skin that identifies pathogens). The virus <a href="Receptor-mediated%20endocytosis">enters the cells</a> through binding between viral proteins and <a href="membrane%20protein">membrane protein</a>s on the Langerhans cell, specifically the <a href="C-type%20lectin">C-type lectin</a>s called DC-SIGN, <a href="mannose%20receptor">mannose receptor</a> and <a href="CLEC5A">CLEC5A</a>. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, seems to be the main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a>, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the <a href="Golgi%20apparatus">Golgi apparatus</a>, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (<a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a>s). The now mature new viruses are released by <a href="exocytosis">exocytosis</a>. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as <a href="monocyte">monocyte</a>s and <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s.

The initial reaction of infected cells is to produce <a href="interferon">interferon</a>, a <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a> that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the <a href="innate%20immune%20system">innate immune system</a> by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the <a href="JAK-STAT%20signaling%20pathway">JAK-STAT pathway</a>. Some serotypes of dengue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process. Interferon also activates the <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune system</a>, which leads to the generation of <a href="antibody">antibodies</a> against the virus as well as <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s that directly attack any cell infected with the virus. Various antibodies are generated; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a> (ingestion by <a href="phagocyte">specialized cells</a> and destruction), but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further.

It is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of <a href="antibody-dependent%20enhancement">antibody-dependent enhancement</a> (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the <a href="complement%20system">complement system</a>.

Severe disease is marked by the problems of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered <a href="coagulation">blood clotting</a>. These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial <a href="glycocalyx">glycocalyx</a>, which acts as a <a href="Molecular%20sieve">molecular filter</a> of blood components. Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) are thought to be caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become <a href="necrosis">necrotic</a>—which affect both coagulation and <a href="fibrinolysis">fibrinolysis</a> (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.

The diagnosis of dengue is typically made clinically, on the basis of reported symptoms and <a href="physical%20examination">physical examination</a>; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other <a href="viral%20infections">viral infections</a>. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: <a href="nausea">nausea</a> and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, <a href="Leukopenia">low white blood cell count</a>, positive <a href="tourniquet%20test">tourniquet test</a>, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an <a href="Endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a> area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a <a href="Sphygmomanometer">blood pressure cuff</a> at between the <a href="blood%20pressure">diastolic</a> and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any <a href="petechial">petechial</a> hemorrhages; a higher number makes a diagnosis of dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1 inch (6.25 cm).

The diagnosis should be considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the <a href="tropics">tropics</a> or <a href="subtropics">subtropics</a>. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and <a href="chikungunya">chikungunya</a>, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="leptospirosis">leptospirosis</a>, <a href="viral%20hemorrhagic%20fever">viral hemorrhagic fever</a>, <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, <a href="meningococcal%20disease">meningococcal disease</a>, <a href="measles">measles</a>, and <a href="influenza">influenza</a>. <a href="Zika%20fever">Zika fever</a> also has similar symptoms as dengue.

The earliest change detectable on laboratory investigations is a low white blood cell count, which may then be followed by <a href="Thrombocytopenia">low platelets</a> and <a href="metabolic%20acidosis">metabolic acidosis</a>. A moderately elevated level of <a href="aminotransferase">aminotransferase</a> (<a href="Aspartate%20transaminase">AST</a> and <a href="Alanine%20transaminase">ALT</a>) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in <a href="hemoconcentration">hemoconcentration</a> (as indicated by a rising <a href="hematocrit">hematocrit</a>) and <a href="hypoalbuminemia">hypoalbuminemia</a>. <a href="Pleural%20effusion">Pleural effusion</a>s or <a href="ascites">ascites</a> can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on <a href="medical%20ultrasonography">ultrasound</a> may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if <a href="pulse%20pressure">pulse pressure</a> drops to ≤ 20 mm Hg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed <a href="capillary%20refill">capillary refill</a>, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.

The <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s 2009 classification divides dengue fever into two groups: uncomplicated and severe. This replaces the 1997 WHO classification, which needed to be simplified as it had been found to be too restrictive, though the older classification is still widely used including by the World Health Organization's Regional Office for South-East Asia . Severe dengue is defined as that associated with severe bleeding, severe organ dysfunction, or severe plasma leakage while all other cases are uncomplicated. The 1997 classification divided dengue into undifferentiated fever, dengue fever, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever was subdivided further into grades I–IV. Grade I is the presence only of easy bruising or a positive tourniquet test in someone with fever, grade II is the presence of spontaneous bleeding into the skin and elsewhere, grade III is the clinical evidence of shock, and grade IV is shock so severe that blood pressure and <a href="pulse">pulse</a> cannot be detected. Grades III and IV are referred to as "dengue shock syndrome".

The diagnosis of dengue fever may be confirmed by microbiological laboratory testing. This can be done by virus isolation in <a href="cell%20culture">cell culture</a>s, <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20test">nucleic acid detection</a> by <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">PCR</a>, viral <a href="antigen">antigen</a> detection (such as for <a href="NS1%20antigen%20test">NS1</a>) or specific <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a> (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; this is likely to improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.

These laboratory tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness with the exception of serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types <a href="IgG">IgG</a> and <a href="IgM">IgM</a>, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (<a href="titre">titre</a>s) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.

Prevention depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmits it. The World Health Organization recommends an Integrated Vector Control program consisting of five elements:


The primary method of controlling "A. aegypti" is by eliminating its <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s. This is done by getting rid of open sources of water, or if this is not possible, by adding <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s or <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological control agents</a> to these areas. Generalized spraying with <a href="organophosphate">organophosphate</a> or <a href="pyrethroid">pyrethroid</a> insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin, using <a href="mosquito%20net">mosquito net</a>ting while resting, and/or the application of <a href="insect%20repellent">insect repellent</a> (<a href="DEET">DEET</a> being the most effective). While these measures can be an effective means of reducing an individual's risk of exposure, they do little in terms of mitigating the frequency of outbreaks, which appear to be on the rise in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of "A. aegypti". The range of the disease also appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.

In 2016 a partially effective <a href="dengue%20fever%20vaccine">vaccine for dengue fever</a> became commercially available in the Philippines and Indonesia. It has also been approved for use by Mexico, Brazil, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Singapore, and Paraguay. In Indonesia it costs about US$207 for the recommended three doses.

The vaccine is produced by <a href="Sanofi">Sanofi</a> and goes by the brand name <a href="Dengvaxia">Dengvaxia</a>. It is based on a weakened combination of the <a href="yellow%20fever%20virus">yellow fever virus</a> and each of the four dengue serotypes. Two studies of a vaccine found it was 60% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases. This is less than wished for by some. In 2017 the manufacturer recommended that the vaccine only be used in people who have previously had a dengue infection as otherwise there was evidence it may worsen subsequent infections.

There are ongoing programs working on a dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes. Now that there is a fifth serotype this will need to be factored in. One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through <a href="antibody-dependent%20enhancement">antibody-dependent enhancement</a> (ADE). The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.

International Anti-Dengue Day is observed every year on 15 June. The idea was first agreed upon in 2010 with the first event held in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> in 2011. Further events were held in 2012 in <a href="Yangon">Yangon</a>, <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> and in 2013 in <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. Goals are to increase public awareness about dengue, mobilize resources for its prevention and control and, to demonstrate the Asian region's commitment in tackling the disease.

There are no specific <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s for dengue; however, maintaining proper fluid balance is important. Treatment depends on the symptoms. Those who are able to drink, are passing urine, have no "warning signs" and are otherwise healthy can be managed at home with daily follow-up and <a href="oral%20rehydration%20therapy">oral rehydration therapy</a>. Those who have other health problems, have "warning signs", or cannot manage regular follow-up should be cared for in hospital. In those with severe dengue care should be provided in an area where there is access to an <a href="intensive%20care%20unit">intensive care unit</a>.

Intravenous hydration, if required, is typically only needed for one or two days. In children with <a href="shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a> due to dengue a rapid dose of 20 mL/kg is reasonable. The rate of fluid administration is then titrated to a <a href="Urination">urinary output</a> of 0.5–1 mL/kg/h, stable <a href="vital%20signs">vital signs</a> and normalization of hematocrit. The smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended.

Invasive medical procedures such as <a href="nasogastric%20intubation">nasogastric intubation</a>, <a href="intramuscular%20injection">intramuscular injection</a>s and arterial punctures are avoided, in view of the bleeding risk. <a href="Paracetamol">Paracetamol</a> (acetaminophen) is used for fever and discomfort while <a href="NSAIDs">NSAIDs</a> such as <a href="ibuprofen">ibuprofen</a> and <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a> are avoided as they might aggravate the risk of bleeding. <a href="Blood%20transfusion">Blood transfusion</a> is initiated early in people presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a "decreasing hematocrit", rather than waiting for the hemoglobin concentration to decrease to some predetermined "transfusion trigger" level. <a href="Packed%20red%20blood%20cells">Packed red blood cells</a> or <a href="whole%20blood">whole blood</a> are recommended, while <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s and <a href="fresh%20frozen%20plasma">fresh frozen plasma</a> are usually not. There is not enough evidence to determine if <a href="corticosteroid">corticosteroid</a>s have a positive or negative effect in dengue fever.

During the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of <a href="Hypervolemia">fluid overload</a>. If fluid overload occurs and vital signs are stable, stopping further fluid may be all that is needed. If a person is outside of the critical phase, a <a href="loop%20diuretic">loop diuretic</a> such as <a href="furosemide">furosemide</a> may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation.

Most people with dengue recover without any ongoing problems. The fatality rate is 1–5%, and less than 1% with adequate treatment; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatality rate of up to 26%. Dengue is <a href="endemism">common</a> in more than 110 countries. In 2013 it causes about 60 million symptomatic infections worldwide, with 18% admitted to hospital and about 13,600 deaths. The worldwide cost of dengue case is estimated US$9 billion. For the decade of the 2000s, 12 countries in Southeast Asia were estimated to have about 3 million infections and 6,000 deaths annually. It is reported in at least 22 countries in Africa; but is likely present in all of them with 20% of the population at risk. This makes it one of the most common <a href="vector-borne%20disease">vector-borne disease</a>s worldwide.

Infections are most commonly acquired in the urban environment. In recent decades, the expansion of villages, towns and cities in the areas in which it is common, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might pose a threat to Europe.

Rates of dengue increased 30 fold between 1960 and 2010. This increase is believed to be due to a combination of urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>. The geographical distribution is around the equator. Of the 2.5 billion people living in areas where it is common 70% are from Asia and the Pacific. An infection with dengue is second only to malaria as a diagnosed cause of fever among travelers returning from the developing world. It is the most common viral disease transmitted by arthropods, and has a <a href="disease%20burden">disease burden</a> estimated at 1,600 <a href="disability-adjusted%20life%20year">disability-adjusted life year</a>s per million population. The World Health Organization counts dengue as one of seventeen <a href="neglected%20tropical%20diseases">neglected tropical diseases</a>.

Like most arboviruses, dengue virus is maintained in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts. The viruses are maintained in the forests of Southeast Asia and Africa by transmission from female "Aedes" mosquitos—of species other than "A. aegypti"—to their offspring and to lower primates. In towns and cities, the virus is primarily transmitted by the highly domesticated "A. aegypti". In rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by "A. aegypti" and other species of "Aedes" such as "<a href="Aedes%20albopictus">A. albopictus</a>". Both these species had expanding ranges in the second half of the 20th century. In all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of circulating dengue viruses, in a process called amplification.

The first record of a case of probable dengue fever is in a Chinese medical encyclopedia from the <a href="Jin%20Dynasty%20%28265%E2%80%93420%29">Jin Dynasty</a> (265–420 AD) which referred to a "water poison" associated with flying insects. The primary vector, "A. aegypti", spread out of Africa in the 15th to 19th centuries due in part to increased globalization secondary to the <a href="slave%20trade">slave trade</a>. There have been descriptions of epidemics in the 17th century, but the most plausible early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780, when an epidemic swept across Asia, Africa and North America. From that time until 1940, epidemics were infrequent.

In 1906, transmission by the "Aedes" mosquitos was confirmed, and in 1907 dengue was the second disease (after yellow fever) that was shown to be caused by a virus. Further investigations by <a href="John%20Burton%20Cleland">John Burton Cleland</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Franklin%20Siler">Joseph Franklin Siler</a> completed the basic understanding of dengue transmission.

The marked spread of dengue during and after the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> has been attributed to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of <a href="child%20mortality">child mortality</a> and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.

The origins of the Spanish word "dengue" are not certain, but it is possibly derived from "dinga" in the <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a> phrase "Ka-dinga pepo", which describes the disease as being caused by an <a href="evil%20spirit">evil spirit</a>. Slaves in the West Indies having contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a <a href="dandy">dandy</a>, and the disease was known as "dandy fever".

The term "break-bone fever" was applied by physician and <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Founding Father</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Rush">Benjamin Rush</a>, in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. In the report title he uses the more formal term "bilious remitting fever". The term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828. Other historical terms include "breakheart fever" and "la dengue". Terms for severe disease include "infectious thrombocytopenic purpura" and "Philippine", "Thai", or "Singapore hemorrhagic fever".

Outbreaks of dengue fever increases the need for blood products while decreasing the number of potential <a href="blood%20donor">blood donor</a>s due to potential infection with the virus. Someone who has a dengue infection typically is not allowed to donate blood for the next at least six months.

A National Dengue Day is held in India on May 16th in an effort to raise awareness in affected countries. Efforts are ongoing as of 2019 to make it a global event. The Philippines has an awareness month in June since 1998.

Research efforts to prevent and treat dengue include various means of vector control, vaccine development, and antiviral drugs.

With regards to <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a> control, a number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the placement of the guppy ("<a href="Poecilia%20reticulata">Poecilia reticulata</a>") or <a href="copepods">copepods</a> in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae. There are also trials with genetically modified male "A. aegypti" that after release into the wild mate with females, and render their offspring unable to fly.

Attempts are ongoing to infect the mosquito population with bacteria of the genus "<a href="Wolbachia">Wolbachia</a>", which makes the mosquitos partially resistant to dengue virus. While artificially induced infection with "Wolbachia" is effective, it is unclear if naturally acquired infections are protective. Work is still ongoing to determine the best type of "Wolbachia" to use.

Apart from attempts to control the spread of the "Aedes" mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery of the structure of the viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral <a href="RNA-dependent%20RNA%20polymerase">RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</a> (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with <a href="nucleoside%20analog">nucleoside analog</a>s. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific <a href="Protease%20inhibitor%20%28pharmacology%29">inhibitors</a> of the viral <a href="protease">protease</a> (coded by NS3), which <a href="protein%20splicing">splices</a> viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop <a href="entry%20inhibitor">entry inhibitor</a>s, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the <a href="Five%20prime%20cap">5′ cap</a>ping process, which is required for viral replication.

Joseph Priestley

Joseph Priestley (; – 6 February 1804) was an 18th-century <a href="English%20Separatist">English Separatist</a> <a href="theologian">theologian</a>, <a href="Natural%20philosophy">natural philosopher</a>, <a href="chemistry">chemist</a>, innovative <a href="Linguist">grammarian</a>, multi-subject educator, and <a href="Liberalism">liberal</a> <a href="Political%20philosophy">political theorist</a> who published over 150 works. He has historically been credited with the discovery of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, having isolated it in its gaseous state, although <a href="Carl%20Wilhelm%20Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> also have strong claims to the discovery.

During his lifetime, Priestley's considerable scientific reputation rested on his invention of <a href="soda%20water">soda water</a>, his writings on <a href="electricity">electricity</a>, and his discovery of several "airs" (gases), the most famous being what Priestley dubbed "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen). However, Priestley's determination to defend <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a> and to reject what would become the <a href="chemical%20revolution">chemical revolution</a> eventually left him isolated within the scientific community.

Priestley's science was integral to his theology, and he consistently tried to fuse <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a> with Christian <a href="theism">theism</a>. In his metaphysical texts, Priestley attempted to combine theism, <a href="materialism">materialism</a>, and <a href="determinism">determinism</a>, a project that has been called "audacious and original". He believed that a proper understanding of the natural world would promote human <a href="Progress%20%28history%29">progress</a> and eventually bring about the Christian <a href="millennialism">millennium</a>. Priestley, who strongly believed in the free and open exchange of ideas, advocated <a href="religious%20toleration">toleration</a> and equal rights for <a href="English%20Dissenters">religious Dissenters</a>, which also led him to help found <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a> <a href="History%20of%20Unitarianism%23England">in England</a>. The controversial nature of Priestley's publications, combined with his outspoken support of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, aroused public and governmental suspicion; he was eventually forced to flee in 1791, first to London and then to the United States, after a mob <a href="Priestley%20Riots">burned down</a> his Birmingham home and church. He spent his last ten years in <a href="Northumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland County, Pennsylvania</a>.

A scholar and teacher throughout his life, Priestley also made significant contributions to <a href="pedagogy">pedagogy</a>, including the publication of a seminal work on <a href="Grammar%23History">English grammar</a> and books on history, and he prepared some of the most influential early timelines. These educational writings were among Priestley's most popular works. It was his metaphysical works, however, that had the most lasting influence, being considered primary sources for <a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a> by philosophers such as <a href="Jeremy%20Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</a>, <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, and <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>.

Priestley was born to an established English <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenting</a> family (i.e. they did not conform to the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>) in <a href="Birstall%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Birstall</a>, near <a href="Batley">Batley</a> in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>. He was the oldest of six children born to Mary Swift and Jonas Priestley, a <a href="finishing%20%28textiles%29">finisher</a> of cloth. To ease his mother's burdens, Priestley was sent to live with his grandfather around the age of one. He returned home, five years later, after his mother died. When his father remarried in 1741, Priestley went to live with his aunt and uncle, the wealthy and childless Sarah and John Keighley, from Fieldhead. Because Priestley was precocious—at the age of four he could flawlessly recite all 107 questions and answers of the <a href="Westminster%20Shorter%20Catechism">Westminster Shorter Catechism</a>—his aunt sought the best education for the boy, intending him for the ministry. During his youth, Priestley attended local schools where he learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew.

Around 1749, Priestley became seriously ill and believed he was dying. Raised as a devout <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a>, he believed a <a href="Conversion%20to%20Christianity">conversion experience</a> was necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject <a href="Unconditional%20election">election</a> and to accept <a href="Universal%20reconciliation">universal salvation</a>. As a result, the elders of his home church, the <a href="Independent%20%28religion%29">Independent</a> Upper Chapel of <a href="Heckmondwike">Heckmondwike</a>, refused him admission as a full member.

Priestley's illness left him with a permanent stutter and he gave up any thoughts of entering the ministry at that time. In preparation for joining a relative in trade in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, he studied French, Italian, and German in addition to <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, and Arabic. He was tutored by the Reverend George Haggerstone, who first introduced him to higher mathematics, <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a>, logic, and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> through the works of <a href="Isaac%20Watts">Isaac Watts</a>, <a href="Willem%20%27s%20Gravesande">Willem 's Gravesande</a>, and <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>.

Priestley eventually decided to return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at <a href="Daventry%20Academy">Daventry</a>, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip the first two years of coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a <a href="English%20Dissenters%23Rational%20Dissenters">Rational Dissenter</a>. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.

Priestley later wrote that the book that influenced him the most, save the Bible, was <a href="David%20Hartley%20%28philosopher%29">David Hartley's</a> "<a href="Observations%20on%20Man">Observations on Man</a>" (1749). Hartley's psychological, philosophical, and theological treatise postulated a material <a href="Philosophy%20of%20mind">theory of mind</a>. Hartley aimed to construct a Christian philosophy in which both religious and moral "facts" could be scientifically proven, a goal that would occupy Priestley for his entire life. In his third year at Daventry, Priestley committed himself to the ministry, which he described as "the noblest of all professions".

Robert Schofield, Priestley's major modern biographer, describes his first "call" in 1755 to the Dissenting parish in <a href="Needham%20Market">Needham Market</a>, Suffolk, as a "mistake" for both Priestley and the congregation. Priestley yearned for urban life and theological debate, whereas Needham Market was a small, rural town with a congregation wedded to tradition. Attendance and donations dropped sharply when they discovered the extent of his <a href="heterodoxy">heterodoxy</a>. Although Priestley's aunt had promised her support if he became a minister, she refused any further assistance when she realised he was no longer a <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a>. To earn extra money, Priestley proposed opening a school, but local families informed him that they would refuse to send their children. He also presented a series of scientific lectures titled "Use of the Globes" that was more successful.
Priestley's Daventry friends helped him obtain another position and in 1758 he moved to <a href="Nantwich">Nantwich</a>, Cheshire, living at <a href="Sweetbriar%20Hall">Sweetbriar Hall</a> in the town's Hospital Street; his time there was happier. The congregation cared less about Priestley's heterodoxy and he successfully established a school. Unlike many schoolmasters of the time, Priestley taught his students <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a> and even bought scientific instruments for them. Appalled at the quality of the available English grammar books, Priestley wrote his own: "<a href="The%20Rudiments%20of%20English%20Grammar">The Rudiments of English Grammar</a>" (1761). His innovations in the description of English grammar, particularly his efforts to dissociate it from <a href="Grammar%23History">Latin grammar</a>, led 20th-century scholars to describe him as "one of the great grammarians of his time". After the publication of "Rudiments" and the success of Priestley's school, <a href="Warrington%20Academy">Warrington Academy</a> offered him a teaching position in 1761.

In 1761, Priestley moved to <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a> and assumed the post of tutor of modern languages and rhetoric at <a href="Warrington%20Academy">the town's Dissenting academy</a>, although he would have preferred to teach mathematics and natural philosophy. He fitted in well at Warrington, and made friends quickly. These included <a href="John%20Aikin">John Aikin</a>, his sister <a href="Anna%20Laetitia%20Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Aikin</a>, and <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood">Josiah Wedgwood</a>. Wedgwood met Priestley in 1762, after a fall from his horse. Wedgwood and Priestley met rarely, but exchanged letters, advice on chemistry, and laboratory equipment. Wedgwood eventually created a medallion of Priestley in cream-on-blue <a href="jasperware">jasperware</a>.

On 23 June 1762, Priestley married Mary Wilkinson of <a href="Wrexham">Wrexham</a>. Of his marriage, Priestley wrote:

This proved a very suitable and happy connexion, my wife being a woman of an excellent understanding, much improved by reading, of great fortitude and strength of mind, and of a temper in the highest degree affectionate and generous; feeling strongly for others, and little for herself. Also, greatly excelling in every thing relating to household affairs, she entirely relieved me of all concern of that kind, which allowed me to give all my time to the prosecution of my studies, and the other duties of my station.

On 17 April 1763, they had a daughter, whom they named Sarah after Priestley's aunt.

All of the books Priestley published while at Warrington emphasised the study of history; Priestley considered it essential for worldly success as well as religious growth. He wrote histories of science and Christianity in an effort to reveal the progress of humanity and, paradoxically, the loss of a pure, "primitive Christianity".

In his "<a href="Essay%20on%20a%20Course%20of%20Liberal%20Education%20for%20Civil%20and%20Active%20Life">Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life</a>" (1765), "<a href="Lectures%20on%20History%20and%20General%20Policy">Lectures on History and General Policy</a>" (1788), and other works, Priestley argued that the education of the young should anticipate their future practical needs. This principle of utility guided his unconventional curricular choices for Warrington's aspiring middle-class students. He recommended modern languages instead of classical languages and modern rather than ancient history. Priestley's lectures on history were particularly revolutionary; he narrated a <a href="providentialism">providentialist</a> and naturalist account of history, arguing that the study of history furthered the comprehension of God's natural laws. Furthermore, his <a href="millennialism">millennial</a> perspective was closely tied to his optimism regarding scientific progress and the improvement of humanity. He believed that each age would improve upon the previous and that the study of history allowed people to perceive and to advance this progress. Since the study of history was a moral imperative for Priestley, he also promoted the education of middle-class women, which was unusual at the time. Some scholars of education have described Priestley as the most important English writer on education between the 17th-century <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> and the 19th-century <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>. "Lectures on History" was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as New College at Hackney, <a href="Brown%20University">Brown</a>, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>, <a href="Yale">Yale</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. Priestley designed two "Charts" to serve as visual study aids for his "Lectures". These charts are in fact timelines; they have been described as the most influential timelines published in the 18th century. Both were popular for decades, and the trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> to grant him a <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Law</a> degree in 1764.

The intellectually stimulating atmosphere of Warrington, often called the "Athens of the North" (of England) during the 18th century, encouraged Priestley's growing interest in natural philosophy. He gave lectures on anatomy and performed experiments regarding temperature with another tutor at Warrington, his friend <a href="John%20Seddon%20of%20Warrington">John Seddon</a>. Despite Priestley's busy teaching schedule, he decided to write a history of electricity. Friends introduced him to the major experimenters in the field in Britain—<a href="John%20Canton">John Canton</a>, <a href="William%20Watson%20%28scientist%29">William Watson</a>, and the visiting <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>—who encouraged Priestley to perform the experiments he wanted to include in his history. In the process of replicating others' experiments, Priestley became intrigued by unanswered questions and was prompted to undertake experiments of his own design. (Impressed with his "Charts" and the manuscript of his history of electricity, Canton, Franklin, Watson, and <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a> nominated Priestley for a fellowship in the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>; he was accepted in 1766.)

In 1767, the 700-page "<a href="The%20History%20and%20Present%20State%20of%20Electricity">The History and Present State of Electricity</a>" was published to positive reviews. The first half of the text is a history of the study of electricity to 1766; the second and more influential half is a description of contemporary theories about electricity and suggestions for future research. Priestley reported some of his own discoveries in the second section, such as the <a href="Electrical%20conductivity">conductivity</a> of <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> and other substances and the continuum between conductors and non-conductors. This discovery overturned what he described as "one of the earliest and universally received maxims of electricity", that only water and metals could conduct electricity. This and other experiments on the electrical properties of materials and on the electrical effects of chemical transformations demonstrated Priestley's early and ongoing interest in the relationship between chemical substances and electricity. Based on experiments with charged spheres, Priestley was among the first to propose that electrical force followed an <a href="inverse-square%20law">inverse-square law</a>, similar to <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">Newton's law of universal gravitation</a>. However, he did not generalise or elaborate on this, and the <a href="Coulomb%27s%20law">general law</a> was enunciated by French physicist <a href="Charles-Augustin%20de%20Coulomb">Charles-Augustin de Coulomb</a> in the 1780s.

Priestley's strength as a natural philosopher was qualitative rather than quantitative and his observation of "a current of real air" between two electrified points would later interest <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> and <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> as they investigated <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a>. Priestley's text became the standard history of electricity for over a century; <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Alessandro Volta</a> (who later invented the battery), <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> (who discovered <a href="infrared%20radiation">infrared radiation</a>), and <a href="Henry%20Cavendish">Henry Cavendish</a> (who discovered <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>) all relied upon it. Priestley wrote a popular version of the "History of Electricity" for the general public titled "A Familiar Introduction to the Study of Electricity" (1768). He marketed the book with his brother Timothy, but unsuccessfully.

Perhaps prompted by Mary Priestley's ill health, or financial problems, or a desire to prove himself to the community that had rejected him in his childhood, Priestley moved with his family from Warrington to <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> in 1767, and he became <a href="Mill%20Hill%20Chapel">Mill Hill Chapel</a>'s minister. Two sons were born to the Priestleys in Leeds: Joseph junior on 24 July 1768 and <a href="William%20Priestley%20%28Louisiana%20planter%29">William</a> three years later. <a href="Theophilus%20Lindsey">Theophilus Lindsey</a>, a <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> at <a href="Catterick%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Catterick, Yorkshire</a>, became one of Priestley's few friends in Leeds, of whom he wrote: "I never chose to publish any thing of moment relating to theology, without consulting him." Although Priestley had extended family living around Leeds, it does not appear that they communicated. Schofield conjectures that they considered him a <a href="Heresy">heretic</a>. Each year Priestley travelled to London to consult with his close friend and publisher, <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a>, and to attend meetings of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>.

When Priestley became its minister, <a href="Mill%20Hill%20Chapel">Mill Hill Chapel</a> was one of the oldest and most respected <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenting congregations in England</a>; however, during the early 18th century the congregation had fractured along doctrinal lines, and was losing members to the charismatic <a href="Methodism%23Wesleyan%20revival">Methodist movement</a>. Priestley believed that by educating the young, he could strengthen the bonds of the congregation.

In his magisterial three-volume "<a href="Institutes%20of%20Natural%20and%20Revealed%20Religion">Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion</a>" (1772–74), Priestley outlined his theories of religious instruction. More importantly, he laid out his belief in <a href="Socinianism">Socinianism</a>. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a> in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it paved the way for his <a href="materialism">materialism</a> and <a href="necessitarianism">necessitarianism</a> (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).

Priestley's major argument in the "Institutes" was that the only revealed religious truths that could be accepted were those that matched one's experience of the natural world. Because his views of religion were deeply tied to his understanding of nature, the text's <a href="theism">theism</a> rested on the <a href="argument%20from%20design">argument from design</a>. The "Institutes" shocked and appalled many readers, primarily because it challenged basic Christian orthodoxies, such as the <a href="Christ">divinity of Christ</a> and the <a href="Virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">miracle of the Virgin Birth</a>. Methodists in Leeds penned a hymn asking God to "the Unitarian fiend expel / And chase his doctrine back to Hell." Priestley wanted to return Christianity to its "primitive" or "pure" form by eliminating the "corruptions" which had accumulated over the centuries. The fourth part of the "Institutes", "<a href="An%20History%20of%20the%20Corruptions%20of%20Christianity">An History of the Corruptions of Christianity</a>", became so long that he was forced to issue it separately in 1782. Priestley believed that the "Corruptions" was "the most valuable" work he ever published. In demanding that his readers apply the logic of the emerging sciences and comparative history to the Bible and Christianity, he alienated religious and scientific readers alike—scientific readers did not appreciate seeing science used in the defence of religion and religious readers dismissed the application of science to religion.

Priestley engaged in numerous political and religious <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a> wars. According to Schofield, "he entered each controversy with a cheerful conviction that he was right, while most of his opponents were convinced, from the outset, that he was willfully and maliciously wrong. He was able, then, to contrast his sweet reasonableness to their personal rancor", but as Schofield points out Priestley rarely altered his opinion as a result of these debates. While at Leeds he wrote controversial pamphlets on the <a href="Eucharist">Lord's Supper</a> and on <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> doctrine; thousands of copies were published, making them some of Priestley's most widely read works.

Priestley founded the "<a href="Theological%20Repository">Theological Repository</a>" in 1768, a journal committed to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions. Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material became the basis for many of his later theological and metaphysical works). After only a few years, due to a lack of funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal. He revived it in 1784 with similar results.

Many of Priestley's political writings supported the repeal of the <a href="Test%20Act">Test</a> and <a href="Corporation%20Act%201661">Corporation Acts</a>, which restricted the rights of Dissenters. They could not hold political office, serve in the armed forces, or attend Oxford and Cambridge unless they subscribed to the <a href="Thirty-nine%20Articles">Thirty-nine Articles</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing that they were being treated as second-class citizens.

Priestley's friends, particularly other Rational Dissenters, urged him to publish a work on the injustices experienced by Dissenters; the result was his "<a href="Essay%20on%20the%20First%20Principles%20of%20Government">Essay on the First Principles of Government</a>" (1768). An early work of <a href="Liberalism">modern liberal political theory</a> and Priestley's most thorough treatment of the subject, it—unusually for the time—distinguished political rights from civil rights with precision and argued for expansive civil rights. Priestley identified separate private and public spheres, contending that the government should only have control over the public sphere. Education and religion, in particular, he maintained, were matters of private conscience and should not be administered by the state. Priestley's later radicalism emerged from his belief that the British government was infringing upon these individual freedoms.

Priestley also defended the rights of Dissenters against the attacks of <a href="William%20Blackstone">William Blackstone</a>, an eminent legal theorist, whose "<a href="Commentaries%20on%20the%20Laws%20of%20England">Commentaries on the Laws of England</a>" (1765–69) had become the standard legal guide. Blackstone's book stated that dissent from the Church of England was a crime and that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects. Furious, Priestley lashed out with his "Remarks on Dr. Blackstone's Commentaries" (1769), correcting Blackstone's interpretation of the law, his grammar (a highly politicised subject at the time), and history. Blackstone, chastened, altered subsequent editions of his "Commentaries": he rephrased the offending passages and removed the sections claiming that Dissenters could not be loyal subjects, but he retained his description of Dissent as a crime.

Although Priestley claimed that <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a> was only a hobby, he took it seriously. In his "History of Electricity", he described the scientist as promoting the "security and happiness of mankind". Priestley's science was eminently practical and he rarely concerned himself with theoretical questions; his model was <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. When he moved to Leeds, Priestley continued his electrical and chemical experiments (the latter aided by a steady supply of carbon dioxide from a neighbouring brewery). Between 1767 and 1770, he presented five papers to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> from these initial experiments; the first four papers explored <a href="coronal%20discharge">coronal discharge</a>s and other phenomena related to <a href="electrical%20discharge">electrical discharge</a>, while the fifth reported on the conductivity of charcoals from different sources. His subsequent experimental work focused on chemistry and <a href="pneumatics">pneumatics</a>.

Priestley published the first volume of his projected history of experimental philosophy, "The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours" (referred to as his "Optics"), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his "History of Electricity" so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his "History of Electricity", it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the "Optics" convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.

Priestley was considered for the position of astronomer on <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s <a href="James%20Cook%23Second%20voyage%20%281772%E2%80%9375%29">second voyage to the South Seas</a>, but was not chosen. Still, he contributed in a small way to the voyage: he provided the crew with a method for making <a href="carbonated%20water">soda water</a>, which he erroneously speculated might be a cure for <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>. He then published a pamphlet with "Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air" (1772). Priestley did not exploit the commercial potential of soda water, but others such as made fortunes from it. For his discovery of soda water Priestley has been labelled “the father of the <a href="soft%20drink">soft drink</a>”, with the beverage company <a href="Schweppes">Schweppes</a> regarding him as “the father of our industry”. In 1773, the Royal Society recognised Priestley's achievements in natural philosophy by awarding him the <a href="Copley%20Medal">Copley Medal</a>.

Priestley's friends wanted to find him a more financially secure position. In 1772, prompted by <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a> and Benjamin Franklin, <a href="William%20Petty%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Shelburne">Lord Shelburne</a> wrote to Priestley asking him to direct the education of his children and to act as his general assistant. Although Priestley was reluctant to sacrifice his ministry, he accepted the position, resigning from Mill Hill Chapel on 20 December 1772, and preaching his last sermon on 16 May 1773.

In 1773, the Priestleys moved to <a href="Calne">Calne</a> in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>, and a year later <a href="William%20Petty%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Shelburne">Lord Shelburne</a> and Priestley took a tour of Europe. According to Priestley's close friend <a href="Theophilus%20Lindsey">Theophilus Lindsey</a>, Priestley was "much improved by this view of mankind at large". Upon their return, Priestley easily fulfilled his duties as librarian and tutor. The workload was intentionally light, allowing him time to pursue his scientific investigations and theological interests. Priestley also became a political adviser to Shelburne, gathering information on parliamentary issues and serving as a liaison between Shelburne and the Dissenting and American interests. When the Priestleys' third son was born on 24 May 1777, they named him Henry at the lord's request.

Priestley wrote his most important philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major <a href="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> texts published between 1774 and 1780—"An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind" (1774), "Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas" (1775), "<a href="Disquisitions%20relating%20to%20Matter%20and%20Spirit">Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit</a>" (1777), "<a href="The%20Doctrine%20of%20Philosophical%20Necessity%20Illustrated">The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated</a>" (1777), and "<a href="Letters%20to%20a%20Philosophical%20Unbeliever">Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever</a>" (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: <a href="determinism">determinism</a>, <a href="materialism">materialism</a>, <a href="causality">causation</a>, and <a href="necessitarianism">necessitarianism</a>. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.

Priestley strongly suggested that there is no <a href="Dualism%20%28philosophy%20of%20mind%29">mind-body duality</a>, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">soul</a> to exist.

Responding to <a href="Baron%20d%27Holbach">Baron d'Holbach</a>'s "<a href="The%20System%20of%20Nature">Système de la Nature</a>" (1770) and <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>'s "<a href="Dialogues%20Concerning%20Natural%20Religion">Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</a>" (1779) as well as the works of the French "philosophers", Priestley maintained that materialism and determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.

Maintaining that humans had no <a href="free%20will">free will</a>, Priestley argued that what he called "philosophical necessity" (akin to <a href="determinism">absolute determinism</a>) is consonant with Christianity, a position based on his understanding of the natural world. Like the rest of nature, man's mind is subject to the laws of causation, Priestley contended, but because a benevolent God created these laws, the world and the people in it will eventually be perfected. Evil is therefore only an imperfect understanding of the world.

Although Priestley's philosophical work has been characterised as "audacious and original", it partakes of older philosophical traditions on the problems of <a href="free%20will">free will</a>, <a href="determinism">determinism</a>, and <a href="materialism">materialism</a>. For example, the 17th-century philosopher <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a> argued for absolute determinism and absolute materialism. Like Spinoza and Priestley,
<a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Leibniz</a> argued that human will was completely determined by natural laws;
however, unlike them, Leibniz argued for a "parallel universe" of immaterial objects (such as human souls) so arranged by God that its outcomes agree exactly with those of the material universe.
Leibniz
and Priestley
share an optimism that God has chosen the chain of events benevolently; however, Priestley believed that the events were leading to a glorious <a href="Millennialism">Millennial</a> conclusion, whereas for Leibniz the entire chain of events was optimal in and of itself, as compared with other conceivable chains of events.

When Priestley's friend <a href="Theophilus%20Lindsey">Theophilus Lindsey</a> decided to found a new Christian denomination that would not restrict its members' beliefs, Priestley and others hurried to his aid. On 17 April 1774, Lindsey held the first <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> service in Britain, at the newly formed <a href="Essex%20Street%20Chapel">Essex Street Chapel</a> in London; he had even designed his own liturgy, of which many were critical. Priestley defended his friend in the pamphlet "Letter to a Layman, on the Subject of the Rev. Mr. Lindsey's Proposal for a Reformed English Church" (1774), claiming that only the form of worship had been altered, not its substance, and attacking those who followed religion as a fashion. Priestley attended Lindsey's church regularly in the 1770s and occasionally preached there. He continued to support institutionalised Unitarianism for the rest of his life, writing several "Defenses" of Unitarianism and encouraging the foundation of new Unitarian chapels throughout Britain and the United States.

Priestley's years in Calne were the only ones in his life dominated by scientific investigations; they were also the most scientifically fruitful. His experiments were almost entirely confined to "airs", and out of this work emerged his most important scientific texts: the six volumes of "<a href="Experiments%20and%20Observations%20on%20Different%20Kinds%20of%20Air">Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air</a>" (1774–86). These experiments helped repudiate the last vestiges of the <a href="Classical%20element">theory of four elements</a>, which Priestley attempted to replace with his own variation of <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a>. According to that 18th-century theory, the combustion or <a href="redox">oxidation</a> of a substance corresponded to the release of a material substance, "phlogiston".

Priestley's work on "airs" is not easily classified. As historian of science <a href="Simon%20Schaffer">Simon Schaffer</a> writes, it "has been seen as a branch of physics, or chemistry, or natural philosophy, or some highly idiosyncratic version of Priestley's own invention". Furthermore, the volumes were both a scientific and a political enterprise for Priestley, in which he argues that science could destroy "undue and usurped authority" and that government has "reason to tremble even at an air pump or an electrical machine".

Volume I of "Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air" outlined several discoveries: "nitrous air" (<a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a>, NO); "vapor of spirit of salt", later called "acid air" or "marine acid air" (<a href="anhydrous%20hydrochloric%20acid">anhydrous hydrochloric acid</a>, HCl); "alkaline air" (<a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, NH); "diminished" or "dephlogisticated nitrous air" (<a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a>, NO); and, most famously, "dephlogisticated air" (<a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, O) as well as experimental findings that showed plants revitalised enclosed volumes of air, a discovery that would eventually lead to the discovery of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Priestley also developed a "nitrous air test" to determine the "goodness of air". Using a <a href="pneumatic%20trough">pneumatic trough</a>, he would mix nitrous air with a test sample, over water or mercury, and measure the decrease in volume—the principle of <a href="eudiometer">eudiometry</a>. After a small history of the study of airs, he explained his own experiments in an open and sincere style. As an early biographer writes, "whatever he knows or thinks he tells: doubts, perplexities, blunders are set down with the most refreshing candour." Priestley also described his cheap and easy-to-assemble experimental apparatus; his colleagues therefore believed that they could easily reproduce his experiments. Faced with inconsistent experimental results, Priestley employed phlogiston theory. This, however, led him to conclude that there were only three types of "air": "fixed", "alkaline", and "acid". Priestley dismissed the of his day. Instead, he focused on gases and "changes in their sensible properties", as had natural philosophers before him. He isolated <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> (CO), but apparently did not realise that it was a separate "air".

In August 1774 he isolated an "air" that appeared to be completely new, but he did not have an opportunity to pursue the matter because he was about to tour Europe with Shelburne. While in Paris, however, Priestley managed to replicate the experiment for others, including French chemist <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a>. After returning to Britain in January 1775, he continued his experiments and discovered "vitriolic acid air" (<a href="sulphur%20dioxide">sulphur dioxide</a>, SO).

In March he wrote to several people regarding the new "air" that he had discovered in August. One of these letters was read aloud to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>, and a paper outlining the discovery, titled "An Account of further Discoveries in Air", was published in the Society's journal "<a href="Philosophical%20Transactions">Philosophical Transactions</a>". Priestley called the new substance "dephlogisticated air", which he made in the famous experiment by <a href="burning%20glass">focusing the sun’s rays</a> on a sample of <a href="mercuric%20oxide">mercuric oxide</a>. He first tested it on mice, who surprised him by surviving quite a while entrapped with the air, and then on himself, writing that it was "five or six times better than common air for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and, I believe, every other use of common atmospherical air". He had discovered <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> gas (O).

Priestley assembled his oxygen paper and several others into a second volume of "Experiments and Observations on Air", published in 1776. He did not emphasise his discovery of "dephlogisticated air" (leaving it to Part III of the volume) but instead argued in the preface how important such discoveries were to rational religion. His paper narrated the discovery chronologically, relating the long delays between experiments and his initial puzzlements; thus, it is difficult to determine when exactly Priestley "discovered" oxygen. Such dating is significant as both Lavoisier and Swedish pharmacist <a href="Carl%20Wilhelm%20Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a> have strong claims to the discovery of oxygen as well, Scheele having been the first to isolate the gas (although he published after Priestley) and Lavoisier having been the first to describe it as purified "air itself entire without alteration" (that is, the first to explain oxygen without phlogiston theory).

In his paper "Observations on Respiration and the Use of the Blood", Priestley was the first to suggest a connection between blood and air, although he did so using <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a>. In typical Priestley fashion, he prefaced the paper with a history of the study of respiration. A year later, clearly influenced by Priestley, Lavoisier was also discussing respiration at the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Académie des sciences</a>. Lavoisier's work began the long train of discovery that produced papers on oxygen respiration and culminated in the overthrow of phlogiston theory and the establishment of modern chemistry.

Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, the precise reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's outspokenness had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield argues that the most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, she did not like the Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> New Meeting's offer to be their minister.

Both Priestley and Shelburne's families upheld their Unitarian faith for generations.
In December 2013, it was reported that <a href="Sir%20Christopher%20Bullock">Sir Christopher Bullock</a> – a direct descendant of Shelburne's brother, <a href="Thomas%20Fitzmaurice%20%28MP%29">Thomas Fitzmaurice (MP)</a> – had married his wife, <a href="Lupton%20family">Lady Bullock</a>, née Barbara May Lupton, at London's Unitarian <a href="Essex%20Street%20Chapel">Essex Church</a> in 1917. Barbara Lupton was the second cousin of <a href="Family%20of%20Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Olive Middleton</a>, née Lupton, the great grandmother of <a href="Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge</a>. In 1914, Olive and Noel Middleton had married at Leeds' <a href="Mill%20Hill%20Chapel">Mill Hill Chapel</a>, which Priestly, as its minister, had once guided towards Unitarianism.

In 1780 the Priestleys moved to <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and spent a happy decade surrounded by old friends, until they were forced to flee in 1791 by religiously motivated mob violence in what became known as the <a href="Priestley%20Riots">Priestley Riots</a>. Priestley accepted the ministerial position at New Meeting on the condition that he be required to preach and teach only on Sundays, so that he would have time for his writing and scientific experiments. As in Leeds, Priestley established classes for the youth of his parish and by 1781, he was teaching 150 students. Because Priestley's New Meeting salary was only 100 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a>, friends and patrons donated money and goods to help continue his investigations. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1782.

Many of the friends that Priestley made in Birmingham were members of the <a href="Lunar%20Society">Lunar Society</a>, a group of manufacturers, inventors, and natural philosophers who assembled monthly to discuss their work. The core of the group included men such as the manufacturer <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Matthew Boulton</a>, the chemist and geologist <a href="James%20Keir">James Keir</a>, the inventor and engineer <a href="James%20Watt">James Watt</a>, and the botanist, chemist, and geologist <a href="William%20Withering">William Withering</a>. Priestley was asked to join this unique society and contributed much to the work of its members. As a result of this stimulating intellectual environment, he published several important scientific papers, including "Experiments relating to Phlogiston, and the seeming Conversion of Water into Air" (1783). The first part attempts to refute Lavoisier's challenges to his work on oxygen; the second part describes how steam is "converted" into air. After several variations of the experiment, with different substances as fuel and several different collecting apparatuses (which produced different results), he concluded that air could travel through more substances than previously surmised, a conclusion "contrary to all the known principles of hydrostatics". This discovery, along with his earlier work on what would later be recognised as gaseous diffusion, would eventually lead <a href="John%20Dalton">John Dalton</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Graham%20%28chemist%29">Thomas Graham</a> to formulate the <a href="kinetic%20theory%20of%20gases">kinetic theory of gases</a>.

In 1777, <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> had written "Mémoire sur la combustion en général", the first of what proved to be a series of attacks on <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a>; it was against these attacks that Priestley responded in 1783. While Priestley accepted parts of Lavoisier's theory, he was unprepared to assent to the major revolutions Lavoisier proposed: the overthrow of phlogiston, a chemistry based conceptually on <a href="Chemical%20element">elements</a> and <a href="Chemical%20compound">compounds</a>, and a new <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry%20nomenclature">chemical nomenclature</a>. Priestley's original experiments on "dephlogisticated air" (oxygen), combustion, and water provided Lavoisier with the data he needed to construct much of his system; yet Priestley never accepted Lavoisier's new theories and continued to defend phlogiston theory for the rest of his life. Lavoisier's system was based largely on the "quantitative" concept that <a href="mass">mass</a> is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions (i.e., the <a href="law%20of%20conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a>). By contrast, Priestley preferred to observe "qualitative" changes in heat, color, and particularly volume. His experiments tested "airs" for "their solubility in water, their power of supporting or extinguishing flame, whether they were respirable, how they behaved with acid and alkaline air, and with nitric oxide and inflammable air, and lastly how they were affected by the <a href="electric%20spark">electric spark</a>."

By 1789, when Lavoisier published his "<a href="Trait%C3%A9%20%C3%89l%C3%A9mentaire%20de%20Chimie">Traité Élémentaire de Chimie</a>" and founded the "<a href="Annales%20de%20Chimie">Annales de Chimie</a>", the new chemistry had come into its own. Priestley published several more scientific papers in Birmingham, the majority attempting to refute Lavoisier. Priestley and other Lunar Society members argued that the new French system was too expensive, too difficult to test, and unnecessarily complex. Priestley in particular rejected its "establishment" aura. In the end, Lavoisier's view prevailed: his new chemistry introduced many of the principles on which <a href="chemistry">modern chemistry</a> is founded.

Priestley's refusal to accept Lavoisier's "new chemistry"—such as the <a href="law%20of%20conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a>—and his determination to adhere to a less satisfactory theory has perplexed many scholars. Schofield explains it thus: "Priestley was never a chemist; in a modern, and even a Lavoisierian, sense, he was never a scientist. He was a natural philosopher, concerned with the economy of nature and obsessed with an idea of unity, in theology and in nature." Historian of science John McEvoy largely agrees, writing that Priestley's view of nature as coextensive with God and thus infinite, which encouraged him to focus on facts over hypotheses and theories, prompted him to reject Lavoisier's system. McEvoy argues that "Priestley's isolated and lonely opposition to the oxygen theory was a measure of his passionate concern for the principles of intellectual freedom, epistemic equality and critical inquiry." Priestley himself claimed in the last volume of "Experiments and Observations" that his most valuable works were his theological ones because they were "superior [in] dignity and importance".

Although Priestley was busy defending phlogiston theory from the "new chemists", most of what he published in Birmingham was theological. In 1782 he published the fourth volume of his "Institutes", "<a href="An%20History%20of%20the%20Corruptions%20of%20Christianity">An History of the Corruptions of Christianity</a>", describing how he thought the teachings of the early Christian church had been "corrupted" or distorted. Schofield describes the work as "derivative, disorganized, wordy, and repetitive, detailed, exhaustive, and devastatingly argued". The text addresses issues ranging from the divinity of Christ to the proper form for the Lord's Supper. Priestley followed up in 1786 with the provocatively titled book, "An History of Early Opinions concerning Jesus Christ, compiled from Original Writers, proving that the Christian Church was at first Unitarian". <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> would later write of the profound effect that these two books had on him: "I have read his Corruptions of Christianity, and Early Opinions of Jesus, over and over again; and I rest on them ... as the basis of my own faith. These writings have never been answered." Although a few readers such as Jefferson and other Rational Dissenters approved of the work, it was harshly reviewed because of its extreme theological positions, particularly its rejection of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>.

In 1785, while Priestley was engaged in a pamphlet war over "Corruptions", he also published "The Importance and Extent of Free Enquiry", claiming that the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a> had not really reformed the church. In words that would boil over into a national debate, he challenged his readers to enact change:

Let us not, therefore, be discouraged, though, for the present, we should see no great number of churches professedly unitarian ... We are, as it were, laying gunpowder, grain by grain, under the old building of error and superstition, which a single spark may hereafter inflame, so as to produce an instantaneous explosion; in consequence of which that edifice, the erection of which has been the work of ages, may be overturned in a moment, and so effectually as that the same foundation can never be built upon again ...

Although discouraged by friends from using such inflammatory language, Priestley refused to back down from his opinions in print and he included it, forever branding himself as "Gunpowder Joe". After the publication of this seeming call for revolution in the midst of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, pamphleteers stepped up their attacks on Priestley and he and his church were even threatened with legal action.
In 1787, 1789, and 1790, Dissenters again tried to repeal the <a href="Test%20Act">Test</a> and <a href="Corporation%20Act%201661">Corporation Acts</a>. Although initially it looked as if they might succeed, by 1790, with the fears of revolution looming in Parliament, few were swayed by appeals to equal rights. Political cartoons, one of the most effective and popular media of the time, skewered the Dissenters and Priestley. In Parliament, <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> argued against the repeal, a betrayal that angered Priestley and his friends, who had expected the two men's support. Priestley wrote a series of "Letters to William Pitt" and "Letters to Burke" in an attempt to persuade them otherwise, but these publications only further inflamed the populace against him.

Dissenters such as Priestley who supported the French Revolution came under increasing suspicion as scepticism regarding the revolution grew. In its propaganda against "radicals", Pitt's administration used the "gunpowder" statement to argue that Priestley and other Dissenters wanted to overthrow the government. Burke, in his famous "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain "considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump". Burke also associated <a href="republicanism">republican</a> principles with alchemy and insubstantial air, mocking the scientific work done by both Priestley and French chemists. He made much in his later writings of the connections between "Gunpowder Joe", science, and Lavoisier—who was improving gunpowder for the French in their <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">war against Britain</a>. Paradoxically, a secular statesman, Burke, argued against science and maintained that religion should be the basis of civil society, whereas a Dissenting minister, Priestley, argued that religion could not provide the basis for civil society and should be restricted to one's private life.

The animus that had been building against Dissenters and supporters of the American and French Revolutions exploded in July 1791. Priestley and several other Dissenters had arranged to have a celebratory dinner on the anniversary of the <a href="storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">storming of the Bastille</a>, a provocative action in a country where many disapproved of the French Revolution and feared that it might spread to Britain. Amid fears of violence, Priestley was convinced by his friends not to attend. Rioters gathered outside the hotel during the banquet and attacked the attendees as they left. The rioters moved on to the New Meeting and Old Meeting churches—and burned both to the ground. Priestley and his wife fled from their home; although their son <a href="William%20Priestley%20%28Louisiana%20planter%29">William</a> and others stayed behind to protect their property, the mob overcame them and torched Priestley's house "Fairhill" at <a href="Sparkbrook">Sparkbrook</a>, destroying his valuable laboratory and all of the family's belongings. Twenty-six other Dissenters’ homes and three more churches were burned in the three-day riot. Priestley spent several days hiding with friends until he was able to travel safely to London. The carefully executed attacks of the "mob" and the farcical trials of only a handful of the "leaders" convinced many at the time—and modern historians later—that the attacks were planned and condoned by local Birmingham <a href="Magistrate%23United%20Kingdom">magistrates</a>. When <a href="George%20III">George III</a> was eventually forced to send troops to the area, he said: "I cannot but feel better pleased that Priestley is the sufferer for the doctrines he and his party have instilled, and that the people see them in their true light."

Unable to return to Birmingham, the Priestleys eventually settled in <a href="Lower%20Clapton">Lower Clapton</a>, a district in <a href="Hackney%20%28parish%29">Hackney</a>, <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a> where he gave a series of lectures on history and natural philosophy at the <a href="Dissenting%20academies">Dissenting academy</a>, the <a href="New%20College%20at%20Hackney">New College at Hackney</a>. Friends helped the couple rebuild their lives, contributing money, books, and laboratory equipment. Priestley tried to obtain restitution from the government for the destruction of his Birmingham property, but he was never fully reimbursed. He also published "An Appeal to the Public on the Subject of the Riots in Birmingham" (1791), which indicted the people of Birmingham for allowing the riots to occur and for "violating the principles of English government".

The couple's friends urged them to leave Britain and emigrate to either France or the new United States, even though Priestley had received an appointment to preach for the <a href="Gravel%20Pit%20Meeting">Gravel Pit Meeting</a> congregation. Priestley was minister between 1793 and 1794 and the sermons he preached there, particularly the two <a href="Fasting">Fast</a> Sermons, reflect his growing <a href="millennialism">millenarianism</a>, his belief that the end of the world was fast approaching. After comparing Biblical prophecies to recent history, Priestley concluded that the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> was a harbinger of the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming of Christ</a>. Priestley's works had always had a millennial cast, but after the beginning of the French Revolution, this strain increased. He wrote to a younger friend that while he himself would not see the Second Coming, his friend "may probably live to see it ... It cannot, I think be more than twenty years [away]."

Daily life became more difficult for the family: Priestley was burned in effigy along with <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>; vicious political cartoons continued to be published about him; letters were sent to him from across the country, comparing him to the devil and <a href="Guy%20Fawkes">Guy Fawkes</a>; tradespeople feared the family's business; and Priestley's Royal Academy friends distanced themselves. As the penalties became harsher for those who spoke out against the government, Priestley examined options for removing himself and his family from England.

Joseph Priestley's son William was presented to the French Assembly and granted letters of naturalization on 8 June 1792. Priestley learned about it from the "Morning Chronicle". A decree of 26 August 1792 by the French National Assembly conferred French citizenship on Joseph Priestley and others who had "served the cause of liberty" by their writings. Priestley accepted French citizenship, considering it "the greatest of honours". In the <a href="French%20National%20Convention%20election%2C%201792">French National Convention election</a> on 5 September 1792, Joseph Priestley was elected to the French <a href="National%20Convention">National Convention</a> by at least two departments, (<a href="Orne">Orne</a> and <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne-et-Loire">Rhône-et-Loire</a>). However, he declined the honour, on the grounds that he was not fluent in French.

As relations between England and France worsened, however, a removal to France became impracticable. Following the declaration of war of February 1793, and the Aliens Bill of March 1793, which forbade correspondence or travel between England and France, William Priestley left France for America. Joseph Priestley's sons Harry and Joseph chose to leave England for America in August 1793. Finally Priestley himself followed with his wife, boarding the "Sansom" at Gravesend on 7 April 1794. Five weeks after Priestley left, <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt's</a> administration began arresting radicals for <a href="seditious%20libel">seditious libel</a>, resulting in the famous <a href="1794%20Treason%20Trials">1794 Treason Trials</a>.

The Priestleys arrived in New York City on 4 June 1794, where they were <a href="wikt%3Af%C3%AAte">fêted</a> by various political factions vying for Priestley's endorsement. Priestley declined their entreaties, hoping to avoid political discord in his new country. Before travelling to a new home in the backwoods of <a href="Northumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland County, Pennsylvania</a>, at Point township (now the <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Borough of Northumberland</a>), Dr and Mrs Priestley lodged in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, where Priestley gave a series of sermons which led to the founding of the <a href="First%20Unitarian%20Church%20of%20Philadelphia">First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia</a>. Priestley turned down an opportunity to teach chemistry at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>.

Priestley's son Joseph Priestley Jr. was a leading member of a consortium that had purchased 300,000 acres of virgin woodland between the forks of <a href="Loyalsock%20Creek">Loyalsock Creek</a>, which they intended to lease or sell in 400-acre plots, with payment deferred to seven annual instalments, with interest. His brothers, <a href="William%20Priestley%20%28Louisiana%20planter%29">William</a> and Henry, bought a 284-acre plot of woodland which they attempted to transform into a farm, later called "Fairhill", felling and uprooting trees, and making <a href="Liming%20%28soil%29">lime</a> to sweeten the soil by building their own lime kilns. Henry Priestley died 11 December 1795, possibly of <a href="malaria">malaria</a> which he may have contracted after landing at New York. Mary Priestley's health, already poor, deteriorated further; although <a href="William%20Priestley%20%28Louisiana%20planter%29">William's</a> wife, Margaret Foulke-Priestley, moved in with the couple to nurse Mary twenty-four hours a day, Mary Priestley died 17 September 1796. Dr Priestley now moved in with his elder son, Joseph Jr., and his wife Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley. <a href="Thomas%20Cooper%20%28U.S.%20politician%29">Thomas Cooper</a>, whose son, Thomas Jr., was living with the Priestleys, was a frequent visitor.

Since his arrival in America, Priestley had continued to defend his <a href="Unitarianism">Christian Unitarian</a> beliefs; now, falling increasingly under the influence of Thomas Cooper and Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, he was unable to avoid becoming embroiled in political controversy. In 1798, when, in response to the <a href="Charles%20Cotesworth%20Pinckney">Pinckney affair</a>, a belligerent <a href="John%20Adams">President Adams</a> sought to enlarge the navy and mobilise the militia into what Priestley and Cooper saw as a 'standing army', Priestley published an anonymous newspaper article: "Maxims of political arithmetic", which attacked Adams, defended free trade, and advocated a form of Jeffersonian isolationism. In the same year, a small package, addressed vaguely: "Dr Priestley in America," was seized by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> on board a neutral Danish boat. It was found to contain three letters, one of which was signed by the radical printer <a href="John%20Hurford%20Stone">John Hurford Stone</a>. These intercepted letters were published in London, and copied in numerous papers in America. One of the letters was addressed to "MBP", with a note: "I inclose a note for our friend MBP—but, as ignorant of the name he bears at present among you, I must beg you to seal and address it." This gave the intercepted letters a tinge of intrigue. Fearful lest they be taken as evidence of him being a 'spy in the interest of France', Priestley sent a clumsy letter to numerous newspaper editors, in which he naively named "MBP" (Member of the British Parliament) as <a href="Benjamin%20Vaughan">Mr. Benjamin Vaughan</a>, who "like me, thought it necessary to leave England, and for some time is said to have assumed a feigned name." <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a>, in his "Porcupine's Gazette", 20 August 1798, added that Priestley "has told us who Mr MBP is, and has confirmed me in the opinion of their both being spies in the interest of France."
Joseph Priestley Jr. left on a visit to England at Christmas 1798, not returning until August 1800. In his absence, his wife Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley and Thomas Cooper became increasing close, collaborating in numerous political essays. Priestley allowed himself to fall too heavily under Elizabeth and Cooper's influences, even helping hawk a seditious handbill Cooper had printed, around <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Point township</a>, and across the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna</a> at <a href="Sunbury%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sunbury</a>. In September 1799, <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a> printed extracts from this handbill, asserting that: "Dr Priestley has taken great pains to circulate this address, has travelled through the country for the purpose, and is in fact the patron of it." He challenged Priestley to "clear himself of the accusation" or face prosecution." Barely a month later, in November and December 1799, Priestley stepped forward in his own defence, with his "Letters to the inhabitants of Northumberland".

Priestley’s son, <a href="William%20Priestley%20%28Louisiana%20planter%29">William</a>, now living in Philadelphia, was increasingly embarrassed by his father's actions. He confronted his father, expressing <a href="John%20Vaughan%20%28wine%20merchant%29">John</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Vaughan">Benjamin Vaughan</a>’s unease, his own wife's concerns about Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley's dietary care, and his own concerns at the closeness of Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley and Thomas Cooper's relationship, and their adverse influence on Dr Priestley; but this only led to a further estrangement between William and his sister-in-law. When, a while later, Priestley's household suffered a bout of food poisoning, perhaps from <a href="milk%20sickness">milk sickness</a> or a <a href="Pathogenic%20bacteria">bacterial infection</a>, Elizabeth Ryland-Priestley, falsely accused William of having poisoned the family's flour. Although this allegation has attracted the attention of some modern historians, it is believed to be without foundation.

Priestley continued the educational projects that had always been important to him, helping to establish the "Northumberland Academy" and donating his library to the fledgling institution. He exchanged letters regarding the proper structure of a university with <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, who used this advice when founding the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>. Jefferson and Priestley became close, and when he had completed his "General History of the Christian Church", he dedicated it to President Jefferson, writing that "it is now only that I can say I see nothing to fear from the hand of power, the government under which I live being for the first time truly favourable to me."

Priestley tried to continue his scientific investigations in America with the support of the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a>. He was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no longer on the forefront of discovery. Although the majority of his publications focused on defending <a href="phlogiston%20theory">phlogiston theory</a>, he also did some original work on <a href="spontaneous%20generation">spontaneous generation</a> and dreams. Despite Priestley's reduced scientific output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.

By 1801, Priestley had become so ill that he could no longer write or experiment. He died on the morning of 6 February 1804, aged seventy and was buried at Riverview Cemetery in <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland, Pennsylvania</a>.

Priestley's epitaph reads:

By the time he died in 1804, Priestley had been made a member of every major scientific society in the Western world and he had discovered numerous substances. The 19th-century French naturalist <a href="George%20Cuvier">George Cuvier</a>, in his eulogy of Priestley, praised his discoveries while at the same time lamenting his refusal to abandon phlogiston theory, calling him "the father of modern chemistry [who] never acknowledged his daughter". Priestley published more than 150 works on topics ranging from political philosophy to education to theology to natural philosophy. He led and inspired British radicals during the 1790s, paved the way for <a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, and helped found <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a>. A wide variety of philosophers, scientists, and poets became <a href="Association%20of%20Ideas">associationists</a> as a result of his <a href="redaction">redaction</a> of David Hartley's "<a href="Observations%20on%20Man">Observations on Man</a>", including <a href="Erasmus%20Darwin">Erasmus Darwin</a>, Coleridge, <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Bain">Alexander Bain</a>, and <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>. <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> praised Priestley in his "<a href="Critique%20of%20Pure%20Reason">Critique of Pure Reason</a>" (1781), writing that he "knew how to combine his paradoxical teaching with the interests of religion". Indeed, it was Priestley's aim to "put the most 'advanced' Enlightenment ideas into the service of a rationalized though heterodox Christianity, under the guidance of the basic principles of scientific method".

Considering the extent of Priestley's influence, relatively little scholarship has been devoted to him. In the early 20th century, Priestley was most often described as a conservative and dogmatic scientist who was nevertheless a political and religious reformer. In a historiographic review essay, historian of science <a href="Simon%20Schaffer">Simon Schaffer</a> describes the two dominant portraits of Priestley: the first depicts him as "a playful innocent" who stumbled across his discoveries; the second portrays him as innocent as well as "warped" for not understanding their implications better. Assessing Priestley's works as a whole has been difficult for scholars because of his wide-ranging interests. His scientific discoveries have usually been divorced from his theological and metaphysical publications to make an analysis of his life and writings easier, but this approach has been challenged recently by scholars such as John McEvoy and Robert Schofield. Although early Priestley scholarship claimed that his theological and metaphysical works were "distractions" and "obstacles" to his scientific work, scholarship published in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s maintained that Priestley's works constituted a unified theory. However, as Schaffer explains, no convincing synthesis of his work has yet been expounded. More recently, in 2001, historian of science Dan Eshet has argued that efforts to create a "synoptic view" have resulted only in a rationalisation of the contradictions in Priestley's thought, because they have been "organized around philosophical categories" and have "separate[d] the producers of scientific ideas from any social conflict".

Priestley has been remembered by the towns in which he served as a reforming educator and minister and by the scientific organisations he influenced. Two educational institutions have been named in his honour—<a href="Priestley%20College">Priestley College</a> in <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Priestley%20College">Joseph Priestley College</a> in <a href="City%20of%20Leeds">Leeds</a> (now part of <a href="Leeds%20City%20College">Leeds City College</a>)—and an asteroid, <a href="5577%20Priestley">5577 Priestley</a>, discovered in 1986 by <a href="Duncan%20Waldron">Duncan Waldron</a>. In <a href="Birstall%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Birstall</a>, the <a href="Leeds%20City%20Square">Leeds City Square</a>, and in <a href="Chamberlain%20Square">Birmingham</a>, he is memorialised through statues, and plaques commemorating him have been posted in Birmingham, <a href="Calne">Calne</a> and Warrington. Also, since 1952 <a href="Dickinson%20College">Dickinson College</a>, Pennsylvania, has presented the Priestley Award to a scientist who makes "discoveries which contribute to the welfare of mankind". The main undergraduate chemistry laboratories at the <a href="University%20of%20Leeds">University of Leeds</a> were refurbished as part of a £4m refurbishment plan in 2006 and renamed as the Priestley Laboratories in his honour as a prominent chemist from Leeds. In 2016 the <a href="University%20of%20Huddersfield">University of Huddersfield</a> renamed the building housing its Applied Sciences department as the Joseph Priestley Building, as part of an exercise to rename all campus buildings after prominent local figures.

Additional recognition for Priestley's work is marked by a <a href="National%20Historic%20Chemical%20Landmarks">National Historic Chemical Landmark</a> designation for his discovery of oxygen, made on 1 August 1994, at the Priestley House in Northumberland, Penn., by the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a>. Similar recognition was made on 7 August 2000, at <a href="Bowood%20House">Bowood House</a> in Wiltshire, England. The ACS also awards their highest honour, the <a href="Priestley%20Medal">Priestley Medal</a>, in his name.




The most exhaustive biography of Priestley is Robert Schofield's recent two-volume work; several one-volume treatments exist, all somewhat older: Gibbs, Holt and Thorpe. Graham and Smith focus on Priestley's life in America and Uglow and Jackson both discuss Priestley's life in the context of other developments in science.

Hubble Space Telescope

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a <a href="space%20telescope">space telescope</a> that was launched into <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a> in 1990 and remains in operation. Although not the <a href="Orbiting%20Astronomical%20Observatory%202">first space telescope</a>, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>. The HST is named after the <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> and is one of NASA's <a href="Great%20Observatories%20program">Great Observatories</a>, along with the <a href="Compton%20Gamma%20Ray%20Observatory">Compton Gamma Ray Observatory</a>, the <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> and the <a href="Spitzer%20Space%20Telescope">Spitzer Space Telescope</a>.

With a mirror, Hubble's four main instruments observe in the <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a>, <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible</a>, and <a href="near%20infrared">near infrared</a> regions of the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> allows it to take extremely high-resolution images, with substantially lower <a href="background%20%28astronomy%29">background</a> light than ground-based telescopes. Hubble has recorded some of the most detailed <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible light</a> images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>, such as accurately <a href="Hubble%27s%20law%23Using%20Hubble%20space%20telescope%20data">determining the rate of expansion of the universe</a>.

The HST was built by the United States space agency <a href="NASA">NASA</a>, with contributions from the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a>. The <a href="Space%20Telescope%20Science%20Institute">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> (STScI) selects Hubble's targets and processes the resulting data, while the <a href="Goddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Goddard Space Flight Center</a> controls the spacecraft.

Space telescopes were proposed as early as 1923. Hubble was funded in the 1970s, with a proposed launch in 1983, but the project was beset by technical delays, budget problems, and the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">"Challenger" disaster</a> (1986). When finally launched in 1990, Hubble's main mirror was found to have been ground incorrectly, creating a <a href="spherical%20aberration">spherical aberration</a>, compromising the telescope's capabilities. The optics were corrected to their intended quality by a <a href="STS-61">servicing mission</a> in 1993.

Hubble is the only telescope designed to be serviced in space by <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a>s. After launch by in 1990, five subsequent Space Shuttle missions repaired, upgraded, and replaced systems on the telescope, including all five of the main instruments. The fifth mission was initially canceled on safety grounds following the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster">"Columbia" disaster</a> (2003). However, after spirited public discussion, NASA administrator <a href="Michael%20D.%20Griffin">Mike Griffin</a> approved the <a href="STS-125">fifth servicing mission</a>, completed in 2009. The telescope is operating , and could last until 2030–2040. After numerous delays, its successor, the <a href="James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope">James Webb Space Telescope</a> (JWST), is scheduled to be launched in March 2021.

In 1923, <a href="Hermann%20Oberth">Hermann Oberth</a>—considered a father of modern rocketry, along with <a href="Robert%20H.%20Goddard">Robert H. Goddard</a> and <a href="Konstantin%20Tsiolkovsky">Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</a>—published "" ("The Rocket into Planetary Space"), which mentioned how a telescope could be propelled into Earth orbit by a rocket.

The history of the Hubble Space Telescope can be traced back as far as 1946, to the <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Lyman%20Spitzer">Lyman Spitzer</a>'s paper "Astronomical advantages of an extraterrestrial observatory". In it, he discussed the two main advantages that a space-based observatory would have over ground-based telescopes. First, the <a href="angular%20resolution">angular resolution</a> (the smallest separation at which objects can be clearly distinguished) would be limited only by <a href="Diffraction-limited%20system">diffraction</a>, rather than by the turbulence in the atmosphere, which causes stars to twinkle, known to astronomers as <a href="astronomical%20seeing">seeing</a>. At that time ground-based telescopes were limited to resolutions of 0.5–1.0 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s, compared to a theoretical diffraction-limited resolution of about 0.05 arcsec for a telescope with a <a href="mirror">mirror</a> in diameter. Second, a space-based telescope could observe <a href="infrared">infrared</a> and <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light, which are strongly absorbed by the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a>.

Spitzer devoted much of his career to pushing for the development of a space telescope. In 1962, a report by the US <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> recommended the development of a <a href="space%20telescope">space telescope</a> as part of the <a href="Human%20spaceflight">space program</a>, and in 1965 Spitzer was appointed as head of a committee given the task of defining scientific objectives for a large space telescope.

Space-based astronomy had begun on a very small scale following <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, as scientists made use of developments that had taken place in <a href="rocket">rocket</a> technology. The first ultraviolet <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> was obtained in 1946, and the <a href="NASA">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA) launched the <a href="Orbiting%20Solar%20Observatory">Orbiting Solar Observatory</a> (OSO) to obtain UV, X-ray, and gamma-ray spectra in 1962. An <a href="Ariel%201">orbiting solar telescope</a> was launched in 1962 by the United Kingdom as part of the <a href="Ariel%20programme">Ariel space program</a>, and in 1966 NASA launched the first <a href="Orbiting%20Astronomical%20Observatory">Orbiting Astronomical Observatory</a> (OAO) mission. OAO-1's battery failed after three days, terminating the mission. It was followed by <a href="Orbiting%20Astronomical%20Observatory%202">OAO-2</a>, which carried out ultraviolet observations of <a href="star">star</a>s and <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a> from its launch in 1968 until 1972, well beyond its original planned lifetime of one year.

The OSO and OAO missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy, and in 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based <a href="reflecting%20telescope">reflecting telescope</a> with a mirror in diameter, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. These plans emphasized the need for manned maintenance missions to the telescope to ensure such a costly program had a lengthy working life, and the concurrent development of plans for the reusable <a href="Space%20Shuttle">Space Shuttle</a> indicated that the technology to allow this was soon to become available.

The continuing success of the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, and the other to determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> questioned many aspects of the proposed budget for the telescope and forced cuts in the budget for the planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, <a href="public%20spending">public spending</a> cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.

In response a nationwide lobbying effort was coordinated among astronomers. Many astronomers met <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">congressmen</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate">senators</a> in person, and large scale letter-writing campaigns were organized. The National Academy of Sciences published a report emphasizing the need for a space telescope, and eventually the Senate agreed to half of the budget that had originally been approved by Congress.

The funding issues led to something of a reduction in the scale of the project, with the proposed mirror diameter reduced from 3 m to 2.4 m, both to cut costs and to allow a more compact and effective configuration for the telescope hardware. A proposed precursor space telescope to test the systems to be used on the main satellite was dropped, and budgetary concerns also prompted collaboration with the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a>. ESA agreed to provide funding and supply one of the first generation instruments for the telescope, as well as the <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a>s that would power it, and staff to work on the telescope in the United States, in return for European astronomers being guaranteed at least 15% of the observing time on the telescope. Congress eventually approved funding of for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983. In 1983 the telescope was named after <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a>, who made one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century when he discovered that the <a href="universe">universe</a> is <a href="expanding%20universe">expanding</a>.

Once the Space Telescope project had been given the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. <a href="Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Marshall Space Flight Center</a> (MSFC) was given responsibility for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while <a href="Goddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Goddard Space Flight Center</a> was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company <a href="PerkinElmer">Perkin-Elmer</a> to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope. <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a> was commissioned to construct and integrate the spacecraft in which the telescope would be housed.

Optically, the HST is a <a href="Cassegrain%20reflector">Cassegrain reflector</a> of <a href="Ritchey%E2%80%93Chr%C3%A9tien%20telescope">Ritchey–Chrétien design</a>, as are most large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, is known for good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes that are hard to fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an <a href="accuracy">accuracy</a> of about a tenth of the <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a>, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be <a href="diffraction-limited%20system">diffraction limited</a> to take full advantage of the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of , or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15 °C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.

Perkin-Elmer intended to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated <a href="Computer-aided%20manufacturing">computer-controlled polishing machines</a> to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to <a href="Kodak">Kodak</a> to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and <a href="Itek">Itek</a> also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused <a href="%23Flawed%20mirror">such problems</a>.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a>. An Itek mirror built as part of the effort is now used in the 2.4 m telescope at the <a href="Magdalena%20Ridge%20Observatory">Magdalena Ridge Observatory</a>.

Construction of the Perkin-Elmer mirror began in 1979, starting with a blank manufactured by <a href="Corning%20Incorporated">Corning</a> from their ultra-low expansion <a href="glass">glass</a>. To keep the mirror's weight to a minimum it consisted of top and bottom plates, each thick, sandwiching a <a href="honeycomb">honeycomb</a> lattice. Perkin-Elmer simulated <a href="microgravity">microgravity</a> by supporting the mirror from the back with 130 rods that exerted varying amounts of force. This ensured that the mirror's final shape would be correct and to specification when finally deployed. Mirror polishing continued until May 1981. NASA reports at the time questioned Perkin-Elmer's managerial structure, and the polishing began to slip behind schedule and over budget. To save money, NASA halted work on the back-up mirror and put the launch date of the telescope back to October 1984. The mirror was completed by the end of 1981; it was washed using of hot, <a href="deionized%20water">deionized water</a> and then received a reflective coating of <a href="aluminium">aluminum</a> and a protective coating of <a href="magnesium%20fluoride">magnesium fluoride</a>.

Doubts continued to be expressed about Perkin-Elmer's competence on a project of this importance, as their budget and timescale for producing the rest of the OTA continued to inflate. In response to a schedule described as "unsettled and changing daily", NASA postponed the launch date of the telescope until April 1985. Perkin-Elmer's schedules continued to slip at a rate of about one month per quarter, and at times delays reached one day for each day of work. NASA was forced to postpone the launch date until March and then September 1986. By this time, the total project budget had risen to .

The spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight into the darkness of Earth's <a href="shadow">shadow</a>, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of <a href="multi-layer%20insulation">multi-layer insulation</a> keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell in which the telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a <a href="carbon%20fiber%20reinforced%20polymer">graphite-epoxy</a> frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.

While construction of the spacecraft in which the telescope and instruments would be housed proceeded somewhat more smoothly than the construction of the OTA, Lockheed still experienced some budget and schedule slippage, and by the summer of 1985, construction of the spacecraft was 30% over budget and three months behind schedule. An MSFC report said that Lockheed tended to rely on NASA directions rather than take their own initiative in the construction.

The two initial, primary computers on the HST were the 1.25 MHz <a href="DF-224">DF-224</a> system, built by Rockwell Autonetics, which contained three redundant CPUs, and two redundant <a href="NSSC-1">NSSC-1</a> (NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer, Model 1) systems, developed by Westinghouse and GSFC using <a href="diode%E2%80%93transistor%20logic">diode–transistor logic</a> (DTL). A co-processor for the DF-224 was added during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which consisted of two redundant strings of an Intel-based 80386 processor with an 80387 math co-processor. The DF-224 and its 386 co-processor were replaced by a 25 MHz Intel-based 80486 processor system during Servicing Mission 3A in 1999.

Additionally, some of the science instruments and components had their own embedded microprocessor-based control systems. The MATs (Multiple Access Transponder) components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, utilize Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD microprocessors. The Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) also utilized an RCA 1802 microprocessor (or possibly the older 1801 version). The WFPC-1 was replaced by the WFPC-2 during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009.

When launched, the HST carried five scientific instruments: the Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WF/PC), Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), High Speed Photometer (HSP), Faint Object Camera (FOC) and the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS). WF/PC was a high-resolution imaging device primarily intended for optical observations. It was built by NASA's <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, and incorporated a set of 48 <a href="filter%20%28optics%29">filters</a> isolating <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s of particular astrophysical interest. The instrument contained eight <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD) chips divided between two cameras, each using four CCDs. Each CCD has a resolution of 0.64 megapixels. The "wide field camera" (WFC) covered a large angular field at the expense of resolution, while the "planetary camera" (PC) took images at a longer effective <a href="focal%20length">focal length</a> than the WF chips, giving it a greater magnification.

The GHRS was a <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a> designed to operate in the ultraviolet. It was built by the Goddard Space Flight Center and could achieve a <a href="spectral%20resolution">spectral resolution</a> of 90,000. Also optimized for ultraviolet observations were the FOC and FOS, which were capable of the highest spatial resolution of any instruments on Hubble. Rather than CCDs these three instruments used <a href="photon">photon</a>-counting <a href="digicon">digicon</a>s as their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Diego">University of California, San Diego</a>, and <a href="Martin%20Marietta%20Corporation">Martin Marietta Corporation</a> built the FOS.

The final instrument was the HSP, designed and built at the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>. It was optimized for visible and ultraviolet light observations of <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>s and other astronomical objects varying in brightness. It could take up to 100,000 measurements per second with a <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometric</a> accuracy of about 2% or better.

HST's guidance system can also be used as a scientific instrument. Its three <a href="Fine%20Guidance%20Sensor">Fine Guidance Sensor</a>s (FGS) are primarily used to keep the telescope accurately pointed during an observation, but can also be used to carry out extremely accurate <a href="astrometry">astrometry</a>; measurements accurate to within 0.0003 arcseconds have been achieved.

The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) is responsible for the scientific operation of the telescope and the delivery of data products to astronomers. STScI is operated by the <a href="Association%20of%20Universities%20for%20Research%20in%20Astronomy">Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy</a> (AURA) and is physically located in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> on the Homewood campus of <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>, one of the 39 US universities and seven international affiliates that make up the AURA consortium. STScI was established in 1981 after something of a power struggle between NASA and the scientific community at large. NASA had wanted to keep this function in-house, but scientists wanted it to be based in an <a href="academia">academic</a> establishment. The <a href="Space%20Telescope%20European%20Coordinating%20Facility">Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility</a> (ST-ECF), established at <a href="Garching%20bei%20M%C3%BCnchen">Garching bei München</a> near <a href="Munich">Munich</a> in 1984, provided similar support for European astronomers until 2011, when these activities were moved to the European Space Astronomy Centre.

One rather complex task that falls to STScI is scheduling observations for the telescope. Hubble is in a low-Earth orbit to enable servicing missions, but this means that most astronomical targets are <a href="occultation">occulted</a> by the Earth for slightly less than half of each orbit. Observations cannot take place when the telescope passes through the <a href="South%20Atlantic%20Anomaly">South Atlantic Anomaly</a> due to elevated <a href="radiation">radiation</a> levels, and there are also sizable exclusion zones around the Sun (precluding observations of <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>), Moon and Earth. The solar avoidance angle is about 50°, to keep sunlight from illuminating any part of the OTA. Earth and Moon avoidance keeps bright light out of the FGSs, and keeps scattered light from entering the instruments. If the FGSs are turned off, however, the Moon and Earth can be observed. Earth observations were used very early in the program to generate flat-fields for the WFPC1 instrument. There is a so-called continuous viewing zone (CVZ), at roughly 90° to the plane of Hubble's orbit, in which targets are not <a href="occultation">occulted</a> for long periods. Due to the <a href="precession">precession</a> of the orbit, the location of the CVZ moves slowly over a period of eight weeks. Because the <a href="wikt%3ALimb">limb</a> of the Earth is always within about 30° of regions within the CVZ, the brightness of scattered <a href="earthshine">earthshine</a> may be elevated for long periods during CVZ observations.

Hubble orbits in <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a> at an altitude of approximately and an inclination of 28.5°. The position along its orbit changes over time in a way that is not accurately predictable. The density of the upper atmosphere varies according to many factors, and this means that Hubble's predicted position for six weeks' time could be in error by up to . Observation schedules are typically finalized only a few days in advance, as a longer lead time would mean there was a chance that the target would be unobservable by the time it was due to be observed.

Engineering support for HST is provided by NASA and contractor personnel at the <a href="Goddard%20Space%20Flight%20Center">Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in <a href="Greenbelt%2C%20Maryland">Greenbelt, Maryland</a>, south of the STScI. Hubble's operation is monitored 24 hours per day by four teams of flight controllers who make up Hubble's Flight Operations Team.

By early 1986, the planned launch date of October that year looked feasible, but the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">"Challenger" accident</a> brought the U.S. space program to a halt, grounding the Space Shuttle fleet and forcing the launch of Hubble to be postponed for several years. The telescope had to be kept in a clean room, powered up and purged with nitrogen, until a launch could be rescheduled. This costly situation (about per month) pushed the overall costs of the project even higher. This delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests, swap out a possibly failure-prone battery, and make other improvements. Furthermore, the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986, and was barely ready by the 1990 launch.

Eventually, following the resumption of shuttle flights in 1988, the launch of the telescope was scheduled for 1990. On April 24, 1990, successfully launched the telescope into its planned orbit during the <a href="STS-31">STS-31</a> mission.

From its original total cost estimate of about , the telescope cost about by the time of its launch. Hubble's cumulative costs were estimated to be about in 2010, twenty years after launch.

Hubble accommodates five science instruments at a given time, plus the <a href="Fine%20Guidance%20Sensor">Fine Guidance Sensor</a>s, which are mainly used for aiming the telescope but are occasionally used for science (<a href="astrometry">astrometry</a>). Early instruments were replaced with more advanced ones during the Shuttle servicing missions. COSTAR was strictly a corrective optics device rather than a true science instrument, but occupied one of the five instrument bays.

Since the final servicing mission in 2009, the four active instruments have been ACS, COS, STIS and WFC3. NICMOS is kept in hibernation, but may be revived if WFC3 were to fail in the future.

Of the former instruments, three (COSTAR, FOS and WFPC2) are displayed in the Smithsonian <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a>. The FOC is in the Dornier museum, Germany. The HSP is in the Space Place at the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>. The first WFPC was dismantled, and some components were then re-used in WFC3. The current location of GHRS is unclear.

Within weeks of the launch of the telescope, the returned images indicated a serious problem with the optical system. Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of <a href="point%20source">point source</a>s spread out over a radius of more than one arcsecond, instead of having a <a href="point%20spread%20function">point spread function</a> (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1 arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.

Analysis of the flawed images showed that the cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been polished to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about , at the perimeter it was too flat by about . This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe <a href="spherical%20aberration">spherical aberration</a>, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror <a href="focus%20%28optics%29">focuses</a> on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.

The effect of the mirror flaw on scientific observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out-of-focus halo severely reduced the usefulness of the telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a <a href="white%20elephant">white elephant</a>. For instance, in the 1991 comedy "", Hubble was pictured with "<a href="RMS%20Lusitania">Lusitania</a>", the "<a href="LZ%20129%20Hindenburg">Hindenburg</a>", and the <a href="Edsel">Edsel</a>. Nonetheless, during the first three years of the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated <a href="image%20processing">image processing</a> techniques such as <a href="deconvolution">deconvolution</a>.

A commission headed by <a href="Lew%20Allen">Lew Allen</a>, director of the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, was established to determine how the error could have arisen. The Allen Commission found that a reflective <a href="null%20corrector">null corrector</a>, a testing device used to achieve a properly shaped non-spherical mirror, had been incorrectly assembled—one lens was out of position by . During the initial grinding and polishing of the mirror, <a href="Perkin-Elmer">Perkin-Elmer</a> analyzed its surface with two conventional refractive null correctors. However, for the final manufacturing step (<a href="figuring">figuring</a>), they switched to the custom-built reflective null corrector, designed explicitly to meet very strict tolerances. The incorrect assembly of the device resulted in the mirror being ground very precisely but to the wrong shape. A few final tests, using the conventional null correctors, correctly reported <a href="spherical%20aberration">spherical aberration</a>. But these results were dismissed, thus missing the opportunity to catch the error, because the reflective null corrector was considered more accurate.

The commission blamed the failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics company had been severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.

The design of the telescope had always incorporated servicing missions, and astronomers immediately began to seek potential solutions to the problem that could be applied at the first servicing mission, scheduled for 1993. While Kodak had ground a back-up mirror for Hubble, it would have been impossible to replace the mirror in orbit, and too expensive and time-consuming to bring the telescope back to Earth for a refit. Instead, the fact that the mirror had been ground so precisely to the wrong shape led to the design of new optical components with exactly the same error but in the opposite sense, to be added to the telescope at the servicing mission, effectively acting as "<a href="Glasses">spectacles</a>" to correct the spherical aberration.

The first step was a precise characterization of the error in the main mirror. Working backwards from images of point sources, astronomers determined that the <a href="conic%20constant">conic constant</a> of the mirror as built was , instead of the intended . The same number was also derived by analyzing the null corrector used by Perkin-Elmer to figure the mirror, as well as by analyzing <a href="interferogram">interferogram</a>s obtained during ground testing of the mirror.

Because of the way the HST's instruments were designed, two different sets of correctors were required. The design of the <a href="Wide%20Field%20and%20Planetary%20Camera%202">Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2</a>, already planned to replace the existing WF/PC, included relay mirrors to direct light onto the four separate <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD) chips making up its two cameras. An inverse error built into their surfaces could completely cancel the aberration of the primary. However, the other instruments lacked any intermediate surfaces that could be figured in this way, and so required an external correction device.

The <a href="Corrective%20Optics%20Space%20Telescope%20Axial%20Replacement">Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement</a> (COSTAR) system was designed to correct the spherical aberration for light focused at the FOC, FOS, and GHRS. It consists of two mirrors in the light path with one ground to correct the aberration. To fit the COSTAR system onto the telescope, one of the other instruments had to be removed, and astronomers selected the <a href="High%20Speed%20Photometer">High Speed Photometer</a> to be sacrificed. By 2002, all of the original instruments requiring COSTAR had been replaced by instruments with their own corrective optics. COSTAR was removed and returned to Earth in 2009 where it is exhibited at the National Air and Space Museum. The area previously used by COSTAR is now occupied by the <a href="Cosmic%20Origins%20Spectrograph">Cosmic Origins Spectrograph</a>.

Hubble was designed to accommodate regular servicing and equipment upgrades while in orbit. Instruments and limited life items were designed as <a href="orbital%20replacement%20unit%20%28HST%29">orbital replacement unit</a>s. Five servicing missions (SM 1, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4) were flown by NASA <a href="space%20shuttle">space shuttle</a>s, the first in December 1993 and the last in May 2009. Servicing missions were delicate operations that began with maneuvering to intercept the telescope in orbit and carefully retrieving it with the shuttle's <a href="Canadarm">mechanical arm</a>. The necessary work was then carried out in multiple tethered <a href="spacewalk">spacewalk</a>s over a period of four to five days. After a visual inspection of the telescope, astronauts conducted repairs, replaced failed or degraded components, upgraded equipment, and installed new instruments. Once work was completed, the telescope was redeployed, typically after boosting to a higher orbit to address the <a href="orbital%20decay">orbital decay</a> caused by atmospheric <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>.

After the problems with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics. The seven astronauts for the mission were trained to use about a hundred specialized tools. SM1 flew aboard <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Endeavour">"Endeavour"</a> in December 1993, and involved installation of several instruments and other equipment over ten days.

Most importantly, the <a href="High%20Speed%20Photometer">High Speed Photometer</a> was replaced with the <a href="Corrective%20Optics%20Space%20Telescope%20Axial%20Replacement">COSTAR</a> corrective optics package, and WFPC was replaced with the <a href="Wide%20Field%20and%20Planetary%20Camera%202">Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2</a> (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The <a href="Photovoltaic%20module">solar arrays</a> and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a>s in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with added <a href="coprocessor">coprocessor</a>s, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.

On January 13, 1994, NASA declared the mission a complete success and showed the first sharper images. The mission was one of the most complex performed up until that date, involving five long <a href="extra-vehicular%20activity">extra-vehicular activity</a> periods. Its success was a boon for NASA, as well as for the astronomers who now had a more capable space telescope.

Servicing Mission 2, flown by "Discovery" in February 1997, replaced the GHRS and the FOS with the <a href="Space%20Telescope%20Imaging%20Spectrograph">Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph</a> (STIS) and the <a href="Near%20Infrared%20Camera%20and%20Multi-Object%20Spectrometer">Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer</a> (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with a new Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a <a href="heat%20sink">heat sink</a> of solid <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> to reduce the <a href="thermal%20noise">thermal noise</a> from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected <a href="thermal%20expansion">thermal expansion</a> resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.

Servicing Mission 3A, flown by "Discovery", took place in December 1999, and was a split-off from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed a few weeks before the mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a <a href="Fine%20Guidance%20Sensor">Fine Guidance Sensor</a> and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the <a href="DF-224">DF-224</a> it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.

Servicing Mission 3B flown by "Columbia" in March 2002 saw the installation of a new instrument, with the FOC (which, except for the <a href="Fine%20Guidance%20Sensor">Fine Guidance Sensor</a>s when used for astrometry, was the last of the original instruments) being replaced by the <a href="Advanced%20Camera%20for%20Surveys">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a> (ACS). This meant that COSTAR was no longer required, since all new instruments had built-in correction for the main mirror aberration. The mission also revived NICMOS by installing a closed-cycle cooler and replaced the solar arrays for the second time, providing 30 percent more power.

Plans called for Hubble to be serviced in February 2005, but the <a href="Columbia%20disaster">"Columbia" disaster</a> in 2003, in which the orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator <a href="Sean%20O%27Keefe">Sean O'Keefe</a> decided that all future shuttle missions had to be able to reach the safe haven of the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the <a href="James%20Webb%20Telescope">James Webb Telescope</a> (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in <a href="low%20Earth%20orbit">low Earth orbit</a>, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.

In January 2004, O'Keefe said he would review his decision to cancel the final servicing mission to HST due to public outcry and requests from Congress for NASA to look for a way to save it. The National Academy of Sciences convened an official panel, which recommended in July 2004 that the HST should be preserved despite the apparent risks. Their report urged "NASA should take no actions that would preclude a space shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope". In August 2004, O'Keefe asked Goddard Space Flight Center to prepare a detailed proposal for a robotic service mission. These plans were later canceled, the robotic mission being described as "not feasible". In late 2004, several Congressional members, led by Senator <a href="Barbara%20Mikulski">Barbara Mikulski</a>, held public hearings and carried on a fight with much public support (including thousands of letters from school children across the country) to get the Bush Administration and NASA to reconsider the decision to drop plans for a Hubble rescue mission.

The nomination in April 2005 of a new NASA Administrator with an engineering rather than accounting background, <a href="Michael%20D.%20Griffin">Michael D. Griffin</a>, changed the situation, as Griffin stated he would consider a manned servicing mission. Soon after his appointment Griffin authorized Goddard to proceed with preparations for a manned Hubble maintenance flight, saying he would make the final decision after the next two shuttle missions. In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by "Atlantis" was scheduled for October 2008. Hubble's main data-handling unit failed in September 2008, halting all reporting of scientific data until its back-up was brought online on October 25, 2008. Since a failure of the backup unit would leave the HST helpless, the service mission was postponed to incorporate a replacement for the primary unit.

Servicing Mission 4, flown by "Atlantis" in May 2009, was the last scheduled shuttle mission for HST. SM4 installed the replacement data-handling unit, repaired the ACS and STIS systems, installed improved <a href="nickel%E2%80%93hydrogen%20battery">nickel hydrogen batteries</a>, and replaced other components. SM4 also installed two new observation instruments—<a href="Wide%20Field%20Camera%203">Wide Field Camera 3</a> (WFC3) and the <a href="Cosmic%20Origins%20Spectrograph">Cosmic Origins Spectrograph</a> (COS)—and the <a href="Soft%20Capture%20and%20Rendezvous%20System">Soft Capture and Rendezvous System</a>, which will enable the future rendezvous, capture, and safe disposal of Hubble by either a crewed or robotic mission. Except for the ACS's <a href="Advanced%20Camera%20for%20Surveys%23High-Resolution%20Channel%20%28HRC%29">High Resolution Channel</a> which could not be repaired and was disabled, the work accomplished during SM4 rendered the telescope fully functional, and it remains so .

Since the start of the program, a number of research projects have been carried out, some of them almost solely with Hubble, others coordinated facilities such as <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> and <a href="ESO">ESO</a>'s <a href="Very%20Large%20Telescope">Very Large Telescope</a>. Although the Hubble observatory is nearing the end of its life, there are still major projects scheduled for it. One example is the upcoming Frontier Fields program, inspired by the results of Hubble's deep observation of the galaxy cluster <a href="Abell%201689">Abell 1689</a>.
In an August 2013 press release, <a href="CANDELS">CANDELS</a> was referred to as "the largest project in the history of Hubble". The survey "aims to explore galactic evolution in the early Universe, and the very first seeds of cosmic structure at less than one billion years after the Big Bang." The CANDELS project site describes the survey's goals as the following:
The Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey is designed to document the first third of galactic evolution from z = 8 to 1.5 via deep imaging of more than 250,000 galaxies with WFC3/IR and ACS. It will also find the first Type Ia SNe beyond z > 1.5 and establish their accuracy as standard candles for cosmology. Five premier multi-wavelength sky regions are selected; each has multi-wavelength data from Spitzer and other facilities, and has extensive spectroscopy of the brighter galaxies. The use of five widely separated fields mitigates cosmic variance and yields statistically robust and complete samples of galaxies down to 10 solar masses out to z ~ 8.

The program, officially named "Hubble Deep Fields Initiative 2012", is aimed to advance the knowledge of early <a href="galaxy%20formation">galaxy formation</a> by studying high-redshift galaxies in <a href="Deep%20field">blank fields</a> with the help of <a href="gravitational%20lensing">gravitational lensing</a> to see the "faintest galaxies in the distant universe." The Frontier Fields web page describes the goals of the program being:
Anyone can apply for time on the telescope; there are no restrictions on nationality or academic affiliation, but funding for analysis is only available to US institutions. Competition for time on the telescope is intense, with about one-fifth of the proposals submitted in each cycle earning time on the schedule.

Calls for proposals are issued roughly annually, with time allocated for a cycle lasting about one year. Proposals are divided into several categories; "general observer" proposals are the most common, covering routine observations. "Snapshot observations" are those in which targets require only 45 minutes or less of telescope time, including overheads such as acquiring the target. Snapshot observations are used to fill in gaps in the telescope schedule that cannot be filled by regular GO programs.

Astronomers may make "Target of Opportunity" proposals, in which observations are scheduled if a transient event covered by the proposal occurs during the scheduling cycle. In addition, up to 10% of the telescope time is designated "director's discretionary" (DD) time. Astronomers can apply to use DD time at any time of year, and it is typically awarded for study of unexpected transient phenomena such as supernovae.

Other uses of DD time have included the observations that led to views of the Hubble Deep Field and Hubble Ultra Deep Field, and in the first four cycles of telescope time, observations that were carried out by amateur astronomers.

Public image processing of Hubble data is encouraged as most of the data in the archives has not been processed into color imagery.

The first director of STScI, <a href="Riccardo%20Giacconi">Riccardo Giacconi</a>, announced in 1986 that he intended to devote some of his director discretionary time to allowing amateur astronomers to use the telescope. The total time to be allocated was only a few hours per cycle but excited great interest among amateur astronomers.

Proposals for amateur time were stringently reviewed by a committee of amateur astronomers, and time was awarded only to proposals that were deemed to have genuine scientific merit, did not duplicate proposals made by professionals, and required the unique capabilities of the space telescope. Thirteen amateur astronomers were awarded time on the telescope, with observations being carried out between 1990 and 1997. One such study was "<a href="Hubble%20search%20for%20transition%20comets">Transition Comets—UV Search for OH</a>". The very first proposal, "A Hubble Space Telescope Study of Posteclipse Brightening and Albedo Changes on Io", was published in "Icarus", a journal devoted to solar system studies. A second study from another group of amateurs was also published in "Icarus". After that time, however, budget reductions at STScI made the support of work by amateur astronomers untenable, and no additional amateur programs have been carried out.

In the early 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss key projects. These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, which would be explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) a study of the nearby intergalactic medium using quasar <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s to determine the properties of the <a href="intergalactic%20medium">intergalactic medium</a> and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the <a href="Hubble%20constant">Hubble constant</a> within ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale.

Hubble has helped resolve some long-standing problems in astronomy, while also raising new questions. Some results have required new <a href="scientific%20theory">theories</a> to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to <a href="Cepheid%20variable">Cepheid variable</a> stars more accurately than ever before, and thus <a href="Hubble%27s%20law%23Using%20Hubble%20space%20telescope%20data">constrain the value</a> of the <a href="Hubble%20constant">Hubble constant</a>, the measure of the rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had <a href="errors%20and%20residuals%20in%20statistics">errors</a> of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the <a href="Virgo%20Cluster">Virgo Cluster</a> and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.

While Hubble helped to refine estimates of the age of the universe, it also cast doubt on theories about its future. Astronomers from the <a href="High-z%20Supernova%20Search%20Team">High-z Supernova Search Team</a> and the <a href="Supernova%20Cosmology%20Project">Supernova Cosmology Project</a> used ground-based telescopes and HST to observe distant <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e and uncovered evidence that, far from decelerating under the influence of <a href="gravity">gravity</a>, the expansion of the universe may in fact be <a href="Deceleration%20parameter">accelerating</a>. Three members of these two groups have subsequently been awarded <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>s for their discovery. The cause of this acceleration remains poorly understood; the most common cause attributed is <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>.

The high-resolution spectra and images provided by the HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would be found at the centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.

The collision of <a href="Comet%20Shoemaker-Levy%209">Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</a> with <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> in 1994 was fortuitously timed for astronomers, coming just a few months after Servicing Mission 1 had restored Hubble's optical performance. Hubble images of the <a href="planet">planet</a> were sharper than any taken since the passage of <a href="Voyager%202">Voyager 2</a> in 1979, and were crucial in studying the dynamics of the collision of a comet with Jupiter, an event believed to occur once every few centuries.

Other discoveries made with Hubble data include proto-planetary disks (<a href="proplyd">proplyd</a>s) in the <a href="Orion%20Nebula">Orion Nebula</a>; evidence for the presence of <a href="extrasolar%20planet">extrasolar planet</a>s around Sun-like stars; and the optical counterparts of the still-mysterious <a href="gamma-ray%20burst">gamma-ray burst</a>s. HST has also been used to study objects in the outer reaches of the Solar System, including the dwarf planets <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a> and <a href="Eris%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Eris</a>.

A unique window on the Universe enabled by Hubble are the <a href="Hubble%20Deep%20Field">Hubble Deep Field</a>, <a href="Hubble%20Ultra-Deep%20Field">Hubble Ultra-Deep Field</a>, and <a href="Hubble%20Extreme%20Deep%20Field">Hubble Extreme Deep Field</a> images, which used Hubble's unmatched sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new window on the early Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery of some of the most distant objects yet discovered, such as <a href="MACS0647-JD">MACS0647-JD</a>.

The non-standard object <a href="SCP%2006F6">SCP 06F6</a> was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope in February 2006. During June and July 2012, US astronomers using Hubble discovered a <a href="Styx%20%28moon%29">tiny fifth moon</a> orbiting around Pluto.

In March 2015, researchers announced that measurements of aurorae around <a href="Ganymede%20%28moon%29">Ganymede</a> revealed that the moon has a subsurface ocean. Using Hubble to study the motion of its aurorae, the researchers determined that a large saltwater ocean was helping to suppress the interaction between Jupiter's magnetic field and that of Ganymede. The ocean is estimated to be deep, trapped beneath a ice crust.

On December 11, 2015, Hubble captured an image of the first-ever predicted reappearance of a supernova, dubbed "<a href="SN%20Refsdal">Refsdal</a>", which was calculated using different mass models of a galaxy cluster whose gravity is <a href="General%20relativity">warping</a> the supernova's light. The supernova was previously seen in November 2014 behind galaxy cluster <a href="MACS%20J1149.5%2B2223">MACS J1149.5+2223</a> as part of Hubble's Frontier Fields program. Astronomers spotted four separate images of the supernova in an arrangement known as an <a href="Einstein%20Cross">Einstein Cross</a>. The light from the cluster has taken about five billion years to reach Earth, though the supernova exploded some 10 billion years ago. The detection of Refsdal's reappearance served as a unique opportunity for astronomers to test their models of how mass, especially <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>, is distributed within this galaxy cluster.

On March 3, 2016, researchers using Hubble data announced the discovery of the farthest known galaxy to date: <a href="GN-z11">GN-z11</a>. The Hubble observations occurred on February 11, 2015, and April 3, 2015, as part of the <a href="CANDELS">CANDELS</a>/<a href="GOODS">GOODS</a>-North surveys.

Many objective measures show the positive impact of Hubble data on astronomy. Over 15,000 <a href="Scientific%20paper">papers</a> based on Hubble data have been published in peer-reviewed journals, and countless more have appeared in conference <a href="proceedings">proceedings</a>. Looking at papers several years after their publication, about one-third of all astronomy papers have no <a href="citation">citation</a>s, while only 2% of papers based on Hubble data have no citations. On average, a paper based on Hubble data receives about twice as many citations as papers based on non-Hubble data. Of the 200 papers published each year that receive the most citations, about 10% are based on Hubble data.

Although the HST has clearly helped astronomical research, its financial cost has been large. A study on the relative astronomical benefits of different sizes of telescopes found that while papers based on HST data generate 15 times as many citations as a ground-based telescope such as the <a href="William%20Herschel%20Telescope">William Herschel Telescope</a>, the HST costs about 100 times as much to build and maintain.

Deciding between building ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based techniques such as <a href="aperture%20masking%20interferometry">aperture masking interferometry</a> had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 10 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in <a href="adaptive%20optics">adaptive optics</a> have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only a small fraction of astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.

In addition to its scientific results, Hubble has also made significant contributions to <a href="aerospace%20engineering">aerospace engineering</a>, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of <a href="Carbon%20fiber%20reinforced%20polymer">graphite composite</a> structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, <a href="radiation%20damage">radiation damage</a> to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of <a href="multi-layer%20insulation">multi-layer insulation</a>. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.

Hubble data was initially stored on the spacecraft. When launched, the storage facilities were old-fashioned reel-to-reel <a href="tape%20recorder">tape recorder</a>s, but these were replaced by <a href="solid-state%20drive">solid state</a> data storage facilities during servicing missions 2 and 3A. About twice daily, the Hubble Space Telescope radios data to a satellite in the <a href="geosynchronous">geosynchronous</a> <a href="Tracking%20and%20Data%20Relay%20Satellite%20System">Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System</a> (TDRSS), which then downlinks the science data to one of two 60-foot (18-meter) diameter high-gain microwave antennas located at the <a href="White%20Sands%20Test%20Facility">White Sands Test Facility</a> in <a href="White%20Sands%2C%20New%20Mexico">White Sands, New Mexico</a>. From there they are sent to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, and finally to the Space Telescope Science Institute for archiving. Each week, HST downlinks approximately 140 gigabits of data.

All images from Hubble are <a href="monochrome">monochromatic</a> <a href="grayscale">grayscale</a>, taken through a variety of filters, each passing specific wavelengths of light, and incorporated in each camera. Color images are created by combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create <a href="false-color">false-color</a> versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.

All Hubble data is eventually made available via the <a href="Space%20Telescope%20Science%20Institute">Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes</a> at <a href="Space%20Telescope%20Science%20Institute">STScI</a>, <a href="Canadian%20Astronomy%20Data%20Centre">CADC</a> and <a href="European%20Space%20Astronomy%20Centre">ESA/ESAC</a>. Data is usually proprietary—available only to the <a href="principal%20investigator">principal investigator</a> (PI) and astronomers designated by the PI—for six months after being taken. The PI can apply to the director of the STScI to extend or reduce the proprietary period in some circumstances.

Observations made on Director's Discretionary Time are exempt from the proprietary period, and are released to the public immediately. Calibration data such as flat fields and <a href="dark%20frame">dark frame</a>s are also publicly available straight away. All data in the archive is in the <a href="FITS">FITS</a> format, which is suitable for astronomical analysis but not for public use. The <a href="Hubble%20Heritage%20Project">Hubble Heritage Project</a> processes and releases to the public a small selection of the most striking images in <a href="JPEG">JPEG</a> and <a href="Tagged%20Image%20File%20Format">TIFF</a> formats.

Astronomical data taken with <a href="Charge-coupled%20device">CCDs</a> must undergo several calibration steps before they are suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.

Hubble data can be analyzed using many different packages. STScI maintains the custom-made <a href="Space%20Telescope%20Science%20Data%20Analysis%20System">Space Telescope Science Data Analysis System</a> (STSDAS) software, which contains all the programs needed to run pipeline reduction on raw data files, as well as many other astronomical image processing tools, tailored to the requirements of Hubble data. The software runs as a module of <a href="IRAF">IRAF</a>, a popular astronomical data reduction program.

It has always been important for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of <a href="taxpayer">taxpayer</a>s to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.

Several initiatives have helped to keep the public informed about Hubble activities.
In the United States, <a href="outreach">outreach</a> efforts are coordinated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) Office for Public Outreach, which was established in 2000 to ensure that U.S. taxpayers saw the benefits of their investment in the space telescope program. To that end, STScI operates the HubbleSite.org website. The <a href="Hubble%20Heritage%20Project">Hubble Heritage Project</a>, operating out of the STScI, provides the public with high-quality images of the most interesting and striking objects observed. The Heritage team is composed of amateur and professional astronomers, as well as people with backgrounds outside astronomy, and emphasizes the <a href="aesthetic">aesthetic</a> nature of Hubble images. The Heritage Project is granted a small amount of time to observe objects which, for scientific reasons, may not have images taken at enough wavelengths to construct a full-color image.

Since 1999, the leading Hubble outreach group in Europe has been the <a href="Hubble%20European%20Space%20Agency%20Information%20Centre">Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre</a> (HEIC). This office was established at the <a href="Space%20Telescope%20European%20Coordinating%20Facility">Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility</a> in Munich, Germany. HEIC's mission is to fulfill HST outreach and education tasks for the European Space Agency. The work is centered on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble results and images. These are often European in origin, and so increase awareness of both ESA's Hubble share (15%) and the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. ESA produces educational material, including a <a href="videocast">videocast</a> series called Hubblecast designed to share world-class scientific news with the public.

The Hubble Space Telescope has won two Space Achievement Awards from the <a href="Space%20Foundation">Space Foundation</a>, for its outreach activities, in 2001 and 2010.

A replica of the Hubble Space Telescope is on the courthouse lawn in <a href="Marshfield%2C%20Missouri">Marshfield, Missouri</a>, the hometown of namesake Edwin P. Hubble.

The Hubble Space Telescope celebrated its 20th anniversary in space on April 24, 2010. To commemorate the occasion, NASA, ESA, and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) released an image from the <a href="Carina%20Nebula">Carina Nebula</a>.

To commemorate Hubble's 25th anniversary in space on April 24, 2015, STScI released images of the <a href="Westerlund%202">Westerlund 2</a> cluster, located about away in the constellation Carina, through its Hubble 25 website. The European Space Agency created a dedicated 25th anniversary page on its website. In April 2016, a special celebratory image of the <a href="Bubble%20Nebula">Bubble Nebula</a> was released for Hubble's 26th "birthday".

HST uses <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a>s to detect and measure any rotations so it can stabilize itself in orbit and point accurately and steadily at astronomical targets. Three gyroscopes are normally required for operation; observations are still possible with two or one, but the area of sky that can be viewed would be somewhat restricted, and observations requiring very accurate pointing are more difficult. In 2018, the plan is to drop into one-gyro mode if less than three working gyroscopes are operational.The gyroscopes are part of the Pointing Control System, which uses five types of sensors (magnetic sensors, optical sensors, and the gyroscopes) and two types of <a href="actuator">actuator</a>s (<a href="reaction%20wheel">reaction wheel</a>s and <a href="magnetic%20torquer">magnetic torquer</a>s). Hubble carries six gyroscopes in total.

After the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster">"Columbia" disaster</a> in 2003, it was unclear whether another servicing mission would be possible, and gyro life became a concern again, so engineers developed new software for two-gyro and one-gyro modes to maximize the potential lifetime. The development was successful, and in 2005, it was decided to switch to two-gyroscope mode for regular telescope operations as a means of extending the lifetime of the mission. The switch to this mode was made in August 2005, leaving Hubble with two gyroscopes in use, two on backup, and two inoperable. One more gyro failed in 2007.

By the time of the final repair mission in May 2009, during which all six gyros were replaced (with two new pairs and one refurbished pair), only three gyros were still working. Engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid. The new gyro models were assembled using pressurized nitrogen and they should be much more reliable. In the 2009 servicing mission all six gyroscopes were replaced, and after almost ten years only three gryos failed, but only after exceeding the average expected run time for the design.

Of the six gyroscopes replaced in 2009, three were of the old design susceptible for flex-lead failure, and three were of the new design with a longer expected lifetime. The first of the old-style gyros failed in March 2014, and the second of the old-style gyros failed in April 2018. On October 5, 2018, the last of the old-style gyros failed, and one of the new-style gyros was powered-up from standby state. However, that reserve gyro did not immediately perform within operational limits, and so the observatory was placed into "safe" mode while scientists attempted to fix the problem. NASA tweeted on October 22, 2018, that the "rotation rates produced by the backup gyro have reduced and are now within a normal range. Additional tests to be performed to ensure Hubble can return to science operations with this gyro."

The solution that restored the backup new-style gyro to operational range was widely reported as "turning it off and on again". A "running restart" of the gyroscope was performed, but this had no effect, and the final resolution to the failure was more complex. The failure was attributed to an inconsistency in the fluid surrounding the float within the gyroscope (e.g., an air bubble). On October 18, 2018, the Hubble Operations Team directed the spacecraft into a series of maneuvers - moving the spacecraft in opposite directions - in order to mitigate the inconsistency. Only after the maneuvers, and a subsequent set of maneuvers on October 19, did the gyroscope truly operate within its normal range.

Past servicing missions have exchanged old instruments for new ones, avoiding failure and making new types of science possible. Without servicing missions, all of the instruments will eventually fail. In August 2004, the power system of the <a href="Space%20Telescope%20Imaging%20Spectrograph">Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph</a> (STIS) failed, rendering the instrument inoperable. The electronics had originally been fully redundant, but the first set of electronics failed in May 2001. This power supply was fixed during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009.

Similarly, the <a href="Advanced%20Camera%20for%20Surveys">Advanced Camera for Surveys</a> (ACS) main camera primary electronics failed in June 2006, and the power supply for the backup electronics failed on January 27, 2007. Only the instrument's Solar Blind Channel (SBC) was operable using the side-1 electronics. A new power supply for the wide angle channel was added during SM 4, but quick tests revealed this did not help the high resolution channel. The Wide Field Channel (WFC) was returned to service by <a href="STS-125">STS-125</a> in May 2009 but the High Resolution Channel (HRC) remains offline.

On January 8, 2019, Hubble entered a partial safe mode following suspected hardware problems in its most advanced instrument, the <a href="Wide%20Field%20Camera%203">Wide Field Camera 3</a> instrument. NASA later reported that the cause of the safe mode within the instrument was a detection of voltage levels out of a defined range. On January 15, 2019, NASA stated that the cause of the failure was a software problem. Engineering data within the telemetry circuits were not accurate. In addition, all other telemetry within those circuits also contained erroneous values indicating that this was a telemetry issue and not a power supply issue. After resetting the telemetry circuits and associated boards the instrument began functioning again. On January 17, 2019, the device was returned to normal operation and on the same day it completed its first science observations.

Hubble orbits the Earth in the extremely tenuous upper <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a>, and over time its orbit <a href="orbital%20decay">decays</a> due to <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>. If it is not re-boosted, it will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within some decades, with the exact date depending on how active the Sun is and its impact on the upper atmosphere. If Hubble were to descend in a completely uncontrolled re-entry, parts of the main mirror and its support structure would probably survive, leaving the potential for damage or even human fatalities. In 2013, deputy project manager James Jeletic projected that Hubble could survive into the 2020s. Based on solar activity and atmospheric drag, or lack thereof, a natural atmospheric reentry for Hubble will occur between 2028 and 2040. In June 2016, NASA extended the service contract for Hubble until June 2021.

NASA's original plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was to <a href="STS-144">retrieve it using a space shuttle</a>. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. This is no longer possible since the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20retirement">space shuttle fleet has been retired</a>, and would have been unlikely in any case due to the cost of the mission and risk to the crew. Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry. Ultimately, in 2009, as part of Servicing Mission 4, the last servicing mission by the Space Shuttle, NASA installed the Soft Capture Mechanism (SCM), to enable deorbit by either a crewed or robotic mission. The SCM, together with the Relative Navigation System (RNS) - mounted on the Shuttle to collect data to "enable NASA to pursue numerous options for the safe de-orbit of Hubble", constitute the Soft Capture and Rendezvous System (SCRS).

, the <a href="Trump%20Administration">Trump Administration</a> is considering a proposal by the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20Corporation">Sierra Nevada Corporation</a> to use a manned version of its <a href="Dream%20Chaser">Dream Chaser</a> spacecraft to service "Hubble" some time in the 2020s both as a continuation of its scientific capabilities and as insurance against any malfunctions in the to-be-launched <a href="James%20Webb%20Space%20Telescope">James Webb Space Telescope</a>.

There is no direct replacement to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes do not duplicate Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying the expense of a space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using <a href="adaptive%20optics">adaptive optics</a> (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.

Plans for a Hubble successor materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which culminated in plans for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, it is designed to operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 <a href="Lagrangian%20point">Lagrangian point</a>, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the <a href="Timeline%20of%20the%20Big%20Bang">early Universe</a> approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the <a href="Canadian%20Space%20Agency">Canadian Space Agency</a> since 1996, and is planned for launch on an <a href="Ariane%205">Ariane 5</a> rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600 nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>. A typical human eye can see to about 750 nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.
A complementary telescope, looking at even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's <a href="Herschel%20Space%20Observatory">Herschel Space Observatory</a>, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel was not designed to be serviced after launch, and had a mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the <a href="far%20infrared">far infrared</a> and <a href="submillimeter%20astronomy">submillimeter</a>. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.

Further concepts for advanced 21st-century space telescopes include the <a href="Advanced%20Technology%20Large-Aperture%20Space%20Telescope">Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope</a>, a conceptualized optical space telescope that if realized could be a more direct successor to HST, with the ability to observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the <a href="Spitzer%20Space%20telescope">Spitzer Space telescope</a>. This effort is being planned for the 2025–2035 time frame.

Existing ground-based telescopes, and various proposed <a href="Extremely%20Large%20Telescopes">Extremely Large Telescopes</a>, can exceed the HST in terms of sheer light-gathering power and diffraction limit due to larger mirrors, but other factors affect telescopes. In some cases, they may be able to match or beat Hubble in resolution by using adaptive optics (AO). However, AO on large ground-based reflectors will not make Hubble and other space telescopes obsolete. Most AO systems sharpen the view over a very narrow field—<a href="Lucky%20imaging">Lucky Cam</a>, for example, produces crisp images just 10" to 20" wide, whereas Hubble's cameras produce crisp images across a 2½' (150") field. Furthermore, space telescopes can study the universe across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, most of which is blocked by Earth's atmosphere. Finally, the background sky is darker in space than on the ground, because air absorbs solar energy during the day and then releases it at night, producing a faint—but nevertheless discernible—<a href="airglow">airglow</a> that washes out low-contrast astronomical objects.

James A. Garfield

James Abram Garfield (November 19, 1831 – September 19, 1881) was the 20th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a>, serving from March 4, 1881 until his death <a href="Assassination%20of%20James%20A.%20Garfield">by assassination</a> six and a half months later. He was the first sitting member of Congress to be elected to the presidency, and remains the only sitting House member to gain the White House.

Garfield entered politics as a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> in 1857. He served as a member of the <a href="Ohio%20Senate">Ohio State Senate</a> from 1859 to 1861. Garfield opposed <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate secession</a>, served as a major general in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, and fought in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Middle%20Creek">Middle Creek</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Shiloh</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Chickamauga</a>. He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent <a href="Ohio%27s%2019th%20congressional%20district">Ohio's 19th District</a>. Throughout Garfield's extended congressional service after the Civil War, he firmly supported the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> and gained a reputation as a skilled orator. Garfield initially agreed with <a href="Radical%20Republican">Radical Republican</a> views regarding <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>, but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for <a href="Freedman">freedmen</a>.

At the <a href="1880%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1880 Republican National Convention</a>, Senator-elect Garfield attended as campaign manager for <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>, and gave the presidential nomination speech for him. When neither Sherman nor his rivals – <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> and <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> – could get enough votes to secure the nomination, delegates chose Garfield as a compromise on the 36th ballot. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">1880 presidential election</a>, Garfield conducted a low-key <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a> and narrowly defeated Democrat <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>.

Garfield's accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against <a href="senatorial%20courtesy">senatorial courtesy</a> in executive appointments, purging corruption in the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">Post Office</a>, and appointing a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> justice. He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a> by appointing <a href="William%20H.%20Robertson">William H. Robertson</a> to the lucrative post of <a href="Collector%20of%20the%20Port%20of%20New%20York">Collector of the Port of New York</a>, starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>. He also proposed substantial civil service reforms; those reforms were eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, as the <a href="Pendleton%20Civil%20Service%20Reform%20Act">Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act</a>.

On July 2, 1881, Garfield <a href="Assassination%20of%20James%20A.%20Garfield">was shot</a> at the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Potomac%20Railroad%20Station">Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station</a> in <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> by <a href="Charles%20J.%20Guiteau">Charles J. Guiteau</a>, a disappointed <a href="Spoils%20system">office seeker</a>. The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but he succumbed on September 19, 1881. Guiteau was <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">executed</a> for the murder of Garfield in June 1882. Historians often forgo <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">listing Garfield in rankings of U.S. presidents</a> due to the short duration of his presidency.

James Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in <a href="Orange%20Township%2C%20Cuyahoga%20County%2C%20Ohio">Orange Township</a>, now <a href="Moreland%20Hills%2C%20Ohio">Moreland Hills, Ohio</a>. Orange Township had been in the <a href="Western%20Reserve">Western Reserve</a> until 1800, and like many who settled there, Garfield's ancestors were from New England, his ancestor, Edward Garfield immigrating from <a href="Hillmorton">Hillmorton</a>, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, England, to Massachusetts in around 1630. James' father Abram had been born in <a href="Worcester%2C%20New%20York">Worcester, New York</a>, and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart, Mehitabel Ballou, only to find her married. He instead wed her sister Eliza, who had been born in New Hampshire. James was named for an older brother, dead in infancy.

In early 1833, Abram and Eliza Garfield joined the <a href="Church%20of%20Christ">Church of Christ</a>, a decision that would help shape their youngest son's life. Abram Garfield died later that year; his son was raised in poverty in a household led by the strong-willed Eliza. James was her favorite child, and the two remained close for the rest of his life. Eliza Garfield remarried in 1842, but soon left her second husband, Warren Belden (possibly Alfred Belden), and a then-scandalous divorce was awarded against her in 1850. James took his mother's side and when Belden died in 1880, noted the fact in his diary with satisfaction. Garfield enjoyed his mother's stories about his ancestry, especially his <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> great-great-grandfathers and his ancestor who served as a knight of <a href="Caerphilly%20Castle">Caerffili Castle</a>.

Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by his fellow boys, and throughout his life was very sensitive to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring all the books he could find. He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a>, Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing the mules that pulled it. This labor would be used to good effect by <a href="Horatio%20Alger">Horatio Alger</a>, who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.

After six weeks, illness forced Garfield to return home and, during his recuperation, his mother and a local education official got him to promise to postpone his return to the canals for a year and go to school. Accordingly, in 1848, he began at <a href="Geauga%20Seminary">Geauga Seminary</a>, in nearby <a href="Chester%20Township%2C%20Geauga%20County%2C%20Ohio">Chester Township</a>. Garfield later said of his childhood, "I lament that I was born to poverty, and in this chaos of childhood, seventeen years passed before I caught any inspiration ... a precious 17 years when a boy with a father and some wealth might have become fixed in manly ways."

At <a href="Geauga%20Academy">Geauga Academy</a>, which he attended from 1848 to 1850, Garfield learned academic subjects he had not previously had time for. He shone as a student, and was especially interested in languages and elocution. He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience, writing that the speaker's platform "creates some excitement. I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error." Geauga was co-educational, and Garfield was attracted to one of his fellow students, <a href="Lucretia%20Garfield">Lucretia Rudolph</a>, whom he later married. To support himself at Geauga, he worked as a carpenter's assistant and as a teacher. The need to go from town to town to find a place as a teacher disgusted Garfield, and he thereafter developed a dislike of what he called "place-seeking", which became, he said, "the law of my life." In later years, he would astound his friends by letting positions pass that could have been his with a little politicking. Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God, but in his late teens underwent a religious awakening, and attended many <a href="camp%20meeting">camp meeting</a>s, at one of which he was <a href="Born%20again%20%28Christianity%29">born again</a>. The next day, March 4, 1850, he was baptized into Christ by being submerged in the icy waters of the <a href="Chagrin%20River">Chagrin River</a>.
After leaving Geauga, Garfield worked for a year at various jobs, including teaching. Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college, Garfield determined to do the same, and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations. From 1851 to 1854, he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (later named <a href="Hiram%20College">Hiram College</a>) in <a href="Hiram%2C%20Ohio">Hiram, Ohio</a>, a school run by the Disciples. While there, he was most interested in the study of Greek and Latin, but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered. Securing a position on entry as <a href="janitor">janitor</a>, he was hired to teach while still a student. Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute, and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek. He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches, in some cases earning a <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> per service. By 1854, Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full-time teacher. Garfield then enrolled at <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a> in <a href="Williamstown%2C%20Massachusetts">Williamstown, Massachusetts</a>, as a <a href="junior%20%28education%29">third-year student</a>, given credit for two years' study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination. Garfield was impressed with the college president, <a href="Mark%20Hopkins%20%28educator%29">Mark Hopkins</a>, who had responded warmly to Garfield's letter inquiring about admission. He said of Hopkins, "The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other." Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days, "There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject. There was no pretense of genius, or alternation of spasmodic effort, but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions." After his first term, Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby <a href="Pownal%2C%20Vermont">Pownal, Vermont</a>, a post whose previous incumbent was <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>.

Garfield graduated from Williams in August 1856 as <a href="salutatorian">salutatorian</a>, giving an address at the <a href="Graduation">commencement</a>. Garfield biographer Ira Rutkow pointed out that the future president's years at Williams gave Garfield the opportunity to know and respect those of different social backgrounds, and despite his origin as an unsophisticated Westerner, he was liked and respected by socially conscious New Englanders. "In short", as Rutkow later wrote, "Garfield had an extensive and positive first experience with the world outside the Western Reserve of Ohio."

On his return to Ohio, the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction. He returned to Hiram to teach at the Institute, and in 1857 was made its president. He did not see education as a field that would realize his full potential. At Williams, he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti-slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school, and began to consider politics as a career. In 1858, he married Lucretia; they would have seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Soon after the wedding, he formally entered his name to <a href="read%20law">read law</a> at a Cleveland firm, although he did his studying in Hiram. He was admitted to the bar in 1861.

Local <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> leaders invited Garfield to enter politics upon the death of Cyrus Prentiss, the presumptive nominee for the local state senate seat. He was nominated by the party convention on the sixth ballot, and was elected, serving until 1861. Garfield's major effort in the state senate was a bill providing for Ohio's first <a href="geological%20survey">geological survey</a> to measure its mineral resources, though it failed.

After <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s election as president, several Southern states announced their <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> from the Union to form a new government, the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which he regarded as a holy crusade against the <a href="Slave%20Power">Slave Power</a>. In April 1861, the rebels <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">bombarded Fort Sumter</a>, one of the last federal outposts in the South, beginning the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.

At Governor <a href="William%20Dennison%20Jr.">William Dennison's</a> request, Garfield deferred his military ambitions to remain in the legislature, where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio's volunteer regiments. Afterward, the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio, encouraging enlistment in the new regiments. Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets, Garfield returned to Ohio and, in August 1861, received a commission as a <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> in the <a href="42nd%20Ohio%20Infantry">42nd Ohio Infantry</a> regiment. The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper, so Garfield's first task was to fill its ranks. He did so quickly, recruiting many of his neighbors and former students. The regiment traveled to <a href="Camp%20Chase">Camp Chase</a>, outside <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, to complete training. In December, Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky, where they joined the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ohio">Army of the Ohio</a> under <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a>.

Buell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the <a href="40th%20Ohio%20Infantry">40th Ohio Infantry</a>, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed <a href="Catlettsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Catlettsburg, Kentucky</a>, in mid-December, advancing through the valley of the <a href="Big%20Sandy%20River%20%28Ohio%20River%29">Big Sandy River</a>. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached <a href="Paintsville%2C%20Kentucky">Paintsville, Kentucky</a>, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General <a href="Humphrey%20Marshall%20%28general%29">Humphrey Marshall</a> held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered. Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia; Garfield ordered his troops to pursue the Confederates. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Middle%20Creek">Battle of Middle Creek</a>, the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded. At the end of the fighting, the Confederates withdrew from the field, and Garfield sent his troops to <a href="Prestonsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Prestonsburg</a> to reprovision.
In recognition of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general, at the age of 30. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky, and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at <a href="Pound%20Gap">Pound Gap</a>, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.

Garfield's promotion gave him command of the 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio, which was ordered in early 1862 to join <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s forces as they advanced on <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>. Before the 20th Brigade arrived, however, Confederate forces under General <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a> surprised Grant's men in their camps, driving them back. Garfield's troops got word of the battle and advanced quickly, joining the rest of the army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat. The action, later known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>, was the bloodiest of the war to date; Garfield was exposed to fire for much of the day, but emerged uninjured. Major General <a href="Henry%20W.%20Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a>, Grant's superior, took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth; when they arrived, the Confederates had fled.

That summer Garfield suffered from <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a> and significant weight loss. He was forced to return home, where his wife nursed him back to health. While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, although he refused to politick with the delegates. He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment. During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extra-marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it. Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his frustration. In the meantime, he served on the <a href="court-martial%20of%20Fitz%20John%20Porter">court-martial of Fitz John Porter</a> for his tardiness at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>. He was convinced of Porter's guilt, and voted with his fellow generals to convict. The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, and by the end of it, Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General <a href="William%20S.%20Rosecrans">William S. Rosecrans</a>.

The position of Chief of Staff for a general was usually held by a more junior officer, but Garfield's influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual, with duties extending beyond mere communication of orders to duties that involved actual management of his <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Army of the Cumberland</a>. Rosecrans had a voracious appetite for conversation, especially when he was unable to sleep; in Garfield, he found "the first well read person in the Army" and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night. The two became close in spite of Garfield's being twelve years junior to Rosecrans, and their talks covered all topics, especially religion; Rosecrans, who had converted from <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> to <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>, succeeded in softening Garfield's view of his faith. Garfield recommended that Rosecrans replace wing commanders <a href="Alexander%20McCook">Alexander McCook</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Leonidas%20Crittenden">Thomas Crittenden</a>, whom he believed ineffective, but Rosecrans ignored the suggestions. With Rosecrans, Garfield devised the <a href="Tullahoma%20Campaign">Tullahoma Campaign</a> to pursue and trap Confederate General <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a> in <a href="Tullahoma">Tullahoma</a>. After initial Union success, Bragg retreated toward <a href="Chattanooga">Chattanooga</a>, where Rosecrans stalled and requested more troops and supplies. Garfield argued for an immediate advance, in line with demands from Halleck and Lincoln. After a council of war and lengthy deliberations, Rosecrans agreed to attack.

At the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a> on September 19 and 20, 1863, confusion among the wing commanders over Rosecrans's orders created a gap in the lines, resulting in a rout of the right flank. Rosecrans concluded that the battle was lost and fell back on Chattanooga to establish a defensive line. Garfield, however, thought that part of the army had held and, with Rosecrans's approval, headed across <a href="Missionary%20Ridge">Missionary Ridge</a> to survey the scene. Garfield's hunch was correct. His ride became legendary, while Rosecrans' error reignited criticism about his leadership. While Rosecrans's army had avoided disaster, they were stranded in Chattanooga, surrounded by Bragg's army. Garfield sent a telegram to Secretary of War <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Stanton">Edwin M. Stanton</a> alerting Washington to the need for reinforcements to avoid annihilation, and Lincoln and Halleck delivered 20,000 troops by rail within nine days. In the meantime, Grant was promoted to command of the western armies, and quickly replaced Rosecrans with <a href="George%20H.%20Thomas">George H. Thomas</a>. Garfield was ordered to report to Washington, where he was promoted to major general, a commission he would resign before taking a seat in the House of Representatives. According to historian <a href="Jean%20Edward%20Smith">Jean Edward Smith</a>, Grant and Garfield had a "guarded relationship", since Grant promoted Thomas to command of the Army of the Cumberland, rather than Garfield, after Rosecrans was dismissed.

While serving in the Army in early 1862, Garfield was approached by friends about running for Congress from Ohio's newly redrawn, heavily Republican <a href="Ohio%27s%2019th%20congressional%20district">19th district</a>. He was worried that he and other state-appointed generals would get obscure assignments, and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career. The fact that the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 would allow him to continue his war service for a time. Home on medical leave, he refused to campaign for the nomination, leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862, on the eighth ballot. In October, he defeated D.B. Woods by a two-to-one margin in the general election for a seat in the <a href="38th%20United%20States%20Congress">38th Congress</a>.

Soon after the nomination, Garfield was ordered to report to War Secretary <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a> in Washington to discuss his military future. There, Garfield met Treasury Secretary <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>, who befriended him, seeing him as a younger version of himself. The two men agreed politically, and both were part of the <a href="Radical%20Republican">Radical</a> wing of the Republican Party. Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that would do that on a widespread basis. Garfield, in debate on the House floor, supported such legislation and, discussing England's <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>, hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills. Although Garfield had supported Lincoln's <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, the congressman marveled that it was a "...strange phenomenon in the world's history, when a second-rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages."

Garfield not only favored abolition of slavery, but believed that the leaders of the rebellion had forfeited their constitutional rights. He supported the confiscation of southern plantations and even exile or execution of rebellion leaders as a means to ensure the permanent destruction of slavery. Garfield felt Congress was obliged "to determine what legislation is necessary to secure equal justice to all loyal persons, without regard to color." Garfield was more supportive of Lincoln when Lincoln took action against slavery. Early in his tenure, he differed from his party on several issues; his was the solitary Republican vote to terminate the use of bounties in recruiting. Some financially able recruits had used the bounty system to buy their way out of service (called commutation), which Garfield considered reprehensible. Garfield gave a speech pointing out the flaws in the existing conscription law: that of 300,000 called upon to enlist, barely 10,000 had, the remainder claiming exemption or providing money or a substitute. Lincoln appeared before the Military Affairs committee on which Garfield served, demanding a more effective bill; even if it cost him re-election, Lincoln was confident he could win the war before his term expired. After many false starts, Garfield, with the support of Lincoln, procured the passage of a conscription bill that excluded commutation.

Under Chase's influence, Garfield became a staunch proponent of a dollar backed by a <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, and was therefore a strong opponent of the "<a href="Greenback%20%28money%29">greenback</a>"; he regretted very much, but understood, the necessity for <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">suspension of payment in gold or silver</a> during the emergency presented by the Civil War. Garfield voted with the Radical Republicans in passing the <a href="Wade%E2%80%93Davis%20Bill">Wade–Davis Bill</a>, designed to give Congress more authority over <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>, but it was defeated by Lincoln's <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a>.

Garfield did not consider Lincoln particularly worthy of re-election, but no viable alternative seemed available. "He will probably be the man, though I think we could do better." The Ohioan attended <a href="1864%20National%20Union%20National%20Convention">the party convention</a> and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln's running mate, but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>. Both Lincoln and Garfield were re-elected. By then, Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a>, and his relations with Garfield became more distant.

Garfield took up the practice of law in 1865 as a means to improve his personal finances. His efforts took him to Wall Street where, the day after Lincoln's assassination, a riotous crowd led him into an impromptu speech to calm it: "Fellow citizens! Clouds and darkness are round about Him! His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies! Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne! Mercy and truth shall go before His face! Fellow citizens! God reigns, and the Government at Washington still lives!" The speech, with no mention or praise of Lincoln, was according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell "...quite as significant for what it did not contain as for what it did." In the following years, Garfield had more praise for Lincoln; a year after the Illinoisan's death Garfield stated that, "Greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln," and in 1878 called Lincoln "...one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power."

Garfield was as firm a supporter of black suffrage as he had been of abolition, though he admitted that the idea of African Americans as political equals with whites gave him "a strong feeling of repugnance." The new president, Johnson, sought the rapid restoration of the Southern states during the months between his accession and the meeting of Congress in December 1865; Garfield hesitantly supported this policy as an experiment. Johnson, an old friend, sought Garfield's backing, and their conversations led Garfield to assume that differences between president and Congress were not large. When Congress assembled in December (to Johnson's chagrin without the elected representatives of the Southern states, who were excluded), Garfield urged conciliation on his colleagues, although he feared that Johnson, a former Democrat, might combine with other Democrats to gain political control if he rejoined the party. Garfield foresaw conflict even before February 1866 when Johnson vetoed a bill to extend the life of the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a>, charged with aiding the former slaves. By April, Garfield had concluded that Johnson was either "crazy or drunk with opium."
The conflict between the branches of government was the major issue of the 1866 campaign, with Johnson taking to the campaign trail in a <a href="Swing%20Around%20the%20Circle">Swing Around the Circle</a> and Garfield facing opposition within his party in his home district. With the South still disenfranchised and Northern public opinion behind the Republicans, they gained a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress. Garfield, having overcome his challengers at his district nominating convention, was easily re-elected.

Garfield opposed the initial talk of impeaching President Johnson when Congress convened in December 1866. However, he supported legislation to limit Johnson's powers, such as the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Act</a>, which restricted Johnson in removing presidential appointees. Distracted by committee duties, he rarely spoke in connection with these bills, but was a loyal Republican vote against Johnson. Due to a court case, he was absent on the day in April 1868 when the House <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">impeached Johnson</a>, but soon gave a speech aligning himself with Thaddeus Stevens and others who sought Johnson's removal. When the president was acquitted in trial before the Senate, Garfield was shocked, and blamed the outcome of the trial on its presiding officer, Chief Justice Chase, his onetime mentor.

By the time Ulysses S. Grant succeeded Johnson in 1869, Garfield had moved away from the remaining radicals (Stevens, their leader, had died in 1868). He hailed the ratification of the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">15th Amendment</a> in 1870 as a triumph, and he favored the re-admission of Georgia to the Union as a matter of right, not politics. In 1871, Garfield opposed passage of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan%20Act">Ku Klux Klan Act</a>, saying, "I have never been more perplexed by a piece of legislation." He was torn between his indignation at "these terrorists" and his concern for the freedoms endangered by the power the bill gave to the president to enforce the act through suspension of <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>.

Throughout his political career, Garfield favored the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold, and later, through the <a href="free%20silver">free and unlimited coinage of silver</a>. In 1865, Garfield was placed on the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">House Ways and Means Committee</a>, a long-awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues. He reprised his opposition to the greenback, saying, "Any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster, covered with the curses of a ruined people." In 1868 Garfield gave a two-hour speech on currency in the House, which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point; in it he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments, that is, the government paying out silver and gold, rather than paper money that could not be redeemed.

Tariffs had been raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of financial affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held the majority in the House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful <a href="House%20Appropriations%20Committee">House Appropriations Committee</a>, but it was Ways and Means, with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>.

In September 1870, Garfield, who was then chairman of the <a href="House%20Banking%20Committee">House Banking Committee</a>, led an investigation into the <a href="Black%20Friday%20%281869%29">Black Friday</a> Gold Panic scandal. The committee investigation into corruption was thorough, but found no indictable offenses. Garfield blamed the easy availability of <a href="fiat%20money">fiat money</a> greenbacks for financing the speculation that led to the scandal.

Garfield was not at all enthused about the re-election of President Grant in 1872—until Horace Greeley, who emerged as the candidate of the Democrats and <a href="Liberal%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Liberal Republicans</a>, became the only serious alternative. Garfield opined, "I would say Grant was not fit to be nominated and Greeley is not fit to be elected." Both Grant and Garfield won overwhelming re-election victories.

The <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America%20scandal">Crédit Mobilier of America scandal</a> involved corruption in the financing of the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a>, part of the <a href="transcontinental%20railroad">transcontinental railroad</a> that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America">Crédit Mobilier of America</a> company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake the construction of the railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at <a href="par%20value">par value</a>, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, <a href="Oakes%20Ames">Oakes Ames</a> of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.

The story broke in July 1872, in the middle of the presidential campaign. Among those named were Vice President (and former House Speaker) <a href="Schuyler%20Colfax">Schuyler Colfax</a>, Grant's second-term <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a> (Massachusetts Senator <a href="Henry%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a>), Speaker <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> of Maine, and Garfield. Greeley had little luck taking advantage of the scandal. When Congress reconvened after the election, Blaine, seeking to clear his name, demanded a House investigation. Evidence before the special committee exonerated Blaine. Garfield had stated, in September 1872, that Ames had offered him stock, but he had repeatedly refused it. Testifying before the committee in January, Ames alleged that he had offered Garfield ten shares of stock at par value, but that Garfield had never taken the shares, or paid for them. A year had passed, from 1867 to 1868, before Garfield had finally refused it. Garfield, appearing before the committee on January 14, 1873, confirmed much of this. Ames testified several weeks later that Garfield agreed to take the stock on credit, and that it was paid for by the company's huge dividends. The two men differed over a sum of some $300 that Garfield received and later paid back, with Garfield deeming it a loan and Ames a dividend.

Garfield's biographers were unwilling to exonerate him in Crédit Mobilier, with Allan Peskin writing, "Did Garfield lie? Not exactly. Did he tell the truth? Not completely. Was he corrupted? Not really. Even Garfield's enemies never claimed that his involvement ... influenced his behavior." Rutkow wrote that "Garfield's real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock and that he had also received a dividend of $329." Caldwell suggested that Garfield "...while he told the truth [before the committee], certainly failed to tell the whole truth, clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty." That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, "...had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post."

Another issue that caused Garfield trouble in his 1874 re-election bid was the so-called "<a href="Salary%20Grab%20Act">Salary Grab</a>" of 1873, which increased the compensation for members of Congress by 50 percent, retroactive to 1871. Garfield was responsible, as Appropriations Committee chairman, for shepherding the legislative appropriations bill through the House; during the debate in February 1873, Massachusetts Representative <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> offered the increase as an amendment, and despite Garfield's opposition, it passed the House and eventually became law. The law was very popular in the House, as almost half the members were <a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame ducks</a>, but the public was outraged, and many of Garfield's constituents blamed him, though he refused to accept the increase. In what was a bad year for Republicans, who lost control of the House for the first time since the Civil War, Garfield had his closest congressional election, winning with only 57 percent of the vote.

With the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875, Garfield lost his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee. The Democratic leadership in the House appointed Garfield as a Republican member of Ways and Means. With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide, and Blaine elected to the Senate, Garfield was seen as the Republican <a href="floor%20leader">floor leader</a> and the likely Speaker should the party regain control of the chamber.

As the 1876 presidential election approached, Garfield was loyal to the candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the <a href="1876%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1876 Republican National Convention</a> in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six ballots, that Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor. Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time to the practice of law, but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October. Any celebration was short lived, as Garfield's youngest son, Neddie, fell ill with <a href="whooping%20cough">whooping cough</a> shortly after the congressional election, and soon died.
When Hayes appeared to have lost the presidential election the following month to Democrat <a href="Samuel%20Tilden">Samuel Tilden</a>, the Republicans launched efforts to reverse the result in Southern states where they held the governorship: South Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida. If Hayes won all three states, he would take the election by a single electoral vote. Grant asked Garfield to serve as a "neutral observer" in the recount in Louisiana. The observers soon recommended to the state electoral commissions that Hayes be declared the winner—Garfield recommended that the entire vote of <a href="West%20Feliciana%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">West Feliciana Parish</a>, which had given Tilden a sizable majority, be thrown out. The Republican governors of the three states certified that Hayes had won their states, to the outrage of Democrats, who had the state legislatures submit rival returns, and threatened to prevent the counting of the electoral vote—under the Constitution, Congress is the final arbiter of the election. Congress then passed a bill establishing the <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral Commission</a>, to determine the winner. Although he opposed the Commission, feeling that Congress should count the vote and proclaim Hayes victorious, Garfield was appointed to it over the objections of Democrats that he was too partisan. Hayes emerged the victor by a Commission vote of 8 to 7, with all eight votes being cast by Republican politicians or appointees of that party to the Supreme Court. As part of the deal whereby they recognized Hayes as president, Southern Democrats secured the removal of federal troops from the South, ending Reconstruction.

Although a Senate seat would be disposed of by the <a href="Ohio%20General%20Assembly">Ohio General Assembly</a> after the resignation of <a href="John%20Sherman%20%28Ohio%29">John Sherman</a> to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise to protect him from the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the <a href="Bland-Allison%20Act">Bland-Allison Act</a>, to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender <a href="Morgan%20dollar">dollar coins</a>, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.

Garfield during this time purchased the property in <a href="Mentor%2C%20Ohio">Mentor</a> that reporters later dubbed <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield%20National%20Historic%20Site">Lawnfield</a>, and from which he would conduct the first successful <a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a> for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as senator, and devoted his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly, with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent, <a href="Allen%20G.%20Thurman">Allen G. Thurman</a>. The Republicans swept the legislative elections. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. Garfield was elected to the Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880, though his term was not to begin until March 4, 1881.

Garfield was one of three attorneys who argued for the petitioners in the landmark Supreme Court case "<a href="Ex%20parte%20Milligan">Ex parte Milligan</a>" in 1866. His clients were pro-Confederate northern men who had been found guilty and sentenced to death by a military court for treasonous activities. The case turned on whether the defendants should instead have been tried by a civilian court, and resulted in a ruling that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals while the civil courts were operating. The oral argument was Garfield's first court appearance. <a href="Jeremiah%20Black">Jeremiah Black</a> had taken him in as a junior partner a year before, and assigned the case to him in light of his highly regarded oratory skills. With the result, Garfield instantly achieved a reputation as a preeminent appellate lawyer.

During Grant's first term, discontented with public service, Garfield pursued opportunities in the law, but declined a partnership offer when told his prospective partner was of "intemperate and licentious" reputation. In 1873, after the death of Chase, Garfield appealed to Grant to appoint Justice <a href="Noah%20H.%20Swayne">Noah H. Swayne</a> as Chief Justice. Grant, however, appointed <a href="Morrison%20R.%20Waite">Morrison R. Waite</a>.

Garfield thought the <a href="Public%20Land%20Survey%20System%23Railroad%20land%20grants">land grants</a> given to expanding railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, as well as the power sought by workers' unions. Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the <a href="United%20States%20civil%20service">United States civil service</a> as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in exchange for their positions, were forced to <a href="Kickback%20%28bribery%29">kick back</a> a percentage of their wages as political contributions.

In 1876, Garfield displayed his mathematical talent when he developed a trapezoid proof of the <a href="Pythagorean%20theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>. His finding was placed in the "New England Journal of Education". Mathematics historian <a href="William%20Dunham%20%28mathematician%29">William Dunham</a> wrote that Garfield's trapezoid work was "really a very clever proof."

Having just been elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 campaign season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including <a href="Wharton%20Barker">Wharton Barker</a> of Philadelphia, thought Garfield the best choice for the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former President Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.

As the convention began, Senator <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a> of New York, the floor leader for the Grant forces (known as the <a href="Stalwart%20%28politics%29">Stalwart</a> faction), proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election. When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound, Conkling sought to expel them from the convention. Garfield rose to defend the men, giving a passionate speech in defense of their right to reserve judgment. The crowd turned against Conkling, and he withdrew the motion. The performance delighted Garfield's boosters, who now believed more than ever that he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates' votes.

After speeches in favor of the other front-runners, Garfield rose to place Sherman's name in nomination; his nominating speech was well-received, but the delegates mustered little excitement for the idea of Sherman as the next president. The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third. Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces, with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination. <a href="Jeremiah%20McLain%20Rusk">Jeremiah McLain Rusk</a>, a member of the Wisconsin delegation, and <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, an Indiana delegate, sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti-Grant votes to a <a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a> candidate—Garfield. Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot, and the stampede began. Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman, but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him. In the next round of voting, nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield, giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination. Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end, creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party. To obtain that faction's support for the ticket, former <a href="Collector%20of%20the%20Port%20of%20New%20York">New York customs collector</a> <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, a member of Conkling's <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a>, was chosen as the vice presidential nominee.

Despite including a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried over from the convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a> of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>, while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.

Practical differences between the candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of <a href="waving%20the%20bloody%20shirt">waving the bloody shirt</a>: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if Democrats held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters. With a few months to go before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the <a href="tariff">tariff</a>. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, "The tariff question is a local question." The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes, of the more than 9.2 million popular votes cast, separated the two candidates, but in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.

Between his election and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State. Blaine was not only the president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated <a href="William%20Windom">William Windom</a> of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, <a href="William%20H.%20Hunt">William H. Hunt</a> of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, <a href="Robert%20Todd%20Lincoln">Robert Todd Lincoln</a> as Secretary of War, and <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Kirkwood">Samuel J. Kirkwood</a> of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by <a href="Thomas%20Lemuel%20James">Thomas Lemuel James</a> as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's <a href="Wayne%20MacVeagh">Wayne MacVeagh</a>, an adversary of Blaine's, as <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a>. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, <a href="William%20E.%20Chandler">William E. Chandler</a>, as <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">Solicitor General</a> under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.

Distracted by cabinet maneuvering, Garfield's inaugural address was not up to his typical oratorical standards. In one high point, Garfield emphasized the civil rights of <a href="African-Americans">African-Americans</a>, saying "Freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen." After discussing the gold standard, the need for education, and an unexpected denunciation of <a href="Mormon%20polygamy">Mormon polygamy</a>, the speech ended. The crowd applauded, but the speech, according to Peskin, "however sincerely intended, betrayed its hasty composition by the flatness of its tone and the conventionality of its subject matter."

Garfield's appointment of James infuriated Conkling, a factional opponent of the Postmaster General, who demanded a compensatory appointment for his faction, such as the position of Secretary of the Treasury. The resulting squabble occupied much of Garfield's brief presidency. The feud with Conkling reached a climax when the president, at Blaine's instigation, nominated Conkling's enemy, Judge <a href="William%20H.%20Robertson">William H. Robertson</a>, to be Collector of the Port of New York. This was one of the prize patronage positions below cabinet level, and was then held by <a href="Edwin%20Atkins%20Merritt">Edwin A. Merritt</a>. Conkling raised the time-honored principle of <a href="senatorial%20courtesy">senatorial courtesy</a> in an attempt to defeat the nomination, to no avail. Garfield, who believed the practice was corrupt, would not back down and threatened to withdraw all nominations unless Robertson was confirmed, intending to "settle the question whether the president is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States." Ultimately, Conkling and his New York colleague, Senator <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas C. Platt</a>, resigned their Senate seats to seek vindication, but found only further humiliation when the New York legislature elected others in their places. Robertson was confirmed as Collector and Garfield's victory was clear. To Blaine's chagrin, the victorious Garfield returned to his goal of balancing the interests of party factions, and nominated a number of Conkling's Stalwart friends to offices.

In 1880, President Hayes had nominated <a href="Stanley%20Matthews%20%28Supreme%20Court%20justice%29">Stanley Matthews</a> to the Supreme Court of the United States. The U.S. Senate declined to act on the Matthews nomination. In March 1881, Garfield re-nominated Matthews to the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed Matthews to the high Court by a vote of 24-23. According to "The New York Times", "opposition to Matthews's Supreme Court appointment...stemmed from his prosecution in 1859 of a newspaper editor who had assisted two runaway slaves." Because Matthews was "a professed abolitionist at the time, the case was later framed as political expediency triumphing over moral principle." Matthews served on the Court until his death in 1889.

Grant and Hayes had both advocated civil service reform, and by 1881, civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation. Garfield sympathized with them, believing that the <a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a> damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns. Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends, but many remained loyal and supported Garfield.

Corruption in the post office also cried out for reform. In April 1880, there had been a congressional investigation into corruption in the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">Post Office Department</a>, in which profiteering rings allegedly stole millions of dollars, securing bogus mail contracts on <a href="star%20routes">star routes</a>. After obtaining contracts with the lowest bid, costs to run the mail routes would be escalated and profits would be divided among ring members. That year, Hayes stopped the implementation of any new star route contracts. Shortly after taking office, Garfield received information from Attorney General MacVeagh and Postmaster General James of postal corruption by an alleged star route ringleader, Second Assistant Postmaster-General <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Brady">Thomas J. Brady</a>. Garfield demanded Brady's resignation and ordered prosecutions that would end in trials for conspiracy. When told that his party, including his own campaign manager, <a href="Stephen%20W.%20Dorsey">Stephen W. Dorsey</a>, was involved, Garfield directed MacVeagh and James to root out the corruption in the Post Office Department "to the bone", regardless of where it might lead. Brady resigned and was eventually indicted for conspiracy. After two "star route" ring trials in 1882 and 1883, the jury found Brady not guilty.

Garfield believed that the key to improving the state of African American civil rights would be found in education aided by the federal government. During Reconstruction, <a href="freedman">freedmen</a> had gained citizenship and suffrage that enabled them to participate in government, but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy, and was concerned that blacks would become America's permanent "<a href="peasantry">peasantry</a>." He answered by proposing a "universal" education system funded by the federal government. Congress and the northern white public, however, had lost interest in African-American rights, and federal funding for universal education did not find support in Congress during Garfield's term. Garfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions: <a href="Frederick%20Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a>, recorder of deeds in Washington; <a href="Robert%20B.%20Elliott">Robert Elliot</a>, special agent to the Treasury; <a href="John%20M.%20Langston">John M. Langston</a>, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>an minister; and <a href="Blanche%20Bruce">Blanche K. Bruce</a>, register to the Treasury. Garfield believed that Southern support for the Republican party could be gained by "commercial and industrial" interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes's policy of conciliating Southern Democrats. He appointed <a href="William%20H.%20Hunt">William H. Hunt</a>, a <a href="carpetbagger">carpetbagger</a> Republican from Louisiana, as Secretary of the Navy. To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South, Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator <a href="William%20Mahone">William Mahone</a> of the biracial independent <a href="Readjuster%20Party">Readjuster Party</a>, hoping to add the independents' strength to the Republicans' there.

Entering the presidency, Garfield had little foreign policy experience, so he leaned heavily on Blaine. Blaine, a former <a href="Protectionism">protectionist</a>, now agreed with Garfield on the need to promote freer trade, especially within the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>. Their reasons were twofold: firstly, Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> would be the best way to keep Great Britain from dominating the region. Secondly, by encouraging exports, they believed they could increase American prosperity. Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan-American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade. At the same time, they hoped to negotiate a peace in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> then being fought by <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, and <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory, but Chile, which by 1881 had occupied the Peruvian capital, <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, rejected any settlement that restored the previous "status quo". Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas, calling for renegotiation of the <a href="Clayton-Bulwer%20Treaty">Clayton-Bulwer Treaty</a> to allow the United States to construct <a href="Panama%20Canal">a canal through Panama</a> without British involvement, as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>. Garfield's and Blaine's plans for the United States' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere, as he sought commercial treaties with <a href="Joseon%20Dynasty">Korea</a> and <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">Madagascar</a>. Garfield also considered enhancing the United States' military strength abroad, asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization. In the end, these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated. Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan-American conference, but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur, Garfield's successor, cancelled the conference. Naval reform continued under Arthur, if on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned, ultimately ending in the construction of the <a href="Squadron%20of%20Evolution">Squadron of Evolution</a>.

Garfield was shot by <a href="Charles%20J.%20Guiteau">Charles J. Guiteau</a>, a disgruntled office seeker, at the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Potomac%20Railroad%20Station">Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station</a> in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. After eleven weeks of intensive and other care Garfield died in <a href="Elberon%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elberon, New Jersey</a>, the second of four presidents to be assassinated, following Abraham Lincoln. 

Guiteau had followed various professions in his life, but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected would be the winning Republican ticket. He composed a speech, "Garfield vs. Hancock", and got it printed by the Republican National Committee. One means of persuading the voters in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate's merits, but with the Republicans seeking more famous men, Guiteau received few opportunities to speak. On one occasion, according to Kenneth D. Ackerman in his book about Garfield's candidacy and assassination, Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves. Guiteau, who considered himself a <a href="Stalwart%20%28politics%29">Stalwart</a>, deemed his contribution to Garfield's victory sufficient to justify the position of consul in Paris, despite the fact he spoke no French, nor any foreign language. Guiteau has since been described by one medical expert as possibly being a narcissistic schizophrenic; neuroscientist <a href="Kent%20Kiehl">Kent Kiehl</a> assessed him as being a clinical psychopath.

One of President Garfield's more wearying duties was seeing office seekers, and he saw Guiteau at least once. White House officials suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine, as the consulship was within the Department of State. Blaine also saw the public regularly, and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions. Blaine, who had no intention of giving Guiteau a position he was unqualified for and had not earned, simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship, which required Senate confirmation. Once the New York senators had resigned, and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector, Guiteau pressed his claim, and Blaine told him he would not receive the position.

Guiteau came to believe he had lost the position because he was a Stalwart. The office-seeker decided that the only way to end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die—though he had nothing personal against the president. Arthur's succession would restore peace, he felt, and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts, including Guiteau.

The <a href="assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a> was deemed a fluke due to the Civil War, and Garfield, like most people, saw no reason why the president should be guarded; Garfield's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers. Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for a cooler climate on July 2, and made plans to kill him before then. He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum, and followed Garfield several times, but each time his plans were frustrated, or he lost his nerve. His opportunities dwindled to one—Garfield's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2, 1881.

Guiteau concealed himself by the ladies' waiting room at the Sixth Street Station of the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Potomac%20Railroad">Baltimore and Potomac Railroad</a>, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him at least part of the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30 a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.

Garfield was struck by two shots; one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back, shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen. "My God, what is this?" he exclaimed. Guiteau, as he was led away, stated, "I did it. I will go to jail for it. I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be President."

Among those at the station was <a href="Robert%20Todd%20Lincoln">Robert Todd Lincoln</a>, whose <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">father was killed</a> sixteen years earlier by an assassin. Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him, probing the wound with unwashed fingers. At his request, Garfield was taken back to the White House, and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for. Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau's statements.

Although <a href="Joseph%20Lister%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lister">Joseph Lister</a>'s pioneering work in antisepsis was known to American doctors, with Lister himself having visited America in 1876, few of them had confidence in it, and none of his advocates were among Garfield's treating physicians. The physician who took charge at the depot and then at the White House was <a href="Doctor%20Willard%20Bliss">Doctor Willard Bliss</a>. A noted physician and surgeon, Bliss was an old friend of Garfield, and about a dozen doctors, led by Bliss, were soon probing the wound with unsterilized fingers and instruments. Garfield was given morphine for the pain, and asked Bliss to frankly tell him his chances, which Bliss put at one in a hundred. "Well, Doctor, we'll take that chance."

Over the next few days, Garfield made some improvement, as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed. Although he never stood again, he was able to sit up and write several times, and his recovery was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence. He was nourished on oatmeal <a href="porridge">porridge</a> (which he detested) and milk from a cow on the White House lawn. When told that Indian chief <a href="Sitting%20Bull">Sitting Bull</a>, a prisoner of the army, was starving, Garfield said, "Let him starve," then, "Oh, no, send him my oatmeal." X-radiation (or <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>) usage, which likely would have helped the president's physicians determine exactly where the bullet was lodged in his body, would not be invented for another fourteen years. <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector; he was not successful. One means of keeping the president comfortable in Washington's summer heat was one of the first successful <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a> units: air that was propelled by fans over ice and then dried had reduced the temperature in the sickroom by 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).

Beginning on July 23, Garfield took a turn for the worse. His temperature increased to ; doctors, concerned by an <a href="abscess">abscess</a> that had developed by the wound, operated and inserted a drainage tube. This initially seemed to help, and Garfield, in his bed, was able to hold a brief cabinet meeting on July 29, though members were under orders from Bliss to discuss nothing that might excite Garfield. Doctors probed the abscess, which went into Garfield's body, hoping to find the bullet; they most likely only made the infections worse. Garfield performed only one state act in August, signing an extradition paper. By the end of the month, the president was much more feeble than he had been, and his weight had decreased to .

Garfield had long been anxious to escape hot, unhealthy Washington, and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to <a href="Elberon%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elberon</a>, part of <a href="Long%20Branch%2C%20New%20Jersey">Long Branch, New Jersey</a>, where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer. He left the White House for the last time on September 5, traveling in a specially cushioned railway car; a spur line to the <a href="Charles%20G.%20Francklyn">Francklyn Cottage</a>, a seaside mansion given over to his use, was built in a night by volunteers. There, Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became (after an initial rally) a death watch. Garfield's personal secretary, <a href="Joe%20Stanley%20Brown">Joe Stanley Brown</a>, wrote 40 years later, "to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore, the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside, without recalling again that ghastly tragedy."

On September 18, Garfield asked A. F. Rockwell, a friend, if he would have a place in history. Rockwell assured him he would, and told Garfield he had much work still before him. But his response was, "No, my work is done." The following day, Garfield, by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains, marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well, and went to sleep without discomfort. He awoke that evening around 10:15 p.m. with great pain in his chest. The attendant watching him sent for Bliss, who found him unconscious. Despite efforts to revive him, Garfield never awoke, and died at 10:35 p.m. that evening. Learning from a reporter of Garfield's death, <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Arthur</a> took the presidential oath of office administered by New York Supreme Court Justice <a href="John%20R.%20Brady">John R. Brady</a>. 

According to some historians and medical experts, Garfield might have survived his wounds had the doctors attending him had at their disposal today's medical research, knowledge, techniques, and equipment. Standard medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating the path of the bullet. Several of his doctors inserted their <a href="Asepsis">unsterilized</a> fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, a common practice in the 1880s. Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield's demise. Biographer Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation. Rutkow, a professor of surgery at the <a href="University%20of%20Medicine%20and%20Dentistry%20of%20New%20Jersey">University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey</a>, has argued that starvation also played a role. Rutkow suggests that "Garfield had such a nonlethal wound. In today's world, he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days."

Guiteau was indicted on October 14, 1881, for the murder of the president. In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often interrupted and argued, and in which his counsel used the <a href="insanity%20defense">insanity defense</a>, the jury found him guilty on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had <a href="neurosyphilis">neurosyphilis</a>, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.

Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that brought him there, traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body <a href="lying%20in%20state">lay in state</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20rotunda">United States Capitol rotunda</a>; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to the entire population of that city—likewise paid their respects. His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's <a href="Lake%20View%20Cemetery">Lake View Cemetery</a> until his permanent memorial was built.
Memorials to Garfield were erected across the country. On April 10, 1882, seven months after Garfield's death, the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp in his honor, the second stamp issued by the U.S. to honor an assassinated president. In 1884, sculptor <a href="Frank%20Happersberger">Frank Happersberger</a> completed a monument on the grounds of the <a href="Conservatory%20of%20Flowers">San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers</a>. In 1887, the <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield%20Monument">James A. Garfield Monument</a> was dedicated in Washington. <a href="James%20Garfield%20Memorial%2C%20Philadelphia">Another monument</a>, in Philadelphia's <a href="Fairmount%20Park">Fairmount Park</a>, was erected in 1896. In <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria, Australia</a>, <a href="Garfield%2C%20Victoria">Cannibal Creek</a> was renamed Garfield in his honor.

On May 19, 1890, Garfield's body was permanently interred, with great solemnity and fanfare, in a <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland. Attending the dedication ceremonies were former President Hayes, President Benjamin Harrison, and future president <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. Garfield's Treasury Secretary, William Windom, also attended. Harrison said that Garfield was always a "student and instructor" and that his life works and death would "...continue to be instructive and inspiring incidents in American history." Three panels on the monument display Garfield as a teacher, Union major general, and <a href="orator">orator</a>; another shows him taking the presidential oath, and a fifth shows his body lying in state at the Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C.

Garfield's murder by a deranged office-seeker awakened public awareness of the need for civil service reform legislation. Senator <a href="George%20H.%20Pendleton">George H. Pendleton</a>, a Democrat from Ohio, launched a reform effort that resulted in the <a href="Pendleton%20Act">Pendleton Act</a> in January 1883. This act reversed the "spoils system" where office seekers paid up or gave political service to obtain or keep federally appointed positions. Under the act, appointments were awarded on merit and competitive examination. To ensure the reform was implemented, Congress and Arthur established and funded the <a href="Civil%20Service%20Commission">Civil Service Commission</a>. The Pendleton Act, however, covered only 10% of federal government workers. For Arthur, previously known for having been a "veteran spoilsman," civil service reform became his most noteworthy achievement.

A <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield%20%28Niehaus%29">marble statue of Garfield</a> by <a href="Charles%20Niehaus">Charles Niehaus</a> was added to the <a href="National%20Statuary%20Hall%20Collection">National Statuary Hall Collection</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">Capitol</a> in <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>, a gift from the State of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> in 1886. 

On March 2, 2019, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> erected exhibit panels in Washington to mark the site of the assassination.

For a few years after his assassination, Garfield's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story—that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States. Peskin noted that, "In mourning Garfield, Americans were not only honoring a president; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations." As the rivalry between Stalwarts and <a href="Half-Breeds%20%28politics%29">Half-Breeds</a> faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after, so too did memories of Garfield. Beginning in 1882, the year after Garfield's death, the U.S. Post Office began issuing postage stamps honoring the late president. Despite his short term as president, nine different issues were printed over the years. In the 1890s, Americans became disillusioned with politicians, and looked elsewhere for inspiration, focusing on industrialists, labor leaders, scientists, and others as their heroes. Increasingly, Garfield's short time as president was forgotten.

The 20th century saw no revival for Garfield. <a href="Thomas%20Wolfe">Thomas Wolfe</a> deemed the presidents of the <a href="Gilded%20Age">Gilded Age</a>, including Garfield, "lost Americans" whose "gravely vacant and bewhiskered faces mixed, melted, swam together." The politicians of the Gilded Age faded from the public eye, their luster eclipsed by those who had influenced America outside of political office during that time: the <a href="Robber%20baron%20%28industrialist%29">robber barons</a>, the inventors, those who had sought social reform, and others who had lived as America rapidly changed. Current events and more recent figures occupied America's attention: according to Ackerman, "the busy Twentieth Century has made Garfield's era seem remote and irrelevant, its leaders ridiculed for their very obscurity."

Garfield's biographers, and those who have studied his presidency, tend to think well of him, and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end. Historian <a href="Justus%20D.%20Doenecke">Justus D. Doenecke</a>, while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma, chronicles his achievements, "by winning a victory over the Stalwarts, he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office. As a man, he was intelligent, sensitive, and alert, and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched." Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson's favor, and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter's confirmation. According to Caldwell, writing in 1931, "If Garfield lives in history, it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality—but also because in life and in death, he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation. Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more." Rutkow writes, "James Abram Garfield's presidency is reduced to a tantalizing 'what if.

Peskin believes Garfield deserves more credit for his political career than he has received:

Jean Baptiste Point du Sable

Jean Baptiste Point du Sable (also spelled "Point de Sable", "Point au Sable", "Point Sable", "Pointe DuSable"; before 1750 – August 28, 1818) is regarded as the first permanent non-Indigenous settler of what later became <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Illinois, and is recognized as the "Founder of Chicago". A <a href="DuSable%20High%20School">school</a>, <a href="DuSable%20Museum%20of%20African%20American%20History">museum</a>, <a href="Chicago%20Harbor">harbor</a>, <a href="DuSable%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">park</a>, and <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20Bridge">bridge</a> have been named in his honor. The site where he settled near the mouth of the <a href="Chicago%20River">Chicago River</a> around the 1780s <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Point%20Du%20Sable%20Homesite">is identified</a> as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, now located in <a href="Pioneer%20Court">Pioneer Court</a>.

Point du Sable was of African descent but little else is known of his life prior to the 1770s. During his career, the areas where he settled and traded around the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and in the <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a> changed hands several times among France, Britain, Spain and the new United States. Described as handsome and well educated, Point duSable married a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> woman, Kitiwaha, and they had two children. In 1779, during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, he was arrested by the British military on suspicion of being an American sympathizer. In the early 1780s he worked for the British lieutenant-governor of <a href="Michilimackinac">Michilimackinac</a> on an estate at what is now the city of <a href="St.%20Clair%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair, Michigan</a>. 

Point du Sable is first recorded as living at the mouth of the Chicago River in a trader's journal of early 1790. He established an extensive and prosperous trading settlement in what later became the city of Chicago. He sold his Chicago River property in 1800 and moved to <a href="St.%20Charles%2C%20Missouri">St. Charles</a>, now in Missouri, where he was licensed to run a <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> ferry. Point duSable's successful role in developing the Chicago River settlement was little recognized until the mid-20th century.

There are no records of Point du Sable's life prior to the 1770s. Though it is known from sources during his life that he was of African descent, his birth year, place of birth, and parents are unknown. <a href="Juliette%20Augusta%20Magill%20Kinzie">Juliette Kinzie</a>, another early pioneer of <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago</a>, never met Point duSable but stated in her 1856 memoir that he was "a native of St.Domingo" (the island of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>). This became generally accepted as his place of birth. Historian <a href="Milo%20Milton%20Quaife">Milo Milton Quaife</a> regarded Kinzie's account of Point duSable as "largely fictitious and wholly unauthenticated", later putting forward a theory that he was of African and French-Canadian origin. A <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a> published in 1953 helped to popularize the commonly recited claim that he was born in 1745 in <a href="Saint-Marc">Saint-Marc</a> in <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a> (<a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>). If he was born outside continental North America, there are further competing accounts that he entered as a trader from the north through <a href="Canada%20%28New%20France%29">French Canada</a>, or from the south through <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">French Louisiana</a>.

Point du Sable married a <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a> woman named Kitihawa (Christianized to Catherine) on October27, 1788, in a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> ceremony in <a href="Cahokia%2C%20Illinois">Cahokia</a>, an old French <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a> town on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, though it is likely they were married in the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> tradition in the 1770s. They had a son named Jean and a daughter named Susanne. Point duSable supported his family as a frontier trader and settler during a period when Great Britain, and later the newly formed United States, were seeking to assert control in the former southern dependencies of French Canada and in the Illinois Country.

In a footnote to a poem titled "Speech to the Western Indians", <a href="Arent%20DePeyster">Arent DePeyster</a>, British commandant from 1774 to 1779 at <a href="Fort%20Michilimackinac">Fort Michilimackinac</a> (a former French fort in what was then the <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%9391%29">British Quebec territory</a>), noted that "Baptist Point deSaible" was "a handsome negro", "well educated", and "settled in Eschecagou". When he published this poem in 1813, DePeyster presented it as a speech that he had made at the village of Abercroche (now <a href="Harbor%20Springs%2C%20Michigan">Harbor Springs, Michigan</a>) on July4, 1779. This footnote has led many scholars to assume that Point duSable had settled in Chicago by 1779; but letters written by traders in the late 1770s suggest that Point duSable was at this time settled at the mouth of <a href="Trail%20Creek%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">Trail Creek</a> ("Rivière duChemin") at what is now <a href="Michigan%20City%2C%20Indiana">Michigan City, Indiana</a>. In August 1779, during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Point duSable was arrested as a suspected partisan at Trail Creek by British troops and imprisoned briefly at Fort Michilimackinac. An officer's report following his arrest noted that Point du Sable had many friends who vouched for his good character. The following year, he was ordered transported to the Pinery. From the summer of 1780 until May 1784, Point duSable managed the Pinery, a tract of woodlands claimed by a British officer, Lt.<a href="Patrick%20Sinclair">Patrick Sinclair</a>, on the <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair River</a> in eastern Michigan. Point duSable and his family lived in a cabin at the mouth of the Pine River in what is now the city of <a href="St.%20Clair%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair</a>.

Point du Sable settled on the north bank of the <a href="Chicago%20River">Chicago River</a> close to its mouth at some time in the 1780s. The earliest known record of Point duSable living in Chicago is an entry that Hugh Heward made in his journal on May10, 1790, during a journey from Detroit across Michigan and through Illinois. Heward's party stopped at Point duSable's house enroute to the <a href="Chicago%20portage">Chicago portage</a>; they swapped their canoe for a <a href="pirogue">pirogue</a> that belonged to Point duSable, and they bought bread, flour, and pork from him. Perrish Grignon, who visited Chicago in about 1794, described Point duSable as a large man and wealthy trader. Point du Sable's granddaughter, Eulalie Pelletier, was born at his Chicago River settlement in 1796. In 1800 Point duSable sold his farm to <a href="John%20Kinzie">John Kinzie</a>'s frontman, <a href="Jean%20La%20Lime">Jean La Lime</a>, for 6,000 <a href="livres">livres</a>. The bill of sale, which was rediscovered in 1913 in an archive in Detroit, outlined all of the property Point duSable owned as well as many of his personal effects. This included a house, two barns, a horse drawn mill, a bakehouse, a poultry house, a dairy, and a <a href="smoking%20%28food%29">smokehouse</a>. The house was a log cabin filled with fine furniture and paintings.

After Point du Sable sold his property in Chicago, he moved to <a href="St.%20Charles%2C%20Missouri">St. Charles</a>, now in <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> but at that time in <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20Spain%29">Spanish Louisiana</a>, where he was commissioned by the <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Louisiana">colonial governor</a> to operate a <a href="ferry">ferry</a> across the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a>. In St.Charles, he may have lived for a time with his son, and later with his granddaughter's family, and late in life, he may have sought public or charitable assistance. He died in 1818 and was buried in an unmarked grave in St.Charles Borromeo Cemetery. His entry in the parish burial register does not mention his origins, parents, or relatives; it simply describes him as "negre" (French for "negro"). 

The St.Charles Borromeo Cemetery was moved twice in the 19thcentury, and oral tradition and records of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20St.%20Louis">Archdiocese of St. Louis</a> suggested that Point duSable's remains were also moved. On October12, 1968, the Illinois Sesquicentennial Commission erected a granite marker at the site believed to be Point duSable's grave in the third St.Charles Borromeo Cemetery. In 2002 an archaeological investigation of the grave site was initiated by the African Scientific Research Institute at the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Chicago">University of Illinois at Chicago</a>. Researchers using a combination of ground-penetrating radar, surveys, and excavation of a area did not find any evidence of any burials at the supposed grave site, leading the archaeologists to conclude that Point duSable's remains may not have been moved from one of the two previous cemeteries.

Though there is little historical evidence regarding Point duSable's life before the 1770s, there are several theories and legends that give accounts of his early life. Writing in 1933, Quaife identified a French immigrant to Canada, Pierre Dandonneau, who acquired the title "Sieur deSable" and whose descendants were known by both the names "Dandonneau" and "DuSable". Quaife was unable to find a direct link to Point duSable, but he identified descendants of Pierre Dandonneau living around the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region">Great Lakes region</a> in Detroit, Mackinac, and St.Joseph, leading him to speculate that Point duSable's father was a member of this family, while his mother was a slave. In 1951 Joseph Jeremie, a native of Haiti, published a pamphlet in which he said he was the great grandson of Point duSable. Based on family recollections and tombstone inscriptions he claimed that Point duSable was born in Saint-Marc in Haiti, studied in France, and returned to Haiti to deal in coffee before traveling to French Louisiana. Historian and Point duSable biographer John F. Swenson has called these claims "elaborate, undocumented assertions... in a fanciful biography". In 1953 Shirley Graham built on the work of Quaife and Jeremie in a historical novel about Point duSable that she described as "not accurate history nor pure fiction", but rather "an imaginative interpretation of all the known facts". This book presented Point duSable as the son of the <a href="Chief%20Mate">mate</a> on a pirate ship, the "Black Sea Gull", and a freed slave called Suzanne. Despite lack of evidence and the continued debate about Point duSable's early life, parentage, and birthplace, this popular story is widely presented as being definitive.

In 1815 a land claim that had been submitted by Nicholas Jarrot to the land commissioners at <a href="Kaskaskia%2C%20Illinois">Kaskaskia</a>, <a href="Illinois%20Territory">Illinois Territory</a>, was approved. In the claim Jarrot asserted that a "Jean Baptiste Poinstable" had been "head of a family at Peoria in the year 1783, and before and after that year", and that he "had a house built and cultivated land between the Old Fort and the new settlement in the year 1780". This document has been taken by Quaife and other historians as evidence that Point duSable lived at <a href="Peoria%2C%20Illinois">Peoria</a> on the <a href="Illinois%20River">Illinois River</a> prior to going upriver to Chicago. Other records demonstrate that Point duSable was living and working under the British at the Pinery in Michigan in the early 1780s. The Kaskaskia land commissioners identified many fraudulent land claims, including two previously submitted in the name of Point duSable. Nicholas Jarrot, the claimant, was involved in many false claims, and Swenson suggests that this one was also fraudulent, made without the knowledge of Point duSable. Although perhaps in conflict with some of the above information, some historical records suggest that Point duSable bought land in Peoria from J.B. Maillet on March13, 1773, and sold it to Isaac Darneille in 1783 before he became the first "permanent" resident of Chicago.

Point du Sable left Chicago in 1800. He sold his property to <a href="Jean%20La%20Lime">Jean La Lime</a>, a trader from <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, and moved to the Missouri River valley, at that time part of Spanish Louisiana. The reason for his departure is unknown. By 1804, John Kinzie, who also settled in Chicago, had bought the former du Sable house. In her 1852 memoir, Juliette Kinzie, Kinzie's daughter-in-law, suggested that "perhaps he was disgusted at not being elected to a similar dignity [great chief] by the Pottowattamies". In 1874 Nehemiah Matson elaborated on this story, claiming that Point duSable was a slave from Virginia who had moved with his master to <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, in 1790. According to Matson, Point duSable became a zealous Catholic to convince a Jesuit missionary to declare him chief of the local Native Americans, and left Chicago when the natives refused to accept him as their chief. Quaife dismisses both of these stories as being fictional.

In her 1953 novel Graham suggests that Point du Sable left Chicago because he was angered with the United States government, which wanted him to buy the land on which he had lived and called his own for the previous two decades. The 1795 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Greenville">Treaty of Greenville</a>, which ended the <a href="Northwest%20Indian%20War">Northwest Indian War</a>, and the subsequent westward migration of Native Americans away from the Chicago area might also have influenced his decision.

The French came to the North American mid-continent region in the 17thcentury. <a href="Louis%20Jolliet">Louis Jolliet</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Marquette">Jacques Marquette</a>, during their 1673 Mississippi Valley expedition, though probably not the first Europeans to visit the area, are the first in the written record to have crossed the <a href="Chicago%20Portage">Chicago Portage</a> and traveled along the Chicago River. Over the following years visits continued, and occasional intermittent posts were established, including those by <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Robert%20Cavelier%2C%20Sieur%20de%20La%20Salle">René LaSalle</a>, <a href="Henri%20de%20Tonti">Henri Tonti</a>, Pierre Liette and the four-year <a href="Mission%20of%20the%20Guardian%20Angel">Mission of the Guardian Angel</a>. Point duSable 1780s establishment is recognized as the first settlement that continued on and ultimately grew to become the city of Chicago. He is therefore widely regarded as the first permanent resident of Chicago and has been given the appellation "Founder of Chicago".

By the 1850s, historians of Chicago recognized Point duSable as the city's earliest non-native permanent settler. For a long time the city did not honor him in the same manner as other pioneers. Point du Sable was generally forgotten in the 19thcentury and instead the Scots-Irish trader John Kinzie, who had bought his property, was often credited for the settlement. A plaque was erected by the city in 1913 at the corner of Kinzie and Pine Streets to commemorate the Kinzie homestead. In the planning stages of the 1933–1934 <a href="Century%20of%20Progress%20International%20Exposition">Century of Progress International Exposition</a>, several African-American groups campaigned for Point duSable to be honored at the fair. At the time, few Chicagoans had even heard of Point duSable, and the fair's organizers presented the 1803 construction of <a href="Fort%20Dearborn">Fort Dearborn</a> as the city's historical beginning. The campaign was successful, and a replica of Point duSable's cabin was presented as part of the "background of the history of Chicago".

In 1965 a plaza called <a href="Pioneer%20Court">Pioneer Court</a> was built on the site of Point duSable's homestead as part of the construction of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of America building. The <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Point%20Du%20Sable%20Homesite">Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite</a> was designated as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> on May11, 1976, as a site deemed to have "exceptional value to the nation". Pioneer Court is located at what is now 401N.<a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan Avenue</a> in the <a href="Michigan%E2%80%93Wacker%20Historic%20District">Michigan–Wacker Historic District</a>. At this site in 2009 the City of Chicago and a private donor erected a large bronze bust of Point duSable by Chicago-born sculptor Erik Blome. In October 2010 the <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20Bridge">Michigan Avenue Bridge</a> was renamed "DuSable Bridge" in honor of Point duSable. Previously, a small street named "DeSaible Street" had been named after him.

Several Chicago institutions have been named in honor of Point duSable. <a href="DuSable%20High%20School">DuSable High School</a> opened in <a href="Douglas%2C%20Chicago%23Bronzeville">Bronzeville</a> in 1934. The DuSable campus today houses the Daniel Hale Williams Prep School of Medicine, and the Bronzeville Scholastic Institute. Dr.<a href="Margaret%20Taylor-Burroughs">Margaret Taylor-Burroughs</a>, a prominent African-American artist and writer, taught at the school for twenty-three years. She and her husband co-founded the <a href="DuSable%20Museum%20of%20African%20American%20History">DuSable Museum of African American History</a>, located on <a href="Chicago%27s%20South%20Side">Chicago's South Side</a>, which was renamed in honor of Point duSable in 1968. DuSable Harbor is located in the heart of downtown Chicago at the foot of <a href="Randolph%20Street%20%28Chicago%29">Randolph Street</a>, and <a href="DuSable%20Park">DuSable Park</a> is a urban park in Chicago currently awaiting redevelopment. The project was originally announced in 1987 by Mayor <a href="Harold%20Washington">Harold Washington</a>. The <a href="US%20Postal%20Service">US Postal Service</a> has also honored Point duSable with the issue of a Black Heritage Series 22-cent postage stamp on February20, 1987.

1880 United States presidential election

The United States presidential election of 1880 was the 24th quadrennial <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election">presidential election</a>, held on Tuesday, November 2, 1880. The voter turnout rate was one of the highest in the nation's history.

Incumbent President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> did not seek re-election, keeping a promise made during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">1876 campaign</a>. After the longest convention in the party's history, the divided <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> chose another <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>an, Representative <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a>, as their standard-bearer. The <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> chose General <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> as their nominee. The dominance of the two major parties began to fray as an upstart left-wing party, the <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>, nominated another Civil War general for president, <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> Congressman <a href="James%20B.%20Weaver">James B. Weaver</a>. In a campaign fought mainly over issues of <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> loyalties, <a href="Tariffs%20in%20United%20States%20history">tariffs</a>, and <a href="History%20of%20Chinese%20Americans">Chinese immigration</a>, Garfield and Hancock each took just over 48 percent of the popular vote. Weaver and two other minor candidates, <a href="Neal%20Dow">Neal Dow</a> and <a href="John%20W.%20Phelps">John W. Phelps</a>, together made up the remaining percentage. The election of 1880 was the sixth consecutive presidential election won by the Republicans, the second longest winning streak in American history after the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican Party</a> during the period 1800–1824.

In the end, the popular vote totals of the two main candidates were separated by 1,898 votes, the smallest <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20presidential%20elections%20by%20popular%20vote%20margin">victory in the popular vote</a> ever recorded. In the electoral college, however, Garfield's victory was decisive; he won nearly all of the populous Northern states to achieve a majority of 214 electoral votes to 155 for Hancock. Hancock's sweep of the Southern states was not enough for victory, but it cemented <a href="Solid%20South">his party's dominance of the region for generations</a>. This is the first presidential election in which people in every state (at the time) were able to vote for president (In 1876, Colorado appointed electors by state legislature due to insufficient time to organize an election, in 1864–1872, some states skipped out due to the Civil War or Reconstruction, and before then some states used state legislature including South Carolina which used the system up through 1860).

Since before the Civil War, the two major parties were the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> and the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>, and after the end of the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a> in 1877, the national electorate was closely divided between them. Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious background, as well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters. Most Northern <a href="Protestantism">Protestants</a> voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern <a href="Catholicism">Catholics</a> generally voted Democratic.

<a href="Tariff">Tariff</a> reform and the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> also divided the country and the major parties. The monetary debate was over the basis for the value of the United States dollar. Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States until the Civil War, when the mounting costs of the war forced the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to issue "<a href="United%20States%20Notes">greenbacks</a>" (dollar bills backed by government bonds). Greenbacks helped pay for the war, but resulted in the most severe <a href="inflation">inflation</a> since the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. After the war, bondholders and other creditors (especially in the North) wanted to return to a gold standard. At the same time, debtors (often in the South and West) benefited from the way inflation reduced the real value of their debts, and workers and some businessmen liked the way inflation made for easy credit. The issue cut across parties, producing dissension among Republicans and Democrats alike and spawning a third party, the <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>, in 1876, when both major parties nominated "hard money" candidates (i.e., candidates who favored the gold-backed currency instead of "soft money" greenbacks that generated inflation). Monetary debate intensified as Congress effectively <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">demonetized silver in 1873</a> and began redeeming greenbacks in gold by 1879, while limiting their circulation. As the 1880 election season began, the nation's money was backed by gold alone, but the issue was far from settled.

Tariff policy was a source of conflict in late 19th-century American politics. During the Civil War, Congress raised protective tariffs to new heights. This was done partly to pay for the war, but partly because high tariffs were popular in the North. A high tariff meant that foreign goods were more expensive, which made it easier for American businesses to sell goods domestically. Republicans <a href="Protectionism">supported high tariffs</a> as a way to protect American jobs and increase prosperity. Democrats generally condemned them as a source of higher prices for goods, whereas the higher revenues that they generated for the federal government were not needed after the conclusion of the Civil War. Many Northern Democrats supported high tariffs, however, for the same economic reasons that Northern Republicans did. In the interest of party unity, they often sought to avoid the question as much as possible.

Four years earlier, in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201876">election of 1876</a>, Republican <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> of Ohio defeated Democrat <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> in one of the most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral Commission</a>, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.

For Democrats, the "stolen election" became a rallying cry, and the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives spent much of 1878 investigating it, although they failed to turn up any new evidence against their Republican foes. At first, Tilden was seen as the front-runner for the 1880 nomination. For leading Republicans, Hayes's inauguration in 1877 signaled the start of backroom maneuverings for the nomination in 1880. Even before his election, Hayes had pledged not to run for a second term, leaving the path to the White House open in 1880. His cabinet selections alienated many party leaders as well, deepening the growing divide within the Republican party between forces loyal to New York Senator <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a> and those loyal to Maine Senator <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>.

The parties agreed on their respective <a href="Party%20platform">platforms</a> and nominees at <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20nominating%20convention">conventions</a>, which met in the summer before the election.

The Republican convention met first, convening in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, on June 2. Of the men vying for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates leading up to the convention were former president <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, Senator James G. Blaine and Treasury Secretary <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>. Grant had been the leading military commander for the Northern forces during the Civil War, and had served two terms as president from 1869 to 1877. He was seeking an unprecedented third term in the office. He was backed by Conkling's faction of the Republican Party, now known as the <a href="Stalwart%20%28politics%29">Stalwarts</a>. They are mainly known for their opposition to the <a href="civil%20service">civil service</a> reforms sought by President Hayes. Blaine, a senator and former representative from Maine, was backed by the <a href="Half-Breed%20%28politics%29">Half-Breed</a> faction of the party, which did support civil service reform. Sherman, the brother of Civil War general <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>, was a former senator from Ohio serving in Hayes's cabinet. He was backed by a smaller delegation that supported neither of the major factions.

On the first ballot, Grant and Blaine gleaned 304 and 285 votes, respectively, while Sherman received 93. None of the candidates were close to victory, and the balloting continued in order to determine a winner. Many more ballots were taken, but no candidate prevailed. After the thirty-fifth ballot, Blaine and Sherman delegates switched their support to the new "dark horse" candidate, Representative James A. Garfield from Ohio. On the next ballot, Garfield won the nomination when he received 399 votes, most of them former Blaine and Sherman delegates. To placate the Grant faction, Garfield's Ohio supporters suggested <a href="Levi%20P.%20Morton">Levi P. Morton</a> for vice president. Morton declined, based on Conkling's advice. They next offered the nomination to <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, another New York Stalwart. Conkling also advised him to decline, but he accepted. He was nominated, and the longest-ever Republican National Convention was adjourned on June 8, 1880.

Later that month, the Democrats held their convention in <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. Six men were officially candidates for nomination at the convention, and several others also received votes. Of these, the two leading candidates were Major General <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a> from Pennsylvania and Senator <a href="Thomas%20F.%20Bayard">Thomas F. Bayard</a> from Delaware. Tilden was not officially a candidate, but he wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer.

As the convention opened, some delegates favored Bayard, a conservative senator, while others supported Hancock, a career soldier and Civil War hero. Still others flocked to men they saw as surrogates for Tilden, including <a href="Henry%20B.%20Payne">Henry B. Payne</a> from Ohio, an attorney and former congressman, and <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Randall">Samuel J. Randall</a> from Pennsylvania, the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the United States House of Representatives</a>. The first round of balloting was inconclusive, with Hancock and Bayard leading the count. Before the second round, Tilden's withdrawal from the campaign became known for certain; delegates then shifted to Hancock, who was nominated. <a href="William%20Hayden%20English">William Hayden English</a>, a conservative politician and businessman from the <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a> of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, was nominated for vice president.

The Greenback Party convention gathered in Chicago in mid-June, using the hall recently vacated by the Republicans. The party was a newcomer to the political scene in 1880, having arisen as a response to the economic depression that followed the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>, mostly in the nation's West and South. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized "<a href="United%20States%20Note">greenbacks</a>", a form of money redeemable in government bonds, rather than in gold, as was traditional. After the war, many Democrats and Republicans in the East sought to return to the gold standard, and the government began to withdraw greenbacks from circulation. The reduction of the <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a>, combined with the economic depression, made life harder for debtors, farmers, and industrial laborers; the Greenback Party hoped to draw support from these groups. Beyond their support for a larger money supply, they also favored an <a href="Eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a>, safety regulations in factories, and an end to <a href="Child%20labour">child labor</a>.

Six men were candidates for the Greenback nomination. <a href="James%20B.%20Weaver">James B. Weaver</a>, an Iowa congressman and Civil War general, was the clear favorite, but two other congressmen, <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin F. Butler</a> from Massachusetts and <a href="Hendrick%20B.%20Wright">Hendrick B. Wright</a> from Pennsylvania, also commanded considerable followings. Weaver triumphed quickly, winning a majority of the 850 delegates' votes on the first ballot. <a href="Barzillai%20J.%20Chambers">Barzillai J. Chambers</a>, a Texas businessman and <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> veteran, was likewise nominated for vice president on the initial vote. More tumultuous was the fight over the platform, as delegates from disparate factions of the left-wing movement clashed over <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Chinese%20Americans">Chinese immigration</a>, and the extent to which the government should regulate working conditions.

A convention of the <a href="Prohibition%20Party">Prohibition Party</a> also met that month in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>. The Prohibitionists, more of a movement than a party, focused their efforts on <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">banning alcohol</a>. Most party members came from <a href="Pietism">pietist</a> churches, and most were former Republicans. Only twelve states sent delegates to the convention, and the platform they agreed on was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the evils of alcohol. For president, the Prohibitionists nominated <a href="Neal%20Dow">Neal Dow</a>, a Civil War general from Maine. As mayor of <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland</a>, Dow helped to pass the "<a href="Maine%20law">Maine law</a>", which banned the sale of alcohol in the city; it became the model for temperance laws around the country. Finally, a revived <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party%23Later%20Anti-Masonic%20Party">Anti-Masonic Party</a> nominated <a href="John%20W.%20Phelps">John W. Phelps</a>, another Civil War general, on a platform of opposition to <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>. Political prognosticators gave Weaver little chance of victory, and Dow and Phelps none at all.

James Abram Garfield was raised in humble circumstances on an Ohio farm by his widowed mother. He worked at various jobs, including on a <a href="Barge">canal boat</a>, in his youth. Beginning at age 17, he studied at <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a> in <a href="Williamstown%2C%20Massachusetts">Williamstown, Massachusetts</a>, from which he graduated in 1856. A year later, Garfield entered politics as a Republican. He married <a href="Lucretia%20Garfield">Lucretia Rudolph</a> in 1858, and served as a member of the <a href="Ohio%20Senate">Ohio State Senate</a> (1859–1861). Garfield opposed Confederate secession, served as a major general in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the Civil War, and fought in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Middle%20Creek">Middle Creek</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Shiloh</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Chickamauga</a>. He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent <a href="Ohio%27s%2019th%20congressional%20district">Ohio's 19th District</a>. Throughout Garfield's extended congressional service after the Civil War, he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator. Garfield initially agreed with <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republican</a> views regarding <a href="Reconstruction%20Era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>, but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for <a href="Freedman">freedmen</a>.

After his nomination, Garfield met with party leaders in an attempt to heal the schism between the Stalwarts and Half-Breeds. In his formal letter to the party accepting his nomination, written with advice from party leaders, he endorsed the ideas of high tariffs and sound money, but drew particular attention to the issues of Chinese immigration and civil service reform. On both, Garfield sought a moderate path. He called for some restrictions on the former, through treaty renegotiation with the Chinese government. He straddled the divide on civil service reform, saying that he agreed with the concept, while promising to make no appointments without consulting party leaders, a position 20th-century biographer Allan Peskin called "inconsistent". As was traditional at the time, Garfield conducted a "<a href="front%20porch%20campaign">front porch campaign</a>", returning to <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield%20National%20Historic%20Site">his home</a> for the duration of the contest, and leaving the actual campaigning to surrogates.

Winfield Scott Hancock was born and raised in Pennsylvania. He attended the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at West Point and served in the Army for four decades, including service in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> and as a Union general in the Civil War. Known to his Army colleagues as "Hancock the Superb", he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in 1863, where he led the defense of <a href="Pickett%27s%20Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>. His military service continued after the Civil War, as Hancock participated in the military Reconstruction of <a href="Southern%20United%20States">the South</a> and the Army's presence at the Western <a href="Frontier%23United%20States">frontier</a>. During Reconstruction, he sided with then-President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> in working for a quick end to military occupation of the South and a return to government by the pre-war establishment. Hancock's reputation as a war hero at Gettysburg, combined with his status as a prominent Democrat with impeccable Unionist credentials and pro-states' rights views, made him a quadrennial presidential possibility.

Hancock was officially notified of his nomination in July, and responded with the traditional letter of acceptance. As Garfield had, the Democratic nominee sought to cause no controversy in his statement, which according to biographer David M. Jordan was "bland and general". After scorning the previous years of Republican rule, Hancock sought to tamp down fears that election of a Democrat would overturn the results of the war and Reconstruction, a common Republican campaign theme. Unlike Garfield, Hancock had no record in elected office, but the acceptance letter gave no further indication of his political preferences. Hancock remained on active duty during the campaign at his post on <a href="Governors%20Island">Governors Island</a> in <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a>.

James Baird Weaver was born in Ohio, and moved to Iowa as a boy when his family claimed a <a href="Homestead%20Acts">homestead</a> on the frontier. He became politically active as a young man and was an advocate for farmers and laborers, joining and quitting several political parties in the furtherance of the progressive causes in which he believed. After serving in the Union Army in the Civil War, Weaver returned to Iowa and worked for the election of Republican candidates. After making several unsuccessful attempts at Republican nominations to various offices, and growing dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the party, in 1877 Weaver switched to the Greenback Party, advocating an increased money supply and stricter regulation of <a href="big%20business">big business</a>. As a Greenbacker with Democratic support, Weaver won election to the House of Representatives in 1878.

Unlike the major party candidates, Weaver planned to take the field himself, giving speeches around the country. His running mate, Chambers, was to do the same, until a fall from a train in July disabled him for the duration of the campaign. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, he hoped to make inroads in that region. Weaver's path to victory, already unlikely, was made more difficult by his refusal to run a <a href="Electoral%20fusion">fusion</a> ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans. His party's message of racial inclusion also presaged difficulty in the South, as the Greenbackers would face the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement.

Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>, while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York and a few of the Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of <a href="waving%20the%20bloody%20shirt">waving the bloody shirt</a>: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.

The Democrats, for their part, campaigned on the character of the candidates. They attacked Garfield for his connection with the <a href="Cr%C3%A9dit%20Mobilier%20of%20America%20scandal">Crédit Mobilier of America scandal</a> of the early 1870s, in which many members of Congress were bribed by the Crédit Mobilier corporation, a railroad construction company. Garfield's precise involvement was unknown, but modern biographers agree that his account of his dealings with the construction syndicate were less than perfectly honest. Democrats used the incident as a contrast with Hancock who, as a career army officer, stood apart from Congress and lobbyists. Many in the Republican Party were reluctant to directly criticize the "hero of Gettysburg", but they did characterize Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Jordan later characterized their message as simply "our man is better than your man".

The Greenbackers saw the impact of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver embarked on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general at the head of the ticket, faced more opposition. The party's courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters. As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states. Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of <a href="presidential%20electors">presidential electors</a>, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates. In the September <a href="Maine%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201880">gubernatorial race in Maine</a>, one such fusion ticket nominated <a href="Harris%20M.%20Plaisted">Harris M. Plaisted</a>, who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to be a safe state for that party. The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt.

After their defeat in Maine, the Republicans began to emphasise policy differences more. One significant difference between them and the Democrats was a purposely vague statement in the Democratic platform endorsing "a <a href="Tariff%20in%20American%20history">tariff</a> for revenue only". Garfield's campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that benefited from a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said "the tariff question is a local question". While not completely inaccurate—tariff preferences often reflected local concerns—the statement was at odds with the Democrats' platform and suggested that Hancock did not understand the issue.

The change in tactics appeared to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but he convinced them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.

In the last weeks before the election, the issue of Chinese immigration entered the race. Both major parties (as well as the Greenbackers) pledged in their platforms to limit immigration from China, which native-born workers in the Western states believed was depressing their wages. On October 20, however, a Democratic newspaper <a href="Morey%20letter">published a letter</a>, purportedly from Garfield to a group of businessmen, pledging to keep immigration at the current levels so that industry could keep workers' wages low. Garfield denounced the letter as a ruse, but not before one hundred thousand copies of the newspaper were mailed to California and Oregon. Once the letter was exposed as a forgery, Garfield biographer Peskin believes it may even have gained votes for the Republican in the East, but it likely weakened him in the West.

When all the ballots were counted, fewer than 2,000 votes separated Garfield and Hancock, the closest popular vote of any American presidential election before or since. The voters showed their interest in the election by turning out in record numbers; 78 percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, among largest percentages in American history. Each major party candidate earned just over 48 percent of the vote. Weaver won more than 3 percent, tripling the Greenback total of four years earlier. The other minor party candidates fared far worse, as Dow and Phelps earned 0.1 and 0.01 percent, respectively. The narrow victory carried over into the Congressional vote, as the Republicans won the House by a twelve-seat margin and the Senate was evenly divided. Garfield carried the crucial state of New York by 20,000 votes out of 1.1 million cast there. Other states were much closer; Hancock's margin of victory in California was only 144 votes.

In the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral college</a>, the vote was more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and <a href="border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a>, but Garfield swept all but one of the Northern states (the exception was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield's triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.

In Virginia, a split in the Democratic Party over the payment of state debts led to two Democratic electoral slates being nominated, one by the regular debt-paying "Funder" Democrats, the other by the "<a href="Readjuster%20Party">Readjuster</a>" or anti-debt paying faction of the party. Both slates were pledged to the Hancock ticket. Republicans initially hoped the split could lead Garfield to win the state, but the results were otherwise. The Readjuster ticket received 31,527 votes, but the Funder Democrats took 96,449 votes, enough to defeat the Republicans, whose slate had 84,020.

Although Hancock won Georgia's popular vote easily, there was an irregularity in that state's electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>, "The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States." In 1792, Congress had set the date for the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> to vote on the first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia's electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had they not done so, Hancock's electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.

As Garfield entered office in March 1881, the Republican party schism that had been patched up for the election tore apart once more. Garfield appointed Blaine to the cabinet, and Conkling's Stalwart faction became irked at their lack of control over patronage, even in Conkling's home state of New York. Garfield appointed <a href="William%20H.%20Robertson">William H. Robertson</a>, a civil service reform supporter, to the most lucrative government post in New York, and refused to withdraw the nomination despite Conkling's protests; in response, Conkling and his allies brought all legislative action in the closely divided Senate to a halt. In May, Conkling and fellow New York Senator <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Platt">Thomas C. Platt</a> resigned from the Senate in protest. The two Stalwarts expected the New York legislature to reelect them in triumph; instead, the legislature deadlocked for months, eventually declining to return either man to the Senate. Before that result was known, however, tragedy struck as <a href="Charles%20Guiteau">Charles Guiteau</a>, a mentally unstable man disappointed at being unable to secure a patronage appointment, shot Garfield on July 2, 1881.

Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half months before dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, was sworn in as president that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a bipartisan majority in Congress passed the <a href="Pendleton%20Civil%20Service%20Reform%20Act">Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act</a> to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.

Congress also settled the issue of Chinese immigration, passing the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> in 1882. Arthur initially vetoed a similar measure, which he believed contradicted the United States' treaty with China, but eventually signed a compromise bill, which banned immigration from China for ten years. Tariffs, a major issue in the campaign, remained largely unchanged in the four years that followed, although Congress did pass <a href="Tariff%20of%201883">a minor revision</a> that reduced them by an average of less than 2 percent. After a half-hearted attempt at the nomination in 1884, Arthur retired and died two years later.

Hancock did not long survive his electoral opponent. After the election, he remained on duty as commander of the Division of the Atlantic. He attended Garfield's inauguration and served loyally under him and Arthur. In 1885, he visited the Gettysburg battlefield, the site of his most famous triumph two decades earlier. Hancock died the following year, after an abscess in his leg became infected. Weaver survived both of his more popular opponents, returning to Congress for four years in the 1880s, and running for president again as the nominee of the <a href="Populist%20Party%20%28US%29">Populist Party</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201892">1892</a>.

Sviatoslav I of Kiev

Sviatoslav I Igorevich (<a href="Old%20East%20Slavic">Old East Slavic</a>: С~тославъ / Свѧтославъ Игорєвичь, "Sventoslavŭ / Svantoslavŭ Igorevičǐ"; <a href="Old%20Norse%20language">Old Norse</a>: "Sveinald Ingvarsson") (c. 942 – 26 March 972), also spelled Svyatoslav was a Grand prince of Kiev famous for his persistent campaigns in the east and south, which precipitated the collapse of two great powers of Eastern Europe, <a href="Khazars">Khazaria</a> and the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a>. He also conquered numerous <a href="East%20Slavs">East Slavic</a> tribes, defeated the <a href="Alans">Alans</a> and attacked the <a href="Volga%20Bulgaria">Volga Bulgars</a>, and at times was allied with the <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a> and <a href="Hungarian%20people">Magyars</a>.

His decade-long reign over the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> was marked by rapid expansion into the <a href="Volga%20River">Volga River</a> valley, the <a href="Pontic-Caspian%20steppe">Pontic steppe</a>, and the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. By the end of his short life, Sviatoslav carved out for himself the largest state in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, eventually moving his capital in 969 from <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> (modern-day Ukraine) to <a href="Pereyaslavets">Pereyaslavets</a> (identified as the modern village of <a href="Nuf%C4%83ru">Nufăru</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>) on the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. In contrast with his mother's conversion to <a href="History%20of%20Christianity%23High%20Middle%20Ages%20%28800%E2%80%931299%29">Christianity</a>, Sviatoslav remained a staunch <a href="paganism">pagan</a> all of his life. Due to his abrupt death in ambush, his conquests, for the most part, were not consolidated into a functioning empire, while his failure to establish a stable succession led to a <a href="fratricide">fratricidal</a> feud among his three sons, resulting in two of them being killed.

The "<a href="Primary%20Chronicle">Primary Chronicle</a>" records Sviatoslav as the first ruler of the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> with a name of <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> origin (as opposed to his predecessors, whose names had <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> forms). The name "Sviatoslav", however, is not recorded in other medieval Slavic countries. Nevertheless, "Sveinald" is the <a href="Old%20East%20Norse">Old East Norse</a> cognate with the Slavic form as attested in the Old East Norse patronymic of Sviatoslav's son <a href="Vladimir%20I%20of%20Kiev">Vladimir</a>: "Valdamarr Sveinaldsson". This <a href="patronymic">patronymic</a> naming convention continues in <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a> and in <a href="East%20Slavic%20languages">East Slavic languages</a>. Even in Rus', it was attested only among the members of the <a href="Rurik%20Dynasty">house of Rurik</a>, as were the names of Sviatoslav's immediate successors: <a href="Vladimir%20I%20of%20Kiev">Vladimir</a>, <a href="Yaroslav%20I%20the%20Wise">Yaroslav</a>, and <a href="Mstislav%20I%20of%20Kiev">Mstislav</a>. Some scholars see the name of Sviatoslav, composed of the Slavic roots for "holy" and "glory", as an artificial derivation combining the names of his predecessors <a href="Oleg%20of%20Novgorod">Oleg</a> and <a href="Rurik">Rurik</a> (whose names mean "holy" and "glorious" in <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a>, respectively).

Virtually nothing is known about Sviatoslav's childhood and youth, which he spent reigning in <a href="Velikiy%20Novgorod">Novgorod</a>. Sviatoslav's father, <a href="Igor%2C%20Grand%20Prince%20of%20Kiev">Igor</a>, was killed by the <a href="Drevlyans">Drevlians</a> around 945, and his mother, <a href="Olga%20of%20Kiev">Olga</a>, ruled as <a href="regent">regent</a> in <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a> until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963). Sviatoslav was tutored by a <a href="Varangians">Varangian</a> named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration. His life was spent with his "<a href="druzhina">druzhina</a>" (roughly, "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor did he have a tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting his saddle under his head, and all his retinue did likewise. 
Sviatoslav's appearance has been described very clearly by <a href="Leo%20the%20Deacon">Leo the Deacon</a>, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with <a href="John%20I%20Tzimiskes">John I Tzimiskes</a>. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a bright-eyed, man of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He had bald head and a wispy beard and wore a bushy mustache and a <a href="chupryna">sidelock</a> as a sign of his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a <a href="Carbuncle%20%28gemstone%29">carbuncle</a> and two <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s.

Sviatoslav's mother, <a href="Olga%20of%20Kiev">Olga</a>, converted to <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodox Christianity</a> at the court of <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> Emperor <a href="Constantine%20Porphyrogenitus">Constantine Porphyrogenitus</a> in 957, at the approximate age of 67. However, Sviatoslav remained a <a href="Paganism">pagan</a> all of his life. In the treaty of 971 between Sviatoslav and the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes, the Rus' are swearing by <a href="Perun">Perun</a> and <a href="Veles%20%28god%29">Veles</a>. According to the Primary Chronicle, he believed that his warriors (<a href="druzhina">druzhina</a>) would lose respect for him and mock him if he became a Christian. The allegiance of his warriors was of paramount importance in his conquest of an empire that stretched from the Volga to the Danube.

Very little is known of Sviatoslav's family life. It is possible that he was not the only (or the eldest) son of his parents. The <a href="Rus%27-Byzantine%20Treaty%20%28945%29">Russo-Byzantine treaty of 945</a> mentions a certain Predslava, Volodislav's wife, as the noblest of the Rus' women after Olga. The fact that Predslava was Oleg's mother is presented by <a href="Vasily%20Tatishchev">Vasily Tatishchev</a>. He also speculated that Predslava was of a Hungarian nobility. <a href="George%20Vernadsky">George Vernadsky</a> was among many historians to speculate that Volodislav was Igor's eldest son and heir who died at some point during Olga's regency. Another chronicle told that Oleg (? - 944?) was the eldest son of Igor. At the time of Igor's death, Sviatoslav was still a child, and he was raised by his mother or under her instructions. Her influence, however, did not extend to his religious observance.
Sviatoslav had several children, but the origin of his wives is not specified in the chronicle. By his wives, he had <a href="Yaropolk%20I%20of%20Kiev">Yaropolk</a> and <a href="Oleg%20of%20Drelinia">Oleg</a>. By <a href="Malusha">Malusha</a>, a woman of indeterminate origins, Sviatoslav had <a href="Vladimir%20I%20of%20Kiev">Vladimir</a>, who would ultimately break with his father's paganism and <a href="Christianization%20of%20Kievan%20Rus%27">convert Rus' to Christianity</a>. <a href="John%20Skylitzes">John Skylitzes</a> reported that Vladimir had a brother named <a href="Sfengus">Sfengus</a>; whether this Sfengus was a son of Sviatoslav, a son of Malusha by a prior or subsequent husband, or an unrelated Rus' nobleman is unclear.

Shortly after his accession to the throne, Sviatoslav began campaigning to expand Rus' control over the Volga valley and the <a href="Pontic-Caspian%20steppe">Pontic steppe</a> region. His greatest success was the conquest of <a href="Khazars">Khazaria</a>, which for centuries had been one of the strongest states of <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. The sources are not clear about the roots of the conflict between Khazaria and Rus', so several possibilities have been suggested. The Rus' had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the <a href="Volga%20trade%20route">Volga trade route</a> because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Historians have suggested that the Byzantine Empire may have incited the Rus' against the Khazars, who fell out with the Byzantines after the persecutions of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Russia%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union%23Early%20history">Jew</a>s in the reign of <a href="Romanos%20I">Romanus I Lecapenus</a>.
Sviatoslav began by rallying the <a href="East%20Slavs">East Slavic</a> vassal tribes of the Khazars to his cause. Those who would not join him, such as the <a href="Vyatichs">Vyatichs</a>, were attacked and forced to pay tribute to the Kievan Rus' rather than to the Khazars. According to a legend recorded in the Primary Chronicle, Sviatoslav sent a message to the Vyatich rulers, consisting of a single phrase: "I want to come at you!" (<a href="Old%20East%20Slavic">Old East Slavic</a>: "хощю на вы ити") This phrase is used in modern Russian (usually misquoted as "Иду на вы") and in modern Ukrainian ("Іду на ви") to denote an unequivocal declaration of one's intentions. Proceeding by the <a href="Oka%20River">Oka</a> and Volga rivers, he attacked <a href="Volga%20Bulgaria">Volga Bulgaria</a>. He employed <a href="Oghuz%20Turks">Oghuz</a> and <a href="Pechenegs">Pecheneg</a> mercenaries in this campaign, perhaps to counter the superior <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> of the Khazars and Bulgars.

Sviatoslav destroyed the Khazar city of <a href="Sarkel">Sarkel</a> around 965, possibly sacking (but not occupying) the Khazar city of <a href="Kerch">Kerch</a> on the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> as well. At Sarkel he established a Rus' settlement called Belaya Vyezha ("the white tower" or "the white fortress", the East Slavic translation for "Sarkel"). He subsequently destroyed the Khazar capital of <a href="Atil">Atil</a>. A visitor to Atil wrote soon after Sviatoslav's campaign: "The Rus' attacked, and no grape or raisin remained, not a leaf on a branch." The exact chronology of his Khazar campaign is uncertain and disputed; for example, <a href="Mikhail%20Illarionovich%20Artamonov">Mikhail Artamonov</a> and <a href="David%20Christian%20%28historian%29">David Christian</a> proposed that the sack of Sarkel came after the destruction of Atil.
Although <a href="Ibn%20Hawqal">Ibn Haukal</a> reports the sack of <a href="Samandar%20%28city%29">Samandar</a> by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader did not bother to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus Mountains</a> permanently. On his way back to Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the <a href="Ossetians">Ossetians</a> and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar successor statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the <a href="Saltovo-Mayaki">Saltovo-Mayaki</a> culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.

The annihilation of Khazaria was undertaken against the background of the Rus'-Byzantine alliance, concluded in the wake of <a href="Rus%27-Byzantine%20War%20%28941%29">Igor's Byzantine campaign</a> in 944. Close military ties between the Rus' and Byzantium are illustrated by the fact, reported by John Skylitzes, that a Rus' detachment accompanied Byzantine Emperor <a href="Nikephoros%20II">Nikephoros Phokas</a> in his victorious naval expedition to <a href="Crete">Crete</a>.

In 967 or 968, Nikephoros sent to Sviatoslav his agent, <a href="Kalokyros">Kalokyros</a>, with the task of talking Sviatoslav into assisting him in a war against <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgaria</a>. Sviatoslav was paid 15,000 pounds of gold and set sail with an army of 60,000 men, including thousands of Pecheneg mercenaries.

<a href="Battle%20of%20Silistra">Sviatoslav defeated</a> the Bulgarian ruler <a href="Boris%20II%20of%20Bulgaria">Boris II</a> and proceeded to occupy the whole of northern Bulgaria. Meanwhile, the Byzantines bribed the Pechenegs to <a href="Siege%20of%20Kiev%20%28968%29">attack and besiege Kiev</a>, where Olga stayed with Sviatoslav's son Vladimir. The siege was relieved by the "druzhina" of <a href="Siege%20of%20Kiev%20%28968%29">Pretich</a>, and immediately following the Pecheneg retreat, Olga sent a reproachful letter to Sviatoslav. He promptly returned and defeated the Pechenegs, who continued to threaten Kiev.

Sviatoslav refused to turn his Balkan conquests over to the Byzantines, and the parties fell out as a result. To the chagrin of his <a href="boyar">boyar</a>s and his mother (who died within three days after learning about his decision), Sviatoslav decided to move his capital to <a href="Pereyaslavets">Pereyaslavets</a> in the mouth of the Danube due to the great potential of that location as a commercial hub. In the Primary Chronicle record for 969, Sviatoslav explains that it is to Pereyaslavets, the centre of his lands, "all the riches flow: gold, silks, wine, and various fruits from <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, silver and horses from <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, and from Rus' furs, wax, honey, and slaves".
In summer 969, Sviatoslav left Rus' again, dividing his dominion into three parts, each under a nominal rule of one of his sons. At the head of an army that included Pecheneg and Magyar auxiliary troops, he invaded Bulgaria again, devastating <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, capturing the city of <a href="Plovdiv">Philippopolis</a>, and massacring its inhabitants. Nikephoros responded by repairing the defenses of Constantinople and raising new squadrons of armored cavalry. In the midst of his preparations, Nikephoros was overthrown and killed by <a href="John%20I%20Tzimiskes">John Tzimiskes</a>, who thus became the new Byzantine emperor.

John Tzimiskes first attempted to persuade Sviatoslav into leaving Bulgaria, but he was unsuccessful. Challenging the Byzantine authority, Sviatoslav crossed the Danube and laid siege to <a href="Edirne">Adrianople</a>, causing panic on the streets of Constantinople in summer 970. Later that year, the Byzantines launched a counteroffensive. Being occupied with suppressing a revolt of <a href="Bardas%20Phokas%20the%20Younger">Bardas Phokas</a> in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, John Tzimiskes sent his commander-in-chief, <a href="Bardas%20Skleros">Bardas Skleros</a>, who defeated the coalition of Rus', Pechenegs, Magyars, and Bulgarians in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arcadiopolis%20%28970%29">Battle of Arcadiopolis</a>. Meanwhile, John, having quelled the revolt of Bardas Phokas, came to the Balkans with a large army and promoting himself as the liberator of Bulgaria from Sviatoslav, penetrated the impracticable mountain passes and shortly thereafter captured <a href="Marcianopolis">Marcianopolis</a>, where the Rus' were holding a number of Bulgar princes hostage.
Sviatoslav retreated to <a href="Silistra">Dorostolon</a>, which the Byzantine armies <a href="Siege%20of%20Dorostolon">besieged for sixty-five days</a>. Cut off and surrounded, Sviatoslav came to terms with John and agreed to abandon the Balkans, renounce his claims to the southern Crimea, and return west of the <a href="Dnieper%20River">Dnieper River</a>. In return, the Byzantine emperor supplied the Rus' with food and safe passage home. Sviatoslav and his men set sail and landed on <a href="Berezan%20Island">Berezan Island</a> at the mouth of the Dnieper, where they made camp for the winter. Several months later, their camp was devastated by famine, so that even a horse's head could not be bought for less than a half-<a href="Ukrainian%20hryvnia">grivna</a>, reports the Kievan chronicler of the Primary Chronicle. While Sviatoslav's campaign brought no tangible results for the Rus', it weakened the Bulgarian statehood and left it vulnerable to the attacks of <a href="Basil%20II">Basil the Bulgar-Slayer</a> four decades later.

Fearing that the peace with Sviatoslav would not endure, the Byzantine emperor induced the Pecheneg <a href="Khan%20%28title%29">khan</a> <a href="Kurya%20%28khan%29">Kurya</a> to kill Sviatoslav before he reached Kiev. This was in line with the policy outlined by <a href="Constantine%20VII">Constantine VII</a> Porphyrogenitus in "<a href="De%20Administrando%20Imperio">De Administrando Imperio</a>" of fomenting strife between the Rus' and the Pechenegs. According to the Slavic chronicle, <a href="Sveneld">Sveneld</a> attempted to warn Sviatoslav to avoid the <a href="Khortytsia">Dnieper rapids</a>, but the prince slighted his wise advice and was ambushed and slain by the Pechenegs when he tried to cross the cataracts near <a href="Khortytsia">Khortitsa</a> early in 972. The Primary Chronicle reports that his skull was <a href="skull%20cup">made into a chalice</a> by the Pecheneg khan.
Following Sviatoslav's death, tensions between his sons grew. A war broke out between his legitimate sons, Oleg and <a href="Yaropolk%20I%20of%20Kiev">Yaropolk</a>, in 976, at the conclusion of which Oleg was killed. In 977 <a href="Vladimir%20I%20of%20Kiev">Vladimir</a> fled Novgorod to escape Oleg's fate and went to <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, where he raised an army of <a href="Varangians">Varangians</a> and returned in 980. Yaropolk was killed, and Vladimir became the sole ruler of Kievan Rus'.

Sviatoslav has long been a hero of <a href="Belarusians">Belarusian</a>, <a href="Russians">Russian</a>, and <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a> patriots due to his great military successes. His figure first attracted attention of Russian artists and poets during the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281768%E2%80%931774%29">Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)</a>, which provided obvious parallels with Sviatoslav's push towards Constantinople. Russia's southward expansion and the imperialistic ventures of <a href="Catherine%20II%20of%20Russia">Catherine II</a> in the Balkans seemed to have been legitimized by Sviatoslav's campaigns eight centuries earlier.
Among the works created during the war was <a href="Yakov%20Knyazhnin">Yakov Knyazhnin</a>'s tragedy "Olga" (1772). The Russian playwright chose to introduce Sviatoslav as his protagonist, although his active participation in the events following Igor's death is out of sync with the traditional chronology. Knyazhnin's rival <a href="Nikolai%20Nikolev">Nikolai Nikolev</a> (1758–1815) also wrote a play on the subject of Sviatoslav's life. <a href="Ivan%20Akimov">Ivan Akimov</a>'s painting "Sviatoslav's Return from the Danube to Kiev" (1773) explores the conflict between military honour and family attachment. It is a vivid example of <a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Poussinesque</a> rendering of early medieval subject matter.

Interest in Sviatoslav's career increased in the 19th century. <a href="Klavdiy%20Lebedev">Klavdiy Lebedev</a> depicted an episode of Sviatoslav's meeting with <a href="John%20I%20Tzimiskes">Emperor John</a> in his well-known painting, while <a href="Eugene%20Lanceray">Eugene Lanceray</a> sculpted an <a href="equestrian%20sculpture">equestrian statue</a> of Sviatoslav in the early 20th century. Sviatoslav appears in the 1913 poem of <a href="Velimir%20Khlebnikov">Velimir Khlebnikov</a> "Written before the war" (#70. Написанное до войны) as an epitome of militant Slavdom:

Sviatoslav is the villain of the novel "The Lost Kingdom, or the Passing of the Khazars", by Samuel Gordon, a fictionalised account of the destruction of Khazaria by the Rus'. The Slavic warrior figures in a more positive context in the story "Chernye Strely Vyaticha" by Vadim Viktorovich Kargalov; the story is included in his book "Istoricheskie povesti".

In 2005, reports circulated that a village in the <a href="Belgorod">Belgorod</a> region had erected a monument to Sviatoslav's victory over the Khazars by the Russian sculptor <a href="Vyacheslav%20Klykov">Vyacheslav Klykov</a>. The reports described the 13-meter tall statue as depicting a Rus' cavalryman trampling a supine Khazar bearing a <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a> and <a href="Kolovrat%20%28symbol%29">Kolovrat</a>. This created an outcry within the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Russia%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Jewish community</a> of Russia. The controversy was further exacerbated by Klykov's connections with <a href="Pamyat">Pamyat</a> and other anti-Semitic organizations, as well as by his involvement in the "letter of 500", a controversial appeal to the Prosecutor General to review all Jewish organizations in Russia for extremism. The Press Centre of the Belgorod Regional Administration responded by stating that a planned monument to Sviatoslav had not yet been constructed but would show "respect towards representatives of all nationalities and religions." When the statue was unveiled, the shield bore a twelve-pointed star.

Sviatoslav is the main character of the books "Knyaz" ("Князь") and "The Hero" ("Герой"), written by Russian writer <a href="Alexander%20Mazin">Alexander Mazin</a>.

On 7 November 2011, a Ukrainian fisherman found a one metre long sword in the waters of the Dnieper on <a href="Khortytsia">Khortytsia</a> near where Sviatoslav is believed to have been killed in 972. The handle is made out of four different metals including gold and silver, and could possibly have belonged to Sviatoslav himself.

American goldfinch

The American goldfinch ("Spinus tristis") is a small <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="finch">finch</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>. It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, ranging from mid-<a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> to <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> during the <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>, and from just south of the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–United States border</a> to Mexico during the winter.

The only finch in its <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> to undergo a complete <a href="molt">molt</a>, the American goldfinch displays <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in its coloration; the male is a vibrant <a href="yellow">yellow</a> in the summer and an <a href="olive%20%28color%29">olive</a> color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored <a href="plumage">plumage</a> during the breeding season to attract a mate.

The American goldfinch is a <a href="Seed%20predation">granivore</a> and <a href="adaptation">adapted</a> for the consumption of seedheads, with a conical <a href="beak">beak</a> to remove the seeds and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and <a href="Bird%20migration">migrating</a>. It may behave <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorially</a> during nest construction, but this aggression is short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a>, and produces one brood each year.

Human activity has generally benefited the American goldfinch. It is often found in residential areas, attracted to <a href="bird%20feeders">bird feeders</a> which increase its survival rate in these areas. <a href="Deforestation">Deforestation</a> also creates open <a href="meadow">meadow</a> areas which are its preferred <a href="habitat">habitat</a>.

The American goldfinch was one of the many species originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in the landmark 1758 <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his work "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". It was initially included in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Spinus", a group containing New World goldfinches and <a href="siskin">siskin</a>s, but in 1976, "Spinus" was merged into the genus "<a href="Carduelis">Carduelis</a>" as a <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a>. Recent studies resurrect the genus "Spinus". Its closest relatives are the <a href="lesser%20goldfinch">lesser goldfinch</a> "(S. psaltria)", <a href="Lawrence%27s%20goldfinch">Lawrence's goldfinch</a> "(S. lawrencei)", and the siskins. Although it shares a name with the <a href="European%20goldfinch">European goldfinch</a>, the two are in separate subgenera and are not directly related. "Carduelis" is derived from "carduus", the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for <a href="thistle">thistle</a>; the species name "tristis" is Latin for 'sorrowful'. There are four recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the American goldfinch:

This seems to be the most ancient extant species of the Meso American Spinus/Carduelis evolutive radiation, whose parental species is Carduelis/Spinus lawrencei.

The American goldfinch is a small <a href="finch">finch</a>, long, with a <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> of . It weighs between . Among standard measurements, the <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord</a> is , the <a href="tail">tail</a> is , the <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> is and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> is . The beak is small, conical, and pink for most of the year, but turns bright orange with the spring molt in both sexes.
The shape and size of the beak aid in the extraction of <a href="seed">seed</a>s from the seed heads of <a href="thistle">thistle</a>s, <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a>s, and other plants.

The American goldfinch undergoes a <a href="Moult">molt</a> in the spring and autumn. It is the only <a href="Carduelis">cardueline</a> finch to undergo a molt twice a year. During the winter molt it sheds all its feathers; in the spring, it sheds all but the wing and tail feathers, which are dark brown in the female and black in the male. The markings on these feathers remain through each molt, with bars on the wings and white under and at the edges of the short, notched tail. The <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> displayed in plumage coloration is especially pronounced after the spring molt, when the bright color of the male's summer plumage is needed to attract a mate.
Once the spring molt is complete, the body of the male is a brilliant lemon yellow, a color produced by <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s from plant materials in its diet, with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight. The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside with a yellow bib. After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, becoming <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a> below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches. In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.

The immature American goldfinch has a dull brown back, and the underside is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration is the same in both genders.

The <a href="Birdsong">song</a> of the American goldfinch is a series of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A "tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit" call is often given in flight; it may also be described as "per-chic-o-ree". While the female <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubates</a> the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous "teeteeteeteete" sound. The young begin to use a call of "chick-kee" or "chick-wee" shortly before <a href="fledge">fledging</a>, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a "sweet" call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract <a href="predator">predator</a>s, and a "bearbee" used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.

The American goldfinch prefers open country where weeds thrive, such as <a href="field%20%28agriculture%29">fields</a>, meadows, <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a>s, as well as roadsides, <a href="orchards">orchards</a>, and gardens. It may also be found in open <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> and <a href="Riparian%20zone">riparian</a> woodlands and areas of <a href="Secondary%20forest">secondary growth</a>. This <a href="habitat">habitat</a> preference continues during the spring and autumn migrations.

The summer <a href="breeding%20range">breeding range</a> stretches across North America from coast to coast. It is bounded on the north by <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> and stretches south across North America to <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> on the east coast, and northern <a href="California">California</a> on the west coast. The American goldfinch is a short-distance migrant, moving south in response to colder weather and lessened food supply. The migration is completed in compact <a href="flock%20%28birds%29">flocks</a>, which travel in an erratic, wavelike flight pattern.

Its winter range includes southern Canada and stretches south through the United States to parts of Mexico. In winter, in the northern part of its range, the finch may move nearer to <a href="bird%20feeder">feeders</a> if they are available. In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months.

Attempts were made to introduce the American goldfinch into <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> in the 19th century, and <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> in 1938, but the species failed to become established.

The American goldfinch flies in a distinctive undulating pattern, creating a wave-shaped path. This normally consists of a series of wing beats to lift the bird, then folding in the wings and gliding in an arc before repeating the pattern. Birds often vocalize during the flapping phase of the pattern and then go silent during the coasting phase. The call made during flight is "per-twee-twee-twee", or "ti-di-di-di", punctuated by the silent periods.

The American goldfinch does not act aggressively toward predators within its territory; its only reaction is <a href="alarm%20call">alarm call</a>ing. Predators include <a href="snake">snake</a>s, <a href="weasel">weasel</a>s, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, and <a href="blue%20jay">blue jay</a>s, which may destroy eggs or kill young, and <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and <a href="cat">cat</a>s, which pose a threat to both young and adults. The oldest known American goldfinch was 10 years and 5 months old.

The American goldfinch is <a href="wikt%3Agregarious">gregarious</a> during the non-breeding season, when it is often found in large flocks, usually with other finches. The social hierarchy, measured by how many aggressive encounters are won by each individual, tends towards the male being dominant in the non-breeding season. During the breeding season, this finch lives in loose <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a>. While the nest is being constructed, the male will act aggressively toward other males who intrude into his territory, driving them away, and the female reacts in the same way toward other females. This aggressiveness subsides once the eggs have been laid. The social hierarchy in the breeding season generally has the female dominant over the male. Dominance may change based on the value of a resource; a study published in 1987 found that starved subordinate birds were sometimes dominant in competitions over feeder access.
The American goldfinch indicates its degree of aggression through multiple displays. The head-up display, where the neck and legs are slightly extended, shows mild aggression, and is often performed by the victor of an encounter. The carpals-raised display has the neck retracted and the carpals raised; displayers are likely to attack their opponent. The head-forward display is where the legs are flexed, the neck extended, and the beak closed. At higher intensities, the neck is lowered, the beak is pointed at the opponent, and one or both wings are raised. In extreme cases, the neck is retracted, the bill opened, the body feathers sleeked, and the tail is fanned and raised slightly. Aggression is also displayed by showing the front of the body to another individual. Attacks include pecking at feathers, supplanting the opponent by landing next to it, and flying vertically with legs and feet extended, beaks open, and necks extended. Avoidance behaviors include showing only the side of the body to an aggressor, leaning away, flexing the legs, retracting the neck, and pointing the beak down.
The American goldfinch begins its breeding season later in the year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides occasionally the <a href="sedge%20wren">sedge wren</a>. This may be related to the abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.

The courtship rituals of the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male is able to signal his quality and fitness, both in the short term (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.

Once a male has found a mate, he selects a territory, marking the boundaries by warbling as he flies from perch to perch. After circling the perimeter, he performs two flight displays, first repeating a low, flat flight, then flying in an exaggerated version of normal flight, tucking his wings close to his body, plummeting earthwards and catching himself as he spreads his wings to glide upward in a series of loops. Two or three pairs may group their territories together in a loose colony, perhaps to aid in defense against predators.

The nest is built in late summer by the female in the branches of a <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> shrub or tree at a height of up to . The nest-building lasts approximately six days, during which time the female works in 10–40 minute increments. The male frequently flies with the female as she collects nesting materials, and though he may carry some materials back to the nest, he leaves its construction to the female. The outer shell of the nest is built of bark, weeds, vines, and grass. The inside diameter of the finished nest is about . The rim is reinforced with bark bound by <a href="Spider%20web">spiderwebs</a> and caterpillar silk, and the cup is lined with plant down from milkweed, thistle, or cattail. The nest is so tightly woven that it can hold water, and it is possible for nestlings to drown following a rainstorm if the parents do not cover the nest.

The American goldfinch lays four to six bluish-white <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>, which are oval in shape and about , roughly the size of a <a href="peanut">peanut</a>. It is thought that they are laid during the night. The eggs are incubated by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.

The chicks hatch 12–14 days after incubation begins. Like all <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, the chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>; they are hatched naked, with reddish bodies, pale grey <a href="down%20feather">down</a>, and closed eyes. The mother bird feeds her young <a href="Regurgitation%20%28digestion%29">regurgitated</a> seeds and insects as they grow. The hatchlings develop quickly, opening their eyes after three days, and completing the growth of olive-brown juvenile plumage after 11–15 days, at which time they begin to practice short flights close to the nest. For up to three weeks after fledging, they are still fed by the male, who locates them by listening for their fledging call. The chicks stop giving this call when they become entirely independent.

The American goldfinch is occasionally victim to brood parasites, particularly <a href="brown-headed%20cowbird">brown-headed cowbird</a>s. One study found that 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. It likely evades parasitism partly because of its late breeding season. The American goldfinch also makes a very poor host for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is despite the lack of known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites in this finch. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough <a href="nutrition">nutrition</a>; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.

The American goldfinch is a <a href="Diurnal%20animal">diurnal</a> feeder. According to the <a href="Cornell%20Lab%20of%20Ornithology">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>, the species is one of the strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly <a href="Seed%20predation">granivorous</a>, but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide <a href="protein">protein</a>. Its <a href="diet%20%28nutrition%29">diet</a> consists of the seeds from a wide variety of <a href="Annual%20plant">annual</a> plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as <a href="thistle">thistle</a>, <a href="teasel">teasel</a>, <a href="dandelion">dandelion</a>, <a href="ragweed">ragweed</a>, <a href="Verbascum">mullein</a>, <a href="Cosmos%20%28plant%29">cosmos</a>, <a href="Tragopogon">goatsbeard</a>, <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a>, and <a href="alder">alder</a>. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring <a href="Guizotia%20abyssinica">Niger seed</a> (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).

Unlike some finch species, the American goldfinch uses its feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding in order to reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the <a href="catkin">catkin</a>s hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.

The American goldfinch is found in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard <a href="Birdwatching">birders</a> attract it using feeders containing <a href="niger%20seed">niger seed</a>, or by planting grasses and <a href="perennial%20plant">perennial plant</a>s, such as <a href="zinnias">zinnias</a>, <a href="cosmos%20%28plant%29">cosmos</a>, <a href="bee%20balm">bee balm</a>, or <a href="globe%20thistle">globe thistle</a>, which produce seedheads favored by finches.

The American goldfinch is not threatened by human activity, and is widespread throughout its range. The clearing of forests by humans, though harmful to many species, has benefited the American goldfinch. Clearing of woodlands causes declines in numbers of <a href="neotropical">neotropical</a> <a href="bird%20migration">migrants</a>, while favoring short-distance migrants and permanent residents. This benefits the American goldfinch both as a short-distance migrant, and because the created open areas are the preferred environment of the bird, where weeds thrive which produce the primary food source of the American goldfinch.

The American goldfinch is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20birds">state bird</a> of <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> and <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, where it is called the "Eastern Goldfinch", and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, where it is called the "Willow Goldfinch". It was chosen by schoolchildren in Washington in 1951.
