Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal

The Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal is a disused <a href="canal">canal</a> in <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England, built to link <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a> and <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a> with <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. The canal, when fully opened, was 15 miles 1 <a href="furlong">furlong</a> (24.3 km) long. It was accessed via a junction with the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a> in <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a>. Seventeen <a href="lock%20%28water%20transport%29">locks</a> were required to climb to the <a href="Route%20summit">summit</a> as it passed through <a href="Pendleton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Pendleton</a>, heading northwest to <a href="Prestolee">Prestolee</a> before it split northwest to Bolton and northeast to Bury. Between Bolton and Bury the canal was level and required no locks. Six <a href="Navigable%20aqueduct">aqueduct</a>s were built to allow the canal to cross the rivers Irwell and <a href="River%20Tonge">Tonge</a> and several minor roads.

The canal was commissioned in 1791 by local landowners and businessmen and built between 1791 and 1808, during the <a href="history%20of%20the%20British%20canal%20system%23The%20Golden%20Age">Golden Age of canal building</a>, at a cost of <a href="pound%20sterling">£127,700</a> (£ today). Originally designed for <a href="Narrowboat">narrow gauge boats</a>, during its construction the canal was altered into a <a href="Barge">broad gauge</a> canal to allow an ultimately unrealised connection with the <a href="Leeds%20and%20Liverpool%20Canal">Leeds and Liverpool Canal</a>. The canal company later converted into a <a href="railway">railway</a> company and built a railway line close to the canal's path, which required modifications to the Salford arm of the canal.

Most of the freight carried was coal from local <a href="coal%20mining">collieries</a> but, as the mines reached the end of their working lives sections of the canal fell into disuse and disrepair and it was officially abandoned in 1961. In 1987 a society was formed with the aim of restoring the canal for leisure use and, in 2006, restoration began in the area around the junction with the River Irwell in Salford. The canal is currently navigable as far as Oldfield Road, Salford.

The local geology of the <a href="Irwell%20Valley">Irwell Valley</a>, which included steep sided valleys with fast flowing rivers subject to rapid flooding and dry seasons, confined local river transport to the <a href="Mersey%20and%20Irwell%20Navigation">Mersey and Irwell Navigation</a>, west of Manchester. Financial unrest and British involvement in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> restricted local transport investment to road improvements.

With the arrival of more favourable conditions, including the end of the war, a proposal for a canal to link the towns of Manchester, Bolton and Bury was mooted. <a href="Matthew%20Fletcher%20%28mine%20owner%20and%20engineer%29">Matthew Fletcher</a> had in 1789 been employed as a technical advisor and had surveyed the route of the proposed canal, but the first public notice came from Manchester on 4 September 1790. The initial proposal probably came from a group in Bolton, with the support of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company. A meeting was "intended to be holden at the House of Mr Shawe, the Bull's Head in Manchester aforesaid, on Monday, the twentieth day of this instant, September, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon", where "Surveys, Plans, Levels, Estimates and Proposals" would be presented. A further meeting on 16 September, held in Bolton, appointed a committee of six Boltonians chaired by <a href="Thomas%20Egerton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Wilton">Lord Grey de Wilton</a> to attend at Manchester. A series of resolutions at this meeting followed a discussion of the route, and authorised the necessary actions to bring the plan into fruition, which included the petitioning of <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament</a> for the required <a href="Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">bill</a>. <a href="Hugh%20Henshall">Hugh Henshall</a> was asked to survey the proposed route of the canal.

For local industries along the route of the proposed canal, whose operations relied on water from local rivers and brooks which the canal might also use, its construction was a controversial idea. At a meeting in Bolton on 4 October 1790, it was resolved that "proper clauses be inserted in the bill to prevent injury to owners of <a href="Factory">mills</a>". A meeting in Bury at the Eagle & Child <a href="public%20house">public house</a> on 29 September 1790 secured an agreement that "the utility of this scheme nevertheless cannot with propriety be ascertained until such time as it has been certified, from whence and in what proportion the proprietors of the intended navigation expect to draw their resources of water". At another meeting in Bury, on 13 October 1790, <a href="Hugh%20Henshall">Hugh Henshall</a> gave a written report on the canal, and stated that his plan would not require water from the river in times of drought, but that floods and rivulets would supply his reservoirs. He suggested that mill owners could be protected by a suitable clause in the bill, and such a clause was duly obtained by <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Peel%2C%201st%20Baronet">Robert Peel</a>. Businesses in Bolton were concerned with the location of the canal terminus, and proposed the construction of a tunnel to allow the terminus to be built closer to the town centre. Ralph Fletcher, spokesman for those concerned, reported on this proposal to the committee, although no tunnel was built.

In a document entitled "A list of subscribers to the intended Bolton Bury and Manchester Canal Navigation", now kept in the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20County%20Record%20Office">Greater Manchester County Record Office</a>, some of the more notable subscribers are listed, along with the amounts invested by each. Many of the 95 investments on the list appear to have been made by <a href="Proxy%20voting">proxy</a>. The largest is £3,000, and the smallest £100. The total sum of investments is £47,700. £5 per £100 <a href="Share%20%28finance%29">share</a> was initially paid, with an additional £10 call made by 10 August 1791. Similar share calls were made at regular intervals over the following years. The first dividend of 4% was paid in July 1812, with regular payments following thereafter.

Following a parliamentary survey of the route by Charles McNiven, the bill received <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> on 13 May 1791 and became an <a href="Manchester%2C%20Bolton%20and%20Bury%20Canal%20Act%201791">Act of Parliament</a> for the construction of the canal, by which "the proprietors were empowered to purchase land for a breadth of 26 yards on level ground, and wider where required for cuttings or embankments." The Act allowed the company to raise £47,000, with shares of £100. The intention was that at <a href="Prestolee">Prestolee</a> the route would divide into two branches (<a href="canal%20arm">arms</a>), with one branch towards Bolton and the other to Bury, but it would not, however, join the River Irwell. The proprietors were entitled to take water from any brooks within of the canal, or within of the canal summits at Bolton and Bury.

At a meeting in Manchester on 30 June 1791, at the house of Alexander Patten, a committee was formed with the following members:


The meeting secured a resolution that "Matthew Fletcher and Mr McNiven shall dispatch or procure 100 wheelbarrows and as many planks as they shall think necessary for the use and accommodation of the canal navigation". Further meetings took place from 26–29 July. Matthew Fletcher was ordered to meet with land owners to discuss the purchase of any land along the route of the canal, and with this in mind, on 30 July 1791 John Seddon of Sandy Lane was ordered to survey the line of the canal beginning within the estate of John Edenson Heathcote, and ending at the southern extremity of the <a href="Agecroft%20Hall">Reverend Dauntesey's estate</a>. Fletcher and Henshall were ordered to contact people and companies in the building trade to discuss construction.

At a meeting on 16 August 1791, "several persons" attended, and made offers for the contract to build the canal. A Mr John Seddon of <a href="Little%20Hulton">Little Hulton</a>, a labourer, agreed to a contract on Matthew Fletcher's terms, for a "certain part of the canal". Five other persons were rejected, their proposals not receiving the "approbation" of the committee.

With news of the planned <a href="Rochdale%20Canal">Rochdale Canal</a> link into Manchester, the company proposed to extend the canal from Bury through <a href="Littleborough%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Littleborough</a>, and to connect with the Rochdale Canal at Sladen. The new route, known as the Bury and Sladen Canal, was intended as a rival scheme to the proposed Rochdale link into Manchester. A survey was also carried out on a proposed extension from Sladen to <a href="Sowerby%20Bridge">Sowerby Bridge</a>. The company also considered links to the <a href="Leeds%20and%20Liverpool%20Canal">Leeds and Liverpool Canal</a> and the <a href="Mersey%20and%20Irwell%20Navigation">Mersey and Irwell Navigation</a>. These plans would have substantially increased the trans-Pennine traffic using the company's canal, and caused a potential loss of traffic and revenue on the nearby <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a>. With this in mind, the owner of the Bridgewater Canal, the <a href="Francis%20Egerton%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Bridgewater">Duke of Bridgewater</a>, agreed to allow the Rochdale Canal Company to connect to his canal at Manchester. Despite the persistence of the canal company, the Rochdale Canal plan won the day and in 1797 the company abandoned the Bury and Sladen Canal plan.

After several years of construction, on 9 January 1794 an agreement was reached with the Leeds and Liverpool Canal Company to create a link from the Bolton arm of the canal to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Red Moss, near <a href="Horwich">Horwich</a>. This agreement required significant design changes to allow the canal to carry the wider boats used on the broad gauge Leeds and Liverpool Canal, which included a change to <a href="Locks%20%28water%20transport%29%23Doubled%2C%20paired%20or%20twinned%20locks">broad locks</a>. <a href="Benjamin%20Outram">Benjamin Outram</a> was employed to inspect the works, and reported on the cost of this conversion as being £26,924. Although the necessary changes were implemented, the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was altered and the link was not built. In the same year the <a href="Haslingden%20Canal">Haslingden Canal</a> link to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was proposed, from the Bury arm of the canal. Although authorised by an Act of Parliament, it too was never built. The canal company remained hopeful of a link between the two canals, but all hope of this was lost when on 21 June 1819 an Act of Parliament was enacted to create a link between the <a href="Leigh%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Leigh</a> extension of the <a href="Bridgewater%20Canal">Bridgewater Canal</a>, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

A report entitled "A Statement of the Situation of the Works of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal, on the Eighteenth of December, 1795." gives details of the progress of the works, including details of bridges, cuttings, raised bankings and aqueducts. Much of the document details the work required to convert the canal to broad gauge. A length between Oldfield Lane in Salford and Giants Seat Locks in Outwood was navigable with 3 ft 8 in (1.12 m) of water. The remaining work included strengthening work to the banks, an increase of water depth to , and the gravelling of half of the towpath. Between Giants Seat locks and <a href="Stoneclough">Ringley Bridge</a> two locks had been erected, with a small section of canal to be broadened before becoming navigable. From Ringley Bridge to Prestolee Aqueduct one lock had been erected. Nob End Locks were still under construction but mostly complete, although the basin at the bottom had not yet been dug. The stretch to Bolton had at this time been widened, with several bridges requiring further work, incomplete embankments, construction of a weir, and gravelling of the towpath. On the Bury arm, almost the entire length had been dug, and walls to support the canal along the bank of the Irwell had been built. Some widening of previously narrow sections had yet to be undertaken, none of the towpath had been gravelled, and no fences had been erected along the towpath.

Significant parts of the canal were completed by 1796, including the stretch up to Bury in October of that year. With the completion of the Bolton arm in the following year, much of the canal opened for business. The connection to <a href="Fletcher%27s%20Canal">Fletcher's Canal</a> was completed in 1800, but with the failure of the scheme to connect the Bolton arm of the canal to the <a href="Leeds%20and%20Liverpool%20Canal">Leeds and Liverpool Canal</a>, the canal remained isolated from any other navigable waterway. One proposed remedy involved the construction of an aqueduct over the River Irwell in Manchester, to connect directly to the Rochdale Canal between <a href="Castlefield">Castlefield</a> and Piccadilly. A bill was proposed in 1799 but after strong objections from the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company they eventually gave up and subsequently, over the following seven years, the canal company purchased enough land to build a canal link directly to the Irwell.

During construction the company, having spent all of the money allowed in the 1791 Act of Parliament, incurred a debt of £31,345. They therefore applied for a further Act to raise more money. This act, granted in 1805, allowed them to raise an additional £80,000. This allowed them to repay the debt, and continue work to finish the canal. An inspection in June 1808 reported that by November 1808 the canal would be complete throughout.

A connection to the Rochdale Canal was eventually built in 1839 via the <a href="Manchester%20and%20Salford%20Junction%20Canal">Manchester and Salford Junction Canal</a>, which was funded in part by the proprietors of the MB&B canal.

Most of the traffic along the canal transported coal from the many collieries that existed along its length, such as <a href="Outwood%20Colliery">Outwood Colliery</a> and <a href="Ladyshore%20Colliery">Ladyshore Colliery</a>. Some of these pits were linked to the canal by road, and some by short <a href="Tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramlines</a>. In the late 19th century as much as of coal and of other materials including <a href="night%20soil">night soil</a> and fruit were transported annually. The canal also enabled the transport of <a href="Salt%20in%20Cheshire">salt from Cheshire</a> to the many <a href="bleach">bleach</a> and <a href="dye">dye</a> works in its area – hence the name of Salt Wharf on the Bolton arm of the canal. Tolls were easily calculated as milestones were placed along the towpath at ¼ mile (400 m) intervals. This was important as journeys were often quite short, the collieries being so close to industry along the canal's length.
The boats used to transport coal were short and narrow, and each contained a row of boxes used for carrying coal. Each box had a base of two halves, hinged and held closed with chains. These boxes would be lifted out of the boats, positioned by <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> over a bunker or cart and emptied by releasing the chains on the base. This design helped keep the canal competitive, as it increased the speed with which loading and unloading of the boats could be performed.

The canal would often freeze in winter, so an <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a> was used to ensure the canal remained navigable during the cold weather. Named "Sarah Lansdale" and owned by James Crompton Paperworks, it was towed by a team of horses while the crew stood astride the deck, secured to the handrails, rocking the boat from side to side and breaking the ice in the process. Often, ice would be encountered that was so thick the boat would rise up onto the surface of the ice. This boat did once reside at the boat museum in <a href="Ellesmere%20Port%20Dock">Ellesmere Port Dock</a> but was later destroyed by fire.

Food and drink was made available to those using the canal in several places including Margaret Barlow's Tea Gardens, Kilcoby Cottage and Rhodes Lock. A camping ground was also available at Kilcoby Cottage. The nearby Giant's Seat House was for some time the home of the canal manager.

The canal also carried <a href="Packet%20trade">packet services</a>, with passengers facing a three-hour journey between Bolton and Manchester. The first passenger boat to Bolton was launched in 1796 from the Windsor Castle public house, and in 1798 a new packet boat was built for the use of the company. Fares were initially fixed by the canal company (although from 1805 contracted-out) and based upon the service required; a passenger using the state cabin from Bolton to Manchester would be charged one <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a> six <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">pence</a>, and a single shilling on the return journey. Passengers would change boats at Prestolee to avoid delays at the lock flight and also to save water, and a purpose-built covered walkway the length of the road was constructed for their benefit. Another passenger service ran along the two arms from Bolton to Bury, and over 60,000 passengers per year travelled on the canal; between July 1833 and June 1834, 21,060 made the journey from Bolton to Manchester, 21,212 people travelled from Manchester to Bolton, and 20,818 intermediary passengers hopped on and off the boats en route. In 1834 the Bolton to Manchester service earned £1,177 and the Bolton to Bury service earned £75. The service was quite luxurious compared to some packet boat services: central heating was provided in winter and drinks were served on board. This caused a tragedy in 1818, however, when a party of twenty drunken passengers managed to capsize the boat and a number of passengers, including two children, were drowned.

Several fatal incidents combined with general passenger concern caused the canal company to improve passenger safety; in 1802 a wall was built at the wharf at Oldfield Lane in Salford and in 1833 a <a href="Gas%20lighting">gas lamp</a> was installed at Ringley Wharf.

A parcel service was also offered, although this proved unpopular as it was unreliable.

In March 1829 the idea of building a branch railway line from the Oldfield Road terminus in Salford to the new <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Liverpool and Manchester Railway</a> was mooted, but nothing was built. In 1830 the canal company, led by chairman Sir John Tobin, began to promote a proposal to build a railway along the line of the canal, from Salford to Bolton. Alexander Nimmo was employed to report on the proposal and told that it was possible "so far as he expressed himself capable of judging from his present cursory view of the canal". The shareholders then sought a bill for a railway from Bolton to Manchester and on 23 August 1831 obtained an Act of Parliament to become the "Company of Proprietors of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Navigation and Railway Company". They were empowered to build a line from Manchester to Bolton and Bury, "upon or near the line of ... the Canal", and a branch from <a href="Clifton%20Aqueduct">Clifton Aqueduct</a> through to <a href="Great%20Lever">Great Lever</a>. In 1832 this company obtained an Act that allowed it to build the railway. Due mainly to the objections of local mine owners who would have lost access to the canal and supplies, and would not have had branch railways built for them, the company agreed to an amending bill which would keep the canal and allow the new railway to be constructed alongside it. Due to technical and financial constraints the branch to Bury was never built. The canal therefore survived, although locks 4 and 5 in Salford were moved and combined into a two-rise <a href="staircase%20locks">staircase</a>, with a second tunnel built underneath the line which became known as the <a href="Manchester%20and%20Bolton%20Railway">Manchester and Bolton Railway</a>.

The line opened on 28 May 1838, and the company had purchased four <a href="Steam%20locomotive">locomotives</a> from <a href="Bury%2C%20Curtis%2C%20and%20Kennedy">Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy</a>, two from <a href="George%20Forrester%20and%20Company">George Forrester and Company</a>, and two from <a href="William%20Fairbairn%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Fairbairn & Sons</a>. Between the opening date and 9 January 1839 the railway carried 228,799 passengers – far more than had been carried on the canal. Shortly thereafter passenger services on the canal ceased and the boats were sold off. In 1846 the company was taken over by the <a href="Manchester%20and%20Leeds%20Railway">Manchester and Leeds Railway</a>, which itself became the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (L&YR) the following year. In 1890 the L&YR widened the line through Salford. Locks 4, 5 and 6 were moved slightly to the north and the tunnel under the railway was replaced by a bridge (although it is still referred to as a tunnel).

In 1922 the L&YR amalgamated into the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>, and in 1923 this company amalgamated into the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a>. This company was nationalised in 1948 under the <a href="Transport%20Act%201947">Transport Act 1947</a> and became part of <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a>.

By 1924 the Bolton arm had experienced a significant fall in traffic, although until the 1930s, when colliery closures reduced traffic even further, coal trade remained brisk. By 1935 <a href="Fletcher%27s%20Canal">Fletcher's Canal</a> had fallen into disuse. Burst banks alongside the Irwell and <a href="River%20Croal">Croal</a> rivers (caused largely by subsidence from mining activities) were common. A major <a href="%23Breaches">breach</a> occurred in 1936 and was never repaired. of land around this breach was purchased from the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a> by Cream's Paper Mill, who subsequently built over part of the canal.

On 2 March 1937 the London, Midland and Scottish Railway held a <a href="Special%20General%20Meeting">Special General Meeting</a> during which they proposed to abandon the canal from Clifton Aqueduct to Bailey Bridge, from Bailey Bridge to Bury, and the entire Bolton arm from Nob End Locks to Bolton. The proposal was not carried but four years later, under the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Act of 1941, they abandoned of the canal, including a section from Prestolee to Clifton and the entire Bolton arm. In 1939, during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Ministry of Transport</a> ordered a half-mile section in Agecroft piped, to reduce the risk of German bomb damage damaging the adjacent <a href="Magnesium%20Elektron">Magnesium Elektron Company's</a> site.

Although it continued to generate revenue from the sale of water, tolls produced only a small proportion of the canal's income. In 1946, against expenses of £12,500, it earned a total of £7,296, of which only £471 was from tolls. In 1951 total income was £8,815 against a total expenditure of £9,574. In the same year, the canal carried of coal and no other materials.

A British Transport Commission report of 1955 included the canal in its list of "Waterways having insufficient commercial prospects to justify their retention for navigation". Following an Act of Parliament, in 1961 the canal was abandoned. A single coal delivery service between Sion Street and Bury Moors continued until 1968, but this was the last commercial traffic to use the canal.

There are several notable features along the canal, including <a href="Prestolee%20Aqueduct">Prestolee Aqueduct</a> and <a href="Clifton%20Aqueduct">Clifton Aqueduct</a>, both of which are Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed structures</a>. <a href="Nob%20End">Nob End Locks</a> (sometimes referred to as Prestolee Locks) sit at the junction of the three arms of the canal at Nob End. They comprise two sets of three <a href="staircase%20locks">staircase locks</a>, separated by a passing basin. These locks served to lower the level of the canal by over a distance of . The upper staircase is still visible, but most of the lower staircase was filled in at some point in the 1950s, and much of the stonework was removed.

A major breach of the canal along the Bury arm revealed the scale of the engineering used in the construction of the retaining wall. <a href="Rail%20profile">Railway rails</a>, which were used to increase the strength of the walls, are still clearly visible at the site of the breach.

The Mount Sion <a href="steam%20crane">steam crane</a> (a depiction of which is used as the logo of the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society) sits rusting and unused at Mount Sion, on the Bury arm. One of the earliest surviving cranes in England, it was built some time about 1875–1884 for Mount Sion Bleach Works by Thomas Smith & Sons of <a href="Rodley%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Rodley</a> and was used to unload coal boxes from barges into the yard below the canal. It was granted <a href="listed%20building">Grade II listed status</a> in 2011.

The canal was originally supplied by the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a> in Bury, at the Weddell Brook tributary. This proved insufficient for local industry and in 1842 <a href="Elton%20Reservoir">Elton Reservoir</a> at Bury was built to become the canal's principal supply. Although the Bury and Bolton arms are on one level, the Salford arm used seventeen broad locks, including some in staircases (Nob End, for example), to descend over from the <a href="Route%20summit">summit</a> level to the lowest point at Salford. <a href="Robert%20Fulton">Robert Fulton</a> had proposed an <a href="canal%20inclined%20plane">inclined plane</a> at Nob End, but this design was rejected. The connection with <a href="Fletcher%27s%20Canal">Fletcher's Canal</a> near Clifton Aqueduct was made by a <a href="Locks%20%28water%20transport%29%23Variations">single lock</a> long by wide, with a drop of .

Although the canal was originally designed to be a narrow canal with narrow locks for boats wide, in 1794 an agreement was reached with the <a href="Leeds%20and%20Liverpool%20Canal">Leeds and Liverpool Canal</a> company to create a link near Red Moss near <a href="Horwich">Horwich</a>, so broad locks were built to accommodate the wide boats using that canal. This meant removing some of the narrow locks that had already been built. An extension to the original canal feeder was built at Weddell Brook in Bury, alongside the River Irwell. The route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was changed, however, and the planned link never materialised. The design changes to the canal were not completely without merit, since they allowed two narrowboats to use each lock simultaneously, saving passage time and water.

Much of the Bury arm of the canal runs alongside the River Irwell through the Irwell Valley, and eventually required the construction of huge retaining walls to prevent the canal bank from sliding down the hill. Similar strengthening, although on a smaller scale, was required on the Bolton arm where it ran alongside the <a href="River%20Croal">River Croal</a>. Through these sections the towpath is normally on the side of the canal closest to the river.
Six aqueducts were required to allow the canal to cross the River Irwell, the <a href="River%20Tonge">River Tonge</a> and four roads. On the Bolton arm these were Hall Lane Aqueduct, Fogg's Aqueduct and the larger Damside Aqueduct, all of which have since been demolished. Hall Lane Aqueduct was damaged by mining subsidence and replaced in 1884–1885. It was demolished in 1950. The Salford arm flowed over <a href="Prestolee%20Aqueduct">Prestolee Aqueduct</a>, then <a href="Clifton%20Aqueduct">Clifton Aqueduct</a>, and finally the smaller Lumn's Lane Aqueduct (since demolished).

Many bridges were also constructed, along the length of the canal. Most were of small design allowing access to farmland, although many are wide enough for a <a href="horse%20and%20cart">horse and cart</a>. In places where the canal crossed important thoroughfares, such as Water Street in <a href="Radcliffe%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Radcliffe</a>, Radcliffe Road in <a href="Darcy%20Lever">Darcy Lever</a> and Agecroft Road in <a href="Pendlebury">Pendlebury</a>, larger bridges were constructed.

Cranes were used along the many wharfs on the canal to offload cargo. One of these, a <a href="steam%20crane">steam crane</a> at Mount Sion, still exists (albeit in poor condition). At Bury Wharf a traversing steam crane positioned between the two arms of the terminus would offload cargo to be loaded into waiting lorries and a similar system was used at Radcliffe Wharf.

In 1795 costs of construction were detailed as follows:

The total cost of construction was £127,700.

The canal has suffered several major breaches throughout its history. As early as 1799 a flood carried away large sections of the lower banks, and on 15 October 1853 two boats were swept through a breach near the bottom of Nob End Locks (no injuries were reported). Three breaches were reported from 1878–1879, in Little Lever and Darcy Lever, the latter near Burnden Chemical Works. <a href="Subsidence">Subsidence</a>, caused by mining activity, prompted a breach near Agecroft in 1881. As a result of such incidents, from 1881 to 1888 engineer Edwin Muir was employed to reduce the subsidence caused by mining activity. Similar work was undertaken throughout the 1920s. Maps from the 1880s show that by then, to safeguard against further subsidence, the canal company had purchased areas of coal beneath the canal. In 1884 the canal's owners, the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a>, successfully sued colliery owners Knowles & Sons for losses incurred from damage caused by subsidence. Following this judgement, the railway company settled out of court with other colliery owners. Constant repairs were made, particularly through Pendleton, where the embankment was periodically raised. Some bridges were lifted far above their original supports, while others sank as low as above head height.

One of the most serious breaches occurred on 6 July 1936 near Nob End, close to the junction of the canal's three arms, reported by the "<a href="Manchester%20Evening%20News">Manchester Evening News</a>" the following day. It was never repaired and although the canal saw continued use between Ladyshore Colliery and Bury, it eventually closed in 1961.

Almost 60% of the canal's original length is no longer in water. Bury Wharf is now covered by an industrial estate. A car park has been built on top of the canal, near <a href="Daisyfield%20Viaduct">Daisyfield Viaduct</a>, but from there on the towpath remains accessible. The canal, in water but overgrown with weeds, is culverted under Water Street in <a href="Radcliffe%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Radcliffe</a>. It continues in water up to a dam at Ladyshore, following which the foundations of a demolished paper mill, built in 1956, may be found.

The 1936 breach was never repaired and presents a significant gap in the canal's route. On the Salford arm, although in good condition, the top three locks at <a href="Prestolee">Prestolee</a> are derelict; the bottom three have been removed. The canal is in water from the bottom of the lock flight through to Ringley Locks. Ringley Bridge is infilled, as is the canal through Ringley Village and Giants Seat Locks. Kilcoby Bridge is missing and from there the canal is inaccessible until it reaches the <a href="M60%20motorway">M60 motorway</a>. Overgrown, Rhodes Lock is still in reasonable condition. One or more <a href="electricity%20pylon">electricity pylon</a>s straddle the infilled canal between Rhodes Lock and the motorway, which has been built over the line of the canal. A <a href="Sewage%20treatment">sludge lagoon</a> built during the motorway's construction blocks a short section toward Clifton Aqueduct. The canal does not take water again until beyond Clifton Aqueduct, where a short length exists between the former <a href="Pilkington%27s%20Lancastrian%20Pottery%20%26amp%3B%20Tiles">Pilkington</a> factory and the <a href="Enersys">Enersys</a> factory. Lumn's Lane Aqueduct is missing but the canal is in water between there and Holland Street. Beyond this point the canal is infilled and in parts built over, especially through Pendleton. Its junction with the River Irwell in Salford has recently been restored and made navigable.

The Bolton arm of the canal is interrupted by the absence of Hall Lane Aqueduct at Little Lever, which was demolished in 1950 to make way for the widening of Hall Lane. In Darcy Lever, Damside Aqueduct, which crossed Radcliffe Road and the Tonge River, is also missing, having been demolished in June 1965. The route of <a href="A666%20road">St Peter's Way</a> has almost entirely destroyed a significant section of the canal as it heads into the centre of Bolton and Church Wharf no longer exists. The last section of the Bolton arm of the canal still in water is currently used for fishing.

The entire route of the canal is protected from any adverse development that would prevent its restoration, having been included in the <a href="unitary%20development%20plan">unitary development plan</a>s of <a href="City%20of%20Salford%23Council">Salford City Council</a>, <a href="Bolton%23Governance">Bolton Council</a> and <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Bury">Bury Council</a>.

To help secure the canal's future, in 1987 the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Society was formed to protect the canal and campaign for restoration. Despite the aforementioned problems, on 21 October 2005 <a href="British%20Waterways">British Waterways</a> announced funding from <a href="Structural%20Funds%20and%20Cohesion%20Funds%23Regional%20Competitiveness%20and%20Employment%20Objective%20%28Formerly%20Objective%202%29">European Objective Two Funding</a>, the <a href="Northwest%20Regional%20Development%20Agency">Northwest Regional Development Agency</a> (NWDA) and Salford City Council for a restoration scheme at the newly named <a href="Middlewood%20Locks">Middlewood Locks</a> in Salford, which began in September 2006. Restoration was halted briefly by the discovery of what was initially thought to be a <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> bomb but which proved to be a wartime American mortar with no explosive content. Pilings for the tunnel under the <a href="Manchester%20to%20Preston%20Line">Manchester to Preston Line</a> were completed in 2008. The missing Irwell towpath bridge, known as Bloody Bridge, which once crossed the canal's entrance, was replaced with an arched timber structure incorporating elements of the old lock 1. Much of the canal's existing masonry has been re-used and, where possible, the original washwalls were grouted and pointed. The original river locks 1 and 2 were replaced by a single deep lock.

Completion was scheduled for the end of July 2008 and marked with an opening ceremony on 19 September that year, during which the new Margaret Fletcher tunnel under the <a href="Manchester%20Inner%20Ring%20Road">Manchester Inner Ring Road</a> was formally named. Full restoration of the canal could create up to 6,000 jobs and add an annual £6M to the local economy. The total cost is estimated at £60M. The next planned major restoration may be along Salford Crescent.

Local volunteers under the guidance of the Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal Society have for years worked on sections of the canal, removing overgrowth and tidying up its general appearance. A new pedestrian footbridge, designed by artist <a href="Liam%20Curtin">Liam Curtin</a>, was opened at Nob End Locks in April 2013. Made entirely out of scaled-up pieces of <a href="Meccano">Meccano</a>, it was built by society volunteers and other members of the public at a cost of about £90,000. Toward the end of 2015, work began to excavate the buried locks of the Nob End flight, exposing the 6 locks. Infill beneath the first bridge on the canal's Bolton arm was also excavated, exposing the towpath for the first time in decades that was previously hidden by infill.

Boeing 757

The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, <a href="Narrow-body%20aircraft">narrow-body</a> <a href="twinjet">twin-engine</a> <a href="jet%20airliner">jet airliner</a> that was designed and built by <a href="Boeing%20Commercial%20Airplanes">Boeing Commercial Airplanes</a>. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The <a href="twinjet">twinjet</a> has a two-crew member <a href="glass%20cockpit">glass cockpit</a>, <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional <a href="tailplane">tail</a> and, for reduced <a href="aerodynamic%20drag">aerodynamic drag</a>, a <a href="supercritical%20airfoil">supercritical wing</a> design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine <a href="Boeing%20727">727</a> on <a href="Flight%20length">short and medium</a> routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a <a href="Wide-body%20aircraft">wide-body</a> twinjet, the <a href="Boeing%20767">767</a>, and, owing to shared features, pilots can obtain a common <a href="type%20rating">type rating</a> that allows them to operate both aircraft.

The 757 was produced in two <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a> lengths. The original entered service in 1983; the , a package <a href="Cargo%20aircraft">freighter</a> (PF) variant, and the , a passenger-freighter <a href="Combi%20aircraft">combi</a> model, debuted in the late 1980s. The stretched , the longest narrow-body twinjet ever produced, began service in 1999. Passenger have been modified to special freighter (SF) specification for cargo use, while military derivatives include the <a href="Boeing%20C-32">C-32</a> transport, VIP carriers, and other multi-purpose aircraft. Private and government operators have also customized the 757 for research and transport roles. All 757s are powered by <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a> or <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW2000">Pratt & Whitney PW2000</a> series turbofans.

<a href="Eastern%20Air%20Lines">Eastern Air Lines</a> and <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> placed the 757 in commercial service in 1983. The narrow-body twinjet succeeded earlier single-aisle airliners, and became commonly used for short and mid-range <a href="Domestic%20flight">domestic routes</a>, <a href="Air%20shuttle">shuttle services</a>, and <a href="Transcontinental%20flight%20across%20the%20United%20States">transcontinental U.S. flights</a>. After regulators granted approval for extended flights over water (<a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a>) in 1986, airlines also began using the aircraft for intercontinental routes. Major customers for the 757 included U.S. <a href="Mainline%20%28flight%29">mainline</a> carriers, European <a href="charter%20airline">charter airline</a>s, and cargo companies. The airliner has recorded eight <a href="Hull%20loss">hull-loss accidents</a>, including seven fatal crashes, .

Production of the 757 ended in October 2004, after 1,050 had been built for 54 customers. The was by far the most popular model, with 913 built. Diminished sales amid an airline industry trend toward smaller jetliners led Boeing to end production without a direct replacement, in favor of the <a href="Boeing%20737">737</a> family. The last 757 was delivered to <a href="Shanghai%20Airlines">Shanghai Airlines</a> in November 2005. In July 2017, 666 of the narrow-body twinjets were in airline service; <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> was the largest operator with 127 aircraft.

In the early 1970s, following the launch of the wide-body <a href="Boeing%20747">747</a>, Boeing began considering further developments of its narrow-body <a href="Boeing%20727">727</a> <a href="trijet">trijet</a>. Designed for short and medium length routes, the three-engined 727 was the best-selling commercial jetliner of the 1960s and a mainstay of the U.S. domestic airline market. Studies focused on improving the 189-seat , the most successful 727 variant. Two approaches were considered: a stretched , and an all-new aircraft code-named 7N7. The former was a cheaper derivative using the 727's existing technology and tail-mounted engine configuration, while the latter was a twin-engine aircraft which made use of new materials and improvements to propulsion technology which had become available in the civil aerospace industry.
<a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> provided input for the proposed 727-300, which Boeing was poised to launch in late 1975, but lost interest after examining development studies for the 7N7. Although the was offered to <a href="Braniff%20International%20Airways">Braniff International Airways</a> and other carriers, customer interest remained insufficient for further development. Instead, airlines were drawn to the <a href="High-bypass%20turbofan">high-bypass-ratio turbofan</a> engines, new flight deck technologies, lower weight, improved <a href="aerodynamics">aerodynamics</a>, and reduced operating cost promised by the 7N7. These features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size wide-body airliner, code-named 7X7, which became the 767. Work on both proposals accelerated as a result of the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.

By 1978, development studies focused on two variants: a with seating for 160, and a with room for over 180 seats. New features included a redesigned wing, under-wing engines, and lighter materials, while the forward fuselage, cockpit layout, and <a href="T-tail">T-tail</a> configuration were retained from the 727. Boeing planned for the aircraft to offer the lowest fuel burn per passenger-kilometer of any narrow-body airliner. On August 31, 1978, Eastern Air Lines and British Airways became the first carriers to publicly commit to the 7N7 when they announced launch orders totaling 40 aircraft for the version. These orders were signed in March 1979, when Boeing officially designated the aircraft as the 757. The shorter did not receive any orders and was dropped; 737s later fulfilled its envisioned role.

The 757 was intended to be more capable and more efficient than the preceding 727. The focus on <a href="fuel%20efficiency">fuel efficiency</a> reflected airline concerns over <a href="operating%20cost">operating cost</a>s, which had grown amid rising oil prices during the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a> of 1973. Design targets included a 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption from new engines, plus an additional 10 percent from aerodynamic improvements, versus preceding aircraft. Lighter materials and new wings were also expected to improve efficiency. The <a href="maximum%20take-off%20weight">maximum take-off weight</a> (MTOW) was set at , which was more than the 727. The 757's higher <a href="thrust-to-weight%20ratio">thrust-to-weight ratio</a> allowed it to take off from short runways and serve airports in <a href="hot%20and%20high">hot and high</a> climates, offering better <a href="takeoff">takeoff</a> performance than that offered by competing aircraft. Competitors needed longer takeoff runs at airports at higher elevations, with higher ambient temperatures and thinner air. Boeing also offered options for higher <a href="Payload%20%28air%20and%20space%20craft%29">payload capability</a>.
The twin-engine configuration was chosen for greater fuel efficiency versus three- and four-engine designs. Launch customers Eastern Air Lines and British Airways selected the turbofan built by <a href="Rolls-Royce%20plc">Rolls-Royce</a>, which was capable of of <a href="Jet%20engine%23Thrust">thrust</a>. This marked the first time that a Boeing airliner was launched with engines produced outside the U.S. Domestic manufacturer <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney">Pratt & Whitney</a> subsequently offered the thrust PW2037, which Delta Air Lines launched with an order for 60 aircraft in November 1980. <a href="General%20Electric%20Aviation">General Electric</a> also offered its engine early in the program, but eventually abandoned its involvement due to insufficient demand.

As development progressed, the 757 increasingly departed from its 727 origins and adopted elements from the 767, which was several months ahead in development. To reduce risk and cost, Boeing combined design work on both twinjets, resulting in shared features such as interior fittings and handling characteristics. <a href="Computer-aided%20design">Computer-aided design</a>, first applied on the 767, was used for over one-third of the 757's design drawings. In early 1979, a common two-crew member glass cockpit was adopted for the two aircraft, including shared instrumentation, <a href="avionics">avionics</a>, and <a href="flight%20management%20system">flight management system</a>s. In October 1979 the nose was widened and dropped to reduce aerodynamic noise by six dB, to improve the flight deck view and to give more working area for the crew for greater commonality with the 767, as the T-tail was substituted by a conventional tail earlier in the year. <a href="Cathode-ray%20tube">Cathode-ray tube</a> (CRT) color displays replaced conventional <a href="electromechanics">electromechanical</a> instruments, with increased automation eliminating the <a href="flight%20engineer">flight engineer</a> position common to three-person cockpits. After completing a short conversion course, pilots rated on the 757 could be qualified to fly the 767 and vice versa, owing to their design similarities.
A new <a href="Supercritical%20airfoil">aft-loaded</a> shape which produced <a href="Lift%20%28force%29">lift</a> across most of the upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous <a href="airfoil">airfoil</a> designs, was used for the 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> than the 727's produced less <a href="lift-induced%20drag">lift-induced drag</a>, while larger <a href="wing%20root">wing root</a>s increased <a href="Landing%20gear">undercarriage</a> storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.

One of the last 727 vestiges, the T-tail, was dropped in mid-1979 in favor of a conventional tail. This avoided the risk of an aerodynamic condition known as a <a href="Deep%20stall%23Deep%20stall">deep stall</a>, and allowed for more passengers to be carried in a less tapered rear fuselage. At in length, the was longer than the , and with a greater proportion of its internal volume devoted to cabin space, seating was available for 239 passengers, or 50 more than its predecessor. The fuselage cross-section, whose upper lobe was common to the <a href="Boeing%20707">707</a> and 737, was the only major structural feature to be retained from the 727. This was mainly to reduce drag, and while a wider fuselage had been considered, Boeing's market research found low cargo capacity needs and reduced passenger preference for wide-body aircraft on short-haul routes.

Boeing built a final assembly line in Washington at its <a href="Boeing%20Renton%20Factory">Renton factory</a>, home of 707, 727, and 737 production, to produce the 757. Early in the development program, Boeing, British Airways, and Rolls-Royce unsuccessfully lobbied the British aircraft industry to manufacture 757 wings. Ultimately, about half of the aircraft's components, including the wings, nose section, and <a href="empennage">empennage</a>, were produced in-house at Boeing facilities, and the remainder subcontracted to primarily U.S.-based companies. <a href="Fairchild%20Aircraft">Fairchild Aircraft</a> made the <a href="leading%20edge%20slat">leading edge slat</a>s, <a href="Grumman">Grumman</a> supplied the <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>, and <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell International</a> produced the main fuselage. Production ramp-up for the new narrow-body airliner coincided with the winding-down of the 727 program, and final assembly of the first aircraft began in January 1981.
The prototype 757 rolled out of the Renton factory on January 13, 1982. The aircraft, equipped with engines, completed its maiden flight one week ahead of schedule on February 19, 1982. The first flight was affected by an <a href="Stall%20%28engine%29">engine stall</a>, following indications of low <a href="oil%20pressure">oil pressure</a>. After checking system diagnostics, company test pilot John Armstrong and co-pilot Lew Wallick were able to restart the affected engine, and the flight proceeded normally thereafter. Subsequently, the 757 embarked on a seven-day weekly flight test schedule. By this time, the aircraft had received 136 orders from seven carriers, namely <a href="Air%20Florida">Air Florida</a>, <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a>, <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a>, <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Air%20Lines">Eastern Air Lines</a>, <a href="Monarch%20Airlines">Monarch Airlines</a>, and <a href="Transbrasil">Transbrasil</a>.

The seven-month 757 flight test program used the first five aircraft built. Tasks included flight systems and propulsion tests, hot and cold weather trials, and route-proving flights. Data from the 767 program helped expedite the process. After design issues were identified, the 757's exit doors received dual-spring mechanisms for easier operation, and the fuselage was strengthened for greater <a href="bird%20strike">bird strike</a> resistance. The production aircraft was lighter than originally specified, and recorded a three percent better-than-expected rate of fuel burn. This resulted in a range increase of , and prompted Boeing to tout the aircraft's fuel efficiency characteristics. After 1,380 flight test hours, the RB211-powered 757 received U.S. <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) certification on December 21, 1982, followed by UK <a href="Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Aviation Authority</a> (CAA) certification on January 14, 1983. The first delivery to launch customer Eastern Air Lines occurred on December 22, 1982, about four months after the first 767 deliveries. The first 757 with PW2037 engines rolled out about one year later, and was delivered to Delta Air Lines on November 5, 1984.

Eastern Air Lines operated the first commercial 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route. On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Trident">Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B</a> trijets. Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and <a href="Air%20Europe">Air Europe</a> also began 757 operations later that year. Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners. Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose. Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved fuel burn and the use of a two-crew member flight deck. Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40 percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.

Despite the successful debut, 757 sales remained stagnant for most of the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-<a href="Airline%20Deregulation%20Act">deregulation</a> U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-80">McDonnell Douglas MD-80</a> were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when <a href="Northwest%20Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a> placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a>, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from <a href="Nepal%20Airlines">Royal Nepal Airlines</a>. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.

In the late 1980s, increasing <a href="airline%20hub">airline hub</a> congestion and the onset of U.S. airport <a href="noise%20regulation">noise regulation</a>s fueled a turnaround in 757 sales. From 1988 to 1989, airlines placed 322 orders, including a combined 160 orders from American Airlines and United Airlines. By this time, the 757 had become commonplace on short-haul domestic flights and <a href="Transcontinental%20flight%20across%20the%20United%20States">transcontinental</a> services in the U.S., and had replaced aging 707s, 727s, <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a>s, and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-9">McDonnell Douglas DC-9</a>s. The maximum range of , which was over one-and-a-half times the 727's, allowed airlines to use the aircraft on longer <a href="nonstop%20flight">nonstop</a> routes. The 757 was also flown out of airports with stringent noise regulations, such as <a href="John%20Wayne%20Airport">John Wayne Airport</a> in Orange County, California, and airports with aircraft size restrictions, such as <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20Washington%20National%20Airport">Washington National Airport</a> near downtown Washington, D.C. The largest U.S. operators, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, would ultimately operate fleets of over 100 aircraft each.
In Europe, British Airways, <a href="Iberia%20%28airline%29">Iberia</a>, and <a href="Icelandair">Icelandair</a> were the 757's largest mainline customers, while other carriers such as <a href="Lufthansa">Lufthansa</a> rejected the type as too large for their narrow-body aircraft needs. Many European charter airlines, including <a href="Air%202000">Air 2000</a>, <a href="Air%20Holland">Air Holland</a>, and <a href="LTU%20International">LTU International</a>, also acquired the twinjet for holiday and tour package flights in the late 1980s. In Asia, where even larger aircraft were commonly preferred because of greater passenger volumes, the 757 found fewer orders. A 1982 sales demonstration was unable to attract a purchase from potential customer <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a>, and the first Asian customer, <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a>, sold its four 757s in 1989 in favor of standardizing on the 240-seat wide-body <a href="Airbus%20A310">Airbus A310</a>, just five years after debuting the type on Indonesian and Malaysian routes. The 757 fared better in China, where following an initial purchase by the <a href="CAAC%20Airlines">CAAC Airlines</a> in 1987, orders grew to 59 aircraft, making it the largest Asian market. Operators such as <a href="China%20Southern%20Airlines">China Southern</a>, <a href="China%20Southwest%20Airlines">China Southwest</a>, <a href="Shanghai%20Airlines">Shanghai Airlines</a>, <a href="Xiamen%20Airlines">Xiamen Airlines</a>, and <a href="China%20Xinjiang%20Airlines">Xinjiang Airlines</a> used the 757 on medium length domestic routes.

In 1986, the FAA approved RB211-powered 757s for extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (<a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a>) operations over the North Atlantic, following precedents set by the 767. Under ETOPS regulations, a set of safety standards governing twinjet flights over oceans and other areas without nearby suitable landing sites, airlines began using the aircraft for mid-range intercontinental routes. Although the 757 was not originally intended for transoceanic flights, regulators based their decision on its reliable performance record on extended transcontinental U.S. services. ETOPS certification for 757s equipped with PW2000 series engines was granted in 1992.

In the early 1990s, the FAA and other U.S. government agencies, including the <a href="National%20Aeronautics%20and%20Space%20Administration">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA) and the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB), began studying the 757's <a href="wake%20turbulence">wake turbulence</a> characteristics. This followed several incidents, including two fatal crashes, in which small private aircraft experienced <a href="aircraft%20upset">loss of control</a> when flying close behind the twinjet. Smaller airliners had also suffered unexpected rolling movements when flying behind 757s. Investigators focused on the aircraft's aft-loaded wing design, which at certain points during takeoff or landing could produce <a href="wingtip%20vortices">wingtip vortices</a> that were stronger than those emanating from larger 767s and 747s. Other tests were inconclusive, leading to debate among government agencies, and in 1994 and 1996 the FAA updated air traffic control regulations to require greater <a href="Separation%20%28air%20traffic%20control%29">separation</a> behind the 757 than other large-category jets. The 757 became the only sub- airliner to be classified as a "heavy" jet, alongside wide-body aircraft, under FAA separation rules.

Production of the 757 peaked at an annual rate of 100 aircraft in the early 1990s, during which time upgraded models came under consideration. For over a decade, the narrow-body twinjet had been its manufacturer's only single-aisle airliner without a stretched variant, and while rumors of a long-range and stretched persisted, no formal announcements had been made. European charter carriers were particularly interested in a higher-capacity version which could take better advantage of the 757's range. Besides meeting the needs of charter customers, a larger model would enable Boeing to match the passenger lift capabilities of the with lower operating costs, and counter longer-range versions of the 185-seat <a href="Airbus%20A321">Airbus A321</a>, a new stretched variant of the <a href="Airbus%20A320%20family">A320</a> narrow-body airliner.
In September 1996, following a launch order for 12 aircraft from charter carrier <a href="Condor%20Flugdienst">Condor</a>, Boeing announced the stretched at the <a href="Farnborough%20Airshow">Farnborough Airshow</a>. The new model was a stretch of the , resulting in room for 50 more passengers and nearly 50 percent more cargo. The type's design phase was intended to be the shortest in its manufacturer's history, with 27 months from launch to certification. Due to development and cost concerns, radical upgrades such as a <a href="Boeing%20737%20Next%20Generation">Next Generation 737</a>-style advanced cockpit were not implemented. Instead, the stretched derivative received upgraded engines, enhanced avionics, and a redesigned interior. The first rolled out on May 31, 1998, and completed its maiden flight on August 2, 1998. Following regulatory certification in January 1999, the type entered service with Condor on March 19, 1999.

The 757-300 was also ordered by <a href="ATA%20Airlines">American Trans Air</a>, <a href="Arkia%20Israel%20Airlines">Arkia Israel Airlines</a>, <a href="Continental%20Airlines">Continental Airlines</a>, Icelandair, and Northwest Airlines. Sales for the type remained slow, and ultimately totaled 55 aircraft. Boeing had targeted the as a potential replacement for two of its largest customers, American Airlines and United Airlines, but neither were in a financial position to commit to new aircraft. Overtures to other charter airlines also did not result in further orders. By November 1999, faced with diminishing sales and a reduced backlog despite the launch of the , Boeing began studying a decrease in 757 production rates.

While the 757 program had been financially successful, declining sales in the early 2000s threatened its continued viability. Airlines were again gravitating toward smaller aircraft, now mainly the 737 and A320, because of their reduced financial risk. An airline industry downturn and the large number of relatively young 757s already in service also reduced customer demand. In 2000, spurred by interest from Air 2000 and Continental Airlines, Boeing reexamined the possibility of building a longer-range . The proposed derivative would have featured auxiliary fuel tanks, plus wing and landing gear upgrades from the , resulting in a higher MTOW and a potential range increase to over . However, the proposal failed to garner any orders. In March 2001, Boeing delivered the first , a second-hand converted for freighter use, to <a href="DHL%20Aviation">DHL Aviation</a>. The marked the manufacturer's first foray into passenger-to-freighter conversions.
Customer interest in new 757s continued to decline, and in 2003, a renewed sales campaign centered on the and yielded only five new orders. In October 2003, following Continental Airlines' decision to switch its remaining orders to the , Boeing announced the end of 757 production. The 1,050th and last example, a built for Shanghai Airlines, rolled off the production line at the Renton factory on October 28, 2004, and was delivered on November 28, 2005, after several months of storage. With the conclusion of the 757 program, Boeing consolidated 737 assembly at its Renton factory, downsizing its facilities by 40 percent and shifting staff to different locations.

Since the end of production, most 757s have remained in service, mainly in the U.S. From 2004 to 2008, the average fuel cost for typical mid-range U.S. domestic 757 flights tripled, putting pressure on airlines to improve the fuel efficiency of their fleets. In May 2005, the FAA granted regulatory approval for manufacturer-sanctioned <a href="Wingtip%20device">blended winglets</a> from <a href="Aviation%20Partners%20Inc.">Aviation Partners Incorporated</a> as a retrofit on the . The winglets improve fuel efficiency by five percent and increase range by through the reduction of lift-induced drag. Continental Airlines was the first carrier to order winglets for the , and in February 2009 became the first operator of with winglets.
Prior to the United-Continental merger in 2010, the 757 remained the only narrow-body aircraft in use by the large fleets of all three U.S. <a href="legacy%20carrier">legacy carrier</a>s: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. During this period, the 757's capacity and range capabilities have remained largely unequaled among narrow-body airliners; when selecting replacement aircraft, airlines have had to either downsize to smaller single-aisle aircraft in production with fewer seats and less range such as the and A321, or upsize to the larger, longer-range <a href="Boeing%20787%20Dreamliner">787 Dreamliner</a> and wide-body jets. The <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-204">Tupolev Tu-204</a>, a narrow-body twinjet introduced in 1989 with a design similar to the 757's, is offered in a 200-seat version, which has seen limited production for mainly Russian customers. Within Boeing, the 215-seat, range 737-900ER has been regarded as the closest aircraft in production to the 757-200.

In February 2015, Boeing marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth stated that re-engining the 757 had been studied but there was no business case to support it. At the March 2015 <a href="International%20Society%20of%20Transport%20Aircraft%20Trading">ISTAT</a> conference, <a href="Air%20Lease%20Corporation">Air Lease Corporation</a>'s <a href="Steven%20Udvar-Hazy">Steven Udvar-Hazy</a> predicted the 757 replacement as a more capable, clean-sheet 767-like twin-aisle airplane capable of taking off runways like <a href="New%20York%20LaGuardia">New York LaGuardia</a>, and Tinseth is focused on 20% more range and more capacity than the 757-200.

The 757 is a low-wing <a href="Cantilever%20wing">cantilever monoplane</a> with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder. Each wing features a supercritical cross-section and is equipped with five-panel <a href="leading%20edge%20slats">leading edge slats</a>, single- and double-slotted <a href="flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>, an outboard <a href="aileron">aileron</a>, and six <a href="Spoiler%20%28aeronautics%29">spoilers</a>. The wings are largely identical across all 757 variants, swept at 25 degrees, and optimized for a cruising speed of <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 0.8 (). The reduced wing sweep eliminates the need for inboard ailerons, yet incurs little drag penalty on short and medium length routes, during which most of the flight is spent climbing or descending. The <a href="airframe">airframe</a> further incorporates <a href="carbon-fiber%20reinforced%20plastic">carbon-fiber reinforced plastic</a> wing surfaces, <a href="Kevlar">Kevlar</a> <a href="Aircraft%20fairing">fairings</a> and access panels, plus improved <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminum alloys</a>, which together reduce overall weight by .

To distribute the aircraft's weight on the ground, the 757 has a retractable <a href="Tricycle%20gear">tricycle landing gear</a> with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The landing gear was purposely designed to be taller than the company's previous narrow-body aircraft in order to provide ground clearance for stretched models. In 1982, the became the first <a href="subsonic%20aircraft">subsonic</a> jetliner to offer <a href="Ceramic%20composite">carbon brakes</a> as a factory option, supplied by <a href="Dunlop%20Rubber">Dunlop</a>. The stretched features a retractable <a href="tailstrike">tailskid</a> on its aft fuselage to prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff.

Besides common avionics and computer systems, the 757 shares its <a href="auxiliary%20power%20unit">auxiliary power unit</a>, electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational <a href="commonality">commonality</a>, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating to fly the 767 and share the same <a href="Seniority%20list">seniority roster</a> with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.

The 757's flight deck uses six <a href="Rockwell%20Collins">Rockwell Collins</a> CRT screens to display flight instrumentation, as well as an <a href="Electronic%20Flight%20Instrument%20System">electronic flight instrument system</a> (EFIS) and an <a href="Electronic%20Flight%20Instrument%20System%23Engine%20indications%20and%20crew%20alerting%20system%20%28EICAS%29%20/%20electronic%20centralized%20aircraft%20monitoring%20%28ECAM%29">engine indication and crew alerting system</a> (EICAS). These systems allow the pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer. An enhanced flight management system, improved over versions used on early 747s, automates navigation and other functions, while an <a href="Autoland">automatic landing</a> system facilitates <a href="Instrument%20landing%20system">CAT IIIb</a> instrument landings in low visibility conditions. The <a href="Inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial reference system</a> (IRS) which debuted with the was the first to feature <a href="Inertial%20navigation%20system%23Laser%20gyros">laser-light gyros</a>. On the , the upgraded flight deck features a <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> Pegasus flight management computer, enhanced EICAS, and updated software systems.

To accommodate the same flight deck design as the 767, the 757 has a more rounded nose section than previous narrow-body aircraft. The resulting space has unobstructed panel visibility and room for an observer seat. Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows.

Three independent <a href="hydraulics">hydraulic</a> systems are installed on the 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A <a href="ram%20air%20turbine">ram air turbine</a> is fitted to provide power for essential controls in the event of an emergency. A basic form of <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a> facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup <a href="hydraulic%20motor">hydraulic motor</a> generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.

The 757 interior allows seat arrangements of up to six per row with a single center aisle. Originally optimized for flights averaging two hours, the 757 features interior lighting and cabin architecture designs aimed at a more spacious impression. As on the 767, <a href="garment%20bag">garment-bag</a>-length <a href="Airliner%23Overhead%20bins">overhead bins</a> and a rear economy-class <a href="Galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a> are standard equipment. The bins have twice the capacity as those on the preceding 727. To save weight, <a href="honeycomb%20structure">honeycomb sandwich</a> is used for interior paneling and bins. Unlike previous <a href="evacuation%20slide">evacuation slide</a> designs which are not equipped for water landings, the 757's main exits feature combination <a href="Lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29">slide rafts</a> similar to those found on the 747. In the 1980s, Boeing altered the interior designs of its other narrow-body aircraft to be similar to that of the 757.

In 1998, the 757-300 debuted a redesigned interior derived from the Next Generation 737 and <a href="Boeing%20777">777</a>, including sculptured ceiling panels, indirect lighting, and larger overhead bins with an optional continuous handrail built into their base for the entire cabin length. Centerline storage containers mounted in the aisle ceiling for additional escape rafts and other emergency equipment were also added. The 757-300's interior later became an option on all new . In 2000, with wheeled <a href="Baggage%23Hand%20luggage%20%28carry-on%29">carry-on baggage</a> becoming more popular, Delta Air Lines began installing overhead bin extensions on their to provide additional storage space, and American Airlines did the same in 2001. The larger bins are part of aftermarket interior upgrades which include updated ceiling panels and lighting.

The 757 was produced in standard and stretched lengths. The original 757-200 debuted as a passenger model, and was subsequently developed into the 757-200PF and 757-200SF cargo models, as well as the convertible 757-200M variant. The stretched 757-300 was only available as a passenger model. When referring to different versions, Boeing, and airlines are known to collapse the model number (757) and the variant designator (e.g. or ) into a truncated form (e.g. "752" or "753"). The <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) classifies all variants based on the under the code "B752", and the is referred to as "B753" for air traffic control purposes.

The 757-200, the original version of the aircraft, entered service with Eastern Air Lines in 1983. The type was produced with two different door configurations, both with three standard cabin doors per side: the baseline version has a fourth, smaller cabin door on each side aft of the wings, and is certified for a maximum capacity of 239, while the alternate version has a pair of over-the-wing emergency exits on each side, and can seat a maximum of 224. The 757-200 was offered with a MTOW of up to ; some airlines and publications have referred to higher <a href="Aircraft%20gross%20weight">gross weight</a> versions with <a href="ETOPS">ETOPS certification</a> as "757-200ERs", but this designation is not used by the manufacturer. Similarly, versions with <a href="winglets">winglets</a> are sometimes called "757-200W" or "757-200WL". The first engine to power the 757-200, the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a>-535C, was succeeded by the upgraded RB211-535E4 in October 1984. Other engines used include the RB211-535E4B, along with the <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW2000">Pratt & Whitney PW2037</a> and PW2040. Its range with full payload is .

Although designed for short and medium length routes, the 757-200 has since been used in a variety of roles ranging from high-frequency shuttle services to transatlantic routes. In 1992, after gaining ETOPS approval, American Trans Air launched 757-200 transpacific services between Tucson and Honolulu. Since the turn of the century, mainline U.S. carriers have increasingly deployed the type on transatlantic routes to Europe, and particularly to smaller cities where passenger volumes are insufficient for wide-body aircraft. Production for the 757-200 totaled 913 aircraft, making the type by far the most popular 757 model. At over , , the longest commercial route served by a 757 is United Airlines' New York to Berlin flight; the aircraft assigned to this route cannot fly with full payload. United's 757s assigned to transatlantic routes are fitted with 169 seats. In July 2018, 611 of the 757-200 versions were in service.

The 757-200PF, the production cargo version of the 757-200, entered service with UPS Airlines in 1987. Targeted at the <a href="Express%20mail">overnight package</a> delivery market, the freighter can carry up to 15 <a href="Unit%20Load%20Device">ULD containers</a> or <a href="pallet">pallet</a>s on its main deck, for a volume of up to , while its two lower holds can carry up to of <a href="bulk%20cargo">bulk cargo</a>. The maximum revenue payload capability is including container weight. The 757-200PF is specified with a MTOW of for maximal range performance; when fully loaded, the aircraft can fly up to . Because the freighter does not carry any passengers, it can operate transatlantic flights free of ETOPS restrictions. Power is provided by RB211-535E4B engines from Rolls-Royce, or PW2037 and PW2040 engines from Pratt & Whitney.

The freighter features a large, upward-opening main deck cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door used by the pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main-deck cargo hold has a smooth <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a> lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded <a href="auxiliary%20power%20unit">auxiliary power unit</a>, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.

The 757-200M, a convertible version capable of carrying cargo and passengers on its main deck, entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also known as the 757-200 Combi, the type retains the passenger windows and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door in the manner of the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed <a href="Nepal%20Airlines">Nepal Airlines</a>, included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.
Nepal Airlines ordered the 757-200M to fulfill a requirement for an aircraft that could carry mixed passenger and freight loads, and operate out of <a href="Tribhuvan%20International%20Airport">Tribhuvan International Airport</a>, with its elevation, in the foothills of the Himalayas. Patterned after convertible variants of the 737 and 747, the 757-200M can carry two to four cargo pallets on its main deck, along with 123 to 148 passengers in the remaining cabin space. Nepal Airlines' 757-200M, which features Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines and an increased MTOW of , was the only production example ordered.

In October 2010, Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions launched aftermarket conversion programs to modify 757-200s into 757 Combi aircraft. Vision Technologies Systems launched a similar program in December 2011. All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 passenger seats. This configuration is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously. Customers for converted 757 Combi aircraft include the <a href="Air%20Transport%20Services%20Group">Air Transport Services Group</a>, <a href="National%20Airlines%20%28N8%29">National Airlines</a>, and <a href="North%20American%20Airlines">North American Airlines</a>.

The 757-200SF, a conversion of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by <a href="Spirit%20AeroSystems">Boeing Wichita</a> in Kansas included the removal of passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a main deck cargo capacity of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, <a href="Israel%20Aerospace%20Industries">Israel Aerospace Industries</a>, Precision Conversions, and <a href="ST%20Aerospace%23Subsidiaries">ST Aerospace Services</a> have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx Express</a> announced a US$2.6 billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.

The 757-300, the stretched version of the aircraft, entered service with <a href="Condor%20Flugdienst">Condor</a> in 1999. With an overall length of , the type is the longest single-aisle twinjet ever built, while being shorter than the <a href="DC-8">DC-8</a>-61/63. Designed to serve the <a href="charter%20airline">charter airline</a> market and provide a low-cost replacement for the 767-200, the 757-300 shares the basic design of the original 757, while extending the fuselage before and after the wings. Six standard cabin doors, two smaller cabin doors behind the wings, plus a pair of over-the-wing emergency exits on each side, enable the 757-300 to have a maximum certified capacity of 295 passengers. A higher MTOW of is specified, while fuel capacity remains unchanged; as a result, the stretched variant offers a maximum range of . Engines used on the type include the RB211-535E4B from Rolls-Royce and the PW2043 from Pratt & Whitney. Due to its greater length, the 757-300 features a retractable tailskid on its aft fuselage to avoid <a href="tailstrike">tailstrike</a>s.

Condor ordered the stretched 757 to replace its <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a>s and serve as low-cost, high-density transportation to holiday destinations such as the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. Because tests showed that boarding the 757-300 could take up to eight minutes longer than the 757-200, Boeing and Condor developed zone-based boarding procedures to expedite loading and unloading times for the lengthened aircraft. The 757-300 has been operated by mainline carriers Continental Airlines (now part of United Airlines), Northwest Airlines (now part of Delta Air Lines), and Icelandair; other operators have included American Trans Air (the first North American operator), <a href="Arkia%20Israel%20Airlines">Arkia Israel Airlines</a>, along with charter carriers Condor and <a href="Thomas%20Cook%20Airlines">Thomas Cook Airlines</a>. Production for the 757-300 totaled 55 aircraft. All 55 were in service in July 2018.

Government, military, and private customers have acquired the 757 for uses ranging from aeronautical testing and research to cargo and VIP transport. The 757-200, the most widely ordered version of the aircraft, has formed the basis for these applications. The first government operator of the 757 was the <a href="Mexican%20Air%20Force">Mexican Air Force</a>, which took delivery of a VIP-configured 757-200 in November 1987.



The largest 757 operators are Delta Air Lines, FedEx Express and United Airlines; Delta Air Lines is the largest overall, with a 757 fleet of 127 aircraft . American Airlines' 757 fleet of 142 aircraft was the largest until 2007, when the carrier retired Pratt & Whitney PW2000-powered models originating from its <a href="TWA">TWA</a> acquisition in order to have an all Rolls-Royce RB211-powered 757 fleet. Delta subsequently acquired 17 former TWA/American Airlines 757s, and in October 2008, gained 45 more 757s from its acquisition of Northwest Airlines.

The cargo carrier with the most 757s is FedEx Express, which operated a 757-200F fleet of 111 aircraft in July 2018. UPS Airlines operate a further 75 of the type, with DHL Aviation and its affiliated companies, <a href="DHL%20Air%20UK">DHL Air UK</a>, DHL Latin America, <a href="European%20Air%20Transport%20Leipzig">European Air Transport Leipzig</a>, and <a href="Blue%20Dart%20Aviation">Blue Dart Aviation</a>, combined operating 35 cargo 757s of various types in 2018.

Joint launch customer British Airways operated the 757-200 for 27 years before retiring the type in November 2010. To celebrate the fleet's retirement, the airline unveiled one of its last three 757-200s in a <a href="retro%20style">retro style</a> livery on October 4, 2010, matching the color scheme that it introduced the aircraft into service with in 1983. Subsequently, the type remained in operation with the company's subsidiary, <a href="OpenSkies">OpenSkies</a>.

Over the duration of the program, 1,050 Boeing 757s were built with 1,049 aircraft delivered. The prototype 757 remained with the manufacturer for testing purposes. In July 2018, a total of 666 Boeing 757 aircraft of all variants were in commercial service with operators <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> (127), <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx Express</a> (111), <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> (77), <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a> (75), <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> (34), <a href="Icelandair">Icelandair</a> (26) and others with fewer aircraft of the type.

Two private aircraft crashes were blamed on <a href="wake%20turbulence">wake turbulence</a> emanating from 757s. On December 18, 1992, a <a href="Cessna%20Citation">Cessna Citation</a> crashed near <a href="Billings%20Logan%20International%20Airport">Billings Logan International Airport</a> in Montana, killing all six aboard, and on December 15, 1993, an <a href="IAI%20Westwind">IAI Westwind</a> crashed near John Wayne Airport in California, killing all five aboard. Both airplanes had been flying less than behind a 757. The FAA subsequently increased the required separation between small aircraft and 757s from to .

On September 14, 1999, <a href="Britannia%20Airways%20Flight%20226A">Britannia Airways Flight 226A</a> crash landed near <a href="Girona-Costa%20Brava%20Airport">Girona-Costa Brava Airport</a>, Spain, during a thunderstorm; the 757's fuselage broke into several pieces. The 245 occupants evacuated successfully, with 40 requiring hospital treatment. On October 25, 2010, American Airlines Flight 1640, a 757 flying between Miami and Boston, safely returned to Miami after suffering the loss of a fuselage section at an altitude of approximately . After investigating the incident, the FAA ordered all 757 operators in the U.S. to regularly inspect upper fuselage sections of their aircraft for <a href="Fatigue%20%28material%29">structural fatigue</a>.
A Delta Air Lines 757-200, registered as N608DA, is on display at the <a href="Delta%20Flight%20Museum">Delta Flight Museum</a> in Atlanta, Georgia. The aircraft was the sixty-fourth example built. Prior to being moved to its permanent location, the aircraft was repainted into Delta's 'Widget' livery, the livery it wore when it was originally delivered; it is now on static display at the museum entrance.

Royal assent

Royal assent is the method by which a <a href="monarch">monarch</a> formally approves an act of the legislature (either directly, or through an official acting on the monarch's behalf). In some jurisdictions, royal assent is equivalent to <a href="promulgation">promulgation</a>, while in others that is a separate step. Under a modern <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> royal assent is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still, in theory, permit the monarch to withhold assent to laws (such as the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, and <a href="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to <a href="veto">veto</a> a law by withholding royal assent was once exercised often by <a href="Monarchies%20in%20Europe">European monarchs</a>, such an occurrence has been very rare since the eighteenth century.

Royal assent is sometimes associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> or may appoint <a href="Lords%20Commissioners">Lords Commissioners</a>, who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a> for this purpose. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a>. In other nations, such as <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">governor-general</a> (as the monarch's representative) merely signs a bill. In Canada, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">governor general</a> may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament of their agreement to the bill.

Before the <a href="Royal%20Assent%20by%20Commission%20Act%201541">Royal Assent by Commission Act of 1541</a> became law, assent was always required to be given by the sovereign in person before Parliament.

The last time royal assent was given by the sovereign in person in Parliament was in the reign of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> at a prorogation on 12 August 1854.

The Act was repealed and replaced by the <a href="Royal%20Assent%20Act%201967">Royal Assent Act 1967</a>. However section 1(2) of that Act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring assent in person if he or she so desires.

Royal assent is the final step required for a parliamentary bill to become law. Once a bill is presented to the sovereign or the sovereign's representative, he or she has the following formal options:

The last bill that was refused assent by the sovereign (on the advice of ministers) was the <a href="Scottish%20Militia%20Bill">Scottish Militia Bill</a> during <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne's</a> reign in 1708.

Under modern constitutional conventions, the sovereign generally acts on, and in accordance with, the advice of his or her ministers. However, there is some disagreement among scholars as to whether the monarch should withhold royal assent to a bill if advised to do so by her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, the issue has never arisen, and royal assent has not been withheld.

The sovereign is generally believed not to legally have the power to withhold assent from a bill "against" the advice of ministers.

Originally, legislative power was exercised by the sovereign acting on the advice of the "<a href="Curia%20regis">Curia Regis</a>", or Royal Council, in which important magnates and clerics participated and which evolved into parliament. In 1265, <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">the Earl of Leicester</a> <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%27s%20Parliament">irregularly called a full parliament</a> without royal authorisation. Membership of the so-called <a href="Model%20Parliament">Model Parliament</a>, established in 1295 under <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a> included bishops, abbots, earls, barons, two knights from each <a href="shire">shire</a> and two burgesses from each <a href="borough">borough</a>. The body eventually came to be divided into two branches: bishops, abbots, earls, and barons formed the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, while the shire and borough representatives formed the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>. The King would seek the advice and consent of both houses before making any law. During <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>'s reign, it became regular practice for the two houses to originate legislation in the form of bills, which would not become law unless the sovereign's assent was obtained, as the sovereign was, and still remains, the enactor of laws. Hence, all Acts include the clause "Be it enacted by the Queen's (King's) most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the <a href="Lords%20Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a> and <a href="Lords%20Temporal">Temporal</a>, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows...". The <a href="Parliament%20Acts%201911%20and%201949">Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949</a> provide a second potential preamble if the House of Lords were to be excluded from the process.

The power of parliament to pass bills was often thwarted by monarchs. <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> dissolved parliament in 1629, after it passed motions and bills critical of—and seeking to restrict—his arbitrary exercise of power. During the eleven years of <a href="Personal%20rule%20of%20Charles%20I%2C%201629%E2%80%931640">personal rule</a> that followed, Charles performed legally dubious actions such as raising taxes without Parliament's approval. After the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, it was accepted that parliament should be summoned to meet regularly, but it was still commonplace for monarchs to refuse royal assent to bills. In 1678, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> withheld his assent from a bill "for preserving the Peace of the Kingdom by raising the <a href="Militia">Militia</a>, and continuing them in Duty for Two and Forty Days," suggesting that he, not parliament, should control the militia. The last Stuart monarch, <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Anne</a>, similarly withheld on 11 March 1708, on the advice of her ministers, her assent to the <a href="Scottish%20Militia%20Bill">Scottish Militia Bill</a>. No monarch has since withheld royal assent on a bill passed by the British parliament.

During the rule of the succeeding <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian dynasty</a>, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>, relied on his ministers to a greater extent than had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> and <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a> both openly opposed <a href="Catholic%20Emancipation">Catholic Emancipation</a> and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">Coronation Oath</a>, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.

In 1914, <a href="George%20V">George V</a> did take legal advice on withholding royal assent from the <a href="Home%20Rule%20Act%201914">Government of Ireland Bill</a>, a highly contentious piece of legislation that the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> government intended to push through parliament by means of the <a href="Parliament%20Act%201911">Parliament Act 1911</a>. The King decided that he should not withhold assent without "convincing evidence that it would avert a national disaster, or at least have a tranquillising effect on the distracting conditions of the time".

Royal assent is the final stage in the legislative process for acts of the <a href="Scottish%20parliament">Scottish parliament</a>. The process is governed by sections 28, 32, and 33 of the <a href="Scotland%20Act%201998">Scotland Act 1998</a>. After a bill has been passed, the <a href="Presiding%20Officer%20of%20the%20Scottish%20Parliament">Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament</a> submits it to the monarch for royal assent after a four-week period, during which the <a href="Advocate%20General%20for%20Scotland">Advocate General for Scotland</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Advocate">Lord Advocate</a>, the <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> or the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Scotland">Secretary of State for Scotland</a> may refer the bill to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</a> (prior to 1 October 2009, the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a>) for review of its legality. Royal assent is signified by letters patent under the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20Scotland">Great Seal of Scotland</a> in the following form which is set out in The Scottish Parliament (Letters Patent and Proclamations) Order 1999 (<a href="Statutory%20instrument">SI</a> 1999/737) and of which notice is published in the London, Edinburgh, and Belfast Gazettes:

<a href="Measure%20of%20the%20National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales">Measures</a>, which were the means by which the <a href="National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales">National Assembly for Wales</a> passed legislation between 2006 and 2011, were assented to by the Queen by means of an <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a>. Section 102 of the <a href="Government%20of%20Wales%20Act%202006">Government of Wales Act 2006</a> required the Clerk to the Assembly to present measures passed by the assembly after a four-week period during which the <a href="Counsel%20General%20for%20Wales">Counsel General for Wales</a> or the <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> could refer the proposed measure to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Supreme Court</a> for a decision as to whether the measure was within the assembly's legislative competence.

Following the <a href="Welsh%20devolution%20referendum%2C%202011">referendum held in March 2011</a>, in which the majority vote for the assembly's law-making powers to be extended, measures were replaced by <a href="Act%20of%20the%20National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales">Acts of the Assembly</a>. Similarly to Acts of the <a href="Scottish%20parliament">Scottish parliament</a>, after a four-week waiting period royal assent to acts of the assembly will be given by means of letters patent using the following wording:

The letters patent may also be made in <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>.

Under section 14 of the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Act%201998">Northern Ireland Act 1998</a>, a bill which has been approved by the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> is presented to the Queen by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Northern%20Ireland">Secretary of State for Northern Ireland</a> for royal assent after a four-week waiting period during which the <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20Northern%20Ireland">Attorney General for Northern Ireland</a> may refer the bill to the Supreme Court. Assent is given by means of letters patent in the following form set out in the Northern Ireland (Royal Assent to Bills) Order 1999.

Between 1922 and 1972, bills passed by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Parliament of Northern Ireland</a> were passed to the <a href="Governor%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Governor of Northern Ireland</a> for royal assent under the <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland%20Act%201920">Government of Ireland Act</a> of 1920, replacing the office of <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant</a>.

Under the <a href="Church%20of%20England%20Assembly%20%28Powers%29%20Act%201919">Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919</a> a <a href="List%20of%20Church%20of%20England%20Measures">measure</a> of the <a href="General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">General Synod of the Church of England</a> becomes law once it has received royal assent in the same way as an Act of Parliament.

The lieutenant governors of the <a href="Bailiwick%20of%20Jersey">Bailiwick of Jersey</a> and the <a href="Bailiwick%20of%20Guernsey">Bailiwick and Islands of Guernsey</a> do not by and under their own authority grant assent, nor, as proxies, as the British crown's representative, deliver royal assent, to legislation emanating from the respective legislatures of these islands.

The States of Jersey Law 2005 abolishes the power of the lieutenant governor to directly impose a formal veto to a resolution of the States of Jersey.

The monarch of the United Kingdom, sitting in (together with members of the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> of the United Kingdom of the day, and who are also members of) the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>, grants the equivalent of the royal assent to Jersey and Guernsey legislation (under the formula, or other words to the effect: "Her Majesty, having taken the report into consideration, was pleased, by and with the advice of Her Privy Council, to approve and ratify this Act (a copy of which is annexed to this Order) and to order that it, together with this Order, shall be entered on the Register of the Island of Jersey (or of the Islands of Guernsey) and observed accordingly. Her Majesty's Officers in the Island (or Islands), and all other whom it may concern, are therefore to take notice of Her Majesty's Order and to proceed accordingly").

The equivalent of the royal assent is formally granted or formally refused on the formal advice of the <a href="Committee%20of%20Council%20for%20the%20Affairs%20of%20Jersey%20and%20Guernsey">Committee of Council for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey</a> in pursuance of Queen Elizabeth II's order-in-council of 22 February 1952. A recent example when the equivalent of the royal assent was refused was in 2007, concerning reforms to the constitution of the <a href="Sark%23Chief%20Pleas">Chief Pleas of Sark</a>. (A revised version of the proposed reforms was subsequently given the equivalent of the royal assent.)

In 2011, campaigners against a law that sought to reduce the number of senators in the states of Jersey petitioned the Privy Council to advise the Queen to refuse the equivalent of the royal assent. An Order in Council of 13 July 2011 established new rules for the consideration of petitions against the granting of the equivalent of the royal assent.

Legislation in Jersey and Guernsey entitled "Laws" would seem to require the formal equivalent of the royal assent from the British monarch sitting in the Privy Council; other legislation such as regulations and orders (in Jersey) and ordinances (in Guernsey) would not seem to require such formal equivalent of the royal assent.

There is a proposal that the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Guernsey">Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey</a> should be granted the delegated power of granting the equivalent of the royal assent, formally from the monarch and the Privy Council, to enable laws to be granted formal approval within six weeks if no objection was raised, rather than having to formally refer every law for formal consideration in London and then formal approval also (usually) in London. "At present there is a situation where Channel Island law-making depends, ultimately, on the UK government of the day, unelected by the islands."

Special procedures apply to legislation passed by the <a href="Tynwald">Tynwald</a> of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>. Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Isle%20of%20Man%23Revestment">Revestment</a>), the assent of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, the equivalent of the royal assent was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the <a href="British%20Regency">British Regency</a>, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal assent to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.

In 1981, an Order in Council delegated to the <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20the%20Isle%20of%20Man">lieutenant governor</a> the power to grant royal assent to bills passed by <a href="Tynwald">Tynwald</a>. The lieutenant governor must however refer any bill impacting on reserved powers (defence, foreign relations, nationality law, the relationship between the island and the United Kingdom and any matters relating to the monarch) to the British government for advice, on which he is required to act.

The above procedures are not sufficient to cause an <a href="Act%20of%20Tynwald">Act of Tynwald</a> to come into full force of law. By ancient custom, an Act did not come into force until it had been "promulgated" at an open-air sitting of the Tynwald, historically held on <a href="Tynwald%20Hill">Tynwald Hill</a> at St John's on St John's Day (24 June), but, since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1753, on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). "Promulgation" originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and <a href="Manx%20language">Manx</a>; but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section was sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the short title and a summary of the long title have been read.

An emergency procedure enabling an Act to come into force at the same moment as the receipt of the equivalent of the royal assent, when it is being announced at an ordinary sitting of the Tynwald, subject to its being promulgated within 12 months, was introduced in 1916; since 1988, this has been the normal procedure, but an Act ceases to have effect unless promulgated within 18 months after the equivalent of the royal assent is announced in the Tynwald.

Since 1993, the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Sodor%20and%20Man">Sodor and Man</a> <a href="Diocesan%20Synod">Diocesan Synod</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> within the <a href="Province%20of%20York">Province of York</a> has had power to enact measures making provision "with respect to any matter concerning the Church of England in the Island". If approved by the Tynwald, a measure "shall have the force and effect of an Act of Tynwald upon the Royal Assent thereto being announced to the Tynwald". Between 1979 and 1993, the Synod had similar powers, but limited to the extension to the Isle of Man of measures of the <a href="General%20Synod%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">General Synod</a>. Before 1994, the equivalent of the royal assent was granted by Order in Council, as for a bill, but the power to grant the equivalent of the royal assent to measures has now been delegated to the lieutenant governor. A Measure does not require "promulgation".

The governors (or the acting governors) of <a href="British%20overseas%20territories">British overseas territories</a> grant, withhold, or formally refuse the grant of their own "Governor's assent", under their own official personal authority as governors, for "colonial" or local legislation. Although the governor's assent is also normally granted, this is altogether different in nature to the royal assent.

In <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a>s other than the UK, royal assent is granted or withheld either by the realm's sovereign or, more frequently, by the representative of the sovereign, the <a href="Governor-General%23Commonwealth%20realms">governor-general</a>. In <a href="federation">federated</a> realms, assent in each state or province is granted or withheld by the representatives of the sovereign. In Australia, this is the <a href="Governors%20of%20the%20Australian%20states">governors</a> of the <a href="States%20of%20Australia">states</a>. For Canada, this is the <a href="Lieutenant%20governor%20%28Canada%29">lieutenant governors</a> of the <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">provinces</a>. A lieutenant governor may defer assent to the governor general, and the governor general may defer assent to federal bills to the sovereign.

If the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a> is unable to give assent, it can be done by either the <a href="Deputy%20of%20the%20Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Deputy of the Governor General of Canada</a>—the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Canada">Chief Justice of Canada</a>—or <a href="List%20of%20Justices%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada</a>. It is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the "Journals of the House of Commons", whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.

At both state and federal realms in Australia, assent is used as the means of enforcing a <a href="Referendums%20in%20Australia">referendum</a> that is required. This is done by providing that it will not be lawful to even submit the law for viceregal assent unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum.

While royal assent has not been withheld for a Bill backed by the Government in the United Kingdom since 1708, it has often been withheld in British colonies and former colonies by governors acting on royal instructions. In the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>, colonists complained that George III "has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good [and] has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them." Even after colonies such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a>, and <a href="Dominion%20of%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> were granted <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a>, the British government continued to sometimes advise governors-general on the granting of assent; assent was also occasionally reserved to allow the British government to examine a bill before advising the governor-general.

Since the <a href="Balfour%20Declaration%20of%201926">Balfour Declaration of 1926</a> and the "<a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201931">Statute of Westminster 1931</a>", all the Commonwealth realms have been sovereign kingdoms, the monarch and governors-general acting solely on the advice of the local ministers, who generally maintain the support of the legislature and are the ones who secure the passage of bills. They therefore are unlikely to advise the sovereign, or his or her representative, to withhold assent. The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Alberta">Alberta's lieutenant governor</a>, <a href="John%20C.%20Bowen">John C. Bowen</a>, in 1937, in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>'s <a href="Social%20Credit">Social Credit</a> party. Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province, thereby interfering with the federal government's powers. The third, the Accurate News and Information Bill, purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected. The unconstitutionality of all three bills was later confirmed by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> and by the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a>.

In Australia, a technical issue arose with the royal assent in both 1976 and 2001. In 1976, a bill originating in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> was mistakenly submitted to the Governor-General and assented to. However, it was later discovered that it had not been passed by the Senate. The error arose because two bills of the same title had originated from the House. The Governor-General revoked the first assent, before assenting to the bill which had actually passed the Senate and the House. The same procedure was followed to correct a similar error which arose in 2001.

In January 2013, the Guardian reported that, according to information disclosed under the <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%202000">Freedom of Information Act 2000</a>, the Government had persuaded the Queen to refuse Royal Assent on certain Bills that had been passed by backbenchers.

In the United Kingdom, a bill is presented for royal assent after it has passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for assent despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by <a href="Lords%20Commissioners">Lords Commissioners</a> authorised to act by <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a>. It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.
The Clerk of the Parliaments, an official of the House of Lords, traditionally states a formula in <a href="Anglo-Norman%20language">Anglo-Norman</a> <a href="Law%20French">Law French</a>, indicating the sovereign's decision. The granting of royal assent to a <a href="supply%20bill">supply bill</a> is indicated with the words "La Reyne remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi le veult", translated as "The Queen thanks her good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so." For other public or <a href="private%20bill">private bill</a>s, the formula is simply "<a href="La%20Reyne%20le%20veult">La Reyne le veult</a>" ("the Queen wills it"). For <a href="Local%20and%20personal%20Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">personal bill</a>s, the phrase is "Soit fait comme il est désiré" ("let it be as it is desired"). The appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic "La Reyne s'avisera" ("the Queen will consider it"). When the sovereign is male, "Le Roy" is substituted for "La Reyne".
Before the reign of Henry VIII, the sovereign always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the <a href="Imperial%20State%20Crown">Imperial State Crown</a>, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by <a href="herald">herald</a>s and members of the royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>. The Commons, led by their <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20British%20House%20of%20Commons">speaker</a>, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.

A new device for granting assent was created during the reign of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a>. In 1542, Henry sought to execute his fifth wife, <a href="Catherine%20Howard">Catherine Howard</a>, whom he accused of committing adultery; the execution was to be authorised not after a trial but by a <a href="bill%20of%20attainder">bill of attainder</a>, to which he would have to personally assent after listening to the entire text. Henry decided that "the repetition of so grievous a Story and the recital of so infamous a crime" in his presence "might reopen a Wound already closing in the Royal Bosom". Therefore, parliament inserted a clause into the Act of Attainder, providing that assent granted by Commissioners "is and ever was and ever shall be, as good" as assent granted by the sovereign personally. The procedure was used only five times during the 16th century, but more often during the 17th and 18th centuries, especially when George III's health began to deteriorate. <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> became the last monarch to personally grant assent in 1854.
When granting assent by commission, the sovereign authorises three or more (normally five) lords who are <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Counsellors</a> to declare assent in his or her name. The <a href="Lords%20Commissioners">Lords Commissioners</a>, as the monarch's representatives are known, wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the <a href="Woolsack">Woolsack</a>. The Lords Reading Clerk reads the commission aloud; the senior commissioner then states, "My Lords, in obedience to Her Majesty's Commands, and by virtue of the Commission which has been now read, We do declare and notify to you, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled, that Her Majesty has given Her Royal Assent to the several Acts in the Commission mentioned."
During the 1960s, the ceremony of assenting by commission was discontinued and is now only employed once a year, at the end of the annual parliamentary session. In 1960, the Gentleman Usher of the <a href="Black%20Rod">Black Rod</a> arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend the ceremony. The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left the chair to go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent. As the attorney-general explained, "there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused." The granting of assent by the monarch in person, or by commission, is still possible, but this third form is used on a day-to-day basis.
Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ("... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...").
When the act is assented to by the sovereign in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal assent is considered given at the moment when the assent is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 is followed, assent is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the assent, have notified their respective house of the grant of royal assent. Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), assent is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal assent and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the assent.
Independently of the method used to signify royal assent, it is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Parliaments, once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted. The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of the clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets.

In Commonwealth realms, assent may be granted by the sovereign in person, by the governor-general in person, or by a deputy acting for the governor-general. In all of the realms, however, assent is more often granted or signified outside the legislature, with each house being notified separately. 

In Australia, the formal ceremony of granting assent in parliament has not been regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill is sent to the governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated. The governor-general then signs the bill, sending messages to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives, who notify their respective houses of the governor-general's action. A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.

In Canada, the traditional ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long after it had been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived as part of a string of acts intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent realm, was that King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> personally assented to nine bills of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Canadian parliament</a> during his <a href="1939%20royal%20tour%20of%20Canada">1939 tour of Canada</a>—85 years after his great-grandmother, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately (the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Senate%20of%20Canada">Speaker of the Senate</a> or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">governor general</a> regarding the written declaration of Royal Assent), was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court</a>, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed. However, the act provides that a grant of royal assent is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ the traditional ceremony where required.

The Royal Assent ceremony takes place in the <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate</a>, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">secretary to the governor general</a> indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne; the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her; and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The <a href="Usher%20of%20the%20Black%20Rod%20%28Canada%29">Usher of the Black Rod</a> is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the <a href="Serjeant-at-arms%23Canada">Sergeant-at-Arms</a> carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: "in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] doth assent to these bills." If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites "in Her Majesty's name, His [or Her] Excellency the Governor General [or the deputy] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills." The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.

In some monarchies—such as <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, Japan, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, Spain, and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>—promulgation is required as well as royal assent. In <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, however, the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Sweden">monarch</a> is <a href="Constitution%20of%20Sweden">since 1975</a> removed from the process and the <a href="Government%20of%20Sweden">Government</a> (i.e the cabinet chaired by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Sweden">Prime Minister</a>) officially promulgates laws. In both cases, however, the process of assent and promulgation is usually a formality, whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.

According to Article 109 of the constitution: "The King "sanctions" and "promulgates" laws". In Belgium, the royal assent is called "sanction royale" / "koninklijke bekrachtiging" (Royal Sanction), and is granted by the King signing the proposed statute. The Belgian constitution requires a theoretically possible refusal of royal sanction to be countersigned—as any other act of the monarch—by a minister responsible before the House of Representatives. The monarch promulgates the law, meaning that he or she formally orders that the law be officially published and executed. In 1990, when <a href="Baudouin%20of%20Belgium">King Baudouin</a> advised his cabinet he could not, in conscience, sign a bill decriminalising abortion (a refusal patently not covered by a responsible minister), the <a href="Belgian%20federal%20government">Council of Ministers</a>, at the King's own request, declared Baudouin incapable of exercising his powers. In accordance with the Belgian constitution, upon the declaration of the sovereign's incapacity, the Council of Ministers assumed the powers of the head of state until parliament could rule on the King's incapacity and appoint a regent. The bill was then assented to by all members of the Council of Ministers "on behalf of the Belgian People". In a joint meeting, both houses of parliament declared the King capable of exercising his powers again the next day.

The constitution of <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> grants its monarch the right to withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament. Article 93 of that document gives the Jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent to him from the National Assembly; if he vetoes it within that timeframe, the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses; otherwise, the law does not go into effect (but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly). If the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill being presented to him, it becomes law without his signature.

According to Article 9 of the Constitution of <a href="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>, "every law shall require the sanction of the Reigning Prince to attain legal force." Liechtenstein allows its monarch to withhold royal assent of his own will. When <a href="Prince%20Hans%20Adam%20II">Prince Hans Adam II</a>, in an unprecedented move for the constitutional monarchy, refused to give royal assent to a bill legalising abortion, he pushed for a bill to give him sweeping powers in the government beyond only ceremonial matters, including the power to appoint judges. The bill passed and the Prince now has many additional powers, including the power to withhold royal assent on his own accord.

While Article 34 of the constitution of <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> formerly required the <a href="Grand%20Duke%20of%20Luxembourg">grand duke or duchess</a> to "sanction" and "promulgate" a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke <a href="Henri%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Luxembourg">Henri</a> informed his <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Luxembourg">prime minister</a> that he could not in good conscience assent to a bill to permit <a href="euthanasia">euthanasia</a> in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only <a href="promulgation">promulgation</a> (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.

Royal assent in the Netherlands is required, under article 87 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Dutch constitution</a>, for a bill to become law. After a law has been approved by the Council of Ministers and has received a positive advice from the advisory <a href="Council%20of%20State%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Council of State</a>, the government then sends it to the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Netherlands%29">lower house</a> of <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">parliament</a> in the name of the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20Netherlands">monarch</a> with the following text:

After the House of Representatives has debated the law, it either approves it and sends it to the <a href="Senate%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Senate</a> with the text "The Second Chamber of the States General sends the following approved proposal of law to the First Chamber", or it rejects it and returns it to the government with the text "The Second Chamber of the States General has rejected the accompanying proposal of law." If the upper house then approves the law, it sends it back to the government with the text "To the King, The States General have accepted the proposal of law as it is offered here."

The government, consisting of the monarch and the ministers, will then usually approve the proposal and the sovereign and one of the ministers signs the proposal with the addition of an <a href="enacting%20clause">enacting clause</a>, thereafter notifying the States General that "The King assents to the proposal." It has happened in exceptional circumstances that the government does not approve a law that has been passed in parliament. In such a case, neither the monarch nor a minister will sign the bill, notifying the States General that "The King will keep the proposal under advisement." A law that has received royal assent will be published in the State Magazine, with the original being kept in the archives of the King's Offices.

Articles 77–79 of the <a href="Norwegian%20Constitution">Norwegian Constitution</a> specifically grant the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Norway">monarch of Norway</a> the right to withhold royal assent from any bill passed by the <a href="Storting">Storting</a>. Should the sovereign ever choose to exercise this privilege, Article 79 provides a means by which his veto may be over-ridden: "If a Bill has been passed unaltered by two sessions of the Storting, constituted after two separate successive elections and separated from each other by at least two intervening sessions of the Storting, without a divergent Bill having been passed by any Storting in the period between the first and last adoption, and it is then submitted to the King with a petition that His Majesty shall not refuse his assent to a Bill which, after the most mature deliberation, the Storting considers to be beneficial, it shall become law even if the Royal Assent is not accorded before the Storting goes into recess."

In Part II of the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">1978 Spanish constitution</a>, among provisions concerning the Crown, Article 62(a) invests the "sanction" (i.e. Royal Assent) and "promulgation" of laws with the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain">monarch of Spain</a>. Chapter 2 of Part III, concerning the Drafting of Bills, outlines the method by which bills are passed. According to Article 91, the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales. Article 92 invests the monarch with the right to call for a referendum, on the advice of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Spain">president of the government</a> (commonly referred to in English as the prime minister) and the authorisation of the cortes.

No provision within the constitution grants the monarch an ability to veto legislation directly; however, no provision prohibits the sovereign from withholding royal assent, which effectively constitutes a veto. When the Spanish media asked King <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain">Juan Carlos</a> if he would endorse the bill legalising <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Spain">same-sex marriages</a>, he answered ""Soy el Rey de España y no el de Bélgica"" ("I am the King of Spain and not that of Belgium")—a reference to King <a href="Baudouin%20I%20of%20Belgium">Baudouin I of Belgium</a>, who had refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. The King gave royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005; the law was <a href="gazette">gazette</a>d in the "<a href="Bolet%C3%ADn%20Oficial%20del%20Estado">Boletín Oficial del Estado</a>" on 2 July and came into effect on 3 July 2005. Likewise, in 2010, King Juan Carlos gave royal assent to a law permitting abortion.

If the Spanish monarch ever refused in conscience to grant royal assent, a procedure similar to the Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection would not be possible under the current constitution. If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of discharging royal authority, his or her powers would not be transferred to the Cabinet, pending the parliamentary appointment of a regency. Instead, the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession would immediately become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to <a href="Felipe%20VI%20of%20Spain">Felipe</a>, then the heir apparent.

Articles 41 and 68 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Tonga">constitution</a> empower the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Tonga">sovereign</a> to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Tonga">Legislative Assembly</a>. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King <a href="George%20Tupou%20V">George Tupou V</a> saying that he would be guided by his <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Tonga">prime minister</a> in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the illicit possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the illicit possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, <a href="Siale%CA%BBataongo%20Tu%CA%BBivakan%C5%8D">Lord Tuʻivakanō</a>, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.

In certain republican constitutions, royal assent has developed into the possibility of a "presidential veto", such as in the <a href="Veto%23United%20States">United States of America</a> or in <a href="Veto%23European%20republican%20systems">several European countries</a>.

Donkey Kong 64

Donkey Kong 64 is a 1999 <a href="adventure%20game">adventure</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform</a> video game for the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> console, and the first in the "<a href="Donkey%20Kong">Donkey Kong</a>" series to feature 3D gameplay. As the <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a> <a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28character%29">Donkey Kong</a>, the player explores the themed <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> of an island to collect items and rescue <a href="List%20of%20Donkey%20Kong%20characters">his kidnapped friends</a> from <a href="King%20K.%20Rool">King K. Rool</a>. The player completes <a href="minigames">minigames</a> and puzzles as five playable Kong characterseach with its own special abilitiesto receive bananas and other collectibles. In a separate <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> mode, up to four players can compete in <a href="deathmatch">deathmatch</a> and <a href="last%20man%20standing%20%28gaming%29">last man standing</a> games.

<a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>, who had previously developed the "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Country%20%28series%29">Donkey Kong Country</a>" games, began development on this game in 1997. A 16-person team, with many members recruited from Rare's "<a href="Banjo-Tooie">Banjo</a>" group, finished the game in 1999, when it was published by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> for North America in November and worldwide by December. It was the first game to require the Nintendo 64 console's <a href="Expansion%20Pak">Expansion Pak</a>, an accessory that added <a href="random%20access%20memory">memory</a> resources. The game's exceptionally large marketing budget included advertisements, sweepstakes, and a national tour.

The game received universal acclaim from reviewers and was Nintendo's top seller during the 1999 <a href="holiday%20season">holiday season</a>, with 2.3 million units sold by 2004. It won the 1999 <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">E3 Game Critics award</a> for Best Platform Game, and multiple awards and nominations from games magazines. Reviewers noted the game's exceptional size and length, but criticized its camera controls and emphasis on item collection and backtracking. Some cited its similarity in gameplay and visuals to Rare's 1998 predecessor, "<a href="Banjo-Kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>", despite "Donkey Kong 64" mandatory memory add-on. Critics felt that the game did not meet the revolutionary potential of "Donkey Kong Country", but remained among the best 3D platform games on the console.

"Donkey Kong 64" is remembered as the emblematic example of Rare's "collect-a-thon" adventure platformers for the tedium of its collection tasks. A <a href="rap">rap</a> song from the game's introductory sequencethe DK Rapis often cited among the worst songs to feature in a video game. The title was later released on Nintendo's <a href="Wii%20U%20Virtual%20Console">Wii U Virtual Console</a> in 2015.

"Donkey Kong 64" is a 3D <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> in which the player, as <a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28character%29">Donkey Kong</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Donkey%20Kong%20characters">his friends</a>, explores an island and collects items to progress through <a href="minigame">minigame</a>s and puzzles. The game follows a traditional storyline for the series: <a href="King%20K.%20Rool">King K. Rool</a> and his reptilian <a href="Kremlings">Kremlings</a> invade the idyllic DK Isle and kidnap Donkey Kong's friends, planning to power up their Blast-O-Matic weapon and destroy the island. After a tutorial, the player embarks as Donkey Kong to rescue the others from their kidnappers and stop K. Rool's plan. While exploring the in-game world and completing puzzle minigames, the player collects two types of bananas: normal bananas, which are colored differently for each Kong character, award the player with banana medals and can be traded for access to each world's <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss fight</a>; and golden bananas, a certain number of which are required to unlock each new in-game world. Most of the game's puzzles are simple, and involve rearranging items, manipulating switches and tiles, or matching items as in the game <a href="Concentration%20%28game%29">Concentration</a>. Minigames include races, <a href="minecart">minecart</a> rides, and barrels that shoot the characters as projectiles. There are five such golden banana-rewarding objectives for each of five playable characters across seven themed worlds200 goals in total, in addition to a connecting <a href="overworld">overworld</a>. Unlike in prior "Donkey Kong" games, the objectives can be completed in any order. The player can <a href="fast%20travel">fast travel</a> between sections of the <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">level</a> with designated warp pads and can swap between characters in designated swap barrels. The player also collects banana coins, which can be spent to unlock new weapons and abilities, and other collectibles such as weapon ammunition and blueprint puzzle pieces. As in other games by the developer, the player often encounters an impossible situation (e.g., an indestructible object or out-of-reach area) and must eventually backtrack to resolve the impasse after acquiring a new ability.

Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable characters after the player rescues them. Each of the five characters begin with basic abilities and can purchase additional, unique abilities from <a href="Cranky%20Kong">Cranky Kong</a> as the game progresses, which are necessary to solve certain puzzles. For example, Donkey Kong can operate levers, <a href="Chunky%20Kong">Chunky Kong</a> can lift rocks, <a href="Tiny%20Kong">Tiny Kong</a> can crawl through holes, <a href="Diddy%20Kong">Diddy Kong</a> can fly, and <a href="Lanky%20Kong">Lanky Kong</a> can float. The characters are also unique in the projectiles they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut projectiles and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities. Combinations also trigger special modes, including alternative camera angles, a sniper mode, and a snapshot mode, which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable versions of the 1981 "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28video%20game%29">Donkey Kong</a>" and 1983 "<a href="Jetpac">Jetpac</a>" are hidden within the game. Optional hardware support includes a <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> mode and <a href="Rumble%20Pak">Rumble Pak</a> compatibility.

"Donkey Kong 64" features a separate multiplayer mode with six minigames for two to four players. Monkey Smash is an open arena, <a href="deathmatch">deathmatch</a>-style minigame in which up to four players find ammo and use their respective projectile weapons from the single-player game to damage other players before losing all of their own <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">lives</a>. Battle Arena is a king-of-the-hill minigame in which players use weapons and explosives to knock each other off the edge of a platform. Each mode has several sub-types in which players can compete based on time or score.

Following their success with the "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20Country%20%28series%29">Donkey Kong Country</a>" games in the mid-1990s, developer <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a> built their next <a href="Donkey%20Kong">"Donkey Kong" series</a> game upon its predecessors' gameplay but not as a direct sequel. Rare's <a href="Gregg%20Mayles">Gregg Mayles</a> led the effort to create the 3D "Donkey Kong". Development began in 1997—immediately after the completion of ""—for release on the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>'s <a href="Nintendo%2064DD">disk drive add-on</a>. It was transitioned for release on the base console after the add-on was delayed and eventually canceled. A team of 16 people worked on the title over the course of three years, and an additional eight members assisted in its later stages. Many developers transitioned from Rare's Banjo team, which had worked on "<a href="Banjo-Kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>" and <a href="Banjo-Tooie">its sequel</a>. "Donkey Kong 64" was built atop the former's <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>.

Rare conceived and originally designed "Donkey Kong 64" as a traditional, linear platform game more similar to the "Donkey Kong Country" games, rather than the "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>"-like final result. The Nintendo 64 was still new to Rare, and at the time they did not have a common game engine. The linear version was developed for around 18 months. While 3D graphics prevented Rare from reproducing the detailed <a href="Pre-rendering">pre-rendered</a> graphics of the "Donkey Kong Country", they allowed the company to make characters more expressive. 

"Donkey Kong 64" was the first of two games to require the Nintendo 64's <a href="Expansion%20Pak">Expansion Pak</a>, a console <a href="Computer%20memory">memory</a> upgrade that shipped with the game. The upgrade was previously used to power optional, high-resolution textures, but in the case of "Donkey Kong 64", it was marketed as improving the game's frame rate and rendering of objects at a distance. According to Rare programmer Chris Marlow, the company could not resolve a bug that occurred without the Expansion Pak and thus they were forced, at great expense, to bundle the game with the memory upgrade. Additionally, Nintendo said that the choice to bundle, rather than selling the accessory separately, would avoid consumer confusion.

<a href="Grant%20Kirkhope">Grant Kirkhope</a> composed the game's soundtrack, bringing it closer to the tradition of "Banjo-Kazooie" than to that of <a href="David%20Wise%20%28composer%29">David Wise</a>'s "Donkey Kong Country" soundtracks. The DK Rap, which introduces the Kong character abilities at its outset, was conceived and written by George Andreas, scored and recorded by Kirkhope, and performed by Andreas and Chris Sutherland. It was designed to be lighthearted despite being interpreted as a "serious" songwriting attempt at the game's launch. Nintendo of America ran a DK Rap contest in which fans record their own version of the rap to win prizes including a trip to the company's <a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond</a> headquarters.

Rare announced "Donkey Kong 64" with a single screenshot on its website and coverage in the January 1999 issue of "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" wrote that the title was playable by the <a href="E3%201997">1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>, though "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" said that it debuted at <a href="E3%201999">the 1999 event</a>. The game also demoed at Nintendo's 1999 <a href="Nintendo%20Space%20World">Spaceworld</a>. "Donkey Kong 64" was expected to be a bestseller, as the console's "crowning achievement" in graphics and sound.

"Donkey Kong 64" sizable marketing campaign doubled the typical budget for a major Nintendo release. The campaign included a 60-second commercial played at over 10,000 movie theaters during the holiday season, and additional advertisements shown on billboards, in print, and over radio. A promotional "The Beast Is Back" tour brought a truck outfitted with Nintendo games across the United States, and a separate sweepstakes between the series and <a href="Dr.%20Pepper">Dr. Pepper</a> soda advertised in <a href="supermarkets">supermarkets</a>. Nintendo sought to sell four million copies of the game (1.5 million more than for ""), including a million of the translucent green Nintendo 64 bundles. Polled retailers expected "Donkey Kong 64" to be the top console game sold during the 1999 holiday season. Indeed, the title had little <a href="holiday%20season">holiday season</a> competition from Nintendo, who had moved its other releases including "<a href="Mario%20Party%202">Mario Party 2</a>", "<a href="Perfect%20Dark">Perfect Dark</a>", and "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stadium">Pokémon Stadium</a>" into the next year.

Rare and Nintendo released the game in North America in November 1999, and a worldwide release followed the next month. Accompanying the game's launch, Nintendo offered a special bundle of the game and console, including a banana-colored game cartridge, its required Expansion Pak, and a transparent, green "<a href="Jolly%20Rancher">Jolly Rancher</a>-style" Nintendo 64 console.

In April 2015, "Donkey Kong 64" was digitally rereleased as one of the first Nintendo 64 titles added to Nintendo's <a href="Wii%20U%20Virtual%20Console">Wii U Virtual Console</a> catalog. This was the game's first rerelease, as it had not appeared on the <a href="Wii%20Virtual%20Console">Wii Virtual Console</a>.

"Donkey Kong 64" received "universal acclaim", according to video game <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. It was Nintendo 64's top seller during the 1999 holiday season and Nintendo's chief defense against competitor <a href="Sega">Sega</a>'s introduction of its <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> console. As a bestseller, "Donkey Kong 64" joined Nintendo's "<a href="Player%27s%20Choice">Player's Choice</a>" game selection, where it continued to sell well through the next year's holiday season. By 2004, "Donkey Kong 64" had sold over 2.3 million units. It won the 1999 <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">E3 Game Critics award</a> for Best Platform Game, and several annual awards from "Nintendo Power", including best overall game of 1999. It was additionally nominated for Game of the Year and Console Game of the Year in the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a>' 2000 <a href="Interactive%20Achievement%20Awards">Interactive Achievement Awards</a>. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" named it an "Editor's Choice". "IGN" described "Donkey Kong 64" as the biggest and most ambitious title on the Nintendo 64 as of its release, but very similar to "Banjo-Kazooie" in its platforming and puzzle design. Similarities between the two games and their themes was a common refrain among reviewers.

Reviewers criticized or had little praise for the game's emphasis on collecting items and backtracking"an interactive <a href="egg%20hunt">egg hunt</a>". This had become a trend in the developer's games, and "Donkey Kong 64" followed the "predictable formula" of making players collect multiple sets of items and those sets in full for a special ending. "Next Generation" also saw the developer creating a habit of backtracking in their games. "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" was more diplomatic: those who liked collecting items would be titillated by its <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>, and those who did not would be frustrated by its chores. The puzzles and minigames are fun the first time through, according to "EGM", but they quickly become worn when replayed with increasingly tighter time restrictions. "GameSpot", however, considered parts of "Donkey Kong 64" gameplay "cerebral", requiring the player to consider several simultaneous tasks to solve later puzzles. Already familiar with the game's concepts borrowed from "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>", "Ocarina of Time", and "Banjo-Kazooie", reviewers considered the player's tasks less innovative or interesting to decipher. In retrospective reviews, "<a href="Nintendo%20Life">Nintendo Life</a>" described the chore of collecting objects "excessive" and repetitive. They suggested that backtracking, for instance, could be reduced by letting the player switch between characters at any time.

Reviewers noted the game's size and length. With an estimated 30 hours in basic gameplay, "IGN" called it Rare's "<a href="War%20and%20Peace">War and Peace</a>". "Big" is an understatement, wrote "<a href="GameFan">GameFan</a>", "the adventure found within is mastodonic". Reviewers became frequently lost or distracted in its world. Critics highlighted the ingenuity of the boss battles, particularly the final battle against K. Rool, though the story's ending disappointed "EGM". Critics found little entertainment in the multiplayer mode but praised the gameplay variety between the five characters. The controls also frustrated reviewers, between slow movement speed and camera angle issues. For example, characters who become unresponsive to control during their attack animations are vulnerable to encroaching enemies. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" wrote that the lack of camera improvements over "Banjo-Kazooie" was inexcusable.

Despite its expanded memory resources, reviewers felt that "Donkey Kong 64" visuals were only marginallyif at allbetter than that of its contemporary games, such as the previous year's "Banjo-Kazooie". In fact, "IGN" avowed that "Donkey Kong 64" was not as pretty as "Banjo-Kazooie", especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. "IGN" hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered its dynamic lighting overused. "<a href="N64%20Magazine">N64 Magazine</a>" said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. "GameSpot" also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.

The characters have Rare's emblematic humor, and reviewers praised their individual personalities. Several reviewers noted the degree to which the character personalities showed in their animations. "IGN" considered "Donkey Kong 64" characters less baffling than those of other Rare titles, and sometimes funny. "GameFan" found that the addition of the three new playable characters to the series offered little personality that would be missed.

While "IGN" felt that the game's music was less clever than "Banjo-Kazooie", Kirkhope's soundtrack still delivered a variety of moods and fit the setting. Aural clues in the surround sound and the quality of the underwater effects impressed "GameSpot". Reviewers criticized the opening DK Rap as "embarrassing" and among the worst music to feature in a game. "GamePro", however, thought it was humorous albeit lowbrow. Eight years later, "Nintendo Life" said the song was "loved by some, loathed by others", similar to the game itself.

Reviewers concluded that "Donkey Kong 64" lacked the revolutionary potential of "Donkey Kong Country" but was of a sufficient high quality to sell well during the holiday season. "The 3D platform genre doesn't evolve with "Donkey Kong 64"", "AllGame" wrote. While hyped fans would be disappointed, "IGN" felt that "Donkey Kong 64" remains an excellent and expansive platformer with an overwhelming amount of things to do. "GameFan", on the other hand, was most disappointed by how the game "truly offers nothing new" and compared its monotony and repetition with the film "<a href="Eyes%20Wide%20Shut">Eyes Wide Shut</a>": "a big bloated project with not enough brilliant moments to justify the numbness ... [of] sitting through the whole thing", it "fails to live up to the Rare name". "Donkey Kong 64" 3D platforming was commonplace by the time of its release and, according to "GameSpot", would have fared better as a Nintendo 64 <a href="launch%20title">launch title</a>. With its competition considered, "<a href="Daily%20Radar">Daily Radar</a>" wrote that "Donkey Kong 64" was simply the best 3D platform game on the console. "Edge" qualified this thought: "Donkey Kong 64" was the closest any third-party developer had come to outdoing Nintendo's mastery of game structure, but its gameplay was derivative and unimaginative compared to the freedom and flexibility of Nintendo's "Super Mario 64". Nevertheless, the 3D "Donkey Kong" was "a fine effort ... in its own right".

Rare's 3D platformers became notorious for their emphasis on collecting items, and "Kotaku" remembered "Donkey Kong 64" as "the worst offender" with hundreds of color-coded bananas. Other retrospective reviewers agreed. "As ... "Super Mario 64" breathed life into the 3D platforming genre", "Electronic Gaming Monthly" wrote, ""Donkey Kong 64" sucked it all out" and solidified Rare's reputation for making "collect-a-thon" games. The indie developer behind "<a href="A%20Hat%20in%20Time">A Hat in Time</a>", a spiritual successor to "Banjo-Kazooie", blamed "Donkey Kong 64" for the "collect-a-thon platform adventurer" genre's decline in popularity.

"Retro Gamer" and "Game Informer" both remembered the game's reception as "mixed", in consideration of its similarities with "Banjo-Kazooie" and lack of genre-pushing changes. Despite decent reviews, "Donkey Kong 64" and Rare's subsequent Nintendo 64 releases did not meet the extolment of the company's preceding games, and lackluster sales led to a staff exodus that culminated with the company's acquisition by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> in 2002. The Nintendo 64 was approaching the end of its lifecycle, "Electronic Gaming Monthly" noted at the game's launch, as gamers turned their sights to the Sega Dreamcast and <a href="Sony%20PlayStation%202">Sony PlayStation 2</a>. "IGN" later named "Donkey Kong 64" as worthy of being remade for Nintendo's <a href="Nintendo%203DS">3DS handheld console</a>.

The DK Rap is remembered for its negative reception. Renditions of the song later appeared in "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>" and "<a href="Donkey%20Konga">Donkey Konga</a>". Over a decade after the game's release, Kirkhope said that the rap was enjoying a resurgence in popularity despite its initial unpopularity. In 2017, he composed a similar rap for "<a href="Yooka-Laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>", a platform game made in homage to Rare's oeuvre.

Theobald of Bec

Theobald of Bec (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1090 – 18 April 1161) was a <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">archbishop of Canterbury</a> from 1139 to 1161. His exact birth date is unknown. Some time in the late 11th or early 12th century Theobald became a monk at the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Bec">Abbey of Bec</a>, rising to the position of <a href="abbot">abbot</a> in 1137. King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen of England</a> chose him to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1138. Canterbury's claim to <a href="Primacy%20of%20Canterbury">primacy</a> over the Welsh ecclesiastics was resolved during Theobald's term of office when Pope <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20III">Eugene III</a> decided in 1148 in Canterbury's favour. Theobald faced challenges to his authority from a subordinate bishop, <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and King Stephen's younger brother, and his relationship with King Stephen was turbulent. On one occasion Stephen forbade him from attending a <a href="Council%20of%20Reims%20%281148%29">papal council</a>, but Theobald defied the king, which resulted in the confiscation of his property and temporary exile. Theobald's relations with his cathedral clergy and the monastic houses in his archdiocese were also difficult.

Serving during the <a href="The%20Anarchy">disorders</a> of Stephen's reign, Theobald succeeded in forcing peace on the king by refusing to consecrate Stephen's son and heir, <a href="Eustace%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Boulogne">Eustace</a>. After Eustace's death in 1153, Stephen recognised his rival <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry of Anjou</a> as his heir, and later Theobald was named regent of the kingdom after Stephen's death. After a long illness, Theobald died in 1161, following which unsuccessful efforts were made to have him <a href="canonised">canonised</a> as a saint.

Theobald was the patron of his successor <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, and a number of other future bishops and archbishops served as his clerks. During his time as archbishop Theobald augmented the rights of his <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a>, or bishopric. Historians of his time and later were divided on his character and he is often overlooked in the historical record, mainly because of the fame of his successor.

Theobald's family was from the area around <a href="Thierville">Thierville</a> near <a href="Le%20Bec-Hellouin">Le Bec-Hellouin</a>, in the <a href="Risle">Risle River</a> valley. The modern historian <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28historian%29">Frank Barlow</a> speculates that Theobald may have been a distant relative of his successor as archbishop, Thomas Becket, as Becket's family came from the same part of Normandy. The exact date of Theobald's birth is unknown; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man, suggesting a birth date of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian. His father was supposedly a knight, but no contemporary reference gives his name. His brother <a href="Walter%20%28Bishop%20of%20Rochester%29">Walter</a> also became a priest, and later a bishop.

Theobald entered the Abbey of Bec in Normandy as a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monk in the late 11th or early 12th century, while William was the third <a href="abbot">abbot</a>. But as William was abbot from 1096 to 1124, that leaves a wide range of possible entry dates. Theobald was the 266th monk admitted under William, out of 346. The historian Avrom Saltman suggests that, if admissions were spaced regularly throughout William's abbacy, Theobald would have become a monk in about 1117, but qualifies his estimate with the statement that 1117 "seems to be rather late".

In 1127 Theobald was made <a href="prior">prior</a> of Bec, after Boso succeeded William as abbot. Theobald became abbot in 1137, following Boso's death in June 1136. The monks of Bec unanimously elected him to be their new abbot without first consulting the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Rouen">Archbishop of Rouen</a>, <a href="Hugh%20de%20Boves">Hugh de Boves</a>, who consequently threatened to void the result. <a href="Audoen">Audoen</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Evreux">Bishop of Evreux</a>, and brother of <a href="Thurstan">Thurstan</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, intervened with Hugh and persuaded him to ratify the election. Another problem then arose when Hugh demanded a written profession of obedience from Theobald, which Theobald refused to provide; no previous abbot had made such a profession. Theobald resisted for 14 months before a compromise was reached through the intercession of <a href="Peter%20the%20Venerable">Peter the Venerable</a>, <a href="Abbot%20of%20Cluny">Abbot of Cluny</a>, allowing Theobald to give a verbal profession to Hugh.

No documents survive from Theobald's tenure as abbot, nor is there any information on the administration of the monastery during his period of office, except that 47 monks were admitted to Bec while he was abbot. Theobald travelled to England on business for his abbey at least once during his abbacy, to supervise the monastery's lands in England, a trip that took place shortly before his selection as the new Archbishop of Canterbury in 1138.

In 1138 King Stephen chose Theobald to fill the vacant archbishopric of Canterbury over Stephen's own brother Henry, the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped Stephen gain the throne of England. Stephen feared that Henry would be too powerful as archbishop, and would attempt to control the king. The election took place on 24 December; Stephen was present with the papal legate, <a href="Alberic%20of%20Ostia">Alberic of Ostia</a>, and a small group of barons and bishops, but Henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons. Most historians consider that Stephen arranged the election's timing to ensure Henry's absence. Henry believed that Theobald had been elected not only because of Stephen's concerns but also because <a href="Waleran%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">Waleran of Meulan</a>, the <a href="Patronage">lay patron</a> of Bec, was attempting to put his own man in one of the most powerful positions in England. Waleran and his twin brother <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert, Earl of Leicester</a>, were Henry's chief rivals for Stephen's favour, and Henry disliked both of them intensely. Although Theobald was pious and well-educated, he had only become abbot the year before, and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery, which had already produced two archbishops of Canterbury, <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a> and <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>. Theobald had no important family connections to advance his career, and few clerical allies.

Theobald was consecrated on 8 January 1139 by the legate, Alberic of Ostia. He went to Rome for his <a href="pallium">pallium</a> and took part in the <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Second Lateran Council</a>. As archbishop his behaviour was less political in comparison to that of his main rival, Henry of Blois. Henry was appointed a <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a> on 1 March 1139, which meant that Henry could now call church councils in England and had power equal to or exceeding that of Theobald. Theobald swore fealty to Stephen upon his election to Canterbury, recognising Stephen as the king of England.

Soon after his election Theobald selected his brother Walter to be <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> of Canterbury, and in 1148 promoted him to be <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>. Theobald attended the council held by Stephen in June 1139 that deprived <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger of Salisbury</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and his nephews <a href="Nigel%20%28bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Nigel</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20of%20Lincoln">Alexander</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, of their castles. According to most historians, Theobald took little part in the controversy that followed the council, which eventually ended with Roger's death in 1139 and Nigel and Alexander's restoration to favour. Recently however, that view has been challenged by two historians who argue that Theobald took a more active role in the council. They base their view on a "Vita", or "Life" of the 12th-century mystic <a href="Christina%20of%20Markyate">Christina of Markyate</a>, which narrates the events and gives a more central role to Theobald, instead of Henry of Blois, in challenging Stephen's arrest of the three bishops.

Theobald's actions in the next few years are intertwined with the history of Stephen's ascension to the throne. Following King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>'s death in 1135 the succession was disputed between the king's nephews—Stephen and his elder brother, <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Theobald II, Count of Champagne</a>—and Henry's surviving legitimate child <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">German Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>. King Henry's only legitimate son, <a href="William%20Adelin">William</a>, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to <a href="Geoffrey%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey, Count of Anjou</a>. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald II or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald II contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was not resigned to the loss, and secured the support of the Scottish king, <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David</a>, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 the support of her half-brother, <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert, Earl of Gloucester</a>, an illegitimate son of Henry I.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281141%29">Battle of Lincoln</a> in 1141, with Stephen in captivity in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, Theobald did not immediately join the Empress. He claimed that he needed to talk to Stephen before switching his oath of fealty. After consulting in person with Stephen, he secured permission to accept the current conditions, and then joined Henry of Blois, who had switched sides, at Winchester in April for a <a href="Synod">legatine council</a> held to depose Stephen and crown Matilda as queen. Attendance at the council was sparse however, and the Empress could not be crowned because she did not hold London. After the unsuccessful attempt to crown Matilda, those gathered at Winchester had to flee before Stephen's forces; one of Matilda's chief supporters, her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, was captured. During their flight Theobald and his fellow bishops were robbed of their horses and ecclesiastical vestments. Theobald then took a leading part in the negotiations that led to the exchange of Robert for Stephen, which happened in November 1141. Henry of Blois, having switched sides again, then held another legatine council in Westminster, which reaffirmed Stephen as king. Theobald ceremonially crowned Stephen at Canterbury during the Christmas court held there.

Matilda remained in England until 1148. The disorders were at their peak between 1142 and 1148, but her cause could never secure enough support to enable her to be crowned. Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda's forces, which meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. But while Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.

Theobald's dealings with Henry of Blois, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, his <a href="suffragan%20bishop">suffragan bishop</a>, were strained because of Henry's position as papal legate. Henry supported the appointment of <a href="William%20of%20York">William FitzHerbert</a> as Archbishop of York in 1141, which Theobald opposed. Although Theobald spoke out against the manner of election, he took little active part in the subsequent electoral disputes, which resulted eventually in the deposition of FitzHerbert and his replacement at York by <a href="Henry%20Murdac">Henry Murdac</a>. But in September 1143, Henry's legatine powers lapsed when Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Innocent II</a>, who had made the legatine appointment, died. <a href="Pope%20Celestine%20II">Celestine II</a> was elected on 26 September 1143, but he was an opponent of Stephen, and thus was not favourably inclined towards Stephen's brother Henry either. To secure appointment as legate, Theobald travelled to Rome in December 1143, arriving shortly before Celestine's death on 8 March 1144. Theobald was probably accompanied by Nigel, Bishop of Ely, and <a href="Roger%20de%20Clinton">Roger de Clinton</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Coventry">Bishop of Coventry</a>. Before his death, Celestine forbade Theobald "to allow any change to be made in the position of the English crown, since the transfer of it had been justly denounced, and the matter was still under dispute". This became the papal policy, and was a significant change from the recognition of Stephen as king by Pope Innocent II soon after Stephen's coronation in 1135. It essentially forbade Theobald from crowning any successor to Stephen, especially while Stephen was still alive.

After Celestine's death Theobald returned to England, stopping at <a href="St%20Denis%20Abbey">St Denis Abbey</a> in Paris to help <a href="Suger">Suger</a>, the abbot, consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars. Theobald was the only bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in France. Meanwhile, Henry of Blois had arrived in Rome and begun negotiations with the new pope, <a href="Pope%20Lucius%20II">Lucius II</a>, over the elevation of the bishopric of Winchester to an archbishopric. It appears that Lucius appointed a legate, Cardinal <a href="Icmar%20of%20Tusculum">Icmar</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Tusculum">Bishop of Tusculum</a>, to travel to England and oversee the project, but Lucius died before anything was accomplished.

Theobald was back in Paris in May 1147 to meet with the new pope, Eugene III; among the issues probably discussed was Theobald's dispute with <a href="Bernard%20%28bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s%29">Bernard of St David's</a>. Relations at this time between Theobald and Stephen seem to have been good, but when Eugene summoned the English bishops to the <a href="Council%20of%20Reims%20%281148%29">Council of Rheims</a> in April 1148 the king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated: <a href="Hilary%20of%20Chichester">Chichester</a>, <a href="Robert%20de%20Bethune">Hereford</a> and <a href="William%20de%20Turbeville">Norwich</a>. Despite having been specifically refused permission Theobald sneaked away in a fishing boat, presumably accompanied by <a href="Gilbert%20Foliot">Gilbert Foliot</a>, who attended the council with him. Theobald had a number of reasons for defying the king: chiefly his obedience to the pope's order commanding his attendance, but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected Archbishop of York, Henry Murdac, in the disputes between York and Canterbury. Murdac was known to be close to his fellow Cistercian Eugene.

Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, died during the council, and Eugene nominated Foliot as his successor at Theobald's urging. One of the council's last acts was to suspend the non-attending bishops from their offices. The only English bishop specifically named was Henry of Blois, but the others who did not attend were presumably also suspended although not named. Henry of Blois was singled out for special handling, as the papacy ordered that he could not be reinstated by Theobald; Eugene reserved to himself the power to restore Henry. Theobald appears to have reinstated most of the bishops quickly, as Foliot wrote later in 1148 that only the bishops of Winchester, Durham, Worcester, Bath and Exeter were still suspended. Theobald forgave the bishops of Exeter, Worcester and Bath on 11 November 1148, according to the later chronicler <a href="Gervase%20of%20Canterbury">Gervase of Canterbury</a>. Gervase also lists Hilary of Chichester as one of those forgiven by Theobald on that date, but as Hilary attended the council it is likely that this is an error. Durham may have been omitted because he was a suffragan bishop of the Archbishop of York, and his reinstatement was in his archbishop's hands.

The king was angry with Theobald for attending the council, even though the archbishop intervened with Eugene, who was displeased with the king for forbidding the bishops' attendance. Theobald persuaded Eugene against excommunicating Stephen, asking the pope to allow the king to make amends for his behaviour. But Stephen was unimpressed with Theobald's intercession; he confiscated Theobald's property and banished the archbishop. In September 1148, the pope put England under <a href="interdict">interdict</a>, which was ignored except in Canterbury. At first Theobald was in exile at <a href="Saint-Omer">St Omer</a>, where he consecrated Gilbert Foliot as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>. He then returned to England and set himself up in <a href="Framlingham">Framlingham</a>, which was held by <a href="Hugh%20Bigod%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Hugh Bigod</a>, an adherent of the Empress. From there he conducted the ecclesiastical business of England, but Theobald's presence in the country posed a threat to Stephen's authority, and Stephen quickly settled the differences between the two.

Henry of Blois had lost his legateship before Celestine became pope, but it was not until about 1150 that Theobald was appointed legate by Eugene III, perhaps owing to the exhortations of <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>. Theobald held the legatine powers in England until his death in 1161. In 1151 Theobald held a <a href="Synod">legatine council</a> in London. The council was attended by the king and <a href="Eustace%20IV%20of%20Boulogne">Eustace</a>, the king's eldest son, as well as other members of the nobility. The council decreed eight canons, or ecclesiastical statutes, including ones condemning the pillaging of church properties and the imposition of financial levies on the clergy. Another canon of the council stated that bishops should no longer pursue violators of church property in the royal courts, but should use ecclesiastical courts instead. The other canons dealt with procedural matters arising from excommunications for abusing church property.

The next year, the archbishop refused to crown Eustace and was again exiled by Stephen, who was attempting to secure the succession for his son by imitating the <a href="Capetian%20dynasty">Capetian dynasty</a> of France, which usually saw the king's heir crowned during his father's lifetime. Although Theobald claimed papal authority for refusal, based on the prohibition by Celestine, it was more probable that he and the bishops had no desire to prolong the civil war. Stephen demanded in April 1152 that Theobald crown Eustace, but the archbishop once again refused, and went into exile in Flanders. Theobald claimed that Stephen had gained the throne through perjury, implying that if the archbishop crowned Eustace, Theobald would be perpetuating this crime. The king and the archbishop reached a truce in August.

In January 1153 <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry of Anjou</a>, Matilda's son, invaded England in pursuit of his claim to the throne, and with the death of Eustace in August 1153, Stephen gave up. Theobald was instrumental in the negotiations between Henry and Stephen that resulted in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wallingford">Treaty of Wallingford</a>, securing Henry's succession to the throne. Theobald was also present when Henry of Anjou met with Stephen's second son <a href="William%20I%2C%20Count%20of%20Boulogne">William</a>, probably after Eustace's death, to settle William's lands and status after Henry succeeded Stephen. Pope Eugene III forced Stephen to reverse the sentence of banishment, and Theobald returned to his see. Later it was mainly Theobald and Henry of Blois who negotiated the treaty ending the civil war, as neither Stephen nor Henry of Anjou was interested in a compromise. Henry of Blois and Theobald, who had previously found working together difficult, managed to secure an end to the disorders in England.

Theobald was present at Stephen's deathbed in October 1154, and Stephen named him as regent until Henry could take up the crown. During the six weeks before Henry arrived, the archbishop had little difficulty in keeping the peace. After Henry's arrival, Theobald crowned Henry and his wife <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a> on 19 December 1154 at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

For most of the remainder of Theobald's life he was occupied with ecclesiastical affairs in his diocese, as well as attending the royal court when Henry was in England. In January 1155 Theobald helped to secure the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%20of%20England">Chancellorship</a> for his protégé, Thomas Becket, an action that Barlow speculates happened because Theobald hoped to secure more influence with the king through Becket. If this was his hope, Barlow notes that it did not materialise. Although the king and the archbishop occasionally clashed when their interests conflicted, both appear to have wished to minimise the disputes and were willing to compromise to secure good relations. As an example, when Pope <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Adrian IV</a> died in September 1159, two rival claimants for the papal throne emerged. King Henry, following the custom of his grandfather Henry I, forbade the bishops from recognising either claimant. Eventually, after Henry weighed the political factors, he recognised Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Alexander III</a>, and it was only then that Theobald also recognised Alexander as pope.

However, not everything was always harmonious between the king and the archbishop. In 1156, Theobald supported the efforts of <a href="Osbert%20de%20Bayeux">Osbert de Bayeux</a>, who was accused of poisoning <a href="William%20of%20York">William</a> the Archbishop of York, to secure a trial for his alleged crimes in an <a href="ecclesiastical%20court">ecclesiastical court</a> rather than in the royal court. The crime had taken place during Stephen's reign, but Stephen's death had prevented Osbert from being tried in 1154. The delay allowed the <a href="Benefit%20of%20clergy">shifting of the trial</a> to the church courts, which Henry opposed. Although Theobald's position displeased the king no open rupture ensued. Theobald himself admitted to the papacy in 1154 that English custom was to try clergy for crimes in the secular courts.

Theobald called a church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly with the issues of the papal schism; his health was poor and he had to be taken to the council in a litter. A further cause of distress to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.

Theobald's <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> was composed of monks, and he was considered the abbot of the monastery of <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Canterbury">Christ Church Cathedral</a>. Because of his episcopal duties, the regular running of the cathedral was the responsibility of the prior. At the time of Theobald's election there were about 140 monks in the chapter, and they seem to have expected that Theobald, being a monk himself, would take their side in disputes and continue to support their needs. Theobald began well, sending a party of monks from the cathedral to <a href="Dover%20Priory">St Martin's Priory</a> at Dover, which had been settled with <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> instead of monks. Theobald replaced the canons with the monks. Theobald also refounded a collegiate church at South Malling near <a href="Lewes">Lewes</a> to provide <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s for his cathedral chapter.

Theobald worked with his first prior, Jeremiah, to eliminate clerical marriage in the diocese. But Jeremiah had been elected during the vacancy before Theobald's election, and the monks had not secured papal permission for the election of a new prior, so eventually Theobald decided to remove Jeremiah and install his own choice as prior. Jeremiah appealed to the papacy, but Theobald deposed him while the appeal was ongoing, and appointed <a href="Walter%20Durdent">Walter Durdent</a> as prior. Innocent II, however, appointed Henry of Blois to hear the case, and Henry sided with Jeremiah and ordered Jeremiah's reinstatement. Theobald then refused to perform any services in the cathedral until Jeremiah was removed by the chapter. The lack of services would have deprived the monks of income, and Theobald's threat had the desired effect, as Jeremiah resigned his office and left Christ Church for <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey%2C%20Canterbury">St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury</a>. Durdent was reinstalled as prior and remained in that position until he became Bishop of Coventry in October 1149.

At Easter, 1151, Theobald took over the management of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.

Theobald also had a dispute with St Augustine's Abbey over the right of the archbishop to receive annual payments, and whether those payments were for sacraments performed by the archbishop, which would have been uncanonical, or were for other reasons. The dispute was eventually settled by a compromise in which St Augustine's continued to make the payments but they were specifically stated not to be for sacraments. Another dispute with St Augustine's concerned the right of the archbishops to have a say in the election of new abbots and whether or not the abbots would make a profession of obedience to the archbishops. This was eventually settled by a papal mandate of 1144 instructing the abbots to profess obedience.

The conflict re-surfaced in 1149, when some of the monks of St Augustine's, led by their prior and sacrist, refused to obey the interdict placed on England by Theobald and Pope Eugene III. Theobald had the two officials excommunicated and publicly flogged. When the previous abbot of St Augustine's died in 1151, the prior, Silvester, paid the king for the right to administer the abbey and to hold a free election for a new abbot. The monks then proceeded to elect Silvester as the new abbot, but Theobald refused to confirm the election, accusing Silvester of buying the office. Eventually, however, Pope Eugene III ordered Theobald to allow Silvester to take up the office, which Theobald did in August 1152. Theobald and St Augustine's also came into conflict over the abbey's claims of exemption from the archbishops' oversight, because it owed obedience directly to the pope. Papal documents held at Rome backed the abbey, but there were no English royal charters that gave the abbey its liberty from the archbishops. Theobald attempted to end the confusion by legal actions both at Rome and in England, but the record was mixed. The documents at Rome clearly favoured the abbey, but at a royal council held at <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a> in 1157, Henry II ruled in favour of Theobald. As part of the settlement Silvester, as abbot, was required to make a formal profession of obedience to Theobald, something he had been attempting to avoid since his election. The struggle with Silvester was just one event in the long history of the dispute between Canterbury and St Augustine's.

As well as St Augustine's, the abbots of a number of other monasteries in the diocese of Canterbury are known to have professed obedience to Theobald, as the documents recording the events survive. Not only abbots and priors from within Canterbury, but some from other dioceses swore to obey Theobald, although normally such oaths would have gone to their diocesan bishop instead. Most of these exceptions occurred because the monastic house claimed exemption from the oversight of their diocesan bishop, and had a tradition of making those oaths to Canterbury instead. Besides these events, Theobald also intervened in the elections of some abbots, although not always successfully. He attempted to secure the right of Gilbert Foliot to remain <a href="Abbot%20of%20Gloucester">Abbot of Gloucester</a> after Foliot's election as Bishop of Hereford, but a new abbot was elected by the monks of Gloucester. Theobald was more successful in securing the election of William, who had previously been a monk at Christ Church, to be <a href="Abbot%20of%20Evesham">Abbot of Evesham</a> over the objections of some of the monks of Evesham.

Theobald also became embroiled in the dispute between Hilary, the Bishop of Chichester, and <a href="Walter%20de%20Lucy">Walter de Lucy</a>, the abbot of <a href="Battle%20Abbey">Battle Abbey</a>, over Hilary's claims to jurisdiction over the abbey and the abbey's counter-claims that it was exempt from episcopal supervision. The abbey had never received a papal exemption, but relied instead on its royal foundation by King <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William I of England</a> and its status as an <a href="Proprietary%20church">eigenkirche</a>, or proprietary church of the king. Under King Stephen, the abbey's claims prevailed, but after Stephen's death Hilary excommunicated the abbot, who appealed to the papacy. Theobald supported the bishop, who eventually secured a trial before King Henry II. It was a minor setback for Theobald when the case was eventually decided in Battle's favour, mainly on the basis of charters that were thought at the time to be genuine, but modern historians have come to believe were forged.

Theobald was instrumental in securing the subordination of the Welsh bishoprics to Canterbury. His first act in this area was the consecration of <a href="Meurig%20%28bishop%29">Meurig</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bangor">Bishop of Bangor</a> in 1140, during which Meurig made a profession of obedience like those made by other bishops subject to Canterbury. <a href="Bernard%2C%20Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s">Bernard</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s">Bishop of St David's</a>, contested Theobald's right to consecrate Meurig and instead asserted that St David's should be considered an archbishopric, and that Bernard should receive a pallium. This went against the last half-century of precedent that Canterbury had jurisdiction over the four Welsh sees, a precedent that dated back to Anselm's days when Anselm had consecrated <a href="Urban%20%28bishop%20of%20Llandaff%29">Urban</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Llandaff">Bishop of Llandaff</a> in 1107.

Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated <a href="Uhtred%20%28Bishop%20of%20Llandaff%29">Uhtred</a> as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also swearing to obey Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated <a href="Gilbert%20%28Bishop%20of%20St%20Asaph%29">Gilbert</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20Asaph">Bishop of St Asaph</a> in 1142, a similar profession of obedience was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts enabled him to withstand the attempts of Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by <a href="David%20fitzGerald">David fitzGerald</a> in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending the efforts to remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.

Theobald even maintained the theoretical claim of Canterbury to jurisdiction over Irish sees by consecrating Patrick as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Limerick">Bishop of Limerick</a> in 1140. That, however, was the last assertion of the claim, as in 1152 the papal legate <a href="Giovanni%20Paparo">Giovanni Paparo</a> reorganised the Irish dioceses and settled the issue by appointing the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Armagh">Archbishop of Armagh</a> the <a href="Primate%20%28bishop%29">primate</a> of Ireland.

Relations with bishops in England remained good, with little activity in the long-running <a href="Canterbury%E2%80%93York%20dispute">Canterbury–York dispute</a> over the primacy of Britain. Theobald obtained a vague confirmation of his see's primacy from Celestine II in 1143–1144, but at the <a href="Council%20of%20Reims">Council of Reims</a> in 1148 Eugene clarified that this primacy did not affect the claims of York to be independent of Canterbury. Because of the unsettled election disputes during the 1140s over the see of York, when it was contested between William of York and Henry Murdac, Theobald faced little challenge from either William or Murdac as to the traditional dispute between Canterbury and York. When William of York died in 1154, Theobald secured York for his protégé, <a href="Roger%20de%20Pont%20L%27Ev%C3%AAque">Roger de Pont L'Evêque</a>. Further peace between the two sees was ensured when Theobald consecrated Roger without requiring a profession of obedience, which had previously been a major bone of contention between the two.

Theobald's household included many young men of ability, including his successor <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>. Theobald was instrumental in the early spread of Roman law to England, inviting the Bologna-schooled jurist <a href="Vacarius">Vacarius</a> to join his administration and advise on legal matters. Whether Vacarius actually started a school in Theobald's household is unclear, but in the 1140s he taught briefly at Oxford. Theobald was instrumental in fostering the teaching of canon law in England; the conflict that later arose between Henry II and Thomas Becket had its roots in disputes that were exposed during Theobald's time in office. While still in Normandy, Theobald had made an intense study of ecclesiastical or canon law, which he continued after being elected archbishop.

Although Theobald was a monk, his episcopal household was not monastic in character. As he settled into the role of archbishop, he seems to have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have a monk as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a>, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in <a href="Bartholomew%20Iscanus">Bartholomew</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Exeter">Bishop of Exeter</a>'s household in around 1172.

Another charter of Theobald's from about 1152 shows the usual household staff that surrounded him. It was witnessed by the archbishop's crossbearer, three of Theobald's nephews and the clerk who presumably was in charge of them, a <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a>, two chaplains who were monks, a butler, dispenser, <a href="chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a>, steward, cook, usher, porter and <a href="marshal">marshal</a>. Theobald also at about the same time granted a mill to his baker named William and some lands to his cook William and the cook's heirs.

Theobald was the patron of three eminent men: Becket, Vacarius, and <a href="John%20of%20Salisbury">John of Salisbury</a>. John of Salisbury was secretary to Theobald for many years, and after Theobald's death became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chartres">Bishop of Chartres</a>. It was during John's time as secretary that he wrote his two most famous works, the "<a href="Policraticus">Policraticus</a>" and the "<a href="Metalogicon">Metalogicon</a>". Others who studied for a time in Theobald's household were Roger de Pont L'Evêque, later Archbishop of York, <a href="John%20of%20Canterbury">John Belemis</a>, later <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Lyons">Archbishop of Lyons</a>, <a href="John%20de%20Pageham">John de Pageham</a>, later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, Bartholomew Iscanus, later Bishop of Exeter, <a href="William%20of%20Northall">William of Northall</a>, later Bishop of Worcester, and <a href="William%20de%20Vere">William de Vere</a>, later Bishop of Hereford. In all, his household produced three archbishops and six bishops. The household itself, although not formally a school, acted as one, with many going on to careers in the church.

Theobald died on 18 April 1161, after a long illness, at his palace in Canterbury. He was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, in the Holy Trinity Chapel, near the tomb of Archbishop Lanfranc. His coffin was opened in 1190 during repairs to the cathedral and his body was found to be <a href="Incorruptibility">uncorrupted</a>, but efforts to secure his <a href="canonisation">canonisation</a> as a saint on the basis of that evidence were unsuccessful. He was reburied in the nave near the altar to St Mary, with his old marble tomb replaced above his new resting place. In 1787 his lead coffin was found in Canterbury.

Although Theobald was troubled by the opposition of his suffragan Henry of Blois, he regained control of the English Church, secured the rights of his see, and helped maintain the unity of the realm. Contemporaries were somewhat divided on his effectiveness and personality. Gervase of Canterbury felt that he was too impetuous, probably because of Theobald's treatment of his priors at Christ Church. <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, who knew him, felt that he was a worthy archbishop. Theobald's legacy perhaps suffered because he was overshadowed by his successor, Becket. Modern historians have been kinder than his contemporaries; Frank Barlow says of Theobald that he was "an upright man, but quick tempered, and sometimes spoke far too rashly".

Robert of Jumièges

Robert of Jumièges (died between 1052 and 1055) was the first <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. He had previously served as <a href="prior">prior</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Ouen%2C%20Rouen">Abbey of St Ouen</a> at <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> in Normandy, before becoming <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of <a href="Jumi%C3%A8ges%20Abbey">Jumièges Abbey</a>, near Rouen, in 1037. He was a good friend and adviser to the king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, who appointed him <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a> in 1044, and then archbishop in 1051. Robert's time as archbishop lasted only about eighteen months. He had already come into conflict with the powerful <a href="Godwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Godwin, Earl of Wessex</a>, and while archbishop made attempts to recover lands lost to Godwin and his family. He also refused to consecrate <a href="Spearhafoc">Spearhafoc</a>, Edward's choice to succeed Robert as Bishop of London. The rift between Robert and Godwin culminated in Robert's deposition and exile in 1052.

A Norman medieval chronicler claimed that Robert travelled to Normandy in 1051 or 1052 and told Duke <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William of Normandy</a>, the future William the Conqueror, that Edward wished for him to become his heir. The exact timing of Robert's trip, and whether he actually made it, have been the subject of debate among historians. The archbishop died in exile at Jumièges sometime between 1052 and 1055. Robert commissioned significant building work at Jumièges and was probably involved in the first Romanesque building in England, the church built in Westminster for Edward the Confessor, now known as <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Robert's treatment by the English was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England.

Robert was prior of the <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Ouen%2C%20Rouen">monastery of St Ouen</a> at Rouen before he became abbot of the important Jumièges Abbey in 1037. Jumièges had been refounded under <a href="William%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">William Longsword</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>. around 940, Its ties with the ducal family were close and it played a role in ducal government and church reform. Robert's alternate surname "Champart" or "Chambert" probably derived from <a href="champart">champart</a>, a term for the part of a crop paid as rent to a landlord. Besides evidence that the preceding abbot at Jumièges was a relative, Robert's origin and family background are otherwise unknown. While abbot, Robert began construction of the abbey church, in the new <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style.

Robert became friendly with Edward the Confessor, a claimant to the English throne, while Edward was living in exile in Normandy, probably in the 1030s. Edward was the son of <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred the Unready</a>, king of England, who had been replaced by <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut the Great</a> in 1016. Cnut subsequently married Æthelred's widow <a href="Emma%20of%20Normandy">Emma of Normandy</a>, Edward's mother, and had a son with her, <a href="Harthacanute">Harthacanute</a>. For their own safety, Edward and his brother <a href="Alfred%20Aetheling">Alfred</a> were sent to Emma's relatives in Normandy. After Cnut's death in 1035, <a href="Harold%20Harefoot">Harold Harefoot</a>, his elder son by his first wife, acceded to the English throne. Following Harald's death in 1040, Harthacanute succeeded him for a short time, but as neither Harald nor Harthacanute left offspring, the throne was offered to Edward on Harthacanute's death in 1042. There is some evidence that Edward spent some of his time in exile around Jumièges, as after becoming king he gave gifts to the abbey.

Robert accompanied Edward the Confessor on Edward's recall to England in 1042 to become king following Harthacanute's death. It was due to Edward that in August 1044 Robert was appointed Bishop of London, one of the first episcopal vacancies which occurred in Edward's reign. Robert remained close to the king and was the leader of the party opposed to Earl Godwin, Earl of Wessex. Godwin, for his part, was attempting to expand the influence of his family, which had already acquired much land. His daughter was Edward's queen, and two of his sons were elevated to earldoms. The "<a href="Vita%20%C3%86dwardi%20Regis">Life of Saint Edward</a>", a <a href="Hagiography">hagiographical</a> work on King Edward's life, claimed that Robert "was always the most powerful confidential adviser of the king". Robert seems to have favoured closer relations with Normandy, and its duke. Edward himself had grown up in the duchy, and spent 25 years in exile there before his return to England. He brought many Normans with him to England, and seems to have spent much time in their company.

When Archbishop <a href="Eadsige">Eadsige</a> of Canterbury died in October 1050, the post remained vacant for five months. The <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> elected Æthelric, a kinsman of Godwin and a monk at Canterbury, but were over-ruled when Edward appointed Robert Archbishop of Canterbury the following year. Godwin was attempting to exercise his power of patronage over the archbishopric, but the king's appointment signalled that the king was willing to contest with the earl over the traditional royal rights at Canterbury. Although the monks of Canterbury opposed it, the king's appointment stood. Robert went to Rome to receive his <a href="pallium">pallium</a> and returned to England where he was ceremonially enthroned at Canterbury on 29 June 1051. Some Norman chroniclers state that he visited Normandy on this trip and informed Duke William, the future William the Conqueror, that he was the childless King Edward's heir. According to these chroniclers, the decision to make William the heir had been decided at the same lenten royal council in 1051 that had declared Robert archbishop.

After returning from Rome, Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, the <a href="Abingdon%20Abbey">Abbot of Abingdon</a> and the king's goldsmith, as his successor to the bishopric of London, claiming that Pope <a href="Pope%20Leo%20IX">Leo IX</a> had forbidden the consecration. Almost certainly the grounds were simony, the purchase of ecclesiastical office, as Leo had recently issued proclamations against the practice. In refusing to consecrate Spearhafoc, Robert may have been following his own interests against the wishes of both the king and Godwin, as he had his own candidate, a Norman, in mind. In the end Robert's favoured candidate, <a href="William%20the%20Norman">William the Norman</a>, was consecrated instead of Spearhafoc. Robert also discovered that some lands belonging to Canterbury had fallen into Godwin's hands, but his efforts to recover them through the shire courts were unsuccessful. Canterbury had lost control of some revenues from the shire of Kent to Godwin during Eadsige's tenure as archbishop, which Robert unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim. These disputes over the estates and revenues of the archbishopric contributed to the friction between Robert and Godwin, which had begun with Robert's election. Robert's election had disrupted Godwin's patronage powers in Canterbury, and now Robert's efforts to recover lands Godwin had seized from Canterbury challenged the earl's economic rights. Events came to a head at a council held at <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> in September 1051, when Robert accused Earl Godwin of plotting to kill King Edward. Godwin and his family were exiled; afterwards Robert claimed the office of sheriff of <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, probably on the strength of <a href="Eadsige">Eadsige</a>, his predecessor as archbishop, having held the office.

Although Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, there is little evidence that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">Gregorian Reform</a>, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a "<a href="quid%20pro%20quo">quid pro quo</a>" for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.

The "Life of Saint Edward" claims that while Godwin was in exile Robert tried to persuade King Edward to divorce <a href="Edith%20of%20Wessex">Edith</a>, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she was sent to a <a href="Abbey">nunnery</a>. However, the "Life" is a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it stresses that Edward voluntarily remained <a href="Celibacy">celibate</a>, something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.

During Godwin's exile, Robert is said to have been sent by the king on an errand to <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William, Duke of Normandy</a>. The reason for the embassy is uncertain. <a href="William%20of%20Jumi%C3%A8ges">William of Jumièges</a> says that Robert went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir. The medieval writer <a href="William%20of%20Poitiers">William of Poitiers</a> gives the same reason, but also adds that Robert took with him as hostages Godwin's son <a href="Wulfnoth%20Godwinson">Wulfnoth</a> and grandson <a href="Hakon%20Sweynson">Hakon</a> (son of <a href="Sweyn%20Godwinson">Sweyn</a>). The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" is silent on the visit however, so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not, or why he did so. The entire history of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused, and complicated by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> in 1066, leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile, or if he went twice or not at all.

After Godwin left England, he went to <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, and gathered a fleet and mercenaries to force the king to allow his return. In the summer of 1052, Godwin returned to England and was met by his sons, who had invaded from Ireland. By September, they were advancing on London, where negotiations between the king and the earl were conducted with the help of <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>. When it became apparent that Godwin would be returning, Robert quickly left England with Bishop <a href="Ulfus%20Normanus">Ulf of Dorchester</a> and Bishop William of London, probably once again taking Wulfnoth and Hakon with him as hostages, whether with the permission of King Edward or not. Robert was declared an outlaw and deposed from his archbishopric on 14 September 1052 at a royal council, mainly because the returning Godwin felt that Robert, along with a number of other Normans, had been the driving force behind his exile. Robert journeyed to Rome to complain to the pope about his own exile, where Leo IX and successive popes condemned Stigand, whom Edward had appointed to Canterbury. Robert's personal property was divided between Earl Godwin, Harold Godwinson, and the queen, who had returned to court.

Robert died at Jumièges, but the date of his death is unclear. Various dates are given, with Ian Walker, the biographer of Harold arguing for between 1053 and 1055, but <a href="H.%20E.%20J.%20Cowdrey">H. E. J. Cowdrey</a>, who wrote Robert's "<a href="Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography%23Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" entry, says on 26 May in either 1052 or 1055. <a href="H.%20R.%20Loyn">H. R. Loyn</a>, another modern historian, argues that it is likely that he died in 1053.

Robert's treatment was used by William the Conqueror as one of the justifications for his invasion of England, the other being that Edward had named William his heir. Ian Walker, author of the most recent scholarly biography of <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>, suggests that it was Robert, while in exile after the return of Godwin, who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward's heir. However, this view is contradicted by David Douglas, a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror, who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward's decision, probably while Robert was on his way to Rome to receive his pallium. Several medieval chroniclers, including the author of the "Life of Saint Edward", felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin's conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with Robert; modern historians tend to see Robert as an ambitious man, with little political skill.

In notable contrast to his successor Stigand, Robert does not figure among the important benefactors to English churches, but we know of some transfers to Jumièges of important English church treasures, the first trickle of what was to become a flood of treasure taken to Normandy after the Conquest. These included the relic of the head of <a href="Saint%20Valentine">Saint Valentine</a> only recently given to the monks of <a href="Winchester%20Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a> by Emma of Normandy. Though the Winchester head remained in place, another one appeared at Jumièges; he "must have clandestinely removed the head, or at least the greater part of it, and left his monks to venerate the empty or nearly empty "capsa"". Two of the four most important surviving late <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s went the same way, thus probably preventing their destruction in a series of fires that devastated the major English libraries. One is the so-called "Missal of Robert of Jumièges", actually a <a href="sacramentary">sacramentary</a> with thirteen surviving full-page miniatures, which bears an inscription apparently in Robert's own hand recording its donation to Jumièges when he was Bishop of London, and the other the so-called "Benedictional of Archbishop Robert", actually a <a href="Roman%20Pontifical">pontifical</a> with three remaining full-page miniatures and other decoration (respectively Rouen, Bibliothèque Municipale, Manuscripts Y.6 and Y.7). The latter may well have been commissioned by Æthelgar, Robert's predecessor as archbishop in 988–90, although it is possible the "Archbishop Robert" of the traditional name is Emma's brother <a href="Robert%20II%20%28archbishop%20of%20Rouen%29">Robert, Archbishop of Rouen</a> from 990 to 1037. These masterpieces of the Winchester style were the most elaborately decorated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts known to have reached Normandy, either before or after the Conquest, and influenced the much less-developed local style, though this remained very largely restricted to initials.

Before he came to England, Robert had begun the construction of a new abbey church at Jumièges, in the new Romanesque style which was then becoming popular, and introduced to Normandy the <a href="Westwork">two-towered western facade</a> from the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>. On his return to Normandy he continued to build there, and the abbey church was not finished until 1067. Although the choir has been torn down, the towers, <a href="nave">nave</a> and <a href="transept">transept</a>s have survived. Robert probably influenced Edward the Confessor's rebuilding of the church at Westminster Abbey, the first known building in the Romanesque style in England, which is so described by <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>. Edward's work began in about 1050 and was completed just before his death in 1065. The recorded name of one of the senior masons, "Teinfrith the churchwright" indicates foreign origins, and Robert may have arranged for Norman masons to be brought over, though other names are English. It is possible that Westminster influenced the building at Jumièges, as the arcade there closely resembles Westminster's arcade, both of them in a style that never became common in Normandy. The Early Romanesque style of both was to be superseded after the Conquest by the Anglo-Norman High Romanesque style pioneered in <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> and <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint-%C3%89tienne%2C%20Caen">St Étienne, Caen</a> by <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>.

Hubert Walter

Hubert Walter ( – 13 July 1205) was an influential royal adviser in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries in the positions of Chief <a href="Justiciar">Justiciar</a> of England, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, and <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>. As chancellor, Walter began the keeping of the <a href="Charter%20Roll">Charter Roll</a>, a record of all charters issued by the chancery. Walter was not noted for his holiness in life or learning, but historians have judged him one of the most outstanding government ministers in <a href="History%20of%20England">English history</a>.

Walter owed his early advancement to his uncle <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Glanvill">Ranulf de Glanvill</a>, who helped him become a clerk of the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>. Walter served King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> in many ways, not just in financial administration, but also including diplomatic and judicial efforts. After an unsuccessful candidacy to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">see of York</a>, Walter was elected <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a> shortly after the accession of Henry's son <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> to the throne of England.

Walter accompanied Richard on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>, and was one of the principals involved in raising Richard's ransom after the king was captured in Germany on his return from the Holy Land. As a reward for his faithful service, Walter was selected to become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193. He also served as Richard's justiciar until 1198, in which role he was responsible for raising the money Richard needed to prosecute his wars in France. Walter set up a system that was the precursor for the modern <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">justices of the peace</a>, based on selecting four knights in each <a href="Hundred%20%28administrative%20division%29">hundred</a> to administer justice. He also revived his predecessor's dispute over setting up a church to rival <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Christ Church Priory</a> in Canterbury, which was only settled when the pope ordered him to abandon the plan. Following Richard's death in 1199, Walter helped assure the elevation of Richard's brother <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a> to the throne. Walter also served John as a diplomat, undertaking several missions to France.

Hubert Walter was the son of Hervey Walter and his wife Maud de Valoignes, one of the daughters (and co-heiresses) of Theobald de Valoignes, who was lord of Parham in Suffolk. Walter was one of six brothers. The eldest brother, <a href="Theobald%20Walter%2C%201st%20Baron%20Butler">Theobald Walter</a>, and Walter himself, were helped in their careers by their uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Glanvill was the chief justiciar for Henry II; and was married to Maud de Valoignes' sister, Bertha. Walter's father and paternal grandfather held lands in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> and <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, which were inherited by Theobald. A younger brother, <a href="Osbert%20fitzHervey">Osbert</a>, became a royal justice and died in 1206. Roger, Hamo (or Hamon) and Bartholomew only appear as witnesses to charters.

Walter's family was from <a href="West%20Dereham">West Dereham</a> in Norfolk, which is probably where Walter was born. Walter first appears in Glanvill's household in a charter that has been dated to 1178, although as it is undated it may have been written as late as 1180. His brother Theobald also served in their uncle's household. Walter's gratitude towards his aunt and uncle is shown in the foundation charter of Walter's monastery in Dereham, where he asks the foundation to pray for the "souls of Ranulf Glanvill and Bertha his wife, who nourished us". Earlier historians asserted that Walter studied law at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, based on his name appearing in a list of those to be commemorated at a monastery in Bologna in which English students lodged. Modern historians have discounted this, as the list also includes benefactors, not just students; other evidence points to the fact that Walter had a poor grasp of Latin, and did not consider himself to be a learned man. However, this did not mean that he was illiterate, merely that he was not "book-learned", or educated at a university. His contemporary, the medieval writer <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> said of Walter that the Exchequer was his school.

By 1184–1185 Walter had a position as a <a href="Exchequer">baron of the exchequer</a>. The king employed him on several tasks, including as a negotiator, a justice, and as a royal secretary. He was appointed <a href="Dean%20of%20York">Dean of York</a> by order of King Henry II about July 1186. The archbishopric had been vacant since 1181 and would remain so until 1189, so it was Walter's job as dean to administer the archbishopric of York. Walter was also an unsuccessful candidate to become <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> in September 1186. The medieval chronicler <a href="Gervase%20of%20Canterbury">Gervase of Canterbury</a> said that during Henry II's reign, Walter "ruled England because Glanvill sought his counsel". Documents also show that Walter was active in the administration of the <a href="diocese%20of%20York">diocese of York</a>.

At the same time he was administering York, Walter founded a <a href="Premonstratensian">Premonstratensian</a> house of <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a>s on purchased property at West Dereham, Norfolk in 1188. His uncle and other family members had favoured the Premonstratensian Order, and this monastery was located near the family lands in Norfolk.

In 1187 Walter, along with Glanvill and King Henry II, attempted to mediate a dispute between the Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Baldwin%20of%20Forde">Baldwin of Forde</a>, and the monks of the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>. Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 and again as archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which the monks of Canterbury's cathedral chapter feared was an attempt to take away the cathedral chapter's right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin giving up the site near Canterbury for one further away at <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, which was less threatening to the monks.

After the death of King Henry in 1189, the new King Richard I appointed Walter Bishop of Salisbury; the election took place on 15 September 1189 at <a href="Pipewell">Pipewell</a>, with the <a href="consecration">consecration</a> on 22 October 1189 at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster</a>. Also elected to bishoprics at this council were <a href="Godfrey%20de%20Lucy">Godfrey de Lucy</a> to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">see of Winchester</a>, <a href="Richard%20FitzNeal">Richard FitzNeal</a> to the <a href="diocese%20of%20London">see of London</a>, and <a href="William%20Longchamp">William Longchamp</a> to the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Ely">see of Ely</a>. The elevation of so many new bishops was probably meant to signal the new king's break with his father's habit of keeping bishoprics empty to retain the revenues of the <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a>s. At about the same time Glanvill was either forced out of his justiciarship or resigned, but the sources are unclear. Walter was probably elevated to a bishopric even though his uncle had lost some of his power because of political manoeuvring over the elevation of King Richard's illegitimate half-brother <a href="Geoffrey%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">Geoffrey</a> to the see of York, which Walter had at first opposed. The bishopric was either a reward or a bribe for Walter's withdrawal of his objections to Geoffrey's election.

Soon after his appointment, Walter accompanied the king on the Third Crusade, going ahead of the king directly from <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> to the Holy Land in a group that included Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ranulf de Glanvill. The group left Marseille in August 1190, and arrived at <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> two months later. While on crusade, he was praised by his fellow crusaders, and acted as Richard's principal negotiator with <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a> for a peace treaty. After the conclusion of the treaty with Saladin, Walter was in the first band of pilgrims that entered <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Saladin entertained Walter during his stay in Jerusalem, and the Englishman succeeded in extracting a promise from Saladin that a small group of Western clergy would be allowed to remain in the city to perform divine services. Walter subsequently led the English army back to England after Richard's departure from <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, but in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> he heard of the king's capture, and diverted to Germany. He, along with <a href="William%20of%20Sainte-M%C3%A8re-Eglise">William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise</a>, was among the first of Richard's subjects to find the king at <a href="Ochsenfurt">Ochsenfurt</a> where he was being held. In April 1193 he returned to England to raise the king's ransom. Richard wrote to his mother, Queen <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>, that Walter should be chosen for the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a>, as well as to the monks of the cathedral chapter, and soon after Walter's return to England, he was duly elected archbishop of Canterbury, having been transferred to the see on 29 May 1193. He was chosen as archbishop without consultation from the bishops, who normally claimed the right to help decide the new archbishop. He received his <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of his archiepiscopal authority, from <a href="Pope%20Celestine%20III">Pope Celestine III</a> and was ceremonially enthroned at Canterbury on 7 November 1193.

After Richard was freed, he spent little time in England, instead concentrating on the war with King <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a>, which began with Philip's attempts to acquire Richard's possessions on the continent. Richard made Walter Chief Justiciar about 25 December 1193. Walter remained in England, raising money for the king's wars and overseeing the administration of the kingdom. The constant warfare forced Walter to find new means of raising money through <a href="Taxation%20in%20medieval%20England">taxation</a>. The historian <a href="Doris%20Mary%20Stenton">Doris Stenton</a> wrote that the <a href="Pipe%20Rolls">Pipe Rolls</a>, or financial records, during Walter's time as justiciar "give the impression of a country taxed to the limit". Walter was also responsible for choosing royal justices, and many of his choices were connected with, or had previously worked with, the archbishop in the royal administration. Because of Richard's absence from England, Walter was able to exercise more authority as justiciar than any of his predecessors. All that Walter needed to do was keep Richard's monetary needs satisfied. Combined with Walter's position as archbishop, Walter wielded a power unseen in England since the days of <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>.

One of Walter's first acts as justiciar was in February 1194, when he presided over a feudal judgement of <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>, Richard's younger brother. After Richard's release from captivity, John, intending to begin a rebellion, had prepared his castles for defence. His letters ordering the preparations were intercepted and John was deprived of his lands. When John showed no signs of submitting, Walter called an ecclesiastical council at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> for the purposes of <a href="Excommunication">excommunicating</a> John unless he submitted. John refused to submit, and was excommunicated. To defeat the rebellion, Walter was required to lay siege to <a href="Marlborough%20Castle">Marlborough Castle</a> himself. Walter employed his brother Theobald in similar actions in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a>, and rewarded him with the office of <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a> of Lancaster. Eventually in May 1194, John made peace with Richard, and was restored to favour, although the restoration of his lands did not occur until late in 1195.

Walter's chief administrative measures were his instructions to the itinerant justices of 1194 and 1198, his ordinance of 1195, an attempt to increase order in the kingdom, and his plan of 1198 for the assessment of a land tax. In 1194 the justices were ordered to secure the election of four <a href="coroner">coroner</a>s by each county court. The coroners were to "keep", or register, royal pleas, which had previously been a duty of the sheriff. The juries were to be chosen by a committee of four knights, also elected by the county court. This introduction of coroners and constables eventually led to a change in the role of sheriffs, and a lessening of their importance in royal administration. Although he probably did not take part in the decision to set up a special exchequer for the collection of Richard's ransom, Walter did appoint the two escheators, or guardians of the amounts due, who were <a href="Hugh%20Bardulf">Hugh Bardulf</a> in the north of England and William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise in the south. His instructions for the eyre, or circuits of traveling justices, are the first that survive in English history. It was during his tenure of the justiciarship that the judicial role of the Exchequer became separated from the purely financial aspects.

He also worked to introduce order into the lending of money by <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish moneylenders, and organised a system where the royal officials worked to combat fraud by both parties in the business of Jewish money lending. Walter was probably the originator of the custom of keeping an archival copy of all <a href="charter">charter</a>s, <a href="Letters%20close">letters</a>, <a href="Letters%20patent">patents</a> and <a href="Foot%20of%20fine">feet of fines</a>, or record of agreements reached in the royal courts, in the <a href="Chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">chancery</a>. The first recorded "foot of the fine" is endorsed with the statement "This is the first <a href="chirograph">chirograph</a> that was made in the king's court in the form of three chirographs, according to the command of his lordship of Canterbury and other barons of the king, to the end that by this form a record can be made to be passed on to the treasurer to put in the treasury." The agreement concerns Walter's brother Theobald, who was the plaintiff.

Walter also helped with the creation of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included <a href="Simon%20of%20Pattishall">Simon of Pattishall</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Foliot">Ralph Foliot</a>, <a href="Richard%20Barre">Richard Barre</a>, <a href="William%20de%20Warenne%20%28justice%29">William de Warenne</a>, <a href="Richard%20Herriard">Richard Herriard</a>, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any familial ties to himself. This group of men replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are the first signs of a professional judiciary.

In 1195 Walter issued an ordinance by which four knights were appointed in every hundred to act as guardians of the peace, a precursor to the office of Justice of the Peace. His use of the <a href="knight">knight</a>s, who appear for the first time in political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">members of parliament</a> or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a <a href="carucage">carucage</a>, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or <a href="carucate">carucate</a>, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them to be made by a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.

In foreign affairs, Walter negotiated with Scotland in 1195 and with the Welsh in 1197. Scotland claimed <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, or northern England. Negotiations broke down, but relations between the two countries remained good throughout the rest of Richard's reign. Talks with the Welsh began after the <a href="Peerage%20of%20England">English lords</a> <a href="Roger%20Mortimer%20of%20Wigmore">Roger Mortimer</a> and <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%204th%20Lord%20of%20Bramber">William de Briouze</a> expanded into Welsh territory in 1195, causing a concern that the Welsh lord <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Gruffydd">Rhys ap Gruffydd</a> would strike back across the border. In 1196, Walter quickly suppressed a popular uprising in London led by <a href="William%20Fitz%20Osbern%20%281196%29">William Fitz Osbern</a>. FitzOsbern was an orator who harnessed the discontent of the poor residents of London against high taxes. His oratory provoked a riot in London, and he was apprehended and hanged on Walter's orders.

Walter held a <a href="Papal%20legate">legateship</a> from Pope Celestine III from 1195 to 1198, which enabled him to act with the pope's delegated authority within the English Church. Walter actively investigated ecclesiastical misconduct, and deposed several <a href="abbot">abbot</a>s, including Robert of <a href="Thorney%20Abbey">Thorney Abbey</a> in 1195 and an abbot of St Mary's in the province of the Archbishop of York. At the monastic <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">cathedral of Worcester</a>, he disciplined the monks between the death of <a href="Henry%20de%20Sully%20%28died%201195%29">Henry de Sully</a> and the election of <a href="John%20of%20Coutances">John of Coutances</a>, as was his right as the archbishop of the province. In his own diocese, he granted markets and fairs to towns, was granted the privilege of minting coins at Shrewsbury, and worked to recover lands and manors that had been lost to the archdiocese.

Walter revived the scheme of his predecessor, Baldwin of Forde, to found a church in <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a> that would be <a href="Secular%20clergy">secular</a> and not <a href="Monk">monastic</a>. He promised that the new foundation's canons would not be allowed to vote in archiepiscopal elections nor would the body of Saint Thomas Becket ever be moved to the new church, but the monks of his cathedral chapter were suspicious and appealed to the papacy. The dispute from the time of Baldwin of Forde flared up again, with the papacy supporting the monks and the king supporting the archbishop. Finally, Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Innocent III</a> ruled for the monks and ordered Walter to destroy what had been built.

The archbishop held ecclesiastical councils, including one at <a href="York">York</a> in 1195 that legislated that the clergy should collect their <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s in full, "...without any reduction." Another council was held at London in 1200 to legislate the size and composition of clerical retinues, and also ruled that the clergy, when saying <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>, should speak clearly and not speed up or slow down their speech. At the request of the papacy, Walter also led inquiries into the <a href="canonisation">canonisation</a>s of <a href="Gilbert%20of%20Sempringham">Gilbert of Sempringham</a> and <a href="Wulfstan%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Wulfstan of Worcester</a>. Walter refused to acquiesce in the election of Gerald of Wales to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s">see of St David's</a> in Wales and opposed the efforts of Gerald and others to elevate St David's to an archbishopric.

In the later part of Richard's reign, the pressures mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties and his government duties made him the target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300 knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied with the results of the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may have resigned willingly, as he had talked of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.

According to the "Life of William Marshal", which dates to soon after 1219, when word reached <a href="William%20Marshal%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">William Marshal</a>, one of the richest and most influential barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal's choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John's young nephew <a href="Arthur%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Arthur of Brittany</a>. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the "Life" has Walter say in reply " 'So be it then,' said the archbishop, 'but mark my words, Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.'" This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John's later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge <a href="fealty">fealty</a> to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king's election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not certain what the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian and author of a biography of John, says of Walter that "No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions for coping with new problems."

One of Walter's first suggestions was to lower the fees for having charters confirmed, from nine <a href="Pound%20sterling">pounds</a> and five <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s to eighteen shillings and four <a href="Penny">pence</a>. Accompanying this measure was a requirement that no charter would be accepted in a king's court without having been confirmed by King John. Not only did this reduce forgeries, it led to the establishment of the Charter Roll, an administrative copy of all charters issued and confirmed by the government. In his relations with other officers, Walter worked closely with the justiciar <a href="Geoffrey%20Fitz%20Peter%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Geoffrey Fitz Peter</a>, on the collection of taxation, and both men went to Wales in 1203 on a diplomatic mission. Another joint action of the two men concerned a tax of a seventh part of all movables collected from both lay and ecclesiastical persons. The medieval chronicler <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a> said that the king "had Archbishop Hubert of Canterbury to act for him in the matter of the church property, Geoffrey fitz-Peter in the matter of lay property; and these two spared no one in carrying out their orders." Walter was also responsible for the keeping of copies of other royal letters in the <a href="Close%20Roll">Close Roll</a>s and the <a href="Patent%20Rolls">Patent Rolls</a>. The Patent rolls record letters that were issued in "patent", or openly and not sealed, and the Close rolls record letters issued sealed, or letters close. The various rolls are extant from 1199 for the Charter roll, 1201 for the Patent roll, and 1204 for the Close roll. Walter also continued to innovate in local government, as the earliest record of the coroner's rolls, or county records, being used to cross-check oral testimony in the county courts date from 1202 and 1203, during Walter's chancellorship.

In 1201 Walter went on a diplomatic mission to Philip II of France, which was unsuccessful, and in 1202 he returned to England as regent while John was abroad. In April 1204 Walter returned to France with <a href="John%20de%20Gray">John de Gray</a> the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, <a href="Eustace%2C%20Dean%20of%20Salisbury">Eustace</a> the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a>, William Marshal, and <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert de Beaumont</a> the <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earl of Leicester</a> to seek peace with Philip Augustus. Philip insisted that John hand over Arthur of Brittany, Arthur's sister <a href="Eleanor%2C%20Fair%20Maid%20of%20Brittany">Eleanor</a>, and renounce all of his continental possessions before the French king would make peace. John refused to do this, and the embassy returned to England not long before Philip conquered <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>.

Besides sending Walter on diplomatic missions, King John gave Walter custody of <a href="Rochester%20Castle">Rochester Castle</a> on 20 July 1202, but as Walter was already accounting for the taxes and fees of the city of Rochester to the Exchequer in 1200, it is possible that he held the castle before 1202. John also upheld the right of the archbishop to mint coins, which Walter held until his death in 1205.

Under John, Walter continued to be active in ecclesiastical affairs, and in September 1200 held a provincial church council at London. This council set forth 14 canons, or decrees, which dealt with a number of subjects, including doctrinal concerns, financial affairs, and the duties of the clergy. It drew heavily on earlier church decrees, including those of the <a href="Third%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">Third Lateran Council</a> of 1179. Walter also interceded with Pope Innocent III in 1200, mediating between the pope and the king over a royal dispute with the Cistercians. Walter's intercession prevented the dispute from escalating, and kept the pope from imposing sanctions on the king for his threats to the Cistercians. It was in 1200 that the church court records of the archdiocese of Canterbury began to be recorded and kept, although after Walter's death in 1205 the records become sparse until the 14th century.

Walter died on 13 July 1205, after a long illness that permitted a reconciliation with his monks. The medieval chronicler <a href="Ralph%20of%20Coggeshall">Ralph of Coggeshall</a> described his death as taking four days, and related that he gave vestments, jewellery, and altar furnishings to his monks, which were confiscated by King John after Walter's death. He was buried in the <a href="Trinity%20Chapel">Trinity Chapel</a> in <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>, next to Thomas Becket, where his tomb can still be seen. The tomb occupied a highly visible spot in the Trinity Chapel, and Walter was the first archbishop to be buried there since the 1170s, when all of the tombs but Becket's had been relocated to focus attention on Becket's shrine. His remained the only ecclesiastic to be buried there until the 14th century. The use by the archbishops of Canterbury of the title "Primate of All England" dates from Walter's archiepiscopal tenure.

The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris retold the story that when King John heard of Walter's death, the king exclaimed "Now for the first time I am king of England". This story, however entertaining, is apocryphal. More secure is the story that another chronicler, Roger of Wendover, relates about Walter's Christmas celebrations in 1200. Roger reports that Walter distributed clothing to those attending his Christmas feast, which angered King John. The chronicler says that Walter "wished to put himself on a par with the king".

Walter was not a holy man, although he was, as <a href="John%20Gillingham">John Gillingham</a>, a historian and biographer of Richard I, says, "one of the most outstanding government ministers in English History". <a href="Hugh%20of%20Lincoln">Hugh of Lincoln</a>, a contemporary and later canonised, is said to have asked forgiveness of God for not having rebuked Walter as often as he probably should have. Modern historians tend not to share the older view that Walter was the driving force behind the administrative changes during Richard's reign, that Richard was uninterested in government, and that he left all decisions in the hands of his ministers, especially Longchamp and Walter. The studies of James Holt and others have shown that Richard was highly involved in government decisions, and that it was more a partnership between the king and his ministers. Walter was, however, very innovative in his approach to government. Walter continued to enjoy the support of Richard's brother John, and it was during John's reign that a number of Walter's administrative reforms took place, although how much royal initiative was behind the innovations is unknown, given John's interest in government and administration.

Walter was the butt of jokes about his lack of learning, and was the target of a series of tales from the pen of the chronicler Gerald of Wales, an enemy of the archbishop. Even Walter's supporters could only state that he was "moderately literate". Walter employed several canon lawyers who had been educated at Bologna in his household, including <a href="John%20of%20Tynemouth%20%28canon%20lawyer%29">John of Tynemouth</a>, <a href="Simon%20of%20Southwell">Simon of Southwell</a>, and <a href="Honorius%20of%20Kent">Honorius of Kent</a>. He also employed the architect <a href="Elias%20of%20Dereham">Elias of Dereham</a>, who was one of Walter's executors. Elias is traditionally credited as being the architect of <a href="Salisbury%20Cathedral">Salisbury Cathedral</a> after Walter's death. Another scholar employed by Walter was <a href="Peter%20of%20Blois">Peter of Blois</a>, who served both Walter and his predecessor as a Latin secretary.

Little is known of his appearance, although he was described by Gerald of Wales as tall and handsome. Gerald also praised his intelligence and cleverness.

W. L. Warren advances the theory that either Walter or Geoffrey Fitz Peter, instead of Ranulf Glanvill, was the author of "<a href="Tractatus%20of%20Glanvill">Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Angliae</a>," a legal treatise on the laws and constitutions of the English. Chrimes agrees that Glanvill was probably not the author, and feels that Walter likely was, although he could not be certain. If he was the author, he composed what Chrimes called a "great literary memorial of Henry II's government". Neither of Walter's two modern biographers, however, feel that he was the author of the "Tractatus", and the historian Ralph Turner agrees. The historian <a href="Michael%20Clanchy">Michael Clanchy</a> says of Walter "The proliferation of documents was a European and a continuing phenomenon, yet if it were to be associated in England with one man, he would be Hubert Walter."

Robert Burnell

Robert Burnell (sometimes spelled Robert Burnel; <a href="circa">c.</a> 1239 – 25 October 1292) was an English bishop who served as <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> of England from 1274 to 1292. A native of <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, he served as a minor royal official before entering into the service of Prince Edward, the future King <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a>. When Edward went on the <a href="Eighth%20Crusade">Eighth Crusade</a> in 1270, Burnell stayed in England to secure the prince's interests. He served as <a href="regent">regent</a> after the death of King <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III of England</a> while Edward was still on crusade. He was twice elected <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, but his personal life—which included a long-term mistress who was rumoured to have borne him four sons—prevented his confirmation by the papacy. In 1275 Burnell was elected <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Bishop of Bath and Wells</a>, after Edward had appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1274.

Burnell was behind the efforts of the royal officials to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including the implementation of the "<a href="Quo%20warranto">Quo warranto</a>" procedures. He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became fixed in London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, and for a time governed <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.

By 1198 Burnell's family had bestowed its name on <a href="Acton%20Burnell">Acton Burnell</a> in Shropshire, where Burnell was born probably in about 1239, as he was close in age to King Edward. His father was probably Roger Burnell, who died in about 1259. He had three brothers, two of whom died fighting the <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moel-y-don">Battle of Moel-y-don</a> in 1282; the third, Hugh, died in 1286. Hugh's son Philip was Robert's eventual heir. Burnell worked as a clerk in the royal chancery, the office responsible for the writing of documents, before moving to the household of Prince Edward, later King Edward I of England. By 1257 Burnell was spending most of his time with the prince and the prince's household. After <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort</a>'s victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lewes">Battle of Lewes</a> in 1264, Burnell continued to serve Edward, and was named the prince's clerk in December 1264. As a reward for his service, Burnell was given the <a href="Prebendary">prebend</a> of Holme in the <a href="diocese%20of%20York">diocese of York</a> some time before 1267, and was named <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20York">Archdeacon of York</a> in December 1270. He also held the office of chancellor to Edward from the time of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Evesham">Battle of Evesham</a> in 1265 until 1270, when Edward left on <a href="Eighth%20Crusade">crusade</a>.

Prince Edward tried to have Burnell elected to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishopric of Canterbury</a> in 1270, but was frustrated by the Canterbury <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>'s members, who instead elected their <a href="prior">prior</a>, <a href="William%20Chillenden">William Chillenden</a>. Eventually Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20X">Gregory X</a> set Chillenden aside and installed his own choice in the see, <a href="Robert%20Kilwardby">Robert Kilwardby</a>. Burnell did not accompany the prince on crusade in late 1270, although he had originally planned to do so. Instead, he was appointed one of the four lieutenants who looked after Edward's interests while the prince was away. Thus he was still in England when Henry III died in November 1272. Burnell acted as one of the regents of the kingdom until August 1274, when the prince, now king, returned from <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. During the regency Burnell supervised a parliament, dealt with raids on the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a> and resolved a trade conflict with Flanders. After the king's return to England Burnell was made chancellor. The historian <a href="Richard%20Huscroft">Richard Huscroft</a> considers that Burnell gained valuable experience governing England during Edward's absence, ensuring Burnell's dominance in the English government after Edward's return.

On 23 January 1275 Burnell was elected to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">see of Bath and Wells</a>. He received the <a href="property">temporalities</a> of the see on 19 March 1275 and was consecrated on 7 April 1275. Three years later Edward once more tried to secure the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a> for his favourite. Burnell was elected to the archbishopric in June or July 1278, but the election was quashed by Pope <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20III">Nicholas III</a> in January 1279. King Edward sent a deputation, including the eventual appointee, <a href="John%20Peckham">John Peckham</a>, to secure Nicholas' confirmation of the election. The pope named three cardinals as investigators, and then appointed Peckham instead. The bishop's second failure to obtain the archbishopric was probably a consequence of his lifestyle, which included keeping a mistress. Edward made one final attempt to promote his friend to a wealthier see in early 1280, when Burnell was nominated to become <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, but Pope Nicholas III quashed the election on 28 June 1280.

Burnell was the chief and most influential of Edward I's advisers during the first half of his reign. As part of his duties Burnell spent most of his time in attendance on the king. He heard many requests and petitions from those who desired patronage or other advancements, and was diligent and active in dealing with routine business. Burnell played a leading role in the legislation introduced by King Edward. The king's major legislative acts mainly date to Burnell's tenure of the office of chancellor, from 21 September 1274 until Burnell's death in 1292. Burnell was instrumental in the enforcement of royal writs and enactments, including the Statutes of Westminster, enacted in <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201275">1275</a>, <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201285">1285</a>, and <a href="Quia%20Emptores">1290</a>. Those of 1275 attempted to deal with the usurpation of royal rights. Keeping the peace in the realm and the extension of royal jurisdiction to cover rape was dealt with in the statutes from 1285, along with a number of other issues. The last statute, from 1290, regulated land law, the result of pressure from the magnates, the leading laymen of England.

During Burnell's time in office Edward and his royal officials made great efforts to reassert royal rights that were felt to have been usurped by the king's subjects. These efforts were made under writs of "Quo warranto", which asked the recipient what royal grant or warrant gives the recipient the authority to exercise a right or a power. They were first issued in 1278, after earlier attempts to recover royal rights through parliament unintentionally resulted in too much work for that body. Through these writs, attempts were made to enforce the rule that the only correct way to receive a privilege or grant of land was through a written charter, which might have deprived most of the magnates of England of their lands and rights. Most lands at that time were held not by documentary grants, but by the force of custom. By the 1290s the government was forced to back down and permit rights as they had been allowed from "time out of mind".

The distinction between the king's personal household department of the <a href="Wardrobe%20%28government%29">Wardrobe</a> and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a>, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the <a href="Privy%20Seal">Privy Seal</a>, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue a letter from the Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.

Edward had such trust in his chancellor and the chancellor's clerks that Burnell and the clerks were allowed to dispense with the <a href="hanaper">hanaper</a> system, which required fees for sealing charters to be paid into the hanaper department of the Chancery for disbursal. Robert and his clerks were permitted to enjoy the profits from the fees of their office. Burnell was also responsible for the decision to force the <a href="Court%20of%20Chancery">Court of Chancery</a> to settle in London, rather than following the king and his court around the country. A Chancery memorandum of 1280 records that the chancellor, along with the other ministers, now had the duty of sorting the many petitions that came into the government and only passing on the most urgent to the king.

As bishop, Burnell had a wall built around the cathedral at Wells, which helped to improve the security of the cathedral and its outlying buildings. He left the court each year at <a href="Lent">Lent</a>, when he returned to his diocese and attended to its affairs. Peckham appointed Burnell to be his deputy when the archbishop went to Wales in 1282. It was probably Burnell who suggested a compromise in 1285 over the jurisdictions of the royal and ecclesiastical courts, which allowed royal officials to return cases involving only religious matters to the church courts.

Burnell was active in the king's foreign policy, especially towards France, Scotland and Wales, and undertook a number of diplomatic missions to those countries. Burnell served as the royal spokesman on several of these occasions, one of them being at Paris in 1286 when he made a speech detailing the history of English–French relations since the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281259%29">Treaty of Paris of 1259</a>. The speech was a prelude to discussions, successfully concluded, involving the <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">homage</a> that Edward owed to King <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">Philip IV of France</a>, for Edward's land in France. Burnell was employed in Gascony during the late 1280s, helping to administer that duchy and to reorganise its government. He showed himself sensitive to the Gascon desire for independence and did not attempt to impose the same systems of government that were used in England. The historian <a href="Michael%20Prestwich">Michael Prestwich</a> therefore argues that the first half of Edward's reign was the period when Gascony enjoyed its most successful government under the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">Plantagenet</a>s. Later, in June 1291, Burnell gave two speeches at the great council of English and <a href="Peerage%20of%20Scotland">Scottish nobles</a> in <a href="Norham">Norham</a> to decide the succession to the Scottish crown. Edward had been asked to mediate an end to the crisis over the succession, or the <a href="Competitors%20for%20the%20Crown%20of%20Scotland">Great Cause</a> as it was known in England.

In Welsh affairs, Burnell attended a number of councils dealing with <a href="Llywelyn%20ap%20Gruffudd">Llywelyn ap Gruffudd</a>, Prince of Wales, and in 1277 he escorted Llywelyn to Westminster, where Llywelyn pledged homage to Edward. Burnell was present during Edward's <a href="Wales%20in%20the%20Late%20Middle%20Ages">conquest of Wales</a> in the 1280s; he witnessed documents in Rhuddlan in 1282, and subsequently at Conwy and Caernarfon.

Sometime before 1290 Burnell vowed to go on crusade to help reinforce the crusader city of <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a>, which was threatened by Muslims in the late 1280s, but he never fulfilled his obligation.

Burnell died in <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick</a>, on 25 October 1292. His body, without his heart, is interred in the nave of <a href="Wells%20Cathedral">Wells Cathedral</a>; his heart was buried at <a href="Bath%20Abbey">Bath Abbey</a>. Although he was usually busy with royal business, Burnell managed to expand his bishopric and provide for his relatives. He amassed great wealth, and acquired numerous estates in <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> and elsewhere. At his death, he owned 82 manors over 19 <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">counties</a>, most of them his personal property rather than that of the diocese of Bath and Wells.

Even after he became a bishop Burnell kept a mistress, Juliana. Rumours circulated that she bore him four sons, and that he had a number of daughters, all of which Burnell denied. He kept a magnificent household, sufficient for him to be able to host a <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">parliament</a> at his home in Acton Burnell in autumn 1283. He married off a number of young female relatives, rumoured to be his daughters, to noblemen. Amabilla Burnell married a member of a royal justice's family, and a Joan Burnell was the subject of a guarantee to the bishop that the son of William of Greystoke would marry her. A William Burnell was <a href="Dean%20%28religion%29">dean</a> of Wells Cathedral, and was named as one of the bishop's executors. Robert Burnell's eventual heir was his nephew, Philip.

Burnell built extensively at <a href="Acton%20Burnell%20Castle">Acton Burnell Castle</a>, and large parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters at the back of a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a <a href="latrine">latrine</a>. The house was not quite a castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the <a href="Bishop%27s%20Palace%2C%20Wells">Bishop's Palace in Wells</a>.

Burnell was a dominant figure during the first part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward's return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues that he may have been the most important royal administrator of the 13th century.

The New Zealand national rugby union team, called the All Blacks, represents <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in men's <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a>, which is known as the country's <a href="national%20sport">national sport</a>. The team has won the last two <a href="Rugby%20World%20Cup">Rugby World Cup</a>s, in <a href="2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2011</a> and <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2015</a> as well as the inaugural tournament in <a href="1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1987</a>.

They have a 77% winning record in <a href="test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">test match</a> rugby, and are the only international men’s side with a winning record against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have lost to only six of the 19 nations they have played in test matches. Since the introduction of the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Rankings">World Rugby Rankings</a> in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. The All Blacks jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier one ranked nation, along with <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>.

New Zealand competes with <a href="Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Argentina</a>, <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">South Africa</a> in <a href="The%20Rugby%20Championship">The Rugby Championship</a>. The All Blacks have won the trophy sixteen times in the competition's twenty-three-year history. New Zealand have completed a <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28rugby%20union%29%23Grand%20Slam%20tours">Grand Slam tour</a> four times1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010. The All Blacks have been named the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Team%20of%20the%20Year">World Rugby Team of the Year</a> ten times since the award was created in 2001, and an All Black has won the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">World Rugby Player of the Year</a> award ten times over the same period. Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the <a href="International%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Rugby Hall of Fame</a>.

The team's first match was in 1884, and their first international <a href="test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">test match</a> was in 1903 against Australia in Sydney. The following year, they hosted their first ever home test, a match against a British Isles side in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>. This was followed by a 34-game (including 5 tests) <a href="The%20Original%20All%20Blacks">tour of Europe and North America</a> in 1905, where the team suffered only one defeat their first ever test loss, against Wales.

New Zealand's early uniforms consisted of a black jersey with a silver fern and white <a href="Knickerbockers%20%28clothing%29">knickerbockers</a>. By the 1905 tour, they were wearing all black, except for the silver fern, and the name All Blacks dates from this time. The team perform a <a href="Haka%20%28sports%29">haka</a>, a <a href="M%C4%81ori%20culture">Māori</a> challenge or posture dance, before each match. The haka has traditionally been <a href="Te%20Rauparaha">Te Rauparaha</a>'s "<a href="Ka%20Mate">Ka Mate</a>", although since 2005 "<a href="Kapa%20o%20Pango">Kapa o Pango</a>" has also been performed.

Rugby unionalmost universally referred to only as "rugby" in New Zealandwas introduced to New Zealand by <a href="Charles%20John%20Monro">Charles Monro</a> in 1870; Monro discovered the sport while completing his studies at <a href="Christ%27s%20College%20%28Finchley%29">Christ's College, Finchley</a>, England. The first recorded game in New Zealand took place in May 1870 in Nelson between the Nelson club and Nelson College. The first provincial union, the <a href="Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Canterbury Rugby Football Union</a>, was formed in 1879, and in 1882 New Zealand's first internationals were played when <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">New South Wales</a> (NSW) toured the country. NSW did not face a New Zealand representative team but played seven provincial sidesthe tourists won four games and lost three. Two years later the first New Zealand team to travel overseas toured New South Wales; where New Zealand won all eight of their games.

A privately organised British team, which later became the <a href="British%20and%20Irish%20Lions">British and Irish Lions</a>, toured New Zealand in 1888. No <a href="test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">test matches</a> were played, and the side only played provincial sides. The British players were drawn mainly from Northern England, but there were representatives from Wales and Scotland.

In 1892, following the canvassing of provincial administrators by <a href="Ernest%20Hoben">Ernest Hoben</a>, the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20Union">New Zealand Rugby Football Union</a> (NZRFU) was formed by the majority of New Zealand's provincial unions, but did not include Canterbury, <a href="Otago%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Otago</a> or <a href="Southland%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Southland</a>. The first officially sanctioned New Zealand side <a href="1893%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia">toured</a> New South Wales in 1893, where the <a href="Thomas%20Ellison">Thomas Ellison</a> captained team won nine of their ten matches. The following year New Zealand played its first home "international" game, losing 8–6 to New South Wales. The team's first true test match occurred against <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> on 15 August 1903 at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> in front of over 30,000 spectators, and resulted in a 22–3 victory.
A representative New Zealand team first toured the British Isles in 1905. The side is now known as the "<a href="The%20Original%20All%20Blacks">Originals</a>", as the "All Blacks" name emerged during this tour when, according to team member <a href="Billy%20Wallace">Billy Wallace</a>, a London newspaper reported that the New Zealanders played as if they were "all backs". Wallace claimed that because of a typographical error, subsequent references were to "All Blacks". This account is most likely a mythbecause of their black playing strip, the side was probably referred to as the "Blacks" before they left New Zealand. Even though the name All Blacks most likely existed before the trip, the tour did popularise it.

The Originals played 35 matches on tour, and their only loss was a 3–0 defeat to Wales in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. The match has entered into the folklore of both countries because of a controversy over whether All Black <a href="Bob%20Deans">Bob Deans</a> scored a try which would have earned his team a 3–3 draw. In contrast to the success of the Originals on the field, the team did antagonise some in the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a>' rugby establishment; both administrators and the press complained that the All Blacks did not play the game within the amateur and gentlemanly spirit promoted by the <a href="World%20Rugby">International Rugby Football Board</a>. This complaint continued to dog New Zealand teams until the 1930s.

The success of the Originals had uncomfortable consequences for the amateur NZRFU. In 1907, a party of professional players was assembled to tour the British Isles and play <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a>a professional offshoot of rugby union that was played by clubs that split from England's <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> (RFU) due to disagreements over financial compensation for players. When the "<a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20Great%20Britain">All Golds</a>", as the team came to be known, returned they established <a href="rugby%20league%20in%20New%20Zealand">rugby league in New Zealand</a>, and a large number of players switched to the professional code. English and Welsh authorities were alarmed by the threat of professionalism to rugby in New Zealand, and in 1908 an Anglo-Welsh side undertook a tour to New Zealand to help promote the amateur values under which they believed sport should be played. The tourists were defeated 2–0 in the three-test series by New Zealand, but the Anglo-Welsh did manage to draw the second test 3–3.

International rugby was suspended during the First World War, but a <a href="New%20Zealand%20Army%20rugby%20team%20of%201919">New Zealand Services</a> team did compete in inter-services competition known as the King's Cup. After their departure from Europe the side toured South Africa before their return to New Zealand, and that tour paved the way for a <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">South African</a> team to tour New Zealand in 1921. The Springboksas the South African team is knownplayed New Zealand in a test series that ended <a href="Tie%20%28draw%29">all square</a>. New Zealand conducted a return tour to South Africa in 1928, and the test series was again drawn; both teams winning two tests each.
The 1924 All Black tourists to the British Isles and France were dubbed "<a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Britain%2C%20Ireland%20and%20France">the Invincibles</a>" because they won every game. However, the team was deprived of a potential <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28rugby%20union%29">grand slam</a> when Scotland refused to play them because they were upset the tour was organised through the RFU rather than the IRFB. The first British Isles side since 1908 toured New Zealand in 1930. Although the Lions won the first test, the home side regrouped and went on to win the series 3–1. New Zealand toured the British Isles again in 1935–36, losing only three gamesincluding two testsduring a 30-match tour. In one of these losses, <a href="Alexander%20Obolensky">Prince Obolensky</a> famously scored two tries to help England to a 13–0 win; their first over New Zealand.

In 1937, South Africa toured New Zealand and decisively won the test series despite losing the first test; this <a href="1937%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour%20to%20Australasia">1937 South African</a> team was described as the best team ever to leave New Zealand. It was not until 1949 that New Zealand next played the Springboks when they <a href="1949%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20South%20Africa">toured South Africa</a> with <a href="Fred%20Allen%20%28rugby%20union%29">Fred Allen</a> as captain. Although each test against South Africa was very close, New Zealand lost the series 4–0.
At the same time as an All Black team was touring South Africa, Australia were touring New Zealand. The two tours coincided because <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> players were not able to go to South Africa at the time, meaning the Australians, played against a New Zealand team made up of the best Māori and the reserve non-Māori players, while the South Africans encountered the best <a href="p%C4%81keh%C4%81">pākehā</a> (non-Māori) players. On the afternoon of 3 September New Zealand, captained by <a href="Johnny%20Smith%20%28rugby%20union%29">Johnny Smith</a>, were beaten 11–6 by Australia in Wellington. New Zealand then lost their second test 16–9, which gave Australia a <a href="Bledisloe%20Cup">Bledisloe Cup</a> series win in New Zealand for the first time. 1949 was an "<a href="annus%20horribilis">annus horribilis</a>" for the All Blacks as they lost all six of their test matches, and the experience of playing two test series simultaneously has not been repeated.

The two consecutive series losses to South Africa made their <a href="1956%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20New%20Zealand">1956 tour of New Zealand</a> highly anticipated. New Zealand were captained by Bob Duff and coached by <a href="Bob%20Stuart">Bob Stuart</a>, and their 3–1 series win was their first over the Springboks and the Springboks' first series loss that century. During the series, New Zealand introduced <a href="Don%20Clarke">Don Clarke</a>, and brought prop <a href="Kevin%20Skinner%20%28rugby%20union%29">Kevin Skinner</a> out of retirement to help secure the win. Skinner, a former New Zealand boxing champion, had retired from international rugby, but was convinced to return for the third and fourth tests. One reason for Skinner's selection was to "sort out" the South African props, while Clarke become known as "The Boot" for his goal kicking.

New Zealand's 3–1 series win over the Lions in 1959 proved to be the start of a dominant period in All Black rugby. This was followed by the 1963–64 tour to Britain and Ireland, led by <a href="Wilson%20Whineray">Wilson Whineray</a>, in which New Zealand were deprived of a Grand Slam by a scoreless draw with Scotland. The only loss on this tour was to <a href="Newport%20RFC">Newport RFC</a>, who won 3–0 at <a href="Rodney%20Parade">Rodney Parade</a>, <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport</a> on 30 October 1963. The <a href="1967%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Britain%2C%20France%20and%20Canada">1967 side</a> won three tests against the home nations, but was unable to play <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a> because of a <a href="Foot-and-mouth%20disease">foot-and-mouth</a> scare. This tour formed part of New Zealand's longest winning streak, between 1965 and 1970, of 17 test victories. This was also the longest test winning streak by any nation at the time; it would be equalled by the Springboks in 1998, and surpassed by <a href="Lithuania%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Lithuania</a> in 2010. Although the 1966 Lions were defeated 0–4 in their New Zealand tour, there was a reversal of fortune five years later when the <a href="1971%20British%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">1971 Lions</a>, under the captaincy of Welshman <a href="John%20Dawes">John Dawes</a>, beat New Zealand in a test series, which remains the Lions' only series victory in New Zealand.

The 1972–3 tourists narrowly missed a Grand Slam with a draw against Ireland. The tour was notable for the sending home of prop Keith Murdoch, who was alleged to have been involved in a brawl in a <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> hotel while celebrating the defeat of Wales. It was on this tour New Zealand lost 9-3 in an epic battle against Llanelli RFC littered with Welsh and British Lions caps

In 1978, <a href="Graham%20Mourie">Graham Mourie</a> captained New Zealand to their first Grand Slam, including a 13–12 victory over Wales. That game generated controversy after New Zealand won as the result of a late penalty. Lock <a href="Andy%20Haden">Andy Haden</a> had dived out of a <a href="line-out%20%28rugby%20union%29">line-out</a> in an attempt to earn a penalty, but referee Roger Quittenden insisted the penalty was against Welsh lock <a href="Geoff%20Wheel">Geoff Wheel</a> for jumping off the shoulder of <a href="Frank%20Oliver%20%28rugby%20union%29">Frank Oliver</a>. New Zealand's only loss on the tour was the famous 12–0 defeat by Irish province <a href="Munster%20Rugby">Munster</a> at <a href="Thomond%20Park">Thomond Park</a>. Later a play which focused on the loss was written by <a href="John%20Breen%20%28playwright%29">John Breen</a>, called "<a href="Alone%20it%20Stands">Alone it Stands</a>".

For the <a href="1960%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia%20and%20South%20Africa">1960 All Blacks tour of South Africa</a>, the South African authorities insisted that Maori players be excluded from the team. The subsequent controversy led to the New Zealand Rugby Union refusing any other tour for the following 10 years until the <a href="1970%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20South%20Africa">1970 tour</a>, when <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Maori</a> players were accepted as "<a href="honorary%20whites">honorary whites</a>". (See <a href="Halt%20All%20Racist%20Tours">Halt All Racist Tours</a>.)

The <a href="1976%20New%20Zealand%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20South%20Africa">1976 All Blacks tour</a> of apartheid South Africa generated much controversy and led to the boycott of the <a href="1976%20Summer%20Olympics">1976 Summer Olympics</a> in Montreal by 33 African nations after the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">IOC</a> refused to ban the team. New Zealand again failed to win the test series in South Africa: they did not do so until 1996, after the fall of <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> and the introduction of neutral referees. The 1976 tour contributed to the <a href="Gleneagles%20Agreement">Gleneagles Agreement</a> being adopted by the Commonwealth Heads of State in 1977.

The <a href="1981%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20New%20Zealand">1981 South African tour</a> to New Zealand sparked protests against South Africa's apartheid policy, the likes of which had not been seen in New Zealand since the <a href="1951%20New%20Zealand%20waterfront%20dispute">1951 waterfront dispute</a>. The NZRU had invited the Springboks to tour as the <a href="Robert%20Muldoon">Muldoon</a> government refused to involve politics in sport. Although New Zealand won the test series, two of the tour's provincial games were cancelled and the whole tour was marred by violence and protest. The third and final test match of the tour is sometimes known as the Flour Bomb test, as an anti-apartheid activist in a Cessna light aircraft dropped leaflets, flares, a parachute-supported banner reading "<a href="Steve%20Biko">Biko</a>" and flour bombs into Auckland's <a href="Eden%20Park">Eden Park</a> throughout the match, felling a New Zealand player. During the tour the country experienced unrest, and the tour had a significant impact on New Zealand society.

The 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa was cancelled after <a href="Finnigan%20v%20New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">legal action</a> on the grounds that it would breach the NZRU's constitution. In 1986, a rebel tour to South Africa took place that had not been authorised by the NZRU and the team, named the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Cavaliers">Cavaliers</a>, included many All Blacks. Those that participated in the tour received a ban for two tests from the NZRU when they returned to New Zealand. Allegations that players received payment for the tour were never proved.

New Zealand hosted and won the <a href="1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">inaugural World Cup</a> in 1987 beating <a href="France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">France</a> 29–9 in the <a href="1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Final">final</a>. New Zealand conceded only 52 points and scored 43 tries in six games en route to the title, beating <a href="Italy%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Italy</a>, <a href="Fiji%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Fiji</a>, <a href="Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Argentina</a>, Scotland, Wales and France.

By the <a href="1991%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1991 World Cup</a> New Zealand were an ageing side, co-coached by <a href="Alex%20Wyllie">Alex Wyllie</a> and <a href="John%20Hart%20%28rugby%20coach%29">John Hart</a>. After beating hosts England in the tournament opener, they struggled during pool matches against the <a href="United%20States%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">United States</a> and Italy, and won their quarter-final against <a href="Canada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Canada</a>. They were then knocked out by eventual winners Australia 16–6 in their semi-final at <a href="Lansdowne%20Road">Lansdowne Road</a>. In the wake of the tournament, there were many retirements, including coach Wyllie, who had enjoyed an 86% win rate during 29 tests in charge.

<a href="Laurie%20Mains">Laurie Mains</a> replaced Wyllie in 1992, and was given the job of preparing the side for the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1995 event</a> in South Africa. New Zealand were again one of the favourites to take the championship. Their status as favourites was enhanced when a young <a href="Jonah%20Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a> scored four tries against England in the 45–29 semi-final win. They managed to take hosts South Africa to extra time in the final, before losing 15-12 to <a href="Joel%20Stransky">Joel Stransky</a>'s <a href="drop%20goal">drop goal</a>.

The professional era in rugby union began in 1995, spurred by creation of the <a href="SANZAAR">SANZAR</a> group (a combination of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia) which was formed with the purpose of selling broadcast rights for two new competitions, the domestic <a href="Super%20Rugby">Super 12</a> competition and the Tri-Nations. The first Tri-Nations was contested in 1996, with New Zealand winning all four of their tests to take the trophy. After a 1996 Tri-Nations match hosted by South Africa, won 29–18 by New Zealand, preceded a separate three-match test series between the two sides. Under new coach <a href="John%20Hart%20%28rugby%20coach%29">John Hart</a> and the captaincy of <a href="Sean%20Fitzpatrick">Sean Fitzpatrick</a>, New Zealand won a test series in South Africa for the first time. Fitzpatrick rated the series win higher than the 1987 World Cup victory in which he had participated.

The next three seasons saw mixed results for New Zealand, who won all their Tri-Nations tests in 1997 before losing the title for the first time in 1998. In 1998 New Zealand lost all five tests in the Tri-Nations and Bledisloe Cup series (two to South Africa and three to Australia), the first time they had lost four tests in succession since 1949. The following year they suffered their worst test loss, 28–7 to Australia in Sydney. At the <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999 World Cup</a> later that year, the All Blacks dominated their pool, handing England a 30–16 defeat at <a href="Twickenham%20Stadium">Twickenham</a>. They advanced past Scotland 30–18 in the quarter-finals to play France at Twickenham. After New Zealand finished the first half 17–10 ahead, France then produced a famous half of rugby to which New Zealand had no answer, winning 43–31. Hart subsequently resigned as coach and was replaced by co-coaches <a href="Wayne%20Smith%20%28rugby%20player%29">Wayne Smith</a> and Tony Gilbert.

Under Smith and Gilbert, New Zealand came second in the 2000 and 2001 Tri-Nations, and in neither season did the side reclaim the Bledisloe Cupwhich had been lost in 1998. Both coaches were replaced by <a href="John%20Mitchell%20%28rugby%20union%29">John Mitchell</a> on 3 October 2001, and he went on to coach New Zealand to victory in both the 2002 and 2003 Tri-Nations, as well as regaining the Bledisloe Cup in 2003. The All Blacks entered the <a href="2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2003 World Cup</a> as one of the favourites and dominated their pool, running up wins against Italy, Canada and <a href="Tonga%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Tonga</a>, before winning one of the most competitive matches of the tournament against Wales. They defeated South Africa in their quarter-final, a team they had never beaten at the World Cup, 29–9, but lost to Australia 22–10 in the semi-final in Sydney.

<a href="Graham%20Henry">Graham Henry</a>'s tenure as coach began with a double victory over 2003 Rugby World Cup winners England in 2004. The two games had an aggregate score of 72–15, and England were kept try-less. Despite the winning start to Henry's tenure, the Tri-Nations was a mixed success with two wins and two losses. The competition was the closest ever, bonus points decided the outcome, and New Zealand finishing last. The 2004 season finished with three wins in Europe, including a record 45–6 victory over France under new captain and outside centre <a href="Tana%20Umaga">Tana Umaga</a>.

In 2005 New Zealand whitewashed the touring <a href="2005%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">British and Irish Lions</a> after Brian O' Driscoll (Irish), Lions' star, received a spear tackle from two New Zealanders in the first test during their three-match test series, won the Tri-Nations, and achieved a second Grand Slam over the Home Nations for the first time since 1978. They went on to sweep the major IRB (now World Rugby) <a href="World%20Rugby%20Awards">awards</a> in which they were named: Team of the Year, Henry was named Coach of the Year, and first five-eighth <a href="Dan%20Carter">Dan Carter</a> was Player of the Year. New Zealand were nominated for the <a href="Laureus%20World%20Sports%20Award%20for%20Team%20of%20the%20Year">Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year</a> in 2006 for their 2005 performance. The following year they again took the Tri-Nations Series after winning their first five matches, three against Australia and two against South Africa. They lost their final match of the series against South Africa. They completed their end of year tour unbeaten, with record away wins over France, England and Wales. New Zealand were named 2006 IRB Team of the Year and were nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for the second time, while flanker and newly appointed captain <a href="Richie%20McCaw">Richie McCaw</a> was named IRB Player of the Year for the first time. 

The 2007 season started off with two <a href="2007%20mid-year%20rugby%20test%20series">mid-year tests</a> against France. New Zealand won the tests 42–11 at Eden Park and 61–10 at Westpac Stadium. A third game, against Canada, resulted in a 64–13 win, although the game was more competitive than the scoreline indicated. New Zealand's first <a href="2007%20Tri%20Nations%20Series">Tri-Nations</a> game of 2007 was against the Springboks in Durban, South Africa. New Zealand scored two tries in the final ten minutes of the game to win 26–21. The following week against the Wallabies at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> the Wallabies upset New Zealand to win 20–15, New Zealand's first loss to Australia since 2004. The All Blacks won their following home games to successfully defend the Tri-Nations Series for 2007. New Zealand entered the <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2007 Rugby World Cup</a> as favourites, and topped their pool, beating Scotland, Italy, Romania and Portugal by at least 40 points. However, they then suffered a defeat by hosts France in the quarter-finals in Cardiff. Following the loss to France coach Graham Henry's job was reappointed amid vocal debate and comment, despite then <a href="Crusaders%20%28rugby%29">Crusaders</a> coach <a href="Robbie%20Deans">Robbie Deans</a> being a strong contender.

The 2008 season started with three <a href="2008%20mid-year%20rugby%20test%20series">mid-year tests</a>, the first against Ireland at <a href="Westpac%20Stadium">Westpac Stadium</a>, Wellington. The final two games were against England, the first at Eden Park and the second at AMI Stadium in Christchurch. New Zealand played their first <a href="2008%20Tri%20Nations%20Series">Tri-Nations</a> game against South Africa at Westpac Stadium in Wellington winning 19–8 but a week later at <a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a> in Dunedin they lost to South Africa 28–30, ending a 30-match winning streak at home, their previous loss in New Zealand being against England in 2003. New Zealand played their next Tri-Nations match on 26 July against Australia at <a href="Stadium%20Australia">Stadium Australia</a> in Sydney, losing 34–19 but a week later against Australia at Eden Park in New Zealand won 39–10. The greatest victory for New Zealand in the 2008 season was beating South Africa 19–0 in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> at <a href="Newlands%20Stadium">Newlands Stadium</a>. New Zealand played their final match on 13 September against Australia at <a href="Lang%20Park">Suncorp Stadium</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> winning 28–24 and retaining the Bledisloe Cup and the Tri-Nations.

The All Blacks opened the 2009 season with a 22–27 loss to France at Carisbrook, but defeated them 14–10 in Wellington a week later. On points difference, France won the Dave Gallaher Cup for the first time. A week later the All Blacks defeated Italy 27–6 in Christchurch. They finished second in the <a href="2009%20Tri%20Nations%20Series">Tri-Nations Series</a>, behind South Africa who lost only one game, and ended the series with a 33–6 win over Australia in Wellington.

In 2010 the All Blacks won the Tri-Nations series for the tenth time after three successive victories against South Africa, also retaining the Bledisloe Cup after consecutive victories against Australia. During 2010 New Zealand were undefeated for 15 test matches. Despite losing the 2011 Tri-Nations after a loss to Australia in Brisbane, but still entered the <a href="2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2011 Rugby World Cup</a> as one of the favourites. The All Blacks went through their pool matches undefeated, and after defeating Argentina, and then Australia, faced France in the final. New Zealand scored one try and a penalty to narrowly win 8–7. Henry stepped down as coach following the World Cup, and was replaced as head coach by his assistant <a href="Steve%20Hansen">Steve Hansen</a>.

The Tri-Nations was expanded to include Argentina in 2012, and subsequently renamed The Rugby Championship. The All Blacks went undefeated in the inaugural tournament, and went through the year unbeaten until their last match of the year, where they lost to England at Twickenham. In 2013 New Zealand hosted France in a three-match seriestheir first meeting since the 2011 World Cup final. They won all three tests, before going unbeaten in the <a href="2013%20Rugby%20Championship">2013 Rugby Championship</a>. In November 2013, New Zealand became the first rugby nation in the professional era to achieve a 100% record in a calendar year.

At the <a href="2014%20Rugby%20Championship">2014 Rugby Championship</a>, the All Blacks drew Australia and lost to South Africa in the away matches, but won the other four matches and the tournament. At the shortened <a href="2015%20Rugby%20Championship">2015 Rugby Championship</a>, the All Blacks lost to Australia and was runner-up. The team entered the <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2015 Rugby World Cup</a> and again went undefeated in their pool matches. They defeated France 62-13 in the Quarter-Final, South Africa 20-18 in the Semi-Final and Australia 34-17 in the <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup%20Final">Final</a> to become the first nation to retain their World Champion title and the first to win the <a href="Rugby%20World%20Cup">Rugby World Cup</a> three times.

The All Blacks went undefeated at the <a href="2016%20Rugby%20Championship">2016 Rugby Championship</a>, claiming bonus points at each match, under new captain and Number 8, Kieran Read and vice-captain and fullback Ben Smith. Smith and wing Israel Dagg were also the joint highest try scorers in the competition with 5 each, while first-five-eighth Beauden Barrett was the highest points scorer of the competition with 81 in total.

2016 did hold a historic loss with the All Blacks losing their first ever game to Ireland for the first time after 111 years of success, losing 40 - 29. However, in the test following New Zealand redeemed themselves by defeating Ireland for the 28th time, out of 30 tests, 21-9.

In 2017 <a href="British%20%26amp%3B%20Irish%20Lions">British & Irish Lions</a> toured New Zealand drawing with the All Blacks 1-1, the All Blacks had won the first test 30 - 15, while the British and Irish Lions won the second test 24 - 21, the final test was drawn 15-15. However they went on to go undefeated in the Rugby Championship 2017 season and also securing the Bledisloe Cup against rivals Australia after defeating the Aussies twice in the Rugby Championship.
In October, New Zealand suffered a massive upset losing to Australia 23-18 at <a href="Suncorp%20Stadium">Suncorp Stadium</a> in Brisbane. The All Blacks later played France, Scotland and Wales defeating all of them to end the 2017 season.

The current New Zealand jersey is form-fitting and entirely black (currently referred to as the 'blackest' jersey ever created) except the <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> logo, the NZRU silver fern on the front and the AIG logo in the lower center (all of which are darkened from previously). The 1884 New Zealand tour to Australia was the first overseas New Zealand rugby tour, and featured clothing very different from today's jersey. Back then, the team donned a dark blue jersey, with gold fern on the left of the jumper. In 1893 the NZRU stipulated at its annual general meeting that the uniform would be black jersey with a silver fern and white knickerbockers. However historic photographs suggest white shorts may have been used instead during these early years. Sometime between 1897 and 1901 there was a change; by 1901 the team met NSW in a black jersey, a canvas top with no collar, and a silver fern.

In 2006, New Zealand wore an embroidered <a href="remembrance%20poppy">remembrance poppy</a> on their jersey sleeve when playing France during the end-of-year tour. The poppy honours the ANZAC soldiers who died on the beaches of <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>. Captain Richie McCaw said "We want to honour the overseas service of New Zealanders. It is an important part of our history as a country and a team."

During the 2011 Rugby World Cup the All Blacks had an embroidered William Webb Ellis cup on the sleeve of their jerseys with the year '1987' underneath. This was to signify which year the team had won the tournament. Each of the four teams who had won the competition had the same detailing on their jerseys.

Adidas is paying the NZRFU $200 million over nine years, expecting New Zealand to win around 75% of their matches. <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> also looked at sponsoring New Zealand in 1996, but went with <a href="Tiger%20Woods">Tiger Woods</a> instead.

The change kit has traditionally been white with black shorts. After a few years playing with a change kit of grey shirt and black shorts, the NZRU announced a return to the traditional white jersey and black shorts in May 2009. For the 30 July 2011 Springboks match in Wellington, the All Black jersey introduced a white collar in homage to that sported by the 1987 World Cup-winning team.

In 2012, the NZRU took the controversial step of allowing American insurance and financial services company, <a href="AIG">AIG</a>, to promote themselves on the centre-front of the All Black jersey. In return, the NZRU would receive direct financial sponsorship that was not revealed; the deal was estimated to be worth approximately $80 million over five years.

Adidas have been the All Blacks' kit suppliers since 1999, taking over from <a href="Canterbury%20of%20New%20Zealand">Canterbury</a>, who supplied the kits since 1924. In June 2017, after releasing a special edition jersey for the impending three tests against the British and Irish Lions, it was announced that the partnership between the All Blacks and Adidas had been extended to at least 2023.

The All Blacks perform a <a href="haka">haka</a> (<a href="M%C4%81ori%20culture">Māori</a> challenge) before each international match. The haka has been closely associated with New Zealand rugby ever since a tour of Australia and the United Kingdom by the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team">1888–89 New Zealand Native football team</a>, though the New Zealand team that toured New South Wales in 1884 may also have performed a haka. The New Zealand native team that toured Britain in 1888 and 1889 used "Ake Ake Kia Kaha", and the 1903 team in Australia used a mocking haka, "Tupoto koe, Kangaru!". The 1905 All Blacks began the tradition of using "<a href="Ka%20Mate">Ka Mate</a>"a haka composed in the 19th century by <a href="Ng%C4%81ti%20Toa">Ngāti Toa</a> leader <a href="Te%20Rauparaha">Te Rauparaha</a>. The 1924 All Blacks used a specially composed haka "Ko Niu Tireni", but later All Blacks reverted to "Ka Mate".

In August 2005, before the Tri-Nations test match between New Zealand and South Africa at <a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a> stadium in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>, New Zealand performed a new haka, "<a href="Kapa%20o%20Pango">Kapa o Pango</a>", specially composed by Derek Lardelli and intended to reflect the <a href="Polynesian%20culture">Polynesian</a>-influenced multicultural make-up of contemporary New Zealand. "Kapa o Pango" was to be performed on special occasions and was not intended to replace "Ka Mate". "Kapa o Pango" concludes with what has been interpreted as a "throat slitting" gesture that led to accusations that "Kapa o Pango" encourages violence, and sends the wrong message to All Blacks fans. However, according to Lardelli, the gesture represents "drawing vital energy into the heart and lungs".

In November 2006, at the <a href="Millennium%20Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a>, Cardiff, New Zealand performed the haka in the dressing room prior to the matchinstead of on the field immediately before kick-offafter a disagreement with the <a href="Welsh%20Rugby%20Union">Welsh Rugby Union</a>, which had wanted Wales to sing <a href="Hen%20Wlad%20Fy%20Nhadau">their national anthem</a> after the haka. In 2008, New Zealand played <a href="Munster%20Rugby">Munster</a> at Thomond Park. Before the match, Munster's four New Zealanders challenged their opponents by performing a haka before the All Blacks started theirs. On the same tour, Wales responded by silently refusing to move after New Zealand's haka, and the two teams simply stared at each other until the referee forced them to start the game.

New Zealand have only ever been beaten by six test nations, and they are the only international team to have a winning record against every nation they have played. They have won 448 of their 578 test matches – 77.51% (see table), and have lost at home only 39 times. Since <a href="World%20Rugby%20Rankings">World Rankings</a> were introduced by World Rugby in October 2003, New Zealand have occupied the number one ranking the majority of the time. In the decade from 2000 to 2009, New Zealand won 100 tests (82% winning percentage).

New Zealand's <a href="Winning%20streak%20%28sports%29%23Rugby%20union">longest winning streak</a> is 18 test victories (a Tier 1 joint world record), achieved between 2015 and 2016. In 2013 they won every test they played during a calendar year. The All Blacks hold the record for most consecutive test wins at home – a 47-match winning streak, achieved between 2009 and 2017. Their longest unbeaten streak is 23 tests (from 1987 to 1990) with one game being drawn.

Their all-time points record for tests stands at 15,899 points for and 7,690 against (updated 10 November 2018). Many national teams' heaviest defeats have occurred against New Zealandthe national teams of Argentina, Fiji, France, Ireland, Japan, Portugal, Samoa, South Africa and Tonga have all suffered their greatest defeats at the hands of New Zealand. The All Blacks' largest test win was 145–17 against Japan in 1995, while their heaviest loss was a 28–7 loss to Australia in 1999.

Below is summary of New Zealand test results, updated 10 November 2018:

New Zealand have won the World Cup three times, the only team to have done so. They beat France in the final of the 1987 inaugural competition held in New Zealand and Australia, defeated France again in the final of the 2011 tournament, also hosted in New Zealand, and most recently defeated Australia in England in 2015, making them the first and only team to win the World Cup in consecutive tournaments. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they reached the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa. They finished in fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003, New Zealand were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. The 2007 World Cup saw their worst tournament, being knocked out in the quarterfinals by the host nation France; until this they were the only team to have reached the semifinals of every tournament. As a result of the poor performance in the 2007 World Cup the NZRU commissioned a 47-page report to detail the causes of the failure. The All Blacks have never lost a World Cup pool match, and have finished top of their pool in all seven tournaments.

New Zealand holds several World Cup records: most World Cup Matches (48), most points in one match (145 versus <a href="Japan%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Japan</a> in 1995), most cumulative points over all World Cups (2,301), most tries overall (306), most conversions (222) and also the record for the most points scored in the first half of a knockout game at the Rugby World Cup (29, against France 2015) along with the largest knockout margin (49) in the same match. Several individual players also hold World Cup records; <a href="Jonah%20Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a> for most World Cup tries (15 over two World Cups)(Currently tied with South Africa's <a href="Bryan%20Habana">Bryan Habana</a>), <a href="Marc%20Ellis%20%28rugby%29">Marc Ellis</a> with most tries in a match (6 versus Japan in 1995), <a href="Grant%20Fox">Grant Fox</a> with most points in one tournament (126 in 1987), and <a href="Simon%20Culhane">Simon Culhane</a> with most points in a single game (45 versus Japan in 1995).

New Zealand's only annual tournament is a competition involving the Southern Hemisphere's top national teams. From 1996 through 2011, they competed in the <a href="Tri%20Nations%20%28rugby%20union%29">Tri Nations</a> against Australia and South Africa. In 2012, Argentina joined the competition, which was renamed <a href="The%20Rugby%20Championship">The Rugby Championship</a>. New Zealand's record of 15 tournament wins (the most recent in 2018) and 80 match wins is well ahead of the other teams' records. The <a href="Bledisloe%20Cup">Bledisloe Cup</a> is contested between New Zealand and Australia, and the <a href="Freedom%20Cup">Freedom Cup</a> between New Zealand and South Africa, as part of the Tri Nations and The Rugby Championship.

On 15 October 2018, Hansen named a 32-man squad ahead of the <a href="2018%20end-of-year%20rugby%20union%20internationals">2018 All Blacks Northern Tour</a>.

In addition to the 32 man squad, <a href="Asafo%20Aumua">Asafo Aumua</a>, <a href="George%20Bridge">George Bridge</a>, <a href="Brett%20Cameron">Brett Cameron</a>, <a href="Liam%20Coltman">Liam Coltman</a>, <a href="Mitchell%20Drummond">Mitchell Drummond</a>, <a href="Gareth%20Evans%20%28New%20Zealand%20rugby%20player%29">Gareth Evans</a>, <a href="Bryn%20Hall%20%28rugby%20union%29">Bryn Hall</a>, <a href="David%20Havili">David Havili</a>, <a href="Jackson%20Hemopo">Jackson Hemopo</a>, <a href="Dillon%20Hunt">Dillon Hunt</a>, <a href="Ngani%20Laumape">Ngani Laumape</a>, <a href="Tyrel%20Lomax">Tyrel Lomax</a>, <a href="Nehe%20Milner-Skudder">Nehe Milner-Skudder</a>, <a href="Reuben%20O%27Neill">Reuben O'Neill</a>, <a href="Tim%20Perry%20%28rugby%20union%29">Tim Perry</a>, <a href="Matt%20Proctor">Matt Proctor</a>, <a href="Luke%20Romano">Luke Romano</a>, <a href="Angus%20Ta%27avao">Angus Ta'avao</a> and <a href="Luke%20Whitelock">Luke Whitelock</a> were named in a wider squad for the test against <a href="Japan%20national%20rugby%20team">Japan</a>. Laumape returned to New Zealand following the test against Japan but was called to rejoin the main squad after the test against England following an injury to Sonny Bill Williams.

On 18 November, <a href="Matt%20Todd">Matt Todd</a>, <a href="Sam%20Whitelock">Sam Whitelock</a>, <a href="Joe%20Moody">Joe Moody</a>, <a href="Liam%20Squire">Liam Squire</a> and <a href="Sonny%20Bill%20Williams">Sonny Bill Williams</a> returned to New Zealand early, due to injury or other commitments.

All squad members apart from <a href="Matt%20Todd">Matt Todd</a> play rugby in New Zealand.

Fifteen former All Blacks have been inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a>: <a href="Fred%20Allen%20%28rugby%20union%29">Sir Fred Allen</a>, <a href="Don%20Clarke">Don Clarke</a>, <a href="Sean%20Fitzpatrick">Sean Fitzpatrick</a>, <a href="Grant%20Fox">Grant Fox</a>, <a href="Dave%20Gallaher">Dave Gallaher</a>, <a href="Michael%20Jones%20%28rugby%20union%29">Sir Michael Jones</a>, <a href="Ian%20Kirkpatrick">Ian Kirkpatrick</a>, <a href="John%20Kirwan%20%28rugby%29">Sir John Kirwan</a>, <a href="Brian%20Lochore">Sir Brian Lochore</a>, <a href="Jonah%20Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a>, <a href="Colin%20Meads">Sir Colin Meads</a>, <a href="Graham%20Mourie">Graham Mourie</a>, <a href="George%20Nepia">George Nepia</a>, <a href="Joe%20Warbrick">Joe Warbrick</a> and <a href="Wilson%20Whineray">Sir Wilson Whineray</a>.

Joe Warbrick represented New Zealand on their historic 1884 tour to Australia, but is better known for selecting and captaining the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team">1888–89 New Zealand Native football team</a> that embarked on a 107-match tour of New Zealand, Australia and the British Isles. The New Zealand Natives were the first New Zealand team to wear black uniforms, and the first to perform a haka.

Dave Gallaher played in New Zealand's first ever test match in 1903 and also captained the 1905 Originals. Along with <a href="Billy%20Stead">Billy Stead</a>, Gallaher authored the famous rugby book "The Complete Rugby Footballer". At the age of only 19, George Nepia played in all 30 matches on the Invincibles tour of 1924–25. Nepia played 37 All Blacks games; his last was against the British Isles in 1930.

Sir Fred Allen captained all of his 21 matches for New Zealand, including six tests, between 1946 and 1949. He eventually moved on to coaching New Zealand between 1966 and 1968. New Zealand won all 14 of their test matches with Allen as coach.

Five hall of Fame inductees, including the first New Zealander named to the World Rugby Hall of Fame, played during the 1960s. Don Clarke was an All Black between 1956 and 1964 and during this period he broke the record at the time for All Black test points. Clarke famously scored six penalties in one match – a record at the time – to give New Zealand an 18–17 victory over the British Isles at Dunedin in 1959. Sir Wilson Whineray played 32 tests, captaining New Zealand in 30 of them. He played prop and also <a href="Number%20eight%20%28rugby%20union%29">number 8</a> between 1957 and 1965. New Zealand lost only four of their 30 tests with Whineray as captain. On 21 October 2007, Whineray became the first New Zealander to earn induction to the World Rugby Hall of Fame. In Sir Colin Meads' New Zealand Rugby Museum profile, he is described as "New Zealand's equivalent of Australia's Sir <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> or the United States of America's <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>." Meads, nicknamed "Pinetree", played 133 games for New Zealand, including 55 tests. In 1999 the New Zealand Rugby Monthly magazine named Meads the New Zealand player of the century. Ian Kirkpatrick played 39 tests, including 9 as captain, between 1967 and 1977. He scored 16 tries in his test career, a record at the time.

The only All Blacks Hall of Famer to debut in the 1970s was flanker Graham Mourie. He captained 19 of his 21 tests and 57 of his 61 overall All Blacks matches between 1976 and 1982. Most notably, in 1978 he was captain of the first All Blacks side to complete a <a href="Grand%20Slam%20tours">Grand Slam</a> over the four <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> sides.

The 1987 World Cup champions were coached by Sir Brian Lochore who had represented New Zealand in 25 tests between 1964 and 1971, including 17 as captain. He was <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">knighted</a> in 1999 for his lifetime services to rugby. Four of the 1987 World Cup squad that he had coached are also inductees in the Hall of Fame. Sir John Kirwan played a total of 63 tests between 1984 and 1994, scoring 35 tries, an All Blacks record at the time. In the 1987 World Cup opener against Italy, Kirwan raced 90 meters to score one of the tries of the tournament. An All Black from 1984 to 1993, Grant Fox was one of New Zealand's greatest point-scorers with 1067 points, including 645 test points. Fox played 46 tests, including the 1987 World Cup final against France. Known as The Iceman, Michael Jones was one of the greatest open side flankers of all time. Born in Auckland, New Zealand, Jones first played international rugby for <a href="Samoa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Samoa</a>, then for New Zealand, playing 55 tests between 1987 and 1998. Due to his Christian faith, Jones never played rugby on Sundays, resulting in him not playing in the 1991 World Cup semi-final against Australia, and also in him not being picked for the 1995 World Cup squad. The team's captain, David Kirk, was inducted into the World Rugby Hall alongside Lochore; all other World Cup-winning captains through 2007 (minus the already-inducted <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australian</a> <a href="John%20Eales">John Eales</a>) were also enshrined at this ceremony.

For many years the most capped test All Black was Sean Fitzpatrick, with 92 appearances. He played in the 1987 World Cup after incumbent Andy Dalton was injured, and was appointed All Blacks captain in 1992, continuing in the role until his retirement in 1997. He played 346 first class rugby matches.

<a href="Jonah%20Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a> is generally regarded as the first true global superstar of rugby union. He was the youngest player ever to appear in a test as an All Black, making his debut at age 19 years, 45 days in 1994. Lomu, a <a href="Wing%20%28rugby%20union%29">wing</a>, had unique physical gifts; even though he stood 1.96 m (6 ft 5 in) and weighed 119 kg (262 lb), making him both the tallest and heaviest back ever to play for New Zealand, he could run 100 metres in under 11 seconds. He burst on the international scene in the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1995 Rugby World Cup</a>, scoring seven tries in the competition. Four of those tries came in New Zealand' semifinal win over England, including an iconic try in which he bulldozed England's <a href="Mike%20Catt">Mike Catt</a> on his way to the try line. He added eight more tries in the <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999 Rugby World Cup</a>. Perhaps most remarkably, Lomu played virtually his entire top-level career in the shadow of <a href="nephrotic%20syndrome">a serious kidney disorder</a> which ended his test career in 2002 and ultimately led to a <a href="kidney%20transplantation">transplant</a> in 2004. Even with his career hampered and eventually shortened by his health issues, he scored 37 tries in 63 tests. Lomu was inducted into the World Rugby Hall in October 2011, and was specifically recognised as one of four new inductees "who had left an indelible mark on Rugby World Cup for their moments of magic, inspiration or feats".

The record for most test points for not only New Zealand, but any nation, is held by <a href="Dan%20Carter">Dan Carter</a> with 1,598 from 112 tests. He surpassed <a href="Andrew%20Mehrtens">Andrew Mehrtens</a>' All Black record total of 967 points from 70 tests in the All Blacks' win over England on 21 November 2009. On 27 November 2010 Dan Carter scored a penalty against Wales to pass Jonny Wilkinson's previous world record of 1,178 points. Carter also holds the record for points against Australia with 366.

The All Blacks' record test try scorer is <a href="Doug%20Howlett">Doug Howlett</a> with 49 tries, who overtook <a href="Christian%20Cullen">Christian Cullen</a>'s 46 during the 2007 World Cup. The world record for tries in a calendar year is held by <a href="Joe%20Rokocoko">Joe Rokocoko</a>, with 17 tries in 2003; he also became the first All Black to score ten tries in his first five tests, as well as the first All Black to score at least two tries in each of four consecutive tests. In test matches, the most capped All Black is <a href="Richie%20McCaw">Richie McCaw</a> with 148 caps. The record for most tests as captain is held by <a href="Richie%20McCaw">Richie McCaw</a> with 110. The youngest All Black in a test match was <a href="Jonah%20Lomu">Jonah Lomu</a>, capped at age 19 years, 45 days, whilst the oldest test player was <a href="Ned%20Hughes">Ned Hughes</a> at 40 years, 123 days.

The current head coach of the All Blacks is Steve Hansen, who has held the position since 2012. He is assisted by <a href="Ian%20Foster%20%28rugby%20union%29">Ian Foster</a> and was until recently also assisted by <a href="Wayne%20Smith%20%28rugby%20player%29">Wayne Smith</a>.
Due to the definition and role of All Blacks coach varying so much prior to the 1949 All Blacks tour of South Africa, the following table only includes coaches appointed since.

Like other major rugby nations Argentina, Australia, France and South Africa, New Zealand does not have an official stadium for its national team. Instead, the All Blacks play their test matches at a variety of venues throughout New Zealand.

Prior to the construction of Westpac Stadium in 1999, Wellington's test venue was <a href="Athletic%20Park%2C%20Wellington">Athletic Park</a>. Athletic Park was the venue for the first All Blacks test match in New Zealand against Great Britain in 1904. The first home test match played outside the main centres of Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin or Wellington was in 1996 at <a href="McLean%20Park">McLean Park</a> in <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier</a>.

Eden Park and AMI Stadium were upgraded in preparation for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. By that time, the NZRU no longer considered Carisbrook a suitable test venue, and <a href="Forsyth%20Barr%20Stadium">a covered sports stadium</a> was proposed as a replacement. <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin City Council</a> approved the new stadium in March 2008, land acquisition proceeded from August to October of that year, and the new venue opened in August 2011, in time for the World Cup.

AMI Stadium was significantly damaged during the February <a href="2011%20Christchurch%20earthquake">2011 Christchurch earthquake</a>, with cracks in some stands and the playing surface badly damaged by <a href="liquefaction">liquefaction</a> as well as damage to infrastructure and streets surrounding the venue. As a result of the damage all scheduled 2011 World Cup games to be held in Christchurch were moved to other regions. test rugby returned to Christchurch in <a href="2012%20mid-year%20rugby%20test%20series">2012</a> at <a href="Rugby%20League%20Park">Rugby League Park</a>. Although the stands at that venue were damaged severely enough that they had to be torn down, infrastructure damage was much less severe than at AMI Stadium, and the playing surface survived relatively intact. The stadium was rebuilt with a permanent capacity of 17,000, with temporary seating allowing for 9,000 more spectators.

If (magazine)

If was an American <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science-fiction magazine</a> launched in March 1952 by Quinn Publications, owned by <a href="James%20L.%20Quinn%20%28editor%29">James L. Quinn</a>.

The magazine was moderately successful, though for most of its run it was not considered to be in the first tier of science-fiction magazines. It achieved its greatest success under editor <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, winning the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for best professional magazine three years running from 1966 to 1968. "If" published many award-winning stories over its 22 years, including <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Moon%20Is%20a%20Harsh%20Mistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>" and <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>'s short story "<a href="I%20Have%20No%20Mouth%20and%20I%20Must%20Scream">I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream</a>". The most prominent writer to make his first sale to "If" was <a href="Larry%20Niven">Larry Niven</a>, whose story "The Coldest Place" appeared in the December 1964 issue.

"If" was merged into "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" after the December 1974 issue, its 175th issue overall.

Although science fiction had been published in the United States before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "Amazing Stories", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s, the field was undergoing its first boom, but <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. "If" was launched in the middle of this second publishing boom.

"If"'s origins can be traced to 1948 and 1949, when <a href="Raymond%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a> founded two magazines while working at <a href="Ziff-Davis">Ziff-Davis</a> in Chicago: "<a href="Fate%20%28magazine%29">Fate</a>" and "<a href="Other%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">Other Worlds</a>". "Fate" published articles about occult and supernatural events, while "Other Worlds" was a science-fiction magazine. The two were sufficiently successful to attract the notice of <a href="James%20L.%20Quinn%20%28editor%29">James L. Quinn</a>, a New York publisher. When Ziff-Davis moved to New York City in late 1950, <a href="Paul%20W.%20Fairman">Paul W. Fairman</a>, a prolific writer, went with them, and was soon in touch with Quinn, who decided to found a pair of magazines modelled after Palmer's. One was a nonfiction magazine entitled "Strange"; the other was "If".
The first issue of "If" was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editor; it featured stories by Richard Shaver, Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all writers who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. By the time the third issue reached the news stands, the disappointing sales figures for the first issue were in, and Quinn decided to let Fairman go. Quinn persevered with himself as editor. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he continued as editor on the masthead for some years. Quinn brought in <a href="Ed%20Valigursky">Ed Valigursky</a> as the art editor; he designed striking covers, including some wraparound artwork—an unusual feature—which helped improve circulation. Quinn began searching for a replacement editor: writer <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a> turned down the job (a decision he is reported to have later regretted), but Quinn was able to engage <a href="Larry%20T.%20Shaw">Larry T. Shaw</a>, an active <a href="science%20fiction%20fan">science-fiction fan</a> who had sold a few stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as associate editor and soon began writing editorials (beginning with the September 1953 issue) and assisting with story selection. The magazine's quality quickly improved and soon Quinn felt able to switch to a monthly schedule, instead of bimonthly. Shaw left after only a year, and Quinn resumed full editorial responsibilities.

In late 1953, Quinn decided to run a competition for short fiction from new writers. The competition was only open to college students who had not sold a story before. The first prize was $1,000, the second prize $500, with five runner-up prizes of $100 each. Entries came in from writers who were later to become well known, including <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>, <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>, and <a href="Andrew%20J.%20Offutt">Andrew J. Offutt</a>, whose story "And Gone Tomorrow", about a man unexpectedly sent a hundred years into the future, won first prize and appeared in the December 1954 issue of "If". The only other one of the seven announced winners who had a career as a science-fiction writer was <a href="Leo%20P.%20Kelley">Leo P. Kelley</a>. Quinn decided to move "If" to a monthly schedule with the March 1954 issue, perhaps because the competition had increased readership. It reverted to a bimonthly schedule with the June 1956 issue, as circulation dropped again.

In 1957, <a href="American%20News%20Company">American News Company</a>, by far the largest magazine distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen by the end of the decade. For a while "If" was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the <a href="Slick%20%28magazine%20format%29">slick format</a> (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, "Space Age", which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve "If"'s circulation, Quinn hired writer <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.

"If"'s new owner was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of ownership was abrupt and led to a delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was <a href="Horace%20Gold">Horace Gold</a>, who was also the editor of "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>"; "Galaxy" had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and "If" and "Galaxy" appeared in alternate months for the next few years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with "If" was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, the effect was that "If" became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for "Galaxy".
<a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> took over the editorship of both "If" and "Galaxy" in 1961. Gold had had a car accident with sufficiently severe health consequences to prevent him from being able to continue as editor. Pohl, who had been intermittently helping Gold with editorial duties for some time prior to the car accident, is first listed as editor of "If" on the masthead of the November 1961 issue, and as editor of "Galaxy" for the December 1961 issue, but he had been acting as editor of both magazines since at least midyear. Pohl paid one cent per word for the stories he bought for "If", whereas "Galaxy" paid three cents per word, and like Gold, he regarded "Galaxy" as the leading magazine of the two, whereas "If" was somewhere he could work with new writers, and try experiments and whims. This developed into a selling point when a letter from a reader, Clayton Hamlin, prompted Pohl to declare that he would publish a new writer in every single issue of the magazine, though he was also able to attract well-known writers. When Pohl began his stint as editor, both magazines were operating at a loss; despite "If"'s lower budget, Pohl found it more fun to edit, and commented that apparently the readers thought so, too; he was able to make "If" show a profit before "Galaxy", adding, "What was fun for me seemed to be fun for them."

In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing brought out the first issue of "<a href="Worlds%20of%20Tomorrow%20%28magazine%29">Worlds of Tomorrow</a>", another science-fiction magazine, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 that it would be better to have "Galaxy" resume a monthly schedule; both "Worlds of Tomorrow" and "Galaxy" were bimonthly at that time, while "If" was monthly. With the August 1967 issue "Worlds of Tomorrow" was merged with "If", though it was another year before "Galaxy" actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, "If" had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).

The circulation rose from 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Analog</a>" among the other science-fiction magazines, and "If" won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including "Galaxy" and "If", to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> when he heard the news, and decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management. He had been considering a return to a writing career for some time and the change in ownership precipitated his decision to leave.

The new editor was <a href="Ejler%20Jakobsson">Ejler Jakobsson</a>, though Pohl continued to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the July–August 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was actually done by <a href="Judy-Lynn%20del%20Rey">Judy-Lynn Benjamin</a>, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. "If" went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of "If", reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.

In May 1973, Judy-Lynn Benjamin (Judy-Lynn del Rey since her 1971 marriage to Lester del Rey) resigned. She was briefly replaced by Albert Dytch, but within four months, Dytch in turn left, and in August 1973, <a href="Jim%20Baen">James Baen</a> joined UPD. He was made managing editor of "If" with effect from the January 1974 issue, and full editor one issue later; Jakobsson was listed as editor emeritus until the August 1974 issue. Baen had little opportunity to work with "If", however, as financial problems at UPD combined with the increasing cost of paper (a consequence of the rising price of oil) led to a decision to combine "If" with "Galaxy". Despite the fact that in 1974, "If"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s circulation had exceeded "Galaxy"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s for the first time, "Galaxy" was retained and "If" was merged with it beginning with the January 1975 issue.

In 1986, an attempt was made to revive "If" as a semiprofessional magazine. The only issue, dated September–October 1986, was edited by Clifford Hong.

The first issue of "If", dated March 1952, went on sale on 7 January of that year. The lead story was <a href="Howard%20Browne">Howard Browne</a>'s "Twelve Times Zero", a murder mystery with a science-fictional resolution; other stories were from <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Palmer">Ray Palmer</a>, <a href="Richard%20Shaver">Richard Shaver</a>, and <a href="Rog%20Phillips">Rog Phillips</a>, all writers associated with the Ziff-Davis magazines. Browne was the editor of Ziff-Davis's "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Science Fiction</a>", a leading magazine of the time, and had given Fairman his start in the field in the late 1940s. Fairman was familiar with Ziff-Davis's stable of writers, and his preference for them was a reflection of his experience, though this did not necessarily serve the magazine well—he referred to the acquisition of Browne's story as "the scoop of the century" and spoke in glowing terms of him in an introductory note despite the fact that Browne was reputed to detest science fiction. In addition to the fiction and the editorial by Fairman, it had a letter column, a profile of <a href="Wilson%20Tucker">Wilson Tucker</a>, a selection of science news, a guest editorial by Ken Slater, a well-known British fan, and an approving review of the TV show "<a href="Tales%20of%20Tomorrow">Tales of Tomorrow</a>".

After Quinn dismissed Fairman and engaged Larry Shaw, the magazine improved significantly, and published several well-received stories, including <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>'s "A Case of Conscience" in the September 1953 issue, later to become the first part of Blish's Hugo Award-winning <a href="A%20Case%20of%20Conscience">novel of the same name</a>, about a <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest on a planet of aliens who have no religion but appear free of sin. The dominant science-fiction magazines of the 1950s were "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding</a>", "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy</a>", and "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20and%20Science%20Fiction">Fantasy and Science Fiction</a>", but "If" was in the next rank in terms of quality: SF historian <a href="Frank%20M.%20Robinson">Frank M. Robinson</a>, for example, describes "If" as the "most major of the minors". Well-known writers who appeared in "If" in the 1950s include <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a> and <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>: the original short story version of Clarke's novel "<a href="The%20Songs%20of%20Distant%20Earth">The Songs of Distant Earth</a>" appeared in the June 1958 issue. Isaac Asimov's widely reprinted story "<a href="The%20Feeling%20of%20Power">The Feeling of Power</a>" appeared in February 1958.

The period under Pohl is regarded as the magazine's heyday; the three consecutive Hugo Awards won from 1966 to 1968 broke a long period in which the award had been monopolized by "Analog" (the name to which "Astounding" changed in 1960) and "Fantasy and Science Fiction". Frank Robinson commented that "Pohl was the only one who was surprised when he won three Hugos in a row for editing "IF". It had been fun, and the fun had showed." Niven's "<a href="Neutron%20Star%20%28short%20story%29">Neutron Star</a>" appeared in October 1966, and Harlan Ellison's "<a href="I%20Have%20No%20Mouth%20and%20I%20Must%20Scream">I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream</a>" appeared in March 1967; both won Hugo Awards. Pohl also managed to secure a new Skylark novel, "<a href="Skylark%20DuQuesne">Skylark DuQuesne</a>", from <a href="E.E.%20Smith">E.E. Smith</a>; the series had been started in the 1920s and was still popular with readers. Pohl also bought <a href="A.E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>'s "The Expendables"; the story was van Vogt's first sale in 14 years and attracted long-time readers to the magazine. Another coup was the serialization of three novels by <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>, including the award-winning "<a href="The%20Moon%20Is%20a%20Harsh%20Mistress">The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</a>", which ran in five parts from December 1965 to April 1966.

Pohl's policy of publishing a story by a new writer in every issue led to a series called ""If"-firsts"; the first one, <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Green">Joseph L. Green</a>'s "Once Around Arcturus", about the courtship between a man and woman of different planets, appeared in the September 1962 issue. Several of the writers featured in the "If"-first series, which were published from 1962 through 1965, became well-known, including <a href="Alexei%20Panshin">Alexei Panshin</a>; the most prominent was <a href="Larry%20Niven">Larry Niven</a>, whose first story, "The Coldest Place", appeared in December 1964. Niven later remarked that the story was immediately outdated; the plot relied on the discovery that the dark side of <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> was the coldest place in the universe, but space probes had recently discovered that Mercury did in fact rotate asynchronously. <a href="Gardner%20Dozois">Gardner Dozois</a> also made his first sale to "If", with "The Empty Man", about a man possessed by an alien, in the September 1966 issue, and <a href="Gene%20Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a>'s "Mountains Like Mice", about an abandoned group of colonists on Mars, appeared in the May 1966 issue. Technically this was not Wolfe's first sale, as he had already had "The Dead Man" published in the October 1965 issue of "Sir!", but "Mountains Like Mice" had been written earlier.

"If"'s covers during the 1960s were typically action-oriented, showing monsters and aliens; and several of the stories Pohl published were directed at a younger audience. For example, Blish's "Welcome to Mars", serialized under the title "The Hour Before Earthrise" in July to September 1966, was about a teenage genius whose antigravity device stranded him and his girlfriend on Mars. Ashley has suggested that "If" was attempting to acquire readership from the many new fans of science fiction who had been introduced to the genre through television, in particular via the popular 1960s shows "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" and "". "If" also ran a friendly letter column, with more fan-oriented discussions than the other magazines, and between 1966 and 1968 a column by <a href="Lin%20Carter">Lin Carter</a> introduced readers to various aspects of <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fandom</a>. These features are also likely to have appealed to a younger audience.

"If" was a digest-sized magazine throughout its life. It began at 164 pages and with only the fifth issue, November 1952, dropped to 124 pages. The page count increased again to 134 pages with the July 1959 issue, and to 164 pages with the September 1965 issue; it stayed at this length until the September–October 1970 issue. The page count was then increased to 180 with the June 1971 issue, and to 164 for the very last issue, December 1974. It was priced at 35 cents to begin with, and increased to 40 cents with the March 1963 issue, to 50 cents with the December 1964 issue, to 60 cents with the August 1967 issue, and finally to 75 cents with the September–October 1970 issue. With the April 1972 issue, UPD began using card stock for the covers, rather than paper, and continued to do so until the magazine ceased publication.

The magazine was bimonthly until the March 1954 issue, which was followed by April 1954, inaugurating a monthly period that ran until June 1955. This was followed by August 1955, resuming a bimonthly schedule that ran until July 1964, with only one irregularity, when the February 1959 issue was followed by July 1959. After July 1964, "If" ran a monthly schedule until April 1970, with three omissions: there were no issues dated September 1964, June 1969, or August 1969. From May–June 1970, the issues were bimonthly and bore the names of two months. This bimonthly sequence ran through the last issue at the end of 1974. The date the magazine printed on the cover reverted to a single month with the June 1971 issue, though the contents page still used two months to identify the issue. The volume numbering began with six issues to a volume: there were three errors on the magazine contents page, with volume 8 number 1 incorrectly printed as volume 7 number 6; volume 9 number 3 printed as volume 8 number 6; and volume 10 number 1 printed as volume 10 number 6. Volume 14, which began in March 1964, ran through the end of the year, with seven numbers; the remaining volumes had 12 numbers each except for volume 19 which had 10 and volume 22 which had 8.

Several British editions of "If" were produced. In 1953 and 1954, Strato Publications reprinted 15 issues, numbering them from 1 to 15; another 18 were reprinted between 1959 and 1962, with the issue numbers started at 1 again. Between January and November 1967 a UK edition appeared from Gold Star Publications; these were identical to the US edition dated ten months previously. Between 1972 and 1974, 15 of the UPD editions of "If" were imported, renumbered and repriced for UK distribution. The numbering, inexplicably, ran from 1 to 9, and then 11, 1, 13, 3, 4 and 5.

The editorial succession at "If" was as follows:
Eight selections of stories from "If" have been published. Two were edited by Quinn: "The First World of If" (1957) and "The Second World of If" (1958); four by Pohl: "The Best Science Fiction from If" (1964), "The If Reader of Science Fiction" (1966), "The Second If Reader of Science Fiction" (1968), and "Worlds of If" (1986); and two by Jakobsson, both published as by "The Editors of If": "The Best from If" (1973) and "The Best from If Vol II" (1974). In addition, two anthologies drew all their contents from "If" without mentioning the magazine: "The 6 Fingers of Time and 5 Other Science Fiction Novelets" (1965) and "The Frozen Planet and Other Stories" (1966). Both were edited by Samuel H Post, who was not credited.

William de Corbeil

William de Corbeil or William of Corbeil (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1070 – 1136) was a medieval <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Very little is known of William's early life or his family, except that he was born at <a href="Corbeil-Essonnes">Corbeil</a> in the outskirts of Paris and that he had two brothers. Educated as a theologian, he taught briefly before serving the bishops of Durham and London as a clerk and subsequently becoming a <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a>, a priest who lived a communal life. William was elected to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a> as a compromise candidate in 1123, the first canon to become an English archbishop. He succeeded <a href="Ralph%20d%27Escures">Ralph d'Escures</a>, who had employed him as a chaplain.

Throughout his archbishopric, William was embroiled in a <a href="Canterbury%E2%80%93York%20dispute">dispute</a> with <a href="Thurstan">Thurstan</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, over the <a href="primacy%20of%20Canterbury">primacy of Canterbury</a>. As a temporary solution, the pope appointed William the <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a> for England, giving him powers superior to those of York. William concerned himself with the morals of the clergy, and presided over three <a href="legatine%20council">legatine council</a>s, which among other things condemned the purchase of benefices or priesthoods, and admonished the clergy to live a celibate life. He was also known as a builder; among his constructions is the <a href="keep">keep</a> of <a href="Rochester%20Castle">Rochester Castle</a>. Towards the end of his life William was instrumental in the selection of Count <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen of Boulogne</a> as King of England, despite his oath to the dying King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a> that he would support the succession of his daughter, the Empress <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>. Although some chroniclers considered him a perjurer and a traitor for crowning Stephen, none doubted his piety.

William de Corbeil was probably born at Corbeil on the <a href="Seine">Seine</a>, possibly in about 1070. He was educated at <a href="Laon">Laon</a>, where he studied under <a href="Anselm%20of%20Laon">Anselm of Laon</a>, the noted <a href="Scholasticism">scholastic</a> and teacher of theology. William taught for a time at Laon, but nothing else is known of his early life. All that is known of his parents or ancestry is that he had two brothers, Ranulf and Helgot; his brothers appear as witnesses on William's charters.

William joined the service of <a href="Ranulf%20Flambard">Ranulf Flambard</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, as a clerk, and was present at the <a href="Translation%20%28relic%29">translation</a> of the body of Saint Cuthbert in 1104. His name appears high in a list of those who were present at the event, implying that he may have held an important position in Flambard's household, but appended to his name is "subsequently archbishop", suggesting that his inclusion could have been a later interpolation. He was a teacher to Flambard's children, probably in about 1107 to 1109, but at some unknown date William appears to have transferred to the household of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Between 1107 and 1112 he went to Laon and attended lectures given by Anselm of Laon. By 1116 he was a clerk for Ralph d'Escures, Archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he travelled to Rome in 1117 when Ralph was in dispute with Thurstan, the Archbishop of York, over the primacy of Canterbury.

In 1118, William entered the <a href="Augustinians">Augustinian</a> order at <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Priory%2C%20Aldgate">Holy Trinity Priory</a> in <a href="Aldgate">Aldgate</a>, a house of <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> rather than monks. Subsequently, he became <a href="prior">prior</a> of the <a href="St%20Osyth%27s%20Priory">Augustinian priory at St Osyth</a> in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, appointed by <a href="Richard%20de%20Beaumis%20%28died%201127%29">Richard de Beaumis</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>, in 1121.

After the death of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom disagreed on who should be appointed. The bishops insisted that it should not be a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (<a href="Ernulf">Ernulf</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a>, and <a href="Serlo%2C%20Bishop%20of%20S%C3%A9es">Serlo</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20S%C3%A9es">Bishop of Séez</a>), and no monks other than <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.

On 2 February or 4 February 1123, William was chosen from among four candidates to the see of Canterbury; the names of the three unsuccessful candidates are unknown. He appears to have been a compromise candidate, as he was at least a canon, if not the monk that the chapter had sought. William was the first Augustinian canon to become an archbishop in England, a striking break with the tradition that had favoured monks in the see of Canterbury. Although most contemporaries would not have considered there to be much of a distinction between monks and canons, William's election still occasioned some trepidation among the monks of the Canterbury chapter, who were "alarmed at the appointment, since he was a clerk".

William, like every other Canterbury archbishop since <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, maintained that Canterbury held primacy—in essence, overlordship—over all other dioceses in Great Britain, including the archbishopric of York. Thurstan had claimed independence, and refused to consecrate William when the latter demanded recognition of Canterbury's primacy; the ceremony was performed instead by William's own <a href="Suffragan%20bishop">suffragan</a> bishops on 18 February 1123. Previous popes had generally favoured York's side of the dispute, and the successive popes <a href="Pope%20Paschal%20II">Paschal II</a>, <a href="Pope%20Gelasius%20II">Gelasius II</a>, and <a href="Pope%20Calixtus%20II">Calixtus II</a> had issued rulings in the late 1110s and early 1120s siding with York. Calixtus had also consecrated Thurstan when both King Henry and William's predecessor had attempted to prevent Thurstan's consecration unless Thurstan submitted to Canterbury.

After travelling to Rome to receive his <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of his authority as an archbishop, William discovered that Thurstan had arrived before him, and had presented a case against William's election to Pope Callixtus II. There were four objections to William's election: first that he was elected in the king's court; second that the chapter of Canterbury had been coerced and was unwilling; third that his consecration was unlawful because it was not performed by Thurstan; and fourth that a monk should be elected to the see of Canterbury, which had been founded by <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>, a monk. However, King Henry I and the Emperor <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>, Henry I's son-in-law, persuaded the pope to overlook the irregularities of the election, with the proviso that William swore to obey "all things that the Pope imposed upon him." At the conclusion of the visit the pope denied the primacy of Canterbury over York, dismissing the Canterbury cathedral chapter's supposed papal documents as forgeries. The outcome was in accordance with most earlier papal rulings on the primacy issue, which involved not taking sides and thus reinforcing papal supremacy. William returned to England, and was enthroned at Canterbury on 22 July 1123.

The archbishop's next opponent was the papal legate of the new Pope <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20II">Honorius II</a>, Cardinal <a href="John%20of%20Crema">John of Crema</a>, who arrived in England in 1125. A compromise between York and Canterbury was negotiated, which involved Canterbury allowing York the supervision of the <a href="diocese">diocese</a>s of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Bangor">Bangor</a>, <a href="Diocese%20of%20Chester">Chester</a>, and <a href="Diocese%20of%20St%20Asaph">St Aspah</a> in return for Thurstan's verbal submission and the written submission of his successors. The pope, however, rejected the agreement, likely because he wished to preserve his own primacy, and substituted his own. The papal solution was that Honorius would appoint William papal legate in England and Scotland, which was done in 1126, giving William the position over York, but it was dependent on the will of the pope, and would lapse on the pope's death. The arrangement merely postponed the problem however, as neither Thurstan nor William renounced their claims. That Christmas, at a royal court, Thurstan unsuccessfully attempted to claim the right to ceremonially crown the king as well as have his episcopal cross carried before him in Canterbury's province. As a result of his lengthy dispute with Thurstan, William travelled to Rome more frequently than any bishop before him except for <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a> in the 7th century.

Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 were held in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, the last two called by Archbishop William. The council of 1125 met under the direction of John of Crema and prohibited <a href="simony">simony</a>, purchase of the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s, and the inheritance of clerical <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s. John of Crema had been sent to England not only to seek a compromise in the Canterbury–York dispute, but to publicize the decrees of the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">First Council of the Lateran</a> held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or <a href="prebend">prebend</a>, which was a source of consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in clergy's households unless they were relatives. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic houses. It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to give up their wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any such women who did not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled and even forced into slavery. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives. This council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to pay a fine to the royal treasury to keep their women. William's allowance of this royal fine was condemned by the chronicler <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>. The <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Immaculate%20Conception">festival of the Conception</a> was also allowed at one of these councils.

As well as the councils, William was active in his diocese, and was interested in reforming the churches in his diocese. A conflict with <a href="Alexander%20of%20Lincoln">Alexander of Lincoln</a> over a church in Alexander's diocese led to further condemnation by Henry of Huntingon and prompted Henry to write that "no one can sing [William's] praises because there's nothing to sing about." William seems to have been somewhat eclipsed in ecclesiastical administration and appointments by <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger of Salisbury</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, and King Henry's primary advisor. William reformed the nunnery of <a href="Minster%2C%20Swale">Minster-in-Sheppey</a> however, and he installed a college of regular canons at the church of St. Gregory's, in Canterbury. He also secured a profession of obedience from the newly installed <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a> in Canterbury. His legateship from Honorius lapsed when the pope died in February 1130, but it was renewed by Honorius' successor Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Innocent II</a> in 1132.

During William's last years he attempted to reform <a href="Dover%20Priory">St Martin's, Dover</a>. The king had granted the church to the archbishop and the diocese of Canterbury in 1130, and William had a new church building constructed near Dover. The archbishop had planned to install <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canons regular</a> into the church, and on William's deathbed dispatched a party of canons from <a href="Merton%20Priory">Merton Priory</a> to take over St Martin's. However, the party of canons, who had been accompanied by two bishops and some other clergy, were prevented from entering by a monk of Canterbury Cathedral, who claimed that St Martin's belonged to the monks of the cathedral chapter. The canons from Merton did not press the issue in the face of the Canterbury chapter's appeal to Rome, and after William's death, the cathedral chapter sent 12 monks to St Martin's instead.

The construction of the keep of Rochester Castle—at , the tallest Norman-built keep in England—was initiated at William's orders. Built for King Henry, it is still intact, although it no longer has a roof or floors. The work at Rochester was built within the stone <a href="Curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain walls</a> that <a href="Gundulf%20of%20Rochester">Gundulf of Rochester</a> had erected in the late 11th century. The keep was designed not only for defence but also to provide comfortable living quarters, which were probably intended for use by the archbishops when they visited Rochester. In 1127, the custody of Rochester Castle was granted to William and his successors as archbishop by King Henry, including the right to fortify the place as the archbishops wished, and the right to garrison the castle with their own men. In the view of the historian <a href="Judith%20Green%20%28historian%29">Judith Green</a>, the grant of the castle was partly to secure the loyalty of the archbishop to the king, and partly to help secure the defences of the coast. William also completed the construction of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>, which was dedicated in May 1130.

The archbishop swore to Henry I that he would support Henry's daughter Matilda's claim to the English throne, but after Henry's death he instead crowned Stephen, on 22 December 1135. He was persuaded to do so by <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and Stephen's brother, and Roger of Salisbury, Bishop of Salisbury. The bishops argued that Henry had no right to impose the oath, and that the dying king had released the barons and the bishops from the oath in any event. The royal steward, <a href="Hugh%20Bigod%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Norfolk">Hugh Bigod</a>, swore that he had been present at the king's deathbed and had heard the king say that he released the oath.

William did not long outlive Henry, dying at Canterbury on 21 November 1136. He was buried in the north <a href="transept">transept</a> of Canterbury Cathedral.
Contemporaries were grudging in their praise, and William's reputation suffered after the accession of Matilda's son, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>, to the English throne. <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> said that William was a courteous and sober man, with little of the flamboyant lifestyle of the more "modern" bishops. The author of the "<a href="Deeds%20of%20King%20Stephen">Gesta Stephani</a>" claimed that William was avaricious and hoarded money. None of the chroniclers, however, doubted his piety, even when they named him a perjurer and a traitor for his coronation of Stephen.

John de Gray

John de Gray or de Grey (died 18 October 1214) was an English prelate who served as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Norwich">Bishop of Norwich</a>, and was elected but unconfirmed <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. He was employed in the service of Prince <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a> even before John became king, for which he was rewarded with a number of ecclesiastical offices, culminating in his <a href="Confirmation%20of%20bishops">"pro forma" election</a> to Norwich in 1200. De Gray continued in royal service after his elevation to the <a href="episcopate">episcopate</a>, lending the King money and undertaking diplomatic missions on his behalf. In 1205 King John attempted to further reward de Gray with a <a href="Translation%20%28ecclesiastical%29">translation</a> to the archbishopric of Canterbury, but a disputed election process led to de Gray's selection being quashed by Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Innocent III</a> in 1206.

Innocent consecrated <a href="Stephen%20Langton">Stephen Langton</a> as archbishop against John's wishes, triggering a long dispute between the papacy and the King. The pope imposed various sanctions on England and John; at one point de Gray was one of only two bishops still legitimately holding office in England. In 1209 he became <a href="Chief%20governor%20of%20Ireland">governor of Ireland</a> for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons and the native Irish in that country. Recalled to England to help defend against a threatened invasion by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of John and Innocent's dispute over the bishop's abortive elevation to Canterbury. After securing his pardon de Gray was appointed <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, but he died on his way back to England.

De Gray built a palace in his diocese and several castles in Ireland. Although he was reviled by one contemporary writer as an "evil counsellor" to the King, modern historians have been more forgiving; one praised his intelligence and others stated that de Gray was one of the few men King John trusted throughout his life. De Gray's nephew, <a href="Walter%20de%20Gray">Walter de Gray</a>, secured the office of <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> with his uncle's help in 1205.

Some describe de Gray as a native of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>; he was likely descended from the <a href="Anglo-Normans">Norman</a> knight <a href="Anchetil%20de%20Greye">Anchetil de Greye</a>. De Gray was the uncle of Walter de Gray, later <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>. The elder de Gray was instrumental in securing the selection of his nephew as Lord Chancellor, as he was a surety for Walter's payment of a fine of 5000 <a href="mark%20%28money%29">marks</a> to acquire the position.

By 1196, de Gray was in the service of King <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>'s brother <a href="John%20I%20of%20England">John</a>, and was keeper of John's seal by 1198. John ascended the throne of England in 1199, with de Gray becoming <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Cleveland">Archdeacon of Cleveland</a> in March 1200, and <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Gloucester">Archdeacon of Gloucester</a> before April that year. He also served as John's secretary, and frequently as a deputy for the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="Hubert%20Walter">Hubert Walter</a>. Shortly after John became king, de Gray began travelling between England and the continent on royal business, and for the first two years of John's reign was active in the royal chancery, sealing royal charters.

De Gray was elected Bishop of Norwich on about 7 September 1200, although the election was purely "pro forma", as acknowledged by a contemporary writer <a href="Roger%20of%20Howden">Roger of Howden</a>, who stated that the new bishop "succeeded to the bishopric of Norwich by the gift of King John". De Gray was <a href="consecration">consecrated</a> on 24 September. His consecration took place together with that of the new <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a> <a href="Giles%20de%20Braose">Giles de Braose</a> at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, at the conclusion of a provincial church council held by Archbishop Walter, which de Gray had been attending. Walter performed the ceremony in a chapel of <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

While bishop, de Gray often lent the king money, and on one occasion held the <a href="regalia">royal regalia</a> as <a href="Security%20interest">security</a> for the repayment of a loan; he also served as a royal justice. In 1203 de Gray accompanied Archbishop Hubert Walter and several <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>s on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to King <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20France">Philip II of France</a>. Philip had demanded that John's niece <a href="Eleanor%2C%20Fair%20Maid%20of%20Brittany">Eleanor of Brittany</a> or his nephew <a href="Arthur%20of%20Brittany">Arthur of Brittany</a> be surrendered to him together with all of John's lands on the continent, none of which John was prepared to concede. Philip invaded <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> after the bishops returned to England.

In 1203 some of de Gray's knights were part of the garrison at the castle of <a href="Le%20Vaudreuil">Vaudreuil</a> in Normandy, serving under the command of <a href="Robert%20FitzWalter">Robert FitzWalter</a>. Although they had provisions and John was moving in support of the troops, in the summer of 1203 the garrison surrendered to Philip, shortly after a siege had begun. When John abandoned Normandy in late 1203, effectively relinquishing control of the duchy to Philip, de Gray was one of his companions on the journey to the port of <a href="Barfleur">Barfleur</a>, and went on to England with the king.

John's attempt to impose de Gray's election as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1205 was the beginning of the king's long quarrel with <a href="Pope%20Innocent%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Pope Innocent III</a>. After Hubert Walter's death in July 1205, the selection of a successor was hindered by doubts about what the proper procedure should be, something that commonly happened with elections to Canterbury. John postponed a decision while delegations from the bishops of England and the monks of the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> went to Rome to seek guidance from the pope. The bishops of the province of Canterbury claimed the right to a say in who was elected, as whoever was chosen would be their superior, but according to <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> the monks of the cathedral chapter had the right to elect the new archbishop. The king also had a say in the election, as the archbishop was a major <a href="tenant-in-chief">tenant-in-chief</a> and was traditionally one of the principal royal advisers.

While the delegations from the various parties were in Rome, the monks of Canterbury secretly elected one of their own, <a href="Reginald%20%28sub-prior%29">Reginald</a>, as archbishop, and subsequently sent him to Rome to join the delegation. When John discovered that Reginald had been elected without any royal input he forced the monks to elect de Gray as archbishop. Some stories have Reginald's election taking place before the despatch of the first delegation to the <a href="Roman%20Curia">papal curia</a>. Another source, <a href="Gervase%20of%20Canterbury">Gervase of Canterbury</a>, has the king telling the chapter they could choose their own nominee after six months, while the king secretly sent envoys to Rome to secure de Gray's election. A further story, from <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a>, states that the monks elected Reginald before Walter was even buried, and that only a few members of the cathedral chapter – the younger ones – participated in the election. Wendover wrote in the 1230s and was not a monk of Canterbury, therefore it is unlikely he has recorded a true account.

De Gray was postulated, or nominated, to Canterbury on 11 December 1205, which presented Innocent with two candidates for the office. In an effort to reach a compromise, the pope quashed both nominations on about 30 March 1206; Innocent's reason for invalidating de Gray's candidacy was that any election was invalid if an earlier one was still under appeal to the papacy. The monks then elected <a href="Stephen%20Langton">Stephen Langton</a>, with Innocent's approval. John did not accept Langton's candidacy however, and Innocent's consecration of Langton in 1207 led to an eight-year struggle between John and the pope over the rights of the king to secure the election of his choice as archbishop. John refused to allow Langton to enter England and exiled the Canterbury monks. Innocent placed an <a href="interdict">interdict</a> on England in 1207, which John countered by confiscating the income and estates of any clergy who enforced it. Innocent went on to <a href="excommunicate">excommunicate</a> John in 1209, in a dispute that led to the exile of many of the English clergy and John's imposition of heavy financial demands on the church in England; by 1209 de Gray and <a href="Peter%20des%20Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, were the only living English bishops not in exile. But it was not until 1213, when Innocent began to support John's deposition, that the king became concerned and reached a settlement with the papacy.

By 1209 de Gray was in Ireland serving as the king's governor, an office sometimes referred to as <a href="justiciar">justiciar</a> for Ireland. One possible reason for his appointment was to save him from being accused of ignoring the interdict on England. As a bishop, it was de Gray's ecclesiastical duty to enforce the interdict, but by going to Ireland, which was not under interdict, he could continue to serve the king without provoking the papacy. De Gray's chief policy in Ireland was to extend English rule, to which end he was involved in battles on the <a href="River%20Shannon">River Shannon</a> and in <a href="Fermanagh">Fermanagh</a>. He also replaced the Irish coinage with English, and attempted unsuccessfully to make English laws applicable in Ireland. De Gray's term of office in Ireland coincided with a time of change in Irish governmental practices.

During John's persecution of <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%204th%20Lord%20of%20Bramber">William de Braose</a> in 1209, <a href="William%20Marshal%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">William Marshal</a> gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose to him as a traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal's refusal does not seem to have embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.

John led an expedition to Ireland in 1210 in an effort to bring the Anglo-Norman barons under control. He opened talks with the native Irish kings, and some accounts state that his negotiations were so successful that the native Irish submitted to him. In contrast, the historian Seán Duffy has argued that the native Irish nobility were just as resistant to John as the Anglo-Norman barons. After John's return to England he ordered de Gray to build three new castles in <a href="Connacht">Connacht</a>, one of them at <a href="Athlone">Athlone</a>. Associated with the castle building were two military invasions of Connacht by the royal government – one from Meath and Leinster and the other from Munster. De Gray left Ireland in 1211 to lead a military campaign against the Welsh, leaving his deputy <a href="Richard%20de%20Tuit">Richard de Tuit</a> in charge of the country.

De Gray also faced resistance from the northern Irish. In 1212 he led a campaign against <a href="%C3%81ed%20M%C3%A9ith">Áed Méith</a>, in the promotion of which he constructed castles at <a href="C%C3%A1el%20Uisce">Cáel Uisce</a>, <a href="Belleek%2C%20County%20Fermanagh">Belleek</a>, and <a href="Clones%2C%20County%20Monaghan">Clones</a>, bases for raids against the <a href="Ua%20N%C3%A9ill">Ua Néill</a> territory in the north. A naval campaign was also launched, but to no avail. De Gray suffered a defeat at the hands of <a href="Cormac%20mac%20Art%20%C3%93%20Melaghlain">Cormac O'Melaghlin</a> in 1212 at <a href="Fircal">Fircal</a>, Offaly, and left Ireland the following year. He continued to hold the office of governor for a time, but by July 1213 he had been replaced by <a href="Henry%20de%20Loundres">Henry de Loundres</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Dublin%20%28Roman%20Catholic%29">Archbishop of Dublin</a>. One of de Gray's final acts as justiciar was to take a force of <a href="Irish%20nobility">Irish knights</a> to England to help repel a threatened invasion by the French king Philip II.

As bishop, de Gray settled a long-running dispute between the monks of his cathedral chapter and his predecessors as bishop. He also allowed the monks of his cathedral chapter the right to appoint and replace the clergy of the dependent churches of the cathedral. De Gray received a 1203 missive from Innocent III decrying the marriages of some <a href="secular%20clergy">secular clergy</a>, in contravention of canon law. In more secular matters, he granted the town of <a href="King%27s%20Lynn%23Toponymy">Bishop's Lynn</a> (now <a href="King%27s%20Lynn">King's Lynn</a>) the right to hold a weekly market and two <a href="Fair%23History">fair</a>s per year. He also built a palace at <a href="Gaywood%2C%20Norfolk">Gaywood</a>.

De Gray's ability to raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500 knights during a period when Philip II was threatening to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, and part of the settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray was not included in the general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a> in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at <a href="Saint-Jean-d%27Ang%C3%A9ly">Saint-Jean-d'Angély</a> in <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>. He was buried in <a href="Norwich%20Cathedral">Norwich Cathedral</a>, but his tomb has not survived.

As well as encouraging his nephew's career, de Gray took into his household two of Hubert Walter's household clerks: David, and Robert of Ruddeby. Another clerk employed by de Gray, <a href="Robert%20de%20Bingham">Robert de Bingham</a>, was in the bishop's household during the papal interdict on England; he went on to become a tutor in theology at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a>, and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a> in 1228.

De Gray remained close to John for most of the bishop's life, and one of the King's chief fundraisers. <a href="Sidney%20Painter">Sidney Painter</a>, a historian and biographer of John, said of de Gray that he was "probably the only man whom John trusted absolutely and without reservation for the whole period of their association". The medievalist Ralph Turner called de Gray "one of John's greatest favourites", and another of John's biographers, , described de Gray as "one of the best brains of the royal administration". <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>, a medieval writer, called him an "evil counsellor", and blamed many of the difficulties of John's later reign on de Gray's failed election to Canterbury.

Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (; 6 September 1757 – 20 May 1834), known in the United States simply as Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, commanding American troops in several battles, including the <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Siege of Yorktown</a>. After returning to France, he was a key figure in the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> of 1789 and the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> of 1830.

Lafayette was born into a wealthy land-owning family in <a href="Chavaniac-Lafayette">Chavaniac</a> in the province of <a href="Auvergne%20%28province%29">Auvergne</a> in south central France. He followed the family's martial tradition and was commissioned an officer at age 13. He became convinced that the American cause was noble in its revolutionary war, and he traveled to the New World seeking glory in it. He was made a major general at age 19, but he was initially not given American troops to command. He was wounded during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Battle of Brandywine</a> but still managed to organize an orderly retreat, and he served with distinction in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rhode%20Island">Battle of Rhode Island</a>. In the middle of the war, he sailed for home to lobby for an increase in French support. He returned to America in 1780 and was given senior positions in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>. In 1781, troops under his command in Virginia blocked forces led by <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Cornwallis</a> until other American and French forces could position themselves for the decisive <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Siege of Yorktown</a>.

Lafayette returned to France and was appointed to the <a href="Assembly%20of%20Notables">Assembly of Notables</a> in 1787, convened in response to the fiscal crisis. He was elected a member of the <a href="Estates%20General%20of%201789">Estates General of 1789</a>, where representatives met from the three traditional orders of French society: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. After forming the <a href="National%20Constituent%20Assembly%20%28France%29">National Constituent Assembly</a>, he helped to write the <a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a> with <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s assistance. This document was inspired by the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> and invoked natural law to establish basic principles of the democratic nation-state. He also advocated the end of slavery, in keeping with the philosophy of natural liberty. After the <a href="storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">storming of the Bastille</a>, he was appointed commander-in-chief of France's National Guard and tried to steer a middle course through the years of revolution. In August 1792, radical factions ordered his arrest, and he fled into the Austrian Netherlands. He was captured by Austrian troops and spent more than five years in prison.

Lafayette returned to France after <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> secured his release in 1797, though he refused to participate in Napoleon's government. After the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Bourbon Restoration</a> of 1814, he became a liberal member of the Chamber of Deputies, a position that he held for most of the remainder of his life. In 1824, President <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a> invited him to the United States as the nation's guest, and he <a href="Visit%20of%20the%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette%20to%20the%20United%20States">visited all 24 states</a> in the union and met a rapturous reception. During France's July Revolution of 1830, he declined an offer to become the French dictator. Instead, he supported <a href="Louis-Philippe">Louis-Philippe</a> as king, but turned against him when the monarch became autocratic. He died on 20 May 1834 and is buried in <a href="Picpus%20Cemetery">Picpus Cemetery</a> in Paris, under soil from <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Bunker Hill</a>. He is sometimes known as "The Hero of the Two Worlds" for his accomplishments in the service of both France and the United States.

Lafayette was born on 6 September 1757 to <a href="Michel%20du%20Motier%2C%20Marquis%20de%20La%20Fayette">Michel Louis Christophe Roch Gilbert Paulette du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette</a>, colonel of grenadiers, and Marie Louise Jolie de La Rivière, at the <a href="ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chavaniac">château de Chavaniac</a>, in <a href="Chavaniac-Lafayette">Chavaniac-Lafayette</a>, near <a href="Le%20Puy-en-Velay">Le Puy-en-Velay</a>, in the <a href="Provinces%20of%20France">province</a> of <a href="Auvergne%20%28province%29">Auvergne</a> (now <a href="Haute-Loire">Haute-Loire</a>).
Lafayette's lineage was likely one of the oldest and most distinguished in Auvergne and, perhaps, in all of France. Males of the <a href="Lafayette%20family">Lafayette family</a> enjoyed a reputation for courage and chivalry and were noted for their contempt for danger. One of Lafayette's early ancestors, <a href="Gilbert%20Motier%20de%20La%20Fayette">Gilbert de Lafayette III</a>, a <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal of France</a>, had been a companion-at-arms of <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>'s army during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Siege of Orléans</a> in 1429. According to legend, another ancestor acquired the <a href="crown%20of%20thorns">crown of thorns</a> during the <a href="Sixth%20Crusade">Sixth Crusade</a>. His non-Lafayette ancestors are also notable; his great-grandfather (his mother's maternal grandfather) was the Comte de <a href="County%20of%20La%20Rivi%C3%A8re">La Rivière</a>, until his death in 1770 commander of the <a href="Musketeers%20of%20the%20Guard">Mousquetaires du Roi</a>, or Black Musketeers, King <a href="Louis%20XV%20of%20France">Louis XV</a>'s personal horse guard. Lafayette's paternal uncle Jacques-Roch died on 18 January 1734 while fighting the Austrians at Milan in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Polish%20Succession">War of the Polish Succession</a>; upon his death, the title of <a href="marquess">marquis</a> passed to his brother Michel.

Lafayette's father likewise died on the battlefield. On 1 August 1759, Michel de Lafayette was struck by a cannonball while fighting a British-led coalition at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Minden">Battle of Minden</a> in <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>. Lafayette became marquis and Lord of Chavaniac, but the estate went to his mother. Perhaps devastated by the loss of her husband, she went to live in Paris with her father and grandfather, leaving Lafayette to be raised in <a href="Chavaniac-Lafayette">Chavaniac-Lafayette</a> by his paternal grandmother, Mme de Chavaniac, who had brought the château into the family with her dowry.

In 1768, when Lafayette was 11, he was summoned to Paris to live with his mother and great-grandfather at the comte's apartments in <a href="Luxembourg%20Palace">Luxembourg Palace</a>. The boy was sent to school at the <a href="Lyc%C3%A9e%20Louis-le-Grand">Collège du Plessis</a>, part of the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a>, and it was decided that he would carry on the family martial tradition. The comte, the boy's great-grandfather, enrolled the boy in a program to train future Musketeers. Lafayette's mother and great-grandfather died, on 3 and 24 April 1770 respectively, leaving Lafayette an income of 25,000 <a href="French%20livre">livres</a>. Upon the death of an uncle, the 12-year-old Lafayette inherited a handsome yearly income of 120,000 livres.

In May 1771, aged less than 14, Lafayette was commissioned an officer in the Musketeers, with the rank of "<a href="second%20lieutenant">sous-lieutenant</a>." His duties, which included marching in military parades and presenting himself to King Louis, were mostly ceremonial and he continued his studies as usual.

At this time, <a href="Jean%20de%20Noailles">Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen</a> was looking to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, <a href="Adrienne%20de%20La%20Fayette">Marie Adrienne Françoise</a>, and the duc spoke to the boy's guardian (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by <a href="Henriette%20Anne%20Louise%20d%27Aguesseau">the duc's wife</a>, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing not to mention the marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet from time to time in casual settings and get to know each other better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.

After the marriage contract was signed in 1773, Lafayette lived with his young wife in his father-in-law's house in <a href="Versailles%20%28city%29">Versailles</a>. He continued his education, both at the riding school Versailles (his fellow students included the future <a href="Charles%20X%20of%20France">Charles X</a>) and at the prestigious Académie de Versailles. He was given a commission as a lieutenant in the Noailles <a href="Dragoon">Dragoon</a>s in April 1773, the transfer from the royal regiment being done at the request of Lafayette's father-in-law.

In 1775, Lafayette took part in his unit's annual training in <a href="Metz">Metz</a>, where he met <a href="Charles-Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Broglie%2C%20marquis%20de%20Ruffec">Charles-François de Broglie, Marquis de Ruffec</a>, the Army of the East's commander. At dinner, both men discussed the ongoing <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">revolt against British rule</a> by Britain's North American colonies. One historiographical perspective suggests that the marquis was disposed to hate the British for killing his father, and felt that a British defeat would diminish that nation's stature internationally. Another notes that the marquis had recently become a <a href="Masonic%20Order">Freemason</a>, and talk of the rebellion "fired his chivalric—and now Masonic—imagination with descriptions of Americans as 'people fighting for liberty.
In September 1775, when Lafayette turned 18, he returned to Paris and received the captaincy in the Dragoons he had been promised as a wedding present. In December, his first child, Henriette, was born. During these months, Lafayette became convinced that the American Revolution reflected his own beliefs, saying "My heart was dedicated."

The year 1776 saw delicate negotiations between American agents, including <a href="Silas%20Deane">Silas Deane</a>, and Louis XVI and his foreign minister, Comte <a href="Charles%20Gravier%2C%20comte%20de%20Vergennes">Charles de Vergennes</a>. The king and his minister hoped that by supplying the Americans with arms and officers, they might restore French influence in North America, and exact revenge against Britain for the loss in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>. When Lafayette heard that French officers were being sent to America, he demanded to be among them. He met Deane, and gained inclusion despite his youth. On 7 December 1776, Deane enlisted Lafayette as a major general.

The plan to send French officers (as well as other aid) to America came to nothing when the British heard of it and threatened war. Lafayette's father-in-law, de Noailles, scolded the young man and told him to go to London and visit <a href="Emmanuel-Marie-Louis%2C%20marquis%20de%20Noailles">the Marquis de Noailles</a>, the ambassador to Britain and Lafayette's uncle by marriage, which he did in February 1777. In the interim, he did not abandon his plans to go to America. Lafayette was presented to <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>, and spent three weeks in London society. On his return to France, he went into hiding from his father-in-law (and superior officer), writing to him that he was planning to go to America. De Noailles was furious, and convinced Louis to issue a decree forbidding French officers from serving in America, specifically naming Lafayette. Vergennes may have persuaded the king to order Lafayette's arrest, though this is uncertain.

Lafayette learned that the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> lacked funds for his voyage; hence, he acquired the sailing ship "Victoire" with his own money, for 112,000 pounds. He journeyed to Bordeaux, where "Victoire" was being prepared for her trip, and sent word asking for information on his family's reaction. The response, including letters from his wife and other relatives, threw Lafayette into emotional turmoil. Soon after departure, he ordered the ship turned around and returned to Bordeaux, to the frustration of the officers traveling with him. The army commander there ordered Lafayette to report to his father-in-law's regiment in Marseilles. De Broglie, who hoped to become a military and political leader in America, met with Lafayette in Bordeaux and convinced him that the government actually wanted him to go. This was not true, though there was considerable public support for Lafayette in Paris, where the American cause was popular. Lafayette wanted to believe it, and pretended to comply with the order to report to Marseilles, going only a few miles east before turning around and returning to his ship. "Victoire" set sail for the United States on 20 April 1777.

The two-month journey to the New World was marked by seasickness and boredom. The ship's captain, Lebourcier, intended to stop in the <a href="Caribbean">West Indies</a> to sell cargo, but Lafayette, fearful of arrest, bought the cargo to avoid docking at the islands. He landed on North Island near <a href="Georgetown%2C%20South%20Carolina">Georgetown, South Carolina</a>, on 13 June 1777.

On arrival, Lafayette met Major <a href="Benjamin%20Huger%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Benjamin Huger</a>, a wealthy landowner, with whom he stayed for two weeks before going to Philadelphia. The Continental Congress had been overwhelmed by French officers recruited by Deane, many of whom could not speak English or lacked military experience. Lafayette had learned some English en route (he became fluent within a year of his arrival), and his Masonic membership opened many doors in Philadelphia. After Lafayette offered to serve without pay, Congress commissioned him a major general on 31 July 1777. Lafayette's advocates included the recently arrived American envoy to France, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who by letter urged Congress to accommodate the young Frenchman.

General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, commander in chief of the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>, came to Philadelphia to brief Congress on military affairs. Lafayette met him at a dinner on 5 August 1777; according to Leepson, "the two men bonded almost immediately." Washington was impressed by the young man's enthusiasm and was inclined to think well of a fellow Mason; Lafayette was simply in awe of the commanding general. General Washington took the Frenchman to view his military camp; when Washington expressed embarrassment at its state and that of the troops, Lafayette responded, "I am here to learn, not to teach." He became a member of Washington's staff, although confusion existed regarding his status. Congress regarded his commission as honorary, while he considered himself a full-fledged commander who would be given control of a division when Washington deemed him prepared. Washington told Lafayette that a division would not be possible as he was of foreign birth, but that he would be happy to hold him in confidence as "friend and father".
Lafayette's first battle was at Brandywine on 11 September 1777. The British commanding general, General <a href="William%20Howe%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Howe">Sir William Howe</a>, <a href="Philadelphia%20campaign">planned to take Philadelphia</a> by moving troops south by ship to <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> (rather than the heavily defended <a href="Delaware%20Bay">Delaware Bay</a>) and bringing them overland to the rebel capital. After the British outflanked the Americans, Washington sent Lafayette to join General <a href="John%20Sullivan%20%28general%29">John Sullivan</a>. Upon his arrival, Lafayette went with the Third Pennsylvania Brigade, under Brigadier <a href="Thomas%20Conway">Thomas Conway</a>, and attempted to rally the unit to face the attack. The British and <a href="Hessian%20%28soldier%29">Hessian</a> forces continued to advance with their superior forces, and Lafayette was shot in the leg. During the American retreat, Lafayette rallied the troops, allowing a more orderly pullback, before being treated for his wound. After the battle, Washington cited him for "bravery and military ardour" and recommended him for the command of a division in a letter to Congress, which was hastily evacuating, as the British took Philadelphia later that month.

Lafayette returned to the field in November after two months of recuperation in the <a href="Moravian%20Church">Moravian</a> settlement of <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethlehem</a>, and received command of the division previously led by Major General <a href="Adam%20Stephen">Adam Stephen</a>. He assisted General <a href="Nathanael%20Greene">Nathanael Greene</a> in reconnaissance of British positions in New Jersey; with 300 soldiers, he <a href="Battle%20of%20Gloucester%20%281777%29">defeated a numerically superior Hessian force</a> in <a href="Gloucester%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Gloucester</a>, on 24 November 1777.
Lafayette stayed at Washington's encampment at <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a> in the winter of 1777–78, and shared the hardship of his troops. There, the <a href="Board%20of%20War">Board of War</a>, led by <a href="Horatio%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a>, asked Lafayette to prepare an invasion of <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%9391%29">Quebec</a> from Albany, New York. When Lafayette arrived in Albany, he found too few men to mount an invasion. He wrote to Washington of the situation, and made plans to return to Valley Forge. Before departing, he recruited the <a href="Oneida%20tribe">Oneida tribe</a>, who referred to Lafayette as "Kayewla" (fearsome horseman), to the American side. In Valley Forge, he criticized the board's decision to attempt an invasion of Quebec in winter. The Continental Congress agreed, and Gates left the board. Meanwhile, treaties signed by America and France were made public in March 1778, and France formally recognized American independence.

Faced with the prospect of French intervention, the British sought to concentrate their land and naval forces in New York City, and they began to evacuate Philadelphia in May 1778. Washington dispatched Lafayette with a 2,200-man force on 18 May to reconnoiter near <a href="Battle%20of%20Barren%20Hill">Barren Hill</a>, Pennsylvania. The next day, the British heard that he had made camp nearby and sent 5,000 men to capture him. General Howe led a further 6,000 soldiers on 20 May and ordered an attack on his left flank. The flank scattered, and Lafayette organized a retreat while the British remained indecisive. To feign numerical superiority, Lafayette ordered men to appear from the woods on an outcropping (now <a href="Lafayette%20Hill%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania</a>) and to fire upon the British periodically. His troops simultaneously escaped via a sunken road, and he was then able to cross Matson's Ford with the remainder of his force.
The British then marched from Philadelphia toward New York. The Continental Army followed and finally attacked at <a href="Freehold%20Borough%2C%20New%20Jersey">Monmouth Courthouse</a> in central New Jersey. Washington appointed General <a href="Charles%20Lee%20%28general%29">Charles Lee</a> to lead the attacking force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monmouth">Battle of Monmouth</a>, and Lee moved against the British flank on 28 June. However, he gave conflicting orders soon after fighting began, causing chaos in the American ranks. Lafayette sent a message to Washington to urge him to the front; upon his arrival, he found Lee's men in retreat. Washington relieved Lee, took command, and rallied the American force. After suffering significant casualties at Monmouth, the British withdrew in the night and successfully reached New York.

The French fleet arrived at Delaware Bay on 8 July 1778 under Admiral <a href="Charles%20Hector%2C%20comte%20d%27Estaing">d'Estaing</a>, with whom General Washington planned to attack <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, the other major British base in the north. Lafayette and General Greene were sent with a 3,000-man force to participate in the attack. Lafayette wanted to control a joint Franco-American force but was rebuffed by the admiral. On 9 August, the American land force attacked the British without consulting d'Estaing. The Americans asked d'Estaing to place his ships in <a href="Narragansett%20Bay">Narragansett Bay</a>, but he refused and sought to defeat the British fleet at sea. The fighting was inconclusive as a storm scattered and damaged both fleets.
D'Estaing moved his ships north to Boston for repairs, where it faced an angry demonstration from Bostonians who considered the French departure from Newport to be a desertion. <a href="John%20Hancock">John Hancock</a> and Lafayette were dispatched to calm the situation, and Lafayette then returned to Rhode Island to prepare the retreat made necessary by d'Estaing's departure. For these actions, he was cited by the Continental Congress for "gallantry, skill, and prudence". He wanted to expand the war to fight the British elsewhere in America and even in Europe under the French flag, but he found little interest in his proposals. In October 1778, he requested permission from Washington and Congress to go home on leave. They agreed, with Congress voting to give him a ceremonial sword to be presented to him in France. His departure was delayed by illness, and he sailed for France in January 1779.

Lafayette reached Paris in February 1779 where he was placed under house arrest for eight days for disobeying the king by going to America. This was merely face-saving by <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a>; Lafayette was given a hero's welcome and was soon invited to hunt with the king. The American envoy was ill, so Benjamin Franklin's grandson <a href="William%20Temple%20Franklin">William Temple Franklin</a> presented Lafayette with the gold-encrusted sword commissioned by the Continental Congress.

Lafayette pushed for an invasion of Britain, with himself to have a major command in the French forces. Spain was now France's ally against Britain and sent ships to the English Channel in support. The Spanish ships did not arrive until August 1779 and were met by a faster squadron of British ships that the combined French and Spanish fleet could not catch. In September, the invasion was abandoned, and Lafayette turned his hopes toward returning to America. In December 1779, Adrienne gave birth to <a href="Georges%20Washington%20Lafayette">Georges Washington Lafayette</a>.

Lafayette worked with Benjamin Franklin to secure the promise of 6,000 soldiers to be sent to America, commanded by General <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20de%20Rochambeau">Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau</a>. Lafayette would resume his position as a major general of American forces, serving as liaison between Rochambeau and Washington, who would be in command of both nations' forces. In March 1780, he departed from <a href="Rochefort%20%28Charente-Maritime%29">Rochefort</a> for America aboard the frigate <a href="French%20frigate%20Hermione%20%281779%29">"Hermione"</a>, arriving in Boston on 27 April 1780.
On his return, Lafayette found the American cause at a low ebb, rocked by several military defeats, especially in the south. Lafayette was greeted in Boston with enthusiasm, seen as "a knight in shining armor from the chivalric past, come to save the nation". He journeyed southwest and on 10 May 1780 had a joyous reunion with Washington at <a href="Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morristown, New Jersey</a>. The general and his officers were delighted to hear that the large French force promised to Lafayette would be coming to their aid. Washington, aware of Lafayette's popularity, had him write (with <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> to correct his spelling) to state officials to urge them to provide more troops and provisions to the Continental Army. This bore fruit in the coming months, as Lafayette awaited the arrival of the French fleet. However, when the fleet arrived, there were fewer men and supplies than expected, and Rochambeau decided to wait for reinforcements before seeking battle with the British. This was unsatisfactory to Lafayette, who proposed grandiose schemes for the taking of New York City and other areas, and Rochambeau briefly refused to receive Lafayette until the young man apologized. Washington counseled the marquis to be patient.
That summer Washington placed Lafayette in charge of a division of troops. The marquis spent lavishly on his command, which patrolled <a href="Northern%20New%20Jersey">Northern New Jersey</a> and adjacent New York State. Lafayette saw no significant action, and in November, Washington disbanded the division, sending the soldiers back to their state regiments. The war continued badly for the Americans, with most battles in the south going against them, and General <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> abandoning them for the British side.

Lafayette spent the first part of the winter of 1780–81 in Philadelphia, where the <a href="American%20Philosophical%20Society">American Philosophical Society</a> elected him its first foreign member. Congress asked him to return to France to lobby for more men and supplies, but Lafayette refused, sending letters instead.

After the Continental victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cowpens">Battle of Cowpens</a> in South Carolina in January 1781, Washington ordered Lafayette to re-form his force in Philadelphia and go south to Virginia to link up with troops commanded by <a href="Baron%20von%20Steuben">Baron von Steuben</a>. The combined force was to try to trap British forces commanded by Benedict Arnold, with French ships preventing his escape by sea. If Lafayette was successful, Arnold was to be summarily hanged. British command of the seas prevented the plan, though Lafayette and a small part of his force (the rest left behind in Annapolis) was able to reach von Steuben in <a href="Yorktown%2C%20Virginia">Yorktown, Virginia</a>. Von Steuben sent a plan to Washington, proposing to use land forces and French ships to trap the main British force under <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Lord Cornwallis</a>. When he received no new orders from Washington, Lafayette began to move his troops north toward Philadelphia, only to be ordered to Virginia to assume military command there. An outraged Lafayette assumed he was being abandoned in a backwater while decisive battles took place elsewhere, and objected to his orders in vain. He also sent letters to <a href="Anne-C%C3%A9sar%2C%20Chevalier%20de%20la%20Luzerne">the Chevalier de la Luzerne</a>, French ambassador in Philadelphia, describing how ill-supplied his troops were. As Lafayette hoped, la Luzerne sent his letter on to France with a recommendation of massive French aid, which, after being approved by the king, would play a crucial part in the battles to come. Washington, fearing a letter might be captured by the British, could not tell Lafayette that he planned to trap Cornwallis in a decisive campaign.

Lafayette evaded Cornwallis' attempts to capture him in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>. In June 1781, Cornwallis received orders from London to proceed to the Chesapeake Bay and to oversee construction of a port, in preparation for an overland attack on Philadelphia. As the British column traveled, Lafayette sent small squads that would appear unexpectedly, attacking the <a href="rear%20guard">rear guard</a> or foraging parties, and giving the impression that his forces were larger than they were.

On 4 July, the British left <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a> and prepared to cross the <a href="James%20River%20%28Virginia%29">James River</a>. Cornwallis sent only an advance guard to the south side of the river, hiding many of his other troops in the forest on the north side, hoping to ambush Lafayette. On 6 July, Lafayette ordered General "Mad" <a href="Anthony%20Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a> to strike British troops on the north side with roughly 800 soldiers. Wayne found himself vastly outnumbered, and, instead of retreating, led a bayonet charge. The charge bought time for the Americans, and the British did not pursue. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Green%20Spring">Battle of Green Spring</a> was a victory for Cornwallis, but the American army was bolstered by the display of courage by the men.

By August, Cornwallis had established the British at Yorktown, and Lafayette took up position on <a href="Malvern%20Hill">Malvern Hill</a>, stationing artillery surrounding the British, who were close to the <a href="York%20River%20%28Virginia%29">York River</a>, and who had orders to construct fortifications to protect the British ships in <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a>. Lafayette's containment trapped the British when the French fleet arrived and won the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Virginia%20Capes">Battle of the Virginia Capes</a>, depriving Cornwallis of naval protection. On 14 September 1781, Washington's forces joined Lafayette's. On 28 September, with the French fleet blockading the British, the combined forces laid <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">siege to Yorktown</a>. On 14 October, Lafayette's 400 men on the American right took <a href="Redoubt">Redoubt</a> 9 after Alexander Hamilton's forces had charged Redoubt 10 in hand-to-hand combat. These two redoubts were key to breaking the British defenses. After a failed British counter-attack, Cornwallis surrendered on 19 October 1781.

Yorktown was the last major land battle of the American Revolution, but the British still held several major port cities. Lafayette wanted to lead expeditions to capture them, but Washington felt that he would be more useful seeking additional naval support from France. Congress appointed him its advisor to America's envoys in Europe, Benjamin Franklin in Paris, <a href="John%20Jay">John Jay</a> in Madrid, and <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> in The Hague, instructing them "to communicate and agree on everything with him". It also sent Louis XVI an official letter of commendation on the marquis's behalf.

Lafayette left Boston for France on 18 December 1781 where he was welcomed as a hero, and he was received at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Palace of Versailles</a> on 22 January 1782. He witnessed the birth of his daughter, whom he named Marie-Antoinette Virginie upon Thomas Jefferson's recommendation. He was promoted to "<a href="mar%C3%A9chal%20de%20camp">maréchal de camp</a>", skipping numerous ranks, and he was made a Knight of the <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Louis">Order of Saint Louis</a>. He worked on a combined French and Spanish expedition against the British West Indies in 1782, as no formal peace treaty had yet been signed. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a> was signed between Great Britain and the United States in 1783, which made the expedition unnecessary; Lafayette took part in those negotiations.

Lafayette worked with Jefferson to establish trade agreements between the United States and France which aimed to reduce America's debt to France. He joined the French abolitionist group <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Friends%20of%20the%20Blacks">Society of the Friends of the Blacks</a> which advocated the end of the slave trade and equal rights for free blacks. He urged the emancipation of slaves and their establishment as tenant farmers in a 1783 letter to Washington, who was a slave owner. Washington declined to free his slaves, though he expressed interest in the young man's ideas, and Lafayette purchased a plantation in French Guiana to house the project.
Lafayette visited America in 1784–1785 where he enjoyed an enthusiastic welcome, visiting all the states. The trip included a visit to Washington's farm at Mount Vernon on 17 August. He addressed the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> where he called for "liberty of all mankind" and urged emancipation of slaves, and he urged the Pennsylvania Legislature to help form a federal union (the states were then bound by the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>). He visited the <a href="Mohawk%20Valley">Mohawk Valley</a> in New York to participate in peace negotiations with the Iroquois, some of whom he had met in 1778. He received an honorary degree from Harvard, a portrait of Washington from the city of Boston, and a bust from the state of Virginia. Maryland's legislature honored him by making him and his male heirs "natural born Citizens" of the state, which made him a natural-born citizen of the United States after the 1789 ratification of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">Constitution</a>. Lafayette later boasted that he had become an American citizen before the concept of French citizenship existed. Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Virginia also granted him citizenship.

Lafayette made the "Hôtel de La Fayette" in Paris's "rue de Bourbon" the headquarters of Americans there. Benjamin Franklin, John and Sarah Jay, and John and <a href="Abigail%20Adams">Abigail Adams</a> met there every Monday and dined in company with Lafayette's family and the liberal nobility, including <a href="Stanislas%20Marie%20Adelaide%2C%20comte%20de%20Clermont-Tonnerre">Clermont-Tonnerre</a> and <a href="Madame%20de%20Sta%C3%ABl">Madame de Staël</a>. Lafayette continued to work on lowering trade barriers in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and Jefferson in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to correct the injustices that Huguenots in France had endured since the revocation of the <a href="Edict%20of%20Nantes">Edict of Nantes</a> a century before.

On 29 December 1786, King Louis XVI called an <a href="Assembly%20of%20Notables">Assembly of Notables</a>, in response to <a href="Causes%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution">France's fiscal crisis</a>. The king appointed Lafayette to the body, which convened on 22 February 1787. In speeches, Lafayette decried those with connections at court who had profited from advance knowledge of government land purchases; he advocated reform. He called for a "truly national assembly", which represented the whole of France. Instead, the king chose to summon an <a href="Estates%20General%20of%201789">Estates General</a>, to convene in 1789. Lafayette was elected as a representative of the nobility (the <a href="Estates%20General%20%28France%29">Second Estate</a>) from <a href="Riom">Riom</a>. The Estates General, traditionally, cast one vote for each of the three Estates: clergy, nobility, and commons, meaning the much larger commons was generally outvoted.

The Estates General convened on 5 May 1789; debate began on whether the delegates should vote by head or by Estate. If by Estate, then the nobility and clergy would be able to outvote the commons; if by head, then the larger Third Estate could dominate. Before the meeting, as a member of the "Committee of Thirty", Lafayette agitated for voting by head, rather than estate. He could not get a majority of his own Estate to agree, but the clergy was willing to join with the commons, and on the 17th, the group declared itself the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28French%20Revolution%29">National Assembly</a>. The loyalist response was to lock out the group, including Lafayette, while those who had not supported the Assembly met inside. This action led to the <a href="Tennis%20Court%20Oath">Tennis Court Oath</a>, where the excluded members swore to not separate until a constitution was established. The Assembly continued to meet, and on 11 July 1789, Lafayette presented a draft of the "<a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a>" to the Assembly, written by himself in consultation with Jefferson. The next day, after the dismissal of Finance Minister <a href="Jacques%20Necker">Jacques Necker</a> (who was seen as a reformer), lawyer <a href="Camille%20Desmoulins">Camille Desmoulins</a> led an armed mob. The king had the royal army under the <a href="Victor-Fran%C3%A7ois%2C%202nd%20duc%20de%20Broglie">duc de Broglie</a> surround Paris. On 14 July, the fortress known as the <a href="Storming%20of%20the%20Bastille">Bastille was stormed</a> by the mob.

On 15 July, Lafayette was acclaimed commander-in-chief of the National Guard of France, an armed force established to maintain order under the control of the Assembly. Lafayette proposed the name and the symbol of the group: a blue, white, and red cockade. This combined the red and blue colors of the city of Paris with the royal white, and originated the French tricolor. He faced a difficult task as head of the Guard; the king and many loyalists considered him and his supporters to be little better than revolutionaries, whereas many commoners felt that he was helping the king to keep power.

The National Assembly approved the Declaration on 26 August, but the king rejected it on 2 October. Three days later, a Parisian crowd led by women fishmongers <a href="The%20March%20on%20Versailles">marched to Versailles</a> in response to the scarcity of bread. Members of the National Guard followed the march, with Lafayette reluctantly leading them. At Versailles, the king accepted the Assembly's votes on the Declaration, but refused requests to go to Paris, and the crowd broke into the palace at dawn. Lafayette took the royal family onto the palace balcony and attempted to restore order, but the crowd insisted that the king and his family move to Paris and the <a href="Tuileries%20Palace">Tuileries Palace</a>. The king came onto the balcony and the crowd started chanting ""Vive le Roi!"" <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> then appeared with her children, but she was told to send the children back in. She returned alone and people shouted to shoot her, but she stood her ground and no one opened fire. Lafayette kissed her hand, leading to cheers from the crowd.
As leader of the National Guard, Lafayette attempted to maintain order and steer a middle ground, even as the radicals gained increasing influence. He and Paris' mayor <a href="Jean%20Sylvain%20Bailly">Jean Sylvain Bailly</a> instituted a political club on 12 May 1790 called the <a href="Society%20of%201789">Society of 1789</a> whose intention was to provide balance to the influence of the radical <a href="Jacobin%20%28politics%29">Jacobins</a>. Lafayette took the civic oath on the <a href="Champs%20de%20Mars">Champs de Mars</a> on 14 July 1790 before a huge assembly at the <a href="F%C3%AAte%20de%20la%20F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration">Fête de la Fédération</a>, vowing to "be ever faithful to the nation, to the law, and to the king; to support with our utmost power the constitution decreed by the National Assembly, and accepted by the king." That oath was also taken by his troops and by the king.

Lafayette continued to work for order in the coming months. He and part of the National Guard left the Tuileries on 28 February 1791 to handle a conflict in Vincennes, and hundreds of armed nobles arrived at the Tuileries to defend the king while he was gone. However, there were rumors that these nobles had come to take the king away and place him at the head of a counter-revolution. Lafayette quickly returned to the Tuileries and disarmed the nobles after a brief standoff. The event came to be known as the <a href="Day%20of%20Daggers">Day of Daggers</a>, and it boosted Lafayette's popularity with the French people for his quick actions to protect the king. Nonetheless, the royal family were increasingly prisoners in their palace. The National Guard disobeyed Lafayette on 18 April and prevented the king from leaving for Saint-Cloud where he planned to attend Mass.

A plot known as the <a href="Flight%20to%20Varennes">Flight to Varennes</a> almost enabled the king to escape from France on 20 June 1791. Lafayette had been responsible for the royal family's custody as leader of the National Guard, and he was thus blamed by extremists such as <a href="Georges%20Danton">Georges Danton</a> and called a traitor to the people by <a href="Maximilien%20Robespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a>. These accusations made Lafayette appear a royalist, damaged his reputation in the eyes of the public, and strengthened the hands of the Jacobins and other radicals. He continued to urge the constitutional rule of law, but he was drowned out by the mob and its leaders.
Lafayette's public standing continued to decline through the latter half of 1791. The radical <a href="Cordelier">Cordelier</a>s organized an event at the Champ de Mars on 17 July to gather signatures on a petition to the National Assembly that it either abolish the monarchy or allow its fate to be decided in a referendum. The assembled crowd was estimated approximately 10,000, and they hanged two men believed to be spies. Lafayette rode into the Champ de Mars at the head of his troops to restore order, but they were met with gunshots and stones. When a dragoon went down, the soldiers <a href="Champ%20de%20Mars%20massacre">fired on the crowd</a>, wounding and killing dozens. Martial law was declared, and the leaders of the mob fled and went into hiding, such as Danton and <a href="Jean-Paul%20Marat">Jean-Paul Marat</a>. His reputation among the common people suffered dramatically after the massacre, as they believed that he sympathized with royal interests. Immediately after the massacre, a crowd of rioters attacked Lafayette's home and attempted to harm his wife. The Assembly finalized a constitution in September, and Lafayette resigned from the National Guard in early October, with a semblance of constitutional law restored.

Lafayette returned to his home province of Auvergne in October 1791. France declared <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">war on Austria</a> on 20 April 1792, and preparations to invade the <a href="Southern%20Netherlands">Austrian Netherlands</a> (today's Belgium) began. Lafayette, who had been promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> on 30 June 1791, received command of one of the three armies, the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Centre">Army of the Centre</a>, based at Metz, on 14 December 1791. Lafayette did his best to mold inductees and National Guardsmen into a cohesive fighting force, but found that many of his troops were Jacobin sympathizers and hated their superior officers. This emotion was common in the army, as demonstrated after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marquain">Battle of Marquain</a>, when the routed French troops dragged <a href="Th%C3%A9obald%20Dillon">their leader</a> to <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, where he was torn to pieces by the mob. One of the army commanders, Rochambeau, resigned. Lafayette, along with the third commander, <a href="Nicolas%20Luckner">Nicolas Luckner</a>, asked the Assembly to begin peace talks, concerned at what might happen if the troops saw another battle.

In June 1792, Lafayette criticized the growing influence of the radicals through a letter to the Assembly from his field post, and ended his letter by calling for their parties to be "closed down by force". He misjudged his timing, for the radicals were in full control in Paris. Lafayette went there, and on 28 June delivered a fiery speech before the Assembly denouncing the Jacobins and other radical groups. He was instead accused of deserting his troops. Lafayette called for volunteers to counteract the Jacobins; when only a few people showed up, he understood the public mood and hastily left Paris. Robespierre called him a traitor and the mob burned him in effigy. He was transferred to command of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20North%20%28France%29">Army of the North</a> on 12 July 1792.

The 25 July <a href="Brunswick%20Manifesto">Brunswick Manifesto</a>, which warned that Paris would be destroyed by the Austrians and Prussians if the king was harmed, led to the downfall of Lafayette, and of the royal family. A mob attacked the Tuileries on 10 August, and the king and queen were imprisoned at the Assembly, then taken to the <a href="Temple%20%28Paris%29">Temple</a>. The Assembly abolished the monarchy—the king and queen would be beheaded in the coming months. On 14 August, the minister of justice, Danton, put out a warrant for Lafayette's arrest. Hoping to travel to the United States, Lafayette entered the <a href="Austrian%20Netherlands">Austrian Netherlands</a>, the area of present <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>.

Lafayette was taken prisoner by the Austrians near <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Belgium">Rochefort</a> when another former French officer, <a href="Jean-Xavier%20Bureau%20de%20Pusy">Jean-Xavier Bureau de Pusy</a>, asked for rights of transit through Austrian territory on behalf of a group of French officers. This was initially granted, as it had been for others fleeing France, but was revoked when the famous Lafayette was recognized. <a href="Frederick%20William%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William II</a> of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, Austria's ally against France, had once received Lafayette, but that was before the French Revolution—the king now saw him as a dangerous fomenter of rebellion, to be interned to prevent him from overthrowing other monarchies.

Lafayette was held at <a href="Nivelles">Nivelles</a>, then transferred to <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> where a coalition <a href="military%20tribunal">military tribunal</a> declared him, de Pusy, and two others to be prisoners of state for their roles in the Revolution. The tribunal ordered them held until a restored French king could render final judgment on them. On 12 September 1792, pursuant to the tribunal's order, the prisoners were transferred to Prussian custody. The party traveled to the Prussian fortress-city of <a href="Wesel">Wesel</a>, where the Frenchmen remained in verminous individual cells in the <a href="Wesel%20citadel">central citadel</a> from 19 September to 22 December 1792. When victorious French revolutionary troops began to threaten the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, King Frederick William II transferred the prisoners east to the citadel at <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>, where they remained an entire year, from 4 January 1793 to 4 January 1794.

Frederick William decided that he could gain little by continuing to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, and that there were easier pickings for his army in the <a href="Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland">Kingdom of Poland</a>. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic and turned the state prisoners back over to his erstwhile coalition partner, the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> Austrian monarch <a href="Francis%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today <a href="Nysa%2C%20Poland">Nysa, Poland</a>) in <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>. On 17 May 1794, they were taken across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a> (today <a href="Olomouc">Olomouc</a> in the Czech Republic).

Lafayette, when captured, had tried to use the American citizenship he had been granted to secure his release, and contacted <a href="William%20Short%20%28American%20ambassador%29">William Short</a>, United States minister in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>. Although Short and other U.S. envoys very much wanted to succor Lafayette for his services to their country, they knew that his status as a French officer took precedence over any claim to American citizenship. Washington, who was by then president, had instructed the envoys to avoid actions that entangled the country in European affairs, and the U.S. did not have diplomatic relations with either Prussia or Austria. They did send money for the use of Lafayette, and for his wife, whom the French had imprisoned. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> Jefferson found a loophole allowing Lafayette to be paid, with interest, for his services as a major general from 1777 to 1783. An act was rushed through <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> and signed by President Washington. These funds allowed both Lafayettes privileges in their captivity.

A more direct means of aiding the former general was an escape attempt sponsored by Alexander Hamilton's sister-in-law <a href="Angelica%20Schuyler%20Church">Angelica Schuyler Church</a> and her husband <a href="John%20Barker%20Church">John Barker Church</a>, a British Member of Parliament who had served in the Continental Army. They hired as agent a young <a href="Electorate%20of%20Hanover">Hanoverian</a> physician, Justus Erich Bollmann, who acquired an assistant, a South Carolinian medical student named <a href="Francis%20Kinloch%20Huger">Francis Kinloch Huger</a>. This was the son of Benjamin Huger, whom Lafayette had stayed with upon his first arrival in America. With their help, Lafayette managed to escape from an escorted carriage drive in the countryside outside Olmütz, but he lost his way and was recaptured.
Once Adrienne was released from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, obtained passports for her and her daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> for an audience with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who had endured harsh solitary confinement since his escape attempt a year before, was astounded when soldiers opened his prison door to usher in his wife and daughters on 15 October 1795. The family spent the next two years in confinement together.

Through diplomacy, the press, and personal appeals, Lafayette's sympathizers on both sides of the Atlantic made their influence felt, most importantly on the post-<a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> French government. A young, victorious general, <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> Bonaparte, negotiated the release of the state prisoners at Olmütz, as a result of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Campo%20Formio">Treaty of Campo Formio</a>. Lafayette's captivity of over five years thus came to an end. The Lafayette family and their comrades in captivity left Olmütz under Austrian escort early on the morning of 19 September 1797, crossed the <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n-<a href="Saxony">Saxonian</a> border north of <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, and were officially turned over to the American consul in Hamburg on 4 October.

From Hamburg, Lafayette sent a note of thanks to General Bonaparte. The French government, the <a href="French%20Directory">Directorate</a>, was unwilling to have Lafayette return unless he swore allegiance, which he was not willing to do, as he believed it had come to power by unconstitutional means. As revenge, it had his remaining properties sold, leaving him a pauper. The family, soon joined by Georges Washington, who had returned from America, recuperated on a property near Hamburg belonging to Adrienne's aunt. Due to <a href="Quasi-War">conflict between the United States and France</a>, Lafayette could not go to America as he had hoped, making him a man without a country.

Adrienne was able to go to Paris, and attempted to secure her husband's repatriation, flattering Bonaparte, who had returned to France after more victories. After Bonaparte's "coup d'état" of <a href="18%20Brumaire">18 Brumaire</a> (9 November 1799), Lafayette used the confusion caused by the change of regime to slip into France with a passport in the name of "Motier". Bonaparte expressed rage, but Adrienne was convinced he was simply posing, and proposed to him that Lafayette would pledge his support, then would retire from public life to a property she had reclaimed, <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20la%20Grange-Bl%C3%A9neau">La Grange</a>. France's new ruler allowed Lafayette to remain, though originally without citizenship and subject to summary arrest if he engaged in politics, with the promise of eventual restoration of civil rights. Lafayette remained quietly at La Grange, and when Bonaparte held a memorial service in Paris for Washington, who had died in December 1799, Lafayette was not invited, nor was his name mentioned.

Bonaparte restored Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800 and he was able to recover some of his properties. France's ruler also offered to make him minister to the United States, but Lafayette would not have anything to do with Napoleon's government and firmly refused. In 1802, he was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint him to the Senate and to bestow the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honor">Legion of Honor</a> upon him, but Lafayette declined—though he stated that he would gladly have accepted the honors from a democratic government.

In 1804, Bonaparte was crowned the Emperor Napoleon after a <a href="plebiscite">plebiscite</a> in which Lafayette did not participate. The retired general remained relatively quiet, although he made Bastille Day addresses. After the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>, President Jefferson asked him if he would be interested in the governorship, but Lafayette declined, citing personal problems and his desire to work for liberty in France.

During a trip to Auvergne in 1807, Adrienne became ill, suffering from complications stemming from her time in prison. She became delirious but recovered enough on Christmas Eve to gather the family around her bed and to say to Lafayette: ""Je suis toute à vous"" ("I am all yours"). She died the next day. In the years after her death, Lafayette mostly remained quietly at La Grange, as Napoleon's power in Europe waxed and then waned. Many influential people and members of the public visited him, especially Americans. He wrote many letters, especially to Jefferson, and exchanged gifts as he had once done with Washington.

In 1814, the <a href="Sixth%20Coalition">coalition</a> that opposed Napoleon invaded France and restored the monarchy; the comte de <a href="County%20of%20Provence">Provence</a> (brother of the executed Louis XVI) took the throne as <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">Louis XVIII</a>. Lafayette was received by the new king, but the staunch republican opposed the new, highly restrictive franchise for the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28France%29">Chamber of Deputies</a> that granted the vote to only 90,000 men in a nation of 25 million. Lafayette did not stand for election in 1814, remaining at La Grange.

There was discontent in France among demobilized soldiers and others. Napoleon had been exiled only as far as <a href="Elba">Elba</a>, an island in the Tuscan archipelago; seeing an opportunity, he landed at Cannes on 1 March 1815 with a few hundred followers. Frenchmen flocked to his banner, and he took Paris later that month, causing Louis to flee to <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>. Lafayette refused Napoleon's call to serve in the new government, but accepted election to the new <a href="Chambre%20des%20repr%C3%A9sentants%20de%20France">Chamber of Representatives</a> under the <a href="Charter%20of%201815">Charter of 1815</a>. There, after Napoleon's defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, Lafayette called for his abdication. Responding to the emperor's brother <a href="Lucien%20Bonaparte">Lucien</a>, Lafayette argued:

By what right do you dare accuse the nation of  ... want of perseverance in the emperor's interest? The nation has followed him on the fields of Italy, across the sands of Egypt and the plains of Germany, across the frozen deserts of Russia.  ... The nation has followed him in fifty battles, in his defeats and in his victories, and in doing so we have to mourn the blood of three million Frenchmen.

On 22 June 1815, four days after Waterloo, Napoleon abdicated. Lafayette arranged for the former emperor's passage to America, but the British prevented this, and Napoleon ended his days on the island of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>. The Chamber of Representatives, before it dissolved, appointed Lafayette to a peace commission that was ignored by the victorious allies who occupied much of France, with the Prussians taking over La Grange as a headquarters. Once the Prussians left in late 1815, Lafayette returned to his house, a private citizen again.

Lafayette's homes, both in Paris and at La Grange, were open to any Americans who wished to meet the hero of their Revolution, and to many other people besides. Among those whom Irish novelist <a href="Sydney%2C%20Lady%20Morgan">Sydney, Lady Morgan</a> met at table during her month-long stay at La Grange in 1818 were the Dutch painter <a href="Ary%20Scheffer">Ary Scheffer</a> and the historian <a href="Augustin%20Thierry">Augustin Thierry</a>, who sat alongside American tourists. Others who visited included philosopher <a href="Jeremy%20Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</a>, American scholar <a href="George%20Ticknor">George Ticknor</a>, and writer <a href="Fanny%20Wright">Fanny Wright</a>.

During the first decade of the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Bourbon Restoration</a>, Lafayette lent his support to a number of conspiracies in France and other European countries, all of which came to nothing. He was involved in the various <a href="Carbonari">Charbonnier</a> plots, and agreed to go to the city of <a href="Belfort">Belfort</a>, where there was a garrison of French troops, and assume a major role in the revolutionary government. Warned that the royal government had found out about the conspiracy, he turned back on the road to Belfort, avoiding overt involvement. More successfully, he supported the <a href="Greek%20Revolution">Greek Revolution</a> beginning in 1821, and by letter attempted to persuade American officials to ally with the Greeks. Louis' government considered arresting both Lafayette and Georges Washington, who was also involved in the Greek efforts, but were wary of the political ramifications if they did. Lafayette remained a member of the restored Chamber of Deputies until 1823, when new plural voting rules helped defeat his bid for re-election.

President James Monroe and Congress invited Lafayette to visit the United States in 1824, in part to celebrate the nation's upcoming 50th anniversary. Monroe intended to have Lafayette travel on an American warship, but Lafayette felt that having such a vessel as transport was undemocratic and booked passage on a merchantman. Louis XVIII did not approve of the trip and had troops disperse the crowd that gathered at <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> to see him off.

<a href="Lafayette%20Welcoming%20Parade%20of%201824%20%28New%20York%29">Lafayette arrived at New York</a> on 15 August 1824, accompanied by his son Georges Washington and his secretary <a href="Auguste%20Levasseur">Auguste Levasseur</a>. He was greeted by a group of Revolutionary War veterans who had fought alongside him many years before. New York erupted for four continuous days and nights of celebration. He then departed for what he thought would be a restful trip to Boston but instead found the route lined by cheering citizens, with welcomes organized in every town along the way. According to Unger, "It was a mystical experience they would relate to their heirs through generations to come. Lafayette had materialized from a distant age, the last leader and hero at the nation's defining moment. They knew they and the world would never see his kind again."

New York, Boston, and <a href="Lafayette%20Welcoming%20Parade%20of%201824%20%28Philadelphia%29">Philadelphia</a> did their best to outdo each other in the celebrations honoring Lafayette. Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today <a href="Independence%20Hall">Independence Hall</a>) which might otherwise have been torn down, because they needed a location for a reception to him. Until that point, it had not been usual in the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit set off a wave of construction—usually with him laying the cornerstone himself, in his capacity as mason. The arts benefited by his visit, as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original 13 states during a four-month visit, but the stay stretched to 16 months as he visited all 24 states.

The towns and cities that he visited gave him enthusiastic welcomes, including <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fayetteville, North Carolina</a>, the first city named in his honor. He visited the capital in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington City</a>, and was surprised by the simple clothing worn by President Monroe and the lack of any guards around the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. He went to Mount Vernon in Virginia as he had 40 years before, this time viewing Washington's grave. He was at Yorktown on 19 October 1824 for the anniversary of Cornwallis's surrender, then journeyed to <a href="Monticello">Monticello</a> to meet with his old friend Jefferson—and Jefferson's successor <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, who arrived unexpectedly. He had also dined with 89-year-old John Adams at his home near Boston, who was the other living former president.

With the roads becoming impassable, Lafayette stayed in Washington City for the winter of 1824–25, and thus was there for the climax of the hotly contested 1824 election in which no presidential candidate was able to secure a majority of the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives. On 9 February 1825, the House selected Secretary of State <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> as president; that evening, runner-up General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> shook hands with Adams at the White House as Lafayette looked on.

In March 1825, Lafayette began to tour the southern and western states. The general pattern of the trip was that he would be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager to be seen with him. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set aside for the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.
Lafayette visited General Jackson at his home <a href="The%20Hermitage%20%28Nashville%2C%20Tennessee%29">The Hermitage</a> in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. He was traveling up the Ohio River by steamboat when the vessel sank beneath him, and he was put in a lifeboat by his son and secretary, then taken to the Kentucky shore and rescued by another steamboat that was going in the other direction. Its captain insisted on turning around, however, and taking Lafayette to <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>. From there, he went generally northeast, viewing <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a> and taking the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a> to Albany, considered a modern marvel. He laid the cornerstone of the <a href="Bunker%20Hill%20Monument">Bunker Hill Monument</a> in Massachusetts in June 1825 after hearing an oration by <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>. He also took some soil from Bunker Hill to be sprinkled on his grave.

After Bunker Hill, Lafayette went to Maine and Vermont, thus visiting all of the states. He met again with John Adams, then went back to New York and then to <a href="History%20of%20Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, where he laid the cornerstone for its public library. He celebrated his 68th birthday on 6 September at a reception with President John Quincy Adams at the White House, and departed the next day. He took gifts with him, besides the soil to be placed on his grave. Congress had voted him $200,000 in gratitude for his services to the country at President Monroe's request, along with a large tract of public lands in Florida. He returned to France aboard a ship that was originally called the "Susquehanna" but was renamed the <a href="USS%20Brandywine%20%281825%29">USS "Brandywine"</a> in honor of the battle where he shed his blood for the United States.

When Lafayette arrived in France, Louis XVIII had been dead about a year and Charles X was on the throne. As king, Charles intended to restore the absolute rule of the monarch, and his decrees had already prompted protest by the time Lafayette arrived. Lafayette was the most prominent of those who opposed the king. In the elections of 1827, the 70-year-old Lafayette was elected to the Chamber of Deputies again. Unhappy at the outcome, Charles dissolved the Chamber, and ordered a new election: Lafayette again won his seat.

Lafayette remained outspoken against Charles' restrictions on civil liberties and the newly introduced censorship of the press. He made fiery speeches in the Chamber, denouncing the new decrees and advocating American-style representative government. He hosted dinners at La Grange, for Americans, Frenchmen, and others; all came to hear his speeches on politics, freedom, rights, and liberty. He was popular enough that Charles felt he could not be safely arrested, but Charles' spies were thorough: one government agent noted "his [Lafayette's] seditious toasts  ... in honor of American liberty".

On 25 July 1830, the king signed the <a href="Ordinances%20of%20Saint-Cloud">Ordinances of Saint-Cloud</a>, removing the franchise from the middle class and dissolving the Chamber of Deputies. The decrees were published the following day. On 27 July, Parisians erected barricades throughout the city, and riots erupted. In defiance, the Chamber continued to meet. When Lafayette, who was at La Grange, heard what was going on, he raced into the city, and was acclaimed as a leader of the revolution. When his fellow deputies were indecisive, Lafayette went to the barricades, and soon the royalist troops were routed. Fearful that the excesses of the 1789 revolution were about to be repeated, deputies made Lafayette head of a restored National Guard, and charged him with keeping order. The Chamber was willing to proclaim him as ruler, but he refused a grant of power he deemed unconstitutional. He also refused to deal with Charles, who abdicated on 2 August. Many young revolutionaries sought a republic, but Lafayette felt this would lead to civil war, and chose to offer the throne to the duc d'Orleans, <a href="Louis-Philippe">Louis-Philippe</a>, who had lived in America and had far more of a common touch than did Charles. Lafayette secured the agreement of Louis-Philippe, who accepted the throne, to various reforms. The general remained as commander of the National Guard. This did not last long—the brief concord at the king's accession soon faded, and the conservative majority in the Chamber voted to abolish Lafayette's National Guard post on 24 December 1830. Lafayette went back into retirement, expressing his willingness to do so.

Lafayette grew increasingly disillusioned with Louis-Phillippe, who backtracked on reforms and denied his promises to make them. The retired general angrily broke with his king, a breach which widened when the government used force to suppress a strike in <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>. Lafayette used his seat in the Chamber to promote liberal proposals, and his neighbors elected him mayor of the village of La Grange and to the council of the "département" of <a href="Seine-et-Marne">Seine-et-Marne</a> in 1831. The following year, he served as a pallbearer and spoke at the funeral of General <a href="Jean%20Maximilien%20Lamarque">Jean Maximilien Lamarque</a>, another opponent of Louis-Phillippe. He pleaded for calm, but there were riots in the streets and a barricade was erected at the <a href="Place%20de%20la%20Bastille">Place de la Bastille</a>. The king forcefully crushed this <a href="June%20Rebellion">June Rebellion</a>, to Lafayette's outrage. He returned to La Grange until the Chamber met in November 1832, when he condemned Louis-Phillippe for introducing censorship, as Charles X had.
Lafayette spoke publicly for the last time in the Chamber of Deputies on 3 January 1834. The next month, he collapsed at a funeral from pneumonia. He recovered, but the following May was wet, and he became bedridden after being caught in a thunderstorm. He died at age 76 on 20 May 1834 on "6 rue d'Anjou-Saint-Honoré "in Paris (now 8 "rue d'Anjou" in the <a href="8th%20arrondissement%20of%20Paris">8th arrondissement of Paris</a>). He was buried next to his wife at the <a href="Picpus%20Cemetery">Picpus Cemetery</a> under soil from Bunker Hill, which his son Georges Washington sprinkled upon him. King Louis-Philippe ordered a military funeral in order to keep the public from attending, and crowds formed to protest their exclusion.

In the United States, President Jackson ordered that Lafayette receive the same memorial honors that had been bestowed on Washington at his death in December 1799. Both Houses of Congress were draped in black bunting for 30 days, and members wore mourning badges. Congress urged Americans to follow similar mourning practices. Later that year, former president John Quincy Adams gave a eulogy of Lafayette that lasted three hours, calling him "high on the list of the pure and disinterested benefactors of mankind".

Lafayette was a firm believer in a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National Assembly work with a monarch, as France always had. His close relationships to American Founding Fathers such as <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and Thomas Jefferson gave him the ability to witness the implementation of a democratic system. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American form of government, which was in turn influenced by the British form of government. For example, Lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins, however, detested the idea of a monarchy in France, which led the National Assembly to vote against it. This idea contributed to his fall from favor, especially when <a href="Maximilien%20Robespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a> took power.

Lafayette was the author of the <a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a> in 1789 and a staunch opponent of slavery. His work never specifically mentioned slavery, but he made his position clear on the controversial topic through letters addressed to friends and colleagues such as Washington and Jefferson. He proposed that slaves not be owned but rather work as free tenants on the land of plantation owners, and he bought a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne in 1785 to put his ideas into practice, ordering that no slaves be bought or sold. He spent his lifetime as an abolitionist, proposing that slaves be emancipated slowly and recognizing the crucial role that slavery played in many economies. Lafayette hoped that his ideas would be adopted by Washington in order to free the slaves in the United States and spread from there, and his efforts were not in vain, as Washington eventually began implementing those practices on his own plantation in Mount Vernon—though he freed no slaves in his lifetime. Lafayette's grandson Gustave de Beaumont later wrote a novel discussing the issues of racism. Lafayette played a significant role in the abolition of slavery in France in 1794, as riots had erupted in Haiti because of the circulation two years earlier of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.

Throughout his life, Lafayette was an exponent of the ideals of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>, especially on <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> and <a href="civic%20nationalism">civic nationalism</a>. Despite the fact that he spent most of his political career in opposition, his views were taken very seriously by intellectuals and others on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the United States, Lafayette's image, from the time of the American Revolution, derived from his "disinterestedness" in fighting, without pay, for the freedom of a country not his own. As <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a> praised Lafayette, in "foregoing the pleasures of Enjoyment of domestick Life and exposing himself to the Hardship and Dangers" of war, he fought "in the glorious cause of freedom". This view was shared by many contemporaries, establishing an image of Lafayette seeking to advance, not the national interest of one country or another, but the liberty of all mankind. As Lafayette took on his roles in the French Revolution, he gained a new role in American eyes: that of an advocate for the virtues of the American republic, seeking to transport them from New World to Old. This was reinforced by his position as surrogate son and disciple of George Washington, who was deemed the <a href="Father%20of%20the%20Nation">Father of His Country</a> and the embodiment of the American experiment.

Lafayette became an American icon in part because he was not associated with any particular region of the country: he was of foreign birth, did not live in America, and had fought in New England, the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, and the South. Thus, he was a unifying figure. His role in the French Revolution, in which he was seen by Americans as steering a middle course, enhanced this popularity. Americans were naturally sympathetic to a republican cause, but also remembered Louis XVI as a friend of the nascent United States. When Lafayette fell from power in 1792, Americans tended to blame factionalism for the ouster of a man who was, in their eyes, above such things.

In 1824, Lafayette returned to the United States at a time when Americans were questioning the success of the republican experiment in view of the disastrous economic <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a> and the <a href="Sectionalism">sectional</a> conflict resulting in the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a>. Lafayette's hosts considered him a judge of how successful the experiment had been. According to cultural historian Lloyd Kramer, Lafayette (as well as a later visitor to America, <a href="Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a>) "provided foreign confirmations of the self-image that shaped America's national identity in the early nineteenth century and that has remained a dominant theme in the national ideology ever since: the belief that America's Founding Fathers, institutions, and freedom created the most democratic, egalitarian, and prosperous society in the world".

Historian Gilbert Chinard wrote in 1936: "Lafayette became a legendary figure and a symbol so early in his life, and successive generations have so willingly accepted the myth, that any attempt to deprive the young hero of his republican halo will probably be considered as little short of iconoclastic and sacrilegious." That legend has been used politically: the name and image of Lafayette were repeatedly invoked in 1917 in seeking to gain popular support for America's entry into <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a>, culminating in the famous phrase, "Lafayette, we are here". This occurred at some cost to Lafayette's image in America: veterans returned from the front singing "We've paid our debt to Lafayette, who the hell do we owe now?" A longer-term threat was the increasing sophistication of Americans and the lessened need for symbols of patriotism; by 1971, according to Anne C. Loveland, "Lafayette no longer served as a national hero-symbol." In 2002, however, Congress voted to grant Lafayette honorary citizenship.

Lafayette's reputation in France is more problematic. Thomas Gaines, in his book about Lafayette, noted that the response to Lafayette's death was far more muted in France than in America, and suggested that this may have been because Lafayette was the last surviving hero of America's only revolution, whereas the evolution of the French government has been far more chaotic. Lafayette's role, especially in the French Revolution, created a more nuanced picture of him in French <a href="Historiography%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution">historiography</a>. To the 19th-century historian <a href="Jules%20Michelet">Jules Michelet</a>, Lafayette was a "mediocre idol", lifted by the mob far beyond what his talents deserved. In their "Histoire et dictionnaire de la Révolution française", <a href="Jean%20Tulard">Jean Tulard</a>, Jean-François Fayard, and Alfred Fierro noted Napoleon's deathbed comment about Lafayette that, if Napoleon had had Lafayette's place during the French Revolution, "the king would still be sitting on his throne". They called Napoleon's comment "not too excessive" and deemed Lafayette "an empty-headed political dwarf [and] one of the people most responsible for the destruction of the French monarchy". Gaines disagreed, and noted that liberal and <a href="Marxist%20historiography">Marxist historians</a> have also dissented from that view of Lafayette. As Lloyd Kramer related in a survey of the French public, just before the Revolution's bicentennial in 1989, 57 percent deemed Lafayette the figure from the Revolution they most admired, with Marat and <a href="Louis%20Antoine%20de%20Saint-Just">Saint-Just</a> tying for second with 21 percent each: "he [Lafayette] clearly had more French supporters in the early 1990s than he could muster in the early 1790s".

Marc Leepson concluded his study of Lafayette's life:

Black Francis

Charles Thompson IV (born April 6, 1965) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He is best known as the frontman of the influential <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, with whom he performs under the stage name Black Francis. Following the band's breakup in 1993, he embarked on a solo career under the name Frank Black. After releasing two albums with record label <a href="4AD">4AD</a> and one with <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28record%20label%29">American Recordings</a>, he left the label and formed a new band, Frank Black and the Catholics. He re-adopted the name Black Francis in 2007.

His vocal style has varied from a screaming, yowling delivery as lead vocalist of the Pixies to a more measured and melodic style in his solo career. His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a>, <a href="incest">incest</a>, and <a href="Bible">biblical</a> violence, along with science fiction and <a href="surf%20culture">surf culture</a>. His use of atypical <a href="Time%20signature">meter signature</a>s, loud–quiet dynamics, and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording during his time with the Catholics, give him a distinct style within <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>.

As frontman of the Pixies, his songs (such as "<a href="Where%20Is%20My%20Mind%3F">Where Is My Mind?</a>" and "<a href="Debaser">Debaser</a>") received praise and citations from contemporaries, including <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s <a href="Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</a> and <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>'s <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>. Thompson regrouped the Pixies in early 2004 and continues to release solo records and tour as a solo artist.

Charles Thompson was born in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. His father was a bar owner, and Thompson lived in Los Angeles, California, as a baby because his father wanted to "learn more about the restaurant and bar business." Thompson was introduced to music at a young age, as his parents listened to 1960s <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a>. His first guitar was his mother's, a <a href="Yamaha">Yamaha</a> classical guitar bought with money from his father's bar tips, which he started to play at age "11 or 12."

Thompson's family moved around, first with his father, and then his stepfather, a religious man who "pursued real estate on both coasts"; his parents had separated twice by the time he was in first grade. When Thompson was 12, his mother and stepfather joined an evangelical church that was tied to the Pentecostal denomination <a href="General%20Council%20of%20the%20Assemblies%20of%20God%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Assemblies of God</a>, a move that influenced many of his songs written with the Pixies, which often refer to the Bible.

He discovered the music of <a href="Christian%20rock">Christian rock</a> singer-songwriter <a href="Larry%20Norman">Larry Norman</a> at 13 when Norman played at a religious <a href="summer%20camp">summer camp</a> that Thompson attended. Norman's music influenced Thompson to the extent that he named the Pixies' first <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> and a lyric in the band's song "Levitate Me" after one of Norman's catchphrases, "<a href="Come%20On%20Pilgrim">Come on, pilgrim</a>!" Thompson later described the music he listened to during his youth:

Thompson lived in an apartment in <a href="Marblehead%2C%20Massachusetts">Marblehead, Massachusetts</a>. Just before his senior year, his family moved to <a href="Westport%2C%20Massachusetts">Westport, Massachusetts</a>, where he received a "Teenager of the Year" award—the title of a later <a href="Teenager%20of%20the%20Year%20%28album%29">solo album</a>. During this time, Thompson composed several songs that appeared in his later career, including "<a href="Here%20Comes%20Your%20Man">Here Comes Your Man</a>" from "<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle</a>," and "Velvety Instrumental Version."

After graduating from high school in 1983, Thompson studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, majoring in <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>. Thompson shared a room with another roommate for a <a href="semester">semester</a> before moving in with future Pixies guitarist <a href="Joey%20Santiago">Joey Santiago</a>. The two shared an interest in rock music, and Santiago introduced Thompson to 1970s punk and the music of <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>; they began to jam together. It was at this time that Thompson discovered <a href="The%20Cars">The Cars</a>, a band he described as "very influential on me and the Pixies."

In his second year of college, Thompson embarked on a trip to <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>, as part of an <a href="Student%20exchange%20program">exchange program</a>. He spent six months in an apartment with a "weird, <a href="psychosis">psycho</a> roommate," who later served as a direct inspiration for the Pixies song "<a href="Crackity%20Jones">Crackity Jones</a>;" many of the band's early songs refer to Thompson's experiences in Puerto Rico. Thompson failed to learn to speak Spanish formally, and left his studies after debating whether he would go to New Zealand to view <a href="Halley%27s%20Comet">Halley's Comet</a> (he later said it "seemed like the cool romantic thing to do at the time"), or start a rock band. He wrote a letter urging Santiago, with the words "we gotta do it, now is the time Joe," to join him in a band upon his return to Boston.

Soon after returning to Massachusetts, Thompson dropped out of college, and moved to Boston with Santiago. He spent 1985 working in a warehouse, "managing buttons on <a href="teddy%20bear">teddy bear</a>s," composing songs on his <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>, and writing lyrics on the <a href="MBTA%20Subway">subway</a>. In January 1986, Thompson formed the Pixies with Santiago. Bassist <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a> was recruited a week later via a classified advertisement placed in a Boston paper, which requested a bassist "into <a href="H%C3%BCsker%20D%C3%BC">Hüsker Dü</a> and <a href="Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>." Drummer <a href="David%20Lovering">David Lovering</a> was later hired on recommendation from Deal's husband.

In 1987, the Pixies released an 18-track <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo tape</a>, commonly referred to as "<a href="Pixies%20%28EP%29">The Purple Tape</a>". Thompson's father assisted the band financially, loaning $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he was doing his best to make up for lost time." "The Purple Tape" led to a recording contract with the English independent record label <a href="4AD">4AD</a>. For the release of the mini album "<a href="Come%20On%20Pilgrim">Come On Pilgrim</a>", Thompson adopted the alias "Black Francis", a name inspired by his father: "he had been saving that name in case he had another son."

In 1988, the Pixies recorded their debut album "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>". Thompson wrote and sang on all the tracks, with the exception of the single "<a href="Gigantic%20%28song%29">Gigantic</a>," which was co-written and sung by Deal. To support the album, the band undertook a European tour, during which Thompson met <a href="Eric%20Drew%20Feldman">Eric Drew Feldman</a>, a later collaborator on Pixies and solo albums. "<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle</a>", with Thompson-penned songs such as "Debaser" and "<a href="Monkey%20Gone%20To%20Heaven">Monkey Gone To Heaven</a>," was released the following year to widespread critical acclaim. However, by this time, tensions between Thompson and Deal, combined with exhaustion, led the band to announce a hiatus. Thompson has an aversion to flying, and spent this time driving across America with his girlfriend, Jean Walsh (whom he had met in the band's early days), performing solo shows in order to raise funds to buy furniture for his new Los Angeles apartment.
The band reconvened in 1990, and recorded two further albums: 1990's "<a href="Bossanova">Bossanova</a>" and 1991's "<a href="Trompe%20le%20Monde">Trompe le Monde</a>"; the latter was Thompson's first collaboration with Feldman. The later Pixies albums were characterized by Thompson's increasing influence on the band's output, as well as a focus on <a href="science%20fiction%20themes">science fiction themes</a>, including <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">alien</a>s and <a href="UFOs">UFOs</a>. These themes would continue to be explored throughout his early solo work. "Trompe le Monde" includes the song "U-Mass," which was written about the university he attended as a youth, and due to the keyboard part played by Feldman, signified a move away from the band's alternative rock sound. Although Deal had contributed on the songs "Gigantic" (from "Surfer Rosa") and "Silver" (from "Doolittle"), from "Bossanova" on, Thompson wrote all the band's original material. This contributed to the increasing tension between him and Deal, and the Pixies broke up in 1992; this was not publicly announced until early 1993.

While the Pixies' 1991 album "Trompe le Monde" was being recorded, Thompson had discussions with the album's producer, <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a>, about a possible solo record. He told Norton he was keen to record again, even though he had no new material; as a result, the two decided on a <a href="Cover%20version">cover album</a>. However, by the time Thompson visited a recording studio again in 1992, he had "plenty of tunes and musical scraps."

He collaborated with Feldman to record new material; they began by trimming down the number of covers to one, <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a>' "<a href="Hang%20On%20to%20Your%20Ego">Hang On to Your Ego</a>". Feldman became the album's producer, and played keyboard and bass guitar on several songs, with Santiago featuring on lead guitar and <a href="Nick%20Vincent%20%28musician%29">Nick Vincent</a> on drums. Francis recorded the album during the hiatus and breakup of the Pixies in late 1992 and early 1993. He then adopted the stage name "Frank Black" (inverting his old persona "Black Francis") and released the results as "<a href="Frank%20Black%20%28album%29">Frank Black</a>" in March 1993. "Frank Black" was characterized by a focus on <a href="UFO">UFO</a>s and science fiction, although he explored other subjects, such as in "I Heard Ramona Sing", a song about the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a>. The album was similar in style, both musically and lyrically, to the Pixies' albums "Bossanova" and "Trompe le Monde". Feldman later said that the first record connected his solo career with "Trompe le Monde", "but at the same time it is an island, like nothing else he [Black] did."

The following year, Black released his second solo record, a 22-song double album entitled "<a href="Teenager%20of%20the%20Year%20%28album%29">Teenager of the Year</a>". "Teenager" included the song "Headache" (), a moderate success on alternative rock playlists; critics described the song as "irresistible <a href="pop%20music">pop</a>". The production of "Teenager of the Year" was markedly different from "Frank Black"; in the previous album, <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> templates were used when writing songs, but in "Teenager", Black showed individual parts to band members, the core of which included drummer Vincent and <a href="Lyle%20Workman">Lyle Workman</a> on lead guitar. Feldman noted that Thompson's songwriting became "a lot more spontaneous" while recording the album. Thompson had begun to stray from his style with the Pixies, writing songs that covered a variety of genres and topics, and his new-found method of recording was closer to later albums than that of "Frank Black" and "Trompe le Monde".

Both "Frank Black" and "Teenager of the Year" were critically well received, although they enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels <a href="4AD">4AD</a> and <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra</a>. In 1996, he released "<a href="The%20Cult%20of%20Ray">The Cult of Ray</a>" on <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>'s <a href="American%20Recordings%20%28US%29">American Recordings</a>; the album marked a turn away from the elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few <a href="overdub">overdub</a>s. His band for this album featured sole "Teenager" holdover <a href="Lyle%20Workman">Lyle Workman</a> on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods for the next several years.

Thompson dubbed his new band "Frank Black and the Catholics," and recorded their <a href="Frank%20Black%20and%20the%20Catholics%20%28album%29">eponymous first album</a> in 1997. Recorded live-to-two-track initially as merely a demo, he was so pleased with the results that he decided to release the sessions with no further production. The album was delayed for over a year by conflicts at American, both internal and over its production, and was ultimately released in late 1998 by <a href="SpinArt%20Records">SpinArt Records</a> in the US. Since leaving American, Black has avoided long-term contracts with labels, and has maintained ownership of his album masters, licensing each album individually for release.

"Frank Black and the Catholics" became the first album to be posted to the <a href="eMusic">eMusic</a> service; they claim it is "the first album ever made legally available for commercial download." Critical reception to the album was mixed, with some writers noting Thompson's seemingly deliberate turn away from the "quirkiness" of the Pixies and his early solo work for a self-consciously straightforward approach, and the "disappointingly straightforward <a href="punk-pop">punk-pop</a>" musical style present on the album.

He would continue to eschew <a href="multi-track%20recording">multi-track recording</a> for the live-to-two-track technique for all subsequent releases under the group name. Live-to-two-track recording precludes the use of overdubs to correct errors or add texture; all takes are recorded continuously, and mixing is done "on the fly." On later albums, he incorporated more musicians into the sessions to allow for more varied instrumental textures. Explaining his rationale behind the method, he commented:

Workman left the Catholics in 1998 to pursue session and sideman work; Rich Gilbert was added to the band to replace him. Frank Black and the Catholics released "<a href="Pistolero%20%28album%29">Pistolero</a>" in 1999 and "<a href="Dog%20in%20the%20Sand">Dog in the Sand</a>" in 2001. "Dog in the Sand" added Dave Philips on <a href="pedal%20steel%20guitar">pedal steel guitar</a> and lead guitar, and Santiago and Feldman began making occasional appearances with the group live and on record. Both "<a href="Pistolero%20%28album%29">Pistolero</a>" and "<a href="Dog%20in%20the%20Sand">Dog in the Sand</a>" were produced by <a href="Nick%20Vincent%20%28musician%29">Nick Vincent</a>.

By this time, while dismissing the possibility of a Pixies reunion, Thompson had begun to incorporate an increasing number of the band's songs into Catholics concerts, as well as including Santiago in his solo work again. Black and the Catholics continued to release records; two separate albums, "<a href="Black%20Letter%20Days">Black Letter Days</a>" and "<a href="Devil%27s%20Workshop">Devil's Workshop</a>", were released simultaneously in 2002. "Devil's Workshop" included the song "Velvety" (), a version of the Pixies song "Velvety Instrumental Version" (written by Black as a teenager) with lyrics. The song was one of the first signs that he had acknowledged his past work with the Pixies in his solo output. A sixth album with the Catholics, "<a href="Show%20Me%20Your%20Tears">Show Me Your Tears</a>", was released in 2003. "Show Me Your Tears<nowiki>'</nowiki>" title and many of the songs in it were inspired by Thompson's recent divorce and entry into <a href="psychotherapy">therapy</a>.

In late 2003, following long-standing rumors, an official announcement was made that the Pixies were rehearsing for a reunion tour. The band played publicly for the first time in 12 years in April 2004, and went on to tour extensively throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe in the same year. They also recorded one of Deal's compositions, "<a href="Bam%20Thwok">Bam Thwok</a>," which was released on the <a href="iTunes%20Music%20Store">iTunes Music Store</a>. "<a href="Frank%20Black%20Francis%20%28album%29">Frank Black Francis</a>", a double album bridging the gap between his two personas, was released to coincide with the Pixies reunion tour. The first disc consisted of solo demos of Pixies songs recorded the day before "The Purple Tape" was recorded, and the second contained studio collaborations, again of Pixies songs, with <a href="David%20Thomas%20and%20Two%20Pale%20Boys">Two Pale Boys</a>.

Also in 2004, Thompson began to collaborate with a group of <a href="Nashville">Nashville</a> <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a>s, including <a href="Steve%20Cropper">Steve Cropper</a>, <a href="Spooner%20Oldham">Spooner Oldham</a>, <a href="Reggie%20Young">Reggie Young</a>, and <a href="Anton%20Fig">Anton Fig</a>, as well as producer <a href="Jon%20Tiven">Jon Tiven</a>. In July 2005, the collective released "<a href="Honeycomb%20%28album%29">Honeycomb</a>" under the Frank Black name, to generally favorable reviews. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" described the album as "spare, graceful, [and] in the pocket," while "<a href="Billboard%20magazine">Billboard</a>" noted it as "One of [Thompson's] finest hours." A second volume of Nashville sessions, a double album entitled "<a href="Fast%20Man%20Raider%20Man">Fast Man Raider Man</a>", was released in June 2006. Thompson appeared at a concert by Christian rock pioneer <a href="Larry%20Norman">Larry Norman</a> in June 2005 in <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem, Oregon</a>. Norman and Thompson performed a duet on "Watch What You're Doing," which later appeared on Norman's album, "Live at <a href="Elsinore%20Theatre">The Elsinore</a>".

Thompson continued to tour with the Pixies through 2005 and 2006. Though the Catholics were effectively defunct, they released two separate albums of <a href="B-side">B-side</a>s and rarities, "Snake Oil" and "One More Road for the Hit", on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>, with an eye towards a future CD release. Thompson was also working on more new solo material with Feldman in the first part of 2006, some of which they performed live. In the fall of 2006, Thompson began his first solo tour since 2003, taking Feldman, Billy Block, and <a href="Duane%20Jarvis">Duane Jarvis</a> along as his backing band. In October 2006, Thompson announced plans for the Pixies to start rehearsing and recording a new album in January 2007, but it is believed that no recording took place because of the reluctance of another member of the Pixies to commit to the project. In December 2006, he released the compilation "Christmass" album; a collection of new studio tracks, hotel room sessions, and live acoustic recordings from a solo tour the previous summer.

A Frank Black "best of" compilation, "<a href="Frank%20Black%2093-03">Frank Black 93-03</a>", was released in June 2007. Concurrently with that release, Thompson undertook a European tour with a new band, featuring Salem's Guards of Metropolis members Jason Carter and Charles Normal, as well as bassist Ding Archer. For this tour, Thompson eschewed his usual rhythm guitar role and performed solely as a frontman and singer. In September 2007, a new album entitled "<a href="Bluefinger">Bluefinger</a>" was released under his former stage name of Black Francis. For this album, he was inspired by the life and works of <a href="Herman%20Brood">Herman Brood</a>, a Dutch musician and artist. He also released a new "mini-album" entitled "<a href="Svn%20Fngrs">Svn Fngrs</a>" as Black Francis in March 2008.

In February 2008, Thompson was taken away by the <a href="Garda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na">Irish police</a> in Dublin, Ireland, after staging an impromptu "precore" acoustic solo gig at <a href="St.%20Stephen%27s%20Green">St. Stephen's Green</a>. He was later released and performed that night in Vicar Street as planned. However, a similar event planned for London was prevented by police and had to be re-arranged for a small indoor venue.

Thompson currently lives in <a href="Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts">Amherst, Massachusetts</a>, and is married to Violet Clark, his second wife, with whom he has three children, along with her two children from previous relationships. The couple formerly lived in <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>, where they met. Thompson and Clark currently compose the band <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20%28band%29">Grand Duchy</a>. Their debut album, "Petit Fours", was released in February 2009.
In 2008, Black produced <a href="Art%20Brut">Art Brut</a>'s third album, "<a href="Art%20Brut%20vs.%20Satan">Art Brut vs. Satan</a>", which was released the following year. Black gave several joint interviews with frontman <a href="Eddie%20Argos">Eddie Argos</a> about the album, and Art Brut supported the Pixies at their 2009 <a href="Brixton%20Academy">Brixton Academy</a> show. In 2010, Black worked with the group a second time on their album "<a href="Brilliant%21%20Tragic%21">Brilliant! Tragic!</a>".

Black Francis released "<a href="NonStopErotik">NonStopErotik</a>" in March 2010 and contributed the song "I Heard Ramona Sing" to the soundtrack for the film "<a href="Scott%20Pilgrim%20vs.%20the%20World">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a>" released in August 2010.

In the fall of 2010 in Nashville, Thompson recorded an album of new songs written and performed with collaborator <a href="Reid%20Paley">Reid Paley</a>, as <a href="Paley%20%26amp%3B%20Francis">Paley & Francis</a> (Reid Paley & Black Francis). The debut <a href="Paley%20%26amp%3B%20Francis">Paley & Francis</a> album (also titled <a href="Paley%20%26amp%3B%20Francis%20%28Paley%20%26amp%3B%20Francis%20album%29">"Paley & Francis"</a>) was produced by <a href="Jon%20Tiven">Jon Tiven</a>, and features Reid Paley and Black Francis on guitars and vocals, accompanied by <a href="Muscle%20Shoals%20Rhythm%20Section">Muscle Shoals</a> legends <a href="Spooner%20Oldham">Spooner Oldham</a> on piano and <a href="David%20Hood">David Hood</a> on bass. The album was released in October 2011 on <a href="Sonic%20Unyon">Sonic Unyon</a> in North America, and on <a href="Cooking%20Vinyl">Cooking Vinyl</a> in the UK & Europe.

Paley & Francis debuted live in early September 2011 with club performances in Albany NY, Buffalo NY, and Hamilton, Ontario, and as one of the headliners of the <a href="Supercrawl">Supercrawl</a> Festival. The band for these performances consisted of Reid Paley and Black Francis on guitars and vocals, <a href="Eric%20Eble">Eric Eble</a> on bass, and <a href="Dave%20Varriale">Dave Varriale</a> on drums. The pair toured again from February 8 to 22, 2013, with the shows including solo performances by each artist.

Black Francis contributed, in 2011, to the <a href="Ray%20Davies">Ray Davies</a> album of collaborations, "See My Friends," with his cover of the <a href="Kinks">Kinks</a> tune "This Is Where I Belong."

Black Francis performed at The Coach House Concert Hall in <a href="San%20Juan%20Capistrano%2C%20California">San Juan Capistrano, California</a>, on March 22, 2013. The Pixies, minus original bassist Kim Deal, reunited for a United States and world tour in 2014.

Over the course of his career, Thompson's musical style has grown to encompass a large number of genres; however, he is considered to produce rock or alternative rock compositions. Whereas songs such as "Here Comes Your Man" ("Doolittle"), "Velvety" ("Devil's Workshop") and "Headache" ("Teenager of the Year") expose a more <a href="Soft%20rock">light rock</a> side, others such as "Something Against You" ("Surfer Rosa") and "Thalassocracy" ("Teenager of the Year") hint to a more <a href="Hard%20rock">heavy rock</a> influence in his material. A strong <a href="country%20music">country music</a> influence is also increasingly evident in his style, most notably in his Nashville albums, "Honeycomb" and "Fast Man Raider Man".

Thompson has said that he acquired his vocal style as a teenager, when a <a href="Thai%20people">Thai</a> neighbor asked him to sing "<a href="Oh%21%20Darling">Oh! Darling</a>" by <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> (from their album "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>") and to "Scream it like you hate that bitch!" Thompson's powerful screams were a signature of Pixies albums, along with the band's typical song structure of quietly paced <a href="Verse-chorus%20form">verses</a> followed by thundering <a href="refrain">chorus</a> lines and repetitive guitar <a href="staccato">staccato</a>.

Thompson has drawn influence from a number of <a href="Music%20genre">musical genres</a>. As a teenager, he mostly listened to 1960s folk and religious music, including the Christian singer-songwriter <a href="Larry%20Norman">Larry Norman</a>. For playing on his junior high baseball team, he was given <a href="Leon%20Russell">Leon Russell</a>'s <a href="Leon%20Russell%20%28album%29">1970 debut album</a>, which he says influenced some of his vocalizing. Later in high school and in college, he discovered <a href="Punk%20rock">punk music</a> (<a href="Black%20Flag%20%28band%29">Black Flag</a>), along with bands from other genres, such as the <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a> band <a href="The%20Cars">The Cars</a> and the obscure <a href="Angst%20%28American%20band%29">Angst</a>. While in Boston in 1984, before starting the Pixies, he listened to <a href="H%C3%BCsker%20D%C3%BC">Hüsker Dü</a>'s "<a href="Zen%20Arcade">Zen Arcade</a>", "<a href="The%20Spotlight%20Kid">The Spotlight Kid</a>" by <a href="Captain%20Beefheart">Captain Beefheart</a>, and "I'm Sick of You", an <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a> bootleg. Thompson was also greatly influenced by the Beatles self-titled 1968 release with regards to the experimental nature of his compositions (especially those featured in Doolittle).

Thompson's lyrics have also featured references to the Bible, especially in his career with the Pixies; most notably in the <a href="incest">incest</a>uous tale of "<a href="Nimrod%20%28king%29">Nimrod</a>'s Son", the stories of <a href="Uriah%20the%20Hittite">Uriah</a> and <a href="Bathsheba">Bathsheba</a> in "Dead", <a href="Samson">Samson</a> in "Gouge Away" and references to the <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a> in songs such as "Build High" and "Old Black Dawning". He cited <a href="surrealism">surrealist</a> films "<a href="Eraserhead">Eraserhead</a>" and "<a href="Un%20Chien%20Andalou">Un Chien Andalou</a>" (as mentioned in "Debaser") as major influences on his work with the Pixies; however, surrealism was less of an influence in his solo career. He commented on these influences (which he paid tribute to most in the Pixies' "Doolittle"), saying he "didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch 20-minute films.

During his stay in Puerto Rico, Thompson acquired a fairly fluent, although informal and at times incorrect, use of Spanish, which he has continued throughout his career. Several early Pixies songs, including "Isla de Encanta" and "Vamos", reference his experiences in <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan</a>, and the lyrics are often heavily seasoned with the island's slang. The island's influence in his work is most notable in the song "Isla De Encanta", named after the island's <a href="motto">motto</a>, "Isla Del Encanto". Other Pixies songs drawn from his experiences there include "Vamos" ("<a href="Come%20On%20Pilgrim">Come On Pilgrim</a>"), "Oh My Golly!", "<a href="Where%20Is%20My%20Mind%3F">Where Is My Mind?</a>" ("<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>"), "<a href="Crackity%20Jones">Crackity Jones</a>" ("<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle</a>") and the B-side "Bailey's Walk". Several of his songs contain Spanish lyrics, most notably in the Pixies' first album, "Come On Pilgrim", and a Spanish translation of "Evil Hearted You" by <a href="The%20Yardbirds">The Yardbirds</a>. From his later works with the Pixies onwards, his use of Spanish drifted westward, reflecting places and aspects of the state of California and its culture.

Thompson's lyrics are noted for their obscure references to off-beat topics such as <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a>, <a href="Unidentified%20flying%20object">UFO</a>s, and <a href="The%20Three%20Stooges">The Three Stooges</a>—the last of these being the subject of "Two Reelers", a song from "Teenager of the Year". Lyrics with a focus on science fiction were particularly prominent on the later Pixies records, as well as his early solo albums. With the Catholics, his lyrics have tended towards historical topics; for example, the song "St. Francis Dam Disaster" (from "Dog in the Sand") details the catastrophic collapse of the <a href="St.%20Francis%20Dam">St. Francis Dam</a> near Los Angeles in March 1928, and the "All My Ghosts" <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> featured an account of the <a href="1860%20Wiyot%20Massacre">Humboldt County Massacre</a> of <a href="Wiyot%20people">Wiyot</a> Indians in 1860 near <a href="Eureka%2C%20California">Eureka, California</a>.

Thompson has appeared on a range of television shows solo and as part of the Pixies, ranging from "<a href="120%20Minutes">120 Minutes</a>" and "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">The Late Show</a>" in the United States, to "<a href="The%20Word%20%28TV%20series%29">The Word</a>" in the UK.

As part of the Pixies, he was reluctant to film music videos for singles. <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>' Peter Lubin commented that "to get videos out of them was a major ... undertaking and it only got worse over time", citing the fact that Thompson refused to <a href="lip-sync">lip-sync</a>; the video for "<a href="Here%20Comes%20Your%20Man">Here Comes Your Man</a>" features Thompson and Deal opening their mouths as the vocals are being heard, mocking the practice.

In his early solo career as Frank Black, his videos were more professional; he became more willing to take part in them. "Los Angeles" is an example; the video features Thompson riding across a desert on a <a href="hovercraft">hovercraft</a>. <a href="They%20Might%20Be%20Giants">They Might Be Giants</a>' <a href="John%20Flansburgh">John Flansburgh</a>, who directed the "Los Angeles" video, later commented on the change in Black's attitude to music videos:

Thompson has released few music videos since leaving 4AD, one being a low-budget video in Germany for "Dog in the Sand"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s "Robert Onion". The last widely released video produced for his solo material was for "Men in Black", from "Cult of Ray".

In 2013, Thompson appeared in a <a href="http%3A//vimeo.com/68814648">video</a> promoting <a href="McSweeney%27s">McSweeney's</a> children's book "Lost Sloth".

Geography of Ireland

<a href="%3AIreland">:Ireland</a> is an island in <a href="Northwestern%20Europe">Northwestern Europe</a> in the north Atlantic Ocean. The island lies on the European continental shelf, part of the <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian Plate</a>. The island's main <a href="geography">geographical</a> features include low central <a href="plain">plain</a>s surrounded by coastal mountains. The highest peak is <a href="Carrauntoohil">Carrauntoohil</a> (), which is above sea level. The western <a href="coast">coast</a>line is rugged, with many islands, <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>s, <a href="headlands%20and%20bays">headlands and bays</a>. The island is bisected by the <a href="River%20Shannon">River Shannon</a>, which at with a <a href="estuary">estuary</a> is the longest river in Ireland and flows south from <a href="County%20Cavan">County Cavan</a> in <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a> to meet the Atlantic just south of <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a>. There are a number of sizeable lakes along Ireland's rivers, of which <a href="Lough%20Neagh">Lough Neagh</a> is the largest.

Politically, the island consists of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a>, with jurisdiction over about five-sixths of the island; and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, a <a href="Countries%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">constituent country</a> (and an unconfirmed <a href="Enclave%20and%20exclave%23%26quot%3BPractical%26quot%3B%20enclaves%2C%20exclaves%20and%20inaccessible%20districts">"practical" exclave</a>) of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, with jurisdiction over the remaining sixth. Located west of the island of Great Britain, it is located at approximately . It has a total area of . It is separated from Great Britain by the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a> and from <a href="mainland%20Europe">mainland Europe</a> by the <a href="Celtic%20Sea">Celtic Sea</a>.
Ireland and Great Britain, together with nearby islands, are known collectively as the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>; as <a href="British%20Isles%20naming%20dispute">the term British Isles is controversial</a> in relation to Ireland, the alternative term 'Britain and Ireland' is increasingly preferred.

The geology of Ireland is diverse. Different regions contain rocks belonging to different geologic periods, dating as far back almost 2 billion years. The oldest known Irish <a href="Rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a> is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on <a href="Inishtrahull%20Island">Inishtrahull Island</a> off the north coast of <a href="Inishowen">Inishowen</a> and on the mainland at <a href="Annagh%20Head">Annagh Head</a> on the <a href="Mullet%20Peninsula">Mullet Peninsula</a>. The newer formations are the <a href="drumlin">drumlin</a>s and glacial valleys as a result of the last ice age, and the sinkholes and cave formations in the limestone regions of Clare.

Ireland's geologic history covers everything from <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> and tropical seas to the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years ago. As a result of tectonics and the effect of ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed can be seen as a result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide <a href="bog">bog</a>s and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are <a href="granite">granite</a>, <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="limestone">limestone</a> with <a href="karst">karst</a> areas, and <a href="basalt">basalt</a> formations.

Lion's share of Ireland has with most likehood been above sea level during the <a href="Cenozoic">last 60 million years</a>. As such its landscapes have been shaped by <a href="erosion">erosion</a> and <a href="weathering">weathering</a> on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> and <a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> deposits. Before the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a>s affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered <a href="regolith">regolith</a> on the uplands and <a href="karst">karst</a> in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding the origin of the <a href="planation%20surface">planation surface</a>s found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in <a href="marine%20planation">marine planation</a> others regard these surfaces as <a href="peneplain">peneplain</a>s formed by weathering and <a href="cycle%20of%20erosion">fluvial erosion</a>. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of <a href="eustacy">sea-level change</a> and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course <a href="structural%20geology">structural</a> features of the <a href="geology%20of%20Ireland">geology of Ireland</a>. Marine erosion since the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> may have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's <a href="glacial%20erosion">glacier-smoothened</a> landscapes.

Ireland consists of a mostly flat low-lying area in the midlands, ringed by mountain ranges such as (beginning in County Kerry and working counter-clockwise) the <a href="MacGillycuddy%27s%20Reeks">MacGillycuddy's Reeks</a>, <a href="Comeragh%20Mountains">Comeragh Mountains</a>, <a href="Blackstairs%20Mountains">Blackstairs Mountains</a>, <a href="Wicklow%20Mountains">Wicklow Mountains</a>, <a href="Mourne%20Mountains">the Mournes</a>, <a href="Glens%20of%20Antrim">Glens of Antrim</a>, <a href="Sperrin%20Mountains">Sperrin Mountains</a>, <a href="Bluestack%20Mountains">Bluestack Mountains</a>, <a href="Derryveagh%20Mountains">Derryveagh Mountains</a>, <a href="Ox%20Mountains">Ox Mountains</a>, <a href="Nephinbeg%20Mountains">Nephinbeg Mountains</a> and the <a href="Twelve%20Bens">Twelve Bens</a>/<a href="Maumturks">Maumturks</a> group. Some mountain ranges are further inland in the south of Ireland, such as the <a href="Galtee%20Mountains">Galtee Mountains</a> (the highest inland range), <a href="Silvermine%20Mountains">Silvermine</a> and <a href="Slieve%20Bloom%20Mountains">Slieve Bloom Mountains</a>. The highest peak <a href="Carrauntoohil">Carrauntoohil</a>, 1,038 m (3,405 ft) high, is in the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, a range of glacier-carved sandstone mountains. Ireland's mountains are not high – only three peaks are over 1,000 m (3,281 ft) and another 457 exceed 500 m (1,640 ft).

The main river in Ireland is the <a href="River%20Shannon">River Shannon</a>. The longest river in Ireland, it separates the midlands of Ireland from the west of the island. The river develops into three lakes along its course, <a href="Lough%20Allen">Lough Allen</a>, <a href="Lough%20Ree">Lough Ree</a>, and <a href="Lough%20Derg%20%28Shannon%29">Lough Derg</a>. Of these, Lough Derg is the largest. The River Shannon enters the Atlantic Ocean after <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a> city at the <a href="Shannon%20Estuary">Shannon Estuary</a>. Other major rivers include the <a href="River%20Liffey">River Liffey</a>, <a href="River%20Lee%20%28Ireland%29">River Lee</a>, <a href="Munster%20Blackwater">River Blackwater</a>, <a href="River%20Nore">River Nore</a>, <a href="River%20Suir">River Suir</a>, <a href="River%20Barrow">River Barrow</a>, <a href="River%20Bann">River Bann</a>, <a href="River%20Foyle">River Foyle</a>, <a href="River%20Erne">River Erne</a>, and <a href="River%20Boyne">River Boyne</a> (see the <a href="list%20of%20rivers%20in%20Ireland">list of rivers in Ireland</a>).

<a href="Lough%20Neagh">Lough Neagh</a>, in Ulster, is the largest lake in Ireland and Britain. Other large lakes include <a href="Lough%20Erne">Lough Erne</a> and <a href="Lough%20Corrib">Lough Corrib</a>.

Beginning with County Donegal, <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a> separates one side of the <a href="Inishowen%20peninsula">Inishowen peninsula</a>. <a href="Lough%20Foyle">Lough Foyle</a> on the other side, is one of Ireland's larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and <a href="County%20Londonderry">County Londonderry</a>. Further round the coast is <a href="Belfast%20Lough">Belfast Lough</a>, between County Antrim and County Down. Also in County Down is <a href="Strangford%20Lough">Strangford Lough</a>, actually an inlet partially separating the <a href="Ards%20peninsula">Ards peninsula</a> from the mainland. Further down the coast, <a href="Carlingford%20Lough">Carlingford Lough</a> is situated between Down and <a href="County%20Louth">County Louth</a>.

<a href="Dublin%20Bay">Dublin Bay</a> is the next sizeable inlet, while the eastern coast of Ireland is mostly uniform until <a href="Wexford%20Harbour">Wexford Harbour</a> at the mouth of the <a href="River%20Slaney">River Slaney</a>. On the southern coast, <a href="Waterford%20Harbour">Waterford Harbour</a> is situated at the mouth of the <a href="River%20Suir">River Suir</a> (into which the other two of the <a href="The%20Three%20Sisters%20%28Ireland%29">Three Sisters</a> (<a href="River%20Nore">River Nore</a> and <a href="River%20Barrow">River Barrow</a>) flow). The next major inlet is <a href="Cork%20Harbour">Cork Harbour</a>, at the mouth of the River Lee, in which <a href="Great%20Island">Great Island</a> is situated.

<a href="Dunmanus%20Bay">Dunmanus Bay</a>, <a href="Kenmare%20River">Kenmare estuary</a> and <a href="Dingle%20Bay">Dingle Bay</a> are all inlets between the peninsulas of <a href="County%20Kerry">County Kerry</a>. North of these is the <a href="Shannon%20Estuary">Shannon Estuary</a>. Between north County Clare and County Galway is <a href="Galway%20Bay">Galway Bay</a>. <a href="Clew%20Bay">Clew Bay</a> is located on the coast of <a href="County%20Mayo">County Mayo</a>, south of <a href="Achill%20Island">Achill Island</a>, while <a href="Broadhaven%20Bay">Broadhaven Bay</a>, <a href="Blacksod%20Bay">Blacksod Bay</a> and <a href="Sruth%20Fada%20Conn">Sruth Fada Conn</a> bays are situated in northwest Connacht, in North Mayo. <a href="Killala%20Bay">Killala Bay</a> is on the northeast coast of Mayo. <a href="Donegal%20Bay">Donegal Bay</a> is a major inlet between County Donegal and <a href="County%20Sligo">County Sligo</a>.

<a href="Malin%20Head">Malin Head</a> is the most northerly point in Ireland, while <a href="Mizen%20Head">Mizen Head</a> is one of the <a href="Extreme%20points%20of%20Ireland">most southern points</a>, hence the term "Malin head to Mizen head" (or the reverse) is used for anything applying to the island of Ireland as a whole. <a href="Carnsore%20Point">Carnsore Point</a> is another <a href="extreme%20points%20of%20Ireland">extreme point of Ireland</a>, being the southeastern most point of Ireland. Further along the coast is <a href="Hook%20Head">Hook Head</a> while the <a href="Old%20Head%20of%20Kinsale">Old Head of Kinsale</a> is one of many headlands along the south coast of Ireland.

<a href="Loop%20Head">Loop Head</a> is the headland at which County Clare comes to a point on the west coast of Ireland, with the Atlantic on the north, and further inland on the south, the Shannon estuary. <a href="Hag%27s%20Head">Hag's Head</a> is another headland further up Clare's north/western coastline, with the <a href="Cliffs%20of%20Moher">Cliffs of Moher</a> along the coastline north of the point.

<a href="Erris%20Head">Erris Head</a> is the northwesternmost point of <a href="Connacht">Connacht</a>.

Apart from Ireland itself, Achill Island to its northwest is now considered the largest island in the group. The island is inhabited, and is connected to the mainland by a bridge. Some of the next largest islands are the <a href="Aran%20Islands">Aran Islands</a>, off the coast of southern <a href="Connacht">Connacht</a>, host to an Irish-speaking community, or <a href="Gaeltacht">Gaeltacht</a>. <a href="Valentia%20Island">Valentia Island</a> off the <a href="Iveragh%20peninsula">Iveragh peninsula</a> is also one of Ireland's larger islands, and is relatively settled, as well as being connected by a bridge at its southeastern end. <a href="Omey%20Island">Omey Island</a>, off the coast of <a href="Connemara">Connemara</a> is a <a href="tidal%20island">tidal island</a>.

Some of the best-known peninsulas in Ireland are in County Kerry; the <a href="Dingle%20peninsula">Dingle peninsula</a>, the aforementioned Iveragh peninsula and the <a href="Beara%20peninsula">Beara peninsula</a>. The <a href="Ards%20peninsula">Ards peninsula</a> is one of the larger peninsulas outside Kerry. The <a href="Inishowen">Inishowen</a> peninsula in County Donegal includes Ireland's most northerly point, Malin Head and several important towns including <a href="Buncrana">Buncrana</a> on <a href="Lough%20Swilly">Lough Swilly</a>, <a href="Carndonagh">Carndonagh</a> and <a href="Moville">Moville</a> on <a href="Lough%20Foyle">Lough Foyle</a>. Ireland's most northerly land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head. <a href="Rockall">Rockall</a> Island may deserve this honour but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> (for the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>) and <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. The most southerly point is the <a href="Fastnet%20Rock">Fastnet Rock</a>.

The <a href="Hebrides">Hebrides</a> off <a href="Geography%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a> off <a href="Geography%20of%20Wales">Wales</a> were grouped with Ireland ("<a href="Hibernia">Hibernia</a>") by the <a href="Greek%20people">Greco</a>-<a href="Ancient%20Romans">Roman</a> <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20geography">geographer</a> <a href="Claudius%20Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, but this is no longer common.
The <a href="climate%20of%20Ireland">climate of Ireland</a> is mild, moist and changeable with abundant <a href="rainfall">rainfall</a> and a lack of <a href="temperature%20extremes">temperature extremes</a>. <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>'s climate is defined as a <a href="temperate">temperate</a> <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a>, or "Cfb" on the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe. The country receives generally warm summers and mild winters. It is considerably warmer than other areas at the same <a href="latitude">latitude</a> on the other side of the Atlantic, such as in <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, because it lies downwind of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. It is also warmer than maritime climates near the same latitude, such as the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> as a result of heat released by the Atlantic overturning circulation that includes the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Current">North Atlantic Current</a> and <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>. For comparison, <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> is 9 °C warmer than <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a> in Newfoundland in winter and 4 °C warmer than <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> in the Pacific Northwest in winter.

The influence of the North Atlantic Current also ensures the coastline of Ireland remains ice-free throughout the winter. The climate in Ireland does not experience extreme weather, with tornadoes and similar weather features being rare. However, Ireland is prone to eastward moving cyclones which come in from the North Atlantic.

The prevailing wind comes from the southwest, breaking on the high mountains of the west coast. Rainfall is therefore a particularly prominent part of western Irish life, with <a href="Valentia%20Island">Valentia Island</a>, off the west coast of <a href="County%20Kerry">County Kerry</a>, getting almost twice as much annual rainfall as Dublin on the east ( vs. ).

January and February are the coldest months of the year, and mean daily air temperatures fall between during these months. July and August are the warmest, with mean daily temperatures of , whilst mean daily maximums in July and August vary from near the coast, to inland. The sunniest months are May and June, with an average of five to seven hours sunshine per day.

Though extreme weather events in Ireland are comparatively rare when compared with other countries in the European Continent, they do occur. Atlantic depressions, occurring mainly in the months of December, January and February, can occasionally bring winds of up to to Western coastal counties; while the summer months, and particularly around late July/early August, thunderstorms can develop.

The table shows mean climate figures for the Dublin Airport weather station over a thirty-year period. Climate statistics based on the counties of Northern Ireland vary slightly but are not significantly different.

Ireland is divided into four <a href="Provinces%20of%20Ireland">provinces</a>, <a href="Connacht">Connacht</a>, <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a>, <a href="Munster">Munster</a> and <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>, and 32 <a href="Counties%20of%20Ireland">counties</a>. Six of the nine Ulster counties form Northern Ireland and the other 26 form the state, Ireland. The map shows the county boundaries for all 32 counties.

From an administrative viewpoint, 21 of the counties in the republic are units of local government. The other six have more than one local council area, producing a total of 31 county-level authorities. <a href="County%20Tipperary">County Tipperary</a> had two <a href="Riding%20%28country%20subdivision%29%23Ireland">ridings</a>, <a href="North%20Tipperary">North Tipperary</a> and <a href="South%20Tipperary">South Tipperary</a>, originally established in 1838, renamed in 2001 and amalgamated in 2014. The cities of Dublin, <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a> and <a href="Galway">Galway</a> have city councils and are administered separately from the counties bearing those names. The cities of <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a> and <a href="Waterford">Waterford</a> were merged with their respective county councils in 2014 to form new city and county councils. The remaining part of <a href="County%20Dublin">County Dublin</a> is divided into <a href="D%C3%BAn%20Laoghaire%E2%80%93Rathdown">Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown</a>, <a href="Fingal%2C%20Ireland">Fingal</a>, and <a href="South%20Dublin">South Dublin</a>.

Electoral areas in Ireland (the state), called constituencies in accordance with <a href="law%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Ireland">Irish law</a>, mostly follow county boundaries. Maintaining links to the county system is a mandatory consideration in the re-organisation of constituency boundaries by a Constituency Commission.

In Northern Ireland, a major re-organisation of local government in 1973 replaced the six traditional counties and two <a href="county%20borough">county borough</a>s (<a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> and <a href="Derry">Derry</a>) by 26 single-tier <a href="districts%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">districts</a>, which, apart from Fermanagh cross the traditional county boundaries. The six counties and two county-boroughs remain in use for purposes such as <a href="Lord-Lieutenant">Lieutenancy</a>. In November 2005, proposals were announced which would see the number of local authorities reduced to seven.
The island's total population of approximately 6 million people is concentrated on the east coast, particularly in Dublin and Belfast and their surrounding areas.

Ireland has 12,000 km² (4,633 miles²) of <a href="bog">bog</a>land, consisting of two distinct types, blanket bogs and raised bogs. Blanket bogs are the more widespread of the two types. They are essentially a product of human activity aided by the moist Irish climate. Blanket bogs formed on sites where <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> farmers cleared trees for farming. As the land so cleared fell into disuse, the soil began to leach and become more acidic, producing a suitable environment for the growth of <a href="Calluna">heather</a> and <a href="Juncaceae">rushes</a>. The debris from these plants accumulated and a layer of <a href="peat">peat</a> formed. One of the largest expanses of Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland is to be found in <a href="County%20Mayo">County Mayo</a>.

Raised bogs are most common in the Shannon basin. They formed when depressions left behind after the ice age filled with water to form lakes. Debris from reeds in these lakes formed a layer at the bottom of the water. This eventually choked the lakes and raised above the surface, forming raised bogs.

Since the 17th century, peat has been cut for fuel for domestic heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called <a href="Bord%20na%20M%C3%B3na">Bord na Móna</a>. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used in a number of industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with <a href="biomass">biomass</a> for dual-firing electricity generation.

In recent years, the high level of bog being destroyed by cutting has raised environmental concerns. The problem is particularly acute for raised bogs as they yield a higher-grade fuel than blanket bogs. Plans are now in place in both the Republic and Northern Ireland to conserve most of the remaining raised bogs on the island.

Offshore exploration for natural gas began in 1970. The first major discovery was the <a href="Kinsale%20Head%20gas%20field">Kinsale Head gas field</a> in 1971. Next was the smaller <a href="Ballycotton%20gas%20field">Ballycotton gas field</a> in 1989, and the <a href="Corrib%20gas%20project">Corrib gas field</a> in 1996. Exploitation of the Corrib project has yet to get off the ground because the <a href="Corrib%20gas%20controversy">controversial proposal</a> to refine the gas onshore, rather than at sea has been met with <a href="Shell%20To%20Sea">widespread opposition</a>. Gas from these fields is pumped ashore and used for both domestic and industrial purposes. The <a href="Helvick%20oil%20field">Helvick oil field</a>, estimated to contain over of oil, is a 2000 discovery. Ireland is the largest European producer of <a href="zinc">zinc</a> with three operating zinc-lead mines at <a href="Navan">Navan</a>, <a href="Galmoy">Galmoy</a> and <a href="Lisheen">Lisheen</a>. Other mineral deposits with actual or potential commercial value include gold, silver, <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, <a href="talc">talc</a>, <a href="calcite">calcite</a>, <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a>, roofing <a href="slate">slate</a>, <a href="limestone">limestone</a> aggregate, <a href="building%20stone">building stone</a>, <a href="sand">sand</a> and <a href="gravel">gravel</a>.

In May 2007 the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (now replaced by the <a href="Department%20of%20Communications%2C%20Energy%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</a>) reported that there may be volumes over of petroleum and of natural gas in Irish waters – worth trillions of <a href="Euro">Euro</a>, if true. The minimum 'guaranteed' amount of oil in the Irish Atlantic waters is , worth over €450 billion. There are also areas of petroleum and natural gas on shore, for example the <a href="Lough%20Allen">Lough Allen</a> basin, with of gas and of oil, valued at €74.4 billion. Already some fields are being exploited, such as the <a href="Spanish%20Point%2C%20County%20Clare">Spanish Point</a> field, with of gas and of oil, valued at €19.6 billion. The Corrib Basin is also quite large, worth anything up to €87 billion, while the <a href="Dunquin%20gas%20field">Dunquin gas field</a> contains of natural gas and of petroleum.

In March 2012 the first commercial oil well was drilled 70 km off the Cork coast by Providence Resources. The Barryroe oil well is yielding 3500 barrels per day, at current oil prices at $120 a barrel Barryroe oil well is worth in excess of €2.14bn annually.

Planescape: Torment

Planescape: Torment is a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> developed by <a href="Black%20Isle%20Studios">Black Isle Studios</a> and published by <a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay Entertainment</a>. Released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on December 12, 1999, the game takes place in locations from the <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a> of <a href="Planescape">Planescape</a>, a "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>" ("D&D") <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20campaign%20settings">campaign setting</a>. The game's <a href="game%20engine">engine</a> is a modified version of the <a href="Infinity%20Engine">Infinity Engine</a>, which was used for <a href="BioWare">BioWare</a>'s "<a href="Baldur%27s%20Gate">Baldur's Gate</a>", a previous "D&D" game set in the <a href="Forgotten%20Realms">Forgotten Realms</a>.

"Planescape: Torment" is primarily story-driven, with combat not being prominently featured. The <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>, known as <a href="The%20Nameless%20One">The Nameless One</a>, is a man who is immortal, but with the cost of him forgetting everything if killed. The game focuses on his journey through the city of <a href="Sigil%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">Sigil</a> and other <a href="Plane%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">planes</a> to reclaim his memories of these previous lives, and to discover why he was made immortal in the first place. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey; most of these characters have encountered him in the past or have been influenced by his actions in some way.

The game was not a commercial success, but received critical acclaim and has since become a <a href="cult%20video%20game">cult classic</a>. Claimed by <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game journalists</a> to be the best role-playing game of 1999, it was lauded for its immersive dialogue, for the dark and relatively obscure Planescape setting, and for the protagonist's unique persona, which shirked many characteristics of traditional role-playing games. It is considered one of the <a href="greatest%20video%20games%20of%20all%20time">greatest video games of all time</a>, and continues to receive attention long after its release. An enhanced version, featuring quality of life updates made for modern platforms among other enhancements, was made by <a href="Beamdog">Beamdog</a> and released for Windows, <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>, and <a href="iOS">iOS</a> in April 2017.

"Planescape: Torment" is built on <a href="BioWare">BioWare</a>'s <a href="Infinity%20Engine">Infinity Engine</a>, which presents the player with a pre-rendered world in an isometric perspective in which <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s are controlled. The game's role-playing ruleset are based on those of <a href="Editions%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%23Advanced%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%202nd%20edition">"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" 2nd Edition</a>. In "Planescape: Torment", the player takes the role of "<a href="The%20Nameless%20One">The Nameless One</a>", an <a href="immortality">immortal</a> man with amnesia on a quest to learn why. Exploration around the painted scenery is accomplished by clicking on the ground to move, or on objects and characters to interact with them. <a href="Item%20%28gaming%29">Items</a> and <a href="Magic%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">spells</a> may be employed through <a href="Keyboard%20shortcut">hotkeys</a>, "quick slots", or a <a href="Pie%20menu">radial menu</a>. An alternative to armor is the use of magical <a href="tattoo">tattoo</a>s, which can be applied to The Nameless One and certain other characters to enhance their abilities.

The game begins with <a href="character%20creation">character creation</a>, where the player assigns <a href="attribute%20%28role-playing%20games%29">attribute</a> points, such as strength, intelligence, and charisma, to The Nameless One. The Nameless One starts the game as a <a href="Fighter%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">fighter class</a>, but the player may later freely change it to a <a href="Rogue%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">thief</a> or <a href="Wizard%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">wizard</a>. The player may recruit companions over the course of the game to join the <a href="Party%20%28role%20playing%20games%29">party</a>. There are seven potential companions, but only a maximum of four may accompany The Nameless One at any given time. Conversation is frequent among party members, occurring both randomly and during conversations with other <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s. The <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> often focuses on the resolution of <a href="quest%20%28gaming%29">quests</a> through dialogue rather than combat, and many of the game's combat encounters can be resolved or avoided through dialogue or stealth. The Nameless One carries a journal, which helps the player keep track of the game's numerous quests and subplots. As The Nameless One is immortal, running out of <a href="health%20points">health points</a> usually imposes no penalty beyond <a href="respawning">respawning</a> in a different location.

"Planescape: Torment" uses the "D&D" <a href="Alignment%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">character alignment</a> system, in which a character's ethical and moral perspective and philosophy is determined based on axis of "good vs. evil" and "law vs. chaos", with neutrality bridging the two opposing sides. In "Planescape: Torment", The Nameless One begins as "true neutral", but can be incrementally changed based on the character's actions throughout the game, with reactions from the game's non-player characters differing based on his alignment.

"Planescape: Torment" is set in the <a href="Planescape">Planescape "multiverse"</a>, a <a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20campaign%20setting">Dungeons & Dragons campaign setting</a> which consists of various <a href="Plane%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">planes of existence</a>, the creatures which live in them (such as <a href="devil%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">devils</a>, <a href="Modron%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">modrons</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%20deities">deities</a>), and the properties of the magic that infuses each plane. A large portion of "Planescape: Torment" takes place in <a href="Sigil%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">Sigil</a>, a large city located atop an infinitely tall spire at the center of the multiverse, that connects the planes with each other via a series of <a href="portal%20%28fiction%29">portals</a>. The city is overseen by the powerful <a href="Lady%20of%20Pain">Lady of Pain</a>, while numerous <a href="faction%20%28Planescape%29">factions</a> control different functions of the city related to each group's <a href="world%20view">world view</a>, with The Nameless One being able to join several of these factions during the game. The story eventually moves on to other planes, such as <a href="Baator">Baator</a> and <a href="Carceri%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">Carceri</a>, where The Nameless One continues to discover more about his past. Over the course of the game, The Nameless One slowly learns about his previous incarnations and the influence they have had on the world.

"Planescape: Torment"s protagonist is "The Nameless One," an <a href="immortality">immortal</a> man who, if killed, will wake up later, sometimes with complete <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a>. Each time The Nameless One dies, another person in the multiverse dies to fuel his resurrection. These dead turn into <a href="ghost">ghost</a>s that seek revenge on him. When the game starts, The Nameless One wakes in a <a href="mortuary">mortuary</a> as a result of his latest death with no memories of how he got there. He then sets out on a quest to discover why he is immortal, also hoping the adventure will help regain his lost memories.

During his quest, The Nameless One meets several characters who can join him as companions: <a href="Morte%20%28Planescape%29">Morte</a>, <a href="Annah-of-the-Shadows">Annah-of-the-Shadows</a>, Dak'kon, Ignus, Nordom, Fall-From-Grace, and Vhailor. These playable characters can also interact with the Nameless One to further the game's plot. Morte is a <a href="Cynicism%20%28contemporary%29">cynical</a> floating skull originally from the <a href="Baator%23Avernus">Pillar of Skulls</a> in Baator. He is introduced at the game's beginning in the mortuary. Morte loyally follows The Nameless One, partly out of guilt for having caused the deaths of some of his previous incarnations.

The Nameless One meets Annah-of-the-Shadows, a young and brash <a href="tiefling">tiefling</a> <a href="rogue%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">rogue</a>, outside the mortuary, but she does not join the group until a later point in the game. Dak'kon is a <a href="githzerai">githzerai</a>, who once made an oath to help The Nameless One until his death, but became enslaved to him for eternity due to not knowing of his immortality. Ignus is a <a href="pyromania">pyromania</a>cal being who was once an apprentice mage of one of The Nameless One's past incarnations. In the Rubikon Dungeon Construct, the Nameless One can find Nordom, a <a href="modron%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">modron</a> disconnected from its species' <a href="Group%20mind%20%28science%20fiction%29">hive mind</a>. Fall-From-Grace is a <a href="succubus%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">succubus</a> who acts as proprietress of the "Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts" in Sigil; unlike other succubi, she is not interested in seducing mortals. Vhailor, found below the city of Curst on the plane of the <a href="Outlands">Outlands</a>, is essentially an animated suit of armor dedicated to serving merciless justice.

The game begins when The Nameless One wakes up in a mortuary. He is immediately approached by a floating skull, called Morte, who offers advice on how to escape. Morte also reads the tattoos written on The Nameless One's back, which were inked there as reminders by a previous incarnation of himself, that contain instructions to find a man named Pharod. After a conversation with the ghost of his former lover, Deionarra, and passing by enslaved <a href="undead%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">undead</a> who work at the mortuary, The Nameless One leaves to explore the slums of Sigil. He finds Pharod, who is the chief of an underground village of scavengers, and is asked to retrieved a magical bronze sphere for him before he will give answers. After returning, Pharod does so, giving him further hints to help piece together his forgotten past. Later on, The Nameless One learns from a powerful sorcerer named Lothar that the <a href="Night%20hag%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">night hag</a> Ravel Puzzlewell caused his immortality, but that she is imprisoned in a magical maze for committing crimes against the Lady of Pain. The Nameless One eventually finds a portal to enter the maze, but realizes that it requires a piece of Ravel to activate it; for this, he locates a daughter of hers and takes drops of her blood.

Once in the maze, The Nameless One converses with Ravel, who asks him "what can change the nature of a man?" — a question that plays a prominent role throughout the game. Ravel is pleased with The Nameless One's answer because he offers his own thoughts; she claims she has killed many men in the past who, instead of giving their own answers, tried to guess what her answer, which they assumed was the only answer, might be. As the conversation progresses, Ravel explains that a past incarnation of The Nameless One had asked her to make him immortal. However, the ritual she performed was flawed, which causes The Nameless One to risk losing his memory each time he dies. She also reveals that the mortality she separated from him was not destroyed, and that as long as he was alive, his mortality must still be intact somewhere. Not knowing where it is, she suggests that the fallen <a href="Deva%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">deva</a> Trias might know.

Ravel then attempts to keep The Nameless One and his party there by force, with them having to defeat her in combat. After they do so and leave the maze, Ravel is revealed to have faked her death. A being known as The Transcendent One then appears, and also combats Ravel after a short conversation, which truly kills her. The portal that The Nameless One and his party found in the maze takes them to the city of Curst, a gate town on the border of the <a href="Outlands">Outlands</a> and <a href="Carceri%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">Carceri</a>, to find Trias. Finding him magically imprisoned underneath Curst, The Nameless One offers to help free him in exchange for answers. Doing so, Trias then claims not to know where The Nameless One's mortality lies, but points him in another direction. The Nameless One then visits the Outlands and Baator, where he learns that his mortality lies in a place known as the Fortress of Regrets, and that only Trias knows how to access it. Meanwhile, however, Curst has "slid" from the border of the Outlands to the neighboring chaotic plane of Carceri due to the chaos unleashed by Trias after The Nameless One freed him. After fights through the city against large groups of <a href="Demon%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">demons</a>, The Nameless One and his party reach Trias, who they also fight. After Trias is weakened enough through combat, he tells The Nameless One that the portal to the Fortress of Regrets is located within Sigil's mortuary, right next to where The Nameless One awoke.

In the Fortress of Regrets, The Nameless One encounters three of his past incarnations: one practical, one good, and one paranoid. The Nameless One learns that the "good" incarnation was the original man who was made immortal by Ravel, and learns that he had committed immeasurably terrible sins in his lifetime. Realizing that he would have to serve in the <a href="Blood%20War">Blood War</a>, an eternal war between <a href="Demon%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">demons</a> and <a href="Devil%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">devils</a>, when he dies, he sought to postpone death for as long as possible in order to atone for his deeds. After merging with his past incarnations through either convincing them or combat and gaining all of their combined experience and knowledge, The Nameless One confronts his mortality, which is embodied as The Transcendent One. The Transcendent One reveals that since being separated from The Nameless One, he has enjoyed his freedom and has been attempting to erase clues that might lead The Nameless One to discover the truth. Depending on the player's choice, The Nameless One then either slays The Transcendent One through combat or convinces it to rejoin with him, with either option finally bringing an end to his immortality. In the game's final scene, The Nameless One awakens near a battleground of Blood War, picking up a <a href="mace%20%28bludgeon%29">mace</a> and walks toward the conflict as was originally intended.

In 1997, the game's designers produced a 47-page document that outlined the game's premise and <a href="vision%20statement">vision statement</a>, and was used to pitch the idea to management at <a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay</a>. Initially, the game was to be called "Last Rites", and they described the game as "avant-garde" fantasy to distinguish it from <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a>. The document also contained concept artwork for characters and areas of the game. It was one of three "Planescape" games being developed by Black Isle at the time, along with a <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> game by <a href="Colin%20McComb">Colin McComb</a> based on <a href="FromSoftware">FromSoftware</a>'s "<a href="King%27s%20Field%20%28series%29">King's Field</a>", and a <a href="PC%20game">PC game</a> by <a href="Zeb%20Cook">Zeb Cook</a>; the other two were cancelled, and only "Last Rites" was released as "Torment". McComb, one of the designers of the overall "Planescape" setting, joined the "Torment" project after his game fell through.
From the outset, "Planescape: Torment"s designers intended to challenge traditional role-playing game conventions: the game features no <a href="Dragon%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">dragons</a>, <a href="Elf%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">elves</a>, <a href="Goblin%20%28Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons%29">goblins</a>, or other common fantasy races; there are only three swords; the rats faced in the game can be quite challenging to defeat; and the undead sometimes prove more sympathetic than humans. The designers explained that most RPGs tend to have a "correct" approach to solving problems, which is almost always the morally good approach. They called this "predictable and stupid" and wished to make a game with greater moral flexibility, where a particular problem might have "two wrongs or two rights". The main quest is not about saving the world, but about understanding The Nameless One and his immortality. Death (of the protagonist or his companions) is often just a minor hindrance, and even necessary at times.

According to lead designer and writer <a href="Chris%20Avellone">Chris Avellone</a>, "Planescape: Torment" was inspired by books, comics, and games, including "<a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a>", "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Amber">The Chronicles of Amber</a>", "<a href="Elementals%20%28Comico%20Comics%29">The Elementals</a>" and "<a href="Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>". The game's 1997 outline also makes references to "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" to describe some characters. While working on "Planescape: Torment", Avellone was simultaneously working on "<a href="Fallout%202">Fallout 2</a>". In an interview from 2007, he says that "Fallout 2" helped him rethink the possibilities of dialogue in "Planescape: Torment" (and in later games he was involved with, including "<a href="Neverwinter%20Nights%202">Neverwinter Nights 2</a>"). Producer <a href="Guido%20Henkel">Guido Henkel</a> commented on taking liberties with the "AD&D" rules by simplifying them: "I think we still take the "AD&D" rules very seriously and we follow those rules. We just take the liberty of removing some of the 'overhead'." The game's credits also cite "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" as an inspiration.

Avellone remarked that many of the ideas in the game "could only have been communicated through text, simply because no one would have the budget or resources to fully realise many of these fantasy works through TV or movies". Ultimately, Avellone has expressed some regret about the game's heavy focus on dialogue, as he feels this interfered with the overall <a href="game%20mechanic">game mechanic</a>s, particularly the combat system. The game's script contains around 800,000 words, after early previews had indicated that the game would be only about 20 hours long.

In several interviews, producer Guido Henkel stated that he was increasingly frustrated by the pressure the management of Interplay put on the development team after Interplay's <a href="initial%20public%20offering">initial public offering</a>. Although only a few additional subplots and characters had to be discarded to meet the planned release date, he accused the Interplay management of disregarding the development team regarding things like <a href="package%20design">package design</a> and <a href="marketing">marketing</a>. Henkel said that it was his main goal to prevent the game from being "crippled" before leaving Interplay when the game reached beta status. He also made the claim that his overall influence on the game was greater than that of Avellone, Eric Campanella, or Dave Maldonaldo, but since a producer often has to make unpopular decisions his role was later downplayed. In 2011 Henkel also revealed that <a href="The%20Nameless%20One">The Nameless One</a>'s face on game box art is based on his real face, due to the fact that the day before the cover photo shoot was scheduled to take place, the model contracted to appear on the box backed out over a scheduling conflict, so Guido Henkel was proposed to use his face. <a href="Cosmetics">Make up</a> lasted for about two hours, and photography took 45 minutes, Henkel said: "My face was red as a beet and burned for the rest of the day, because of the solvent that was used to remove the appliances. Nonetheless, it was all well worth it".

The game used the <a href="Infinity%20Engine">Infinity Engine</a>, a <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> initially developed by <a href="BioWare">BioWare</a> for "<a href="Baldur%27s%20Gate">Baldur's Gate</a>". However, "Planescape: Torment" was being developed using the Infinity Engine before "Baldur's Gate" had been released, leaving the engine's acceptance in the market still unknown. Black Isle made modifications to the engine to suit the game. For example, playable characters were able to run, and both the character <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> and backgrounds were larger and more detailed. The greater size and detail was achieved by bringing the perspective closer to the ground. Magic was also an important part of the game's design, and a team of four designers worked solely on the visuals and mechanics of spells.

In addition to official <a href="Internationalization%20and%20localization">localizations</a>, for example the one by <a href="CD%20Projekt">CD Projekt</a> for the Polish market, fan communities developed Spanish, Hungarian, and Italian <a href="fan%20translation">fan translation</a>s of the game. When Interplay dropped support for "Planescape: Torment" after the official 1.1 <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a>, several not yet fixed <a href="Software%20bug">bugs</a> were corrected by fan created <a href="unofficial%20patch">unofficial patch</a>es. Other <a href="mod%20%28computer%20gaming%29">mods</a> add back items and quests omitted from the final version of the game or new features such as <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> support.

Initially, Interplay hired <a href="dark%20ambient">dark ambient</a> musician <a href="Lustmord">Lustmord</a> to create the musical score for the game. He worked on the project for four months, writing over 40 original pieces. However, just six weeks before the game released, one of the producers had a change of heart on the game's musical direction, who wanted it to sound less ambient and "more along the lines of <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a>". His first time working on a video game project, Lustmord considered the experience "terrible", eventually reusing some of the elements from the score in his 2001 album, "Metavoid". Needing a replacement soundtrack done quickly, Interplay then reached out and asked <a href="Mark%20Morgan%20%28composer%29">Mark Morgan</a>, who had worked on other Black Isle Studios games, to do it. Two additional themes were penned by <a href="Richard%20Band">Richard Band</a>. The game's cast of <a href="voice%20acting">voice actors</a> included <a href="Michael%20T.%20Weiss">Michael T. Weiss</a>, <a href="Sheena%20Easton">Sheena Easton</a>, <a href="Rob%20Paulsen">Rob Paulsen</a>, <a href="Mitch%20Pileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>, <a href="Dan%20Castellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a>, and <a href="Tony%20Jay">Tony Jay</a>.

After the game's release, a reviewer for <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> praised its sound, saying that "When you're in a crowded city, it "sounds" like a crowded city. Walk past a bar, and you'll hear the noise of the drunken patrons inside. Wander near a slave auction, and you'll hear the auctioneer calling. Go to a party in the festival hall, and it sounds just like a party". The same reviewer also stated ""Planescape" has just about the best sound I've ever heard in a game." IGN gave the sound 8.5 out of 10 and noted that "The game has fantastic speech and sound effects, but what's more impressive is the way they fade in and out depending on how close you're standing to them."

A book by the same name was written by Ray and Valerie Vallese and released by <a href="Wizards%20of%20the%20Coast">Wizards of the Coast</a> in 1999. The book's plot follows the game's only loosely; for example, in the game, the main character's lack of a name is a sign of his incomplete state and a source of protection in being anonymous. In the book, the protagonist chooses a <a href="proper%20name">proper name</a>. For the game's 2010 re-release on <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a>, a second, more accurate, novelization produced by Rhyss Hess was bundled with it, based on the game script by Chris Avellone and <a href="Colin%20McComb">Colin McComb</a>.

"Planescape: Torment" received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s reviewer stated "It's clearly the best traditional computer role-playing game of the year", a comment which the website would later expand to "one of the greatest ever". Allen Rausch, writing for <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s 2004 retrospective "A History of D&D Video Games", commented that <a href="Black%20Isle%20Studios">Black Isle Studios</a> "went "way" over the top for this one, crafting an utterly unique experience that has yet to be equaled by any RPG since". The gameplay was often compared to "<a href="Baldur%27s%20Gate">Baldur's Gate</a>", another Interplay game that used the same engine as "Planescape: Torment." Robert Mayer of <a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a> commented that it was "one dark and interesting game. There's lots of macabre humor, some rather deviant sexual references, and enough weirdness to send the devotees of Tolkienesque fantasy running for their copies of "The Hobbit"." Kieron Gillen of <a href="PC%20Gamer%20%28UK%20edition%29">PC Gamer UK</a> commented that ""Planescape: Torment" is attempting to be iconoclastic in the most stereotyped of genres. We're cheering it on."

The game's premise and writing were warmly received; a review in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" noted "The game's level of detail and its emotional impact have prompted some players to cast about for literary peers." Reviewers were pleased with the ability to shape their character's journey as they wished. In 2005, GameSpot stated ""Planescape: Torment" has quite possibly the best implementation of role-playing an evil character ever to appear in a computer or video game to date". The heavily tattooed, egocentric and potentially selfish Nameless One was welcomed as a change of pace from the conventional RPG hero, who was considered a predictable do-gooder. Reviewers also approved of the protagonist's ability to gain new powers by "remembering" past lives. The dark and diversified representation of the "D&D" setting of Planescape was lauded as a fresh departure from the traditional high fantasy of computer role-playing games. A review in "<a href="Next%20Generation%20Magazine">NextGen</a>" praised the game, saying that ""Torment" offers the best RPG gameplay anyone can find on store shelves, hands down." Uros Jojic of "Actiontrip" commented that ""Planescape: Torment" proves that it is possible to make an inventive, fun and refreshing game in this "sea of clones". Creating a computer edition of Planescape system is another triumph for Black Isle Studios." In a March 2000 article for "Game Studies", Diane Carr called the game's setting "a freak show, a long story, a zoo, and a cabinet of talkative curiosities" and described the creatures and monsters in the game as "grotesque rather than scary". Cindy Yans of <a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a> describes the setting as "a world where knowledge and thoughts wield more power than the sword. Belief has the ability to reshape worlds, kill and resurrect powers and change the laws of physics." Cindy Vanous of Computer Games Magazine notes that ""Planescape"'s bestiary features legions of the unknown, and its landscape is an ever-changing tapestry of the bizarre." "Planescape: Torment" is the first video game to be set in the Planescape universe.

The technical aspects of the game were also praised. Although by the time of its release in late 1999, "Planescape: Torment's" default 640x480 resolution was not considered particularly advanced, reviewers were pleased with the art design and color of the environments. The game's sound and music were described as "well above the norm" and "superb", and one reviewer stated that his only complaint about the music was that "there wasn't enough of it". Another reviewer stated that "Planescape: Torment" had "just about the best sound" they had heard in a video game. <a href="GamePro">GamePro</a> stated, "... the characters talk with the talent of real professional voice actors during crucial bits of dialog". The game's graphics were moderately well received, with "incite PC Gaming" saying that "[the graphics] can be a little lackluster, although some of the spell effects certainly look very good", a statement echoed in "NextGen" which stated that "mind-blowing spell effects ... will remind you of a two-dimensional "Final Fantasy" game."

The game's interface received positive remarks. The US edition of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" commented on the <a href="automap">automap</a>, which automatically marked important locations and allowed the user to add custom notes, and on the journal, which separated completed quests from unfinished quests. "PC Gamer" also praised the fine-tuning of the Infinity Engine, such as the use of a <a href="Pie%20menu">radial menu</a>, which allowed the player to stay focused on the game instead of managing multiple screens and "messing with windows and buttons".

Criticism of the game was minimal and problems were generally described as minor, but included complaints about long load times on computers of the day, or the game slowing down during combat. <a href="Software%20bug">Bugs</a> were responsible for slowing down the game when a high level of graphical assets were on-screen at the same time, but it was reported that a fix was released that solved the problem. <a href="Allgame">Allgame</a>'s Derek Williams considered the game's combat simplistic (with a comparison to "<a href="Diablo%20%28video%20game%29">Diablo</a>)", which made the game too easy. The most negative major review came from "Eurogamer", who gave the game seven out of ten (and later increased it to eight when the game was patched). Their reviewer expressed distaste at the immortality of the player character, saying that it made the lives of characters "cheap and meaningless", although other reviews welcomed this aspect, saying it was "implemented perfectly" and did not make the game easier. "Eurogamer" also disapproved of the amount of experience that was awarded for certain dialogues later in the game. However, other reviews cited this as one of the main things that elevated "Planescape: Torment" above the standard RPG format. Some reviewers also criticized the game's <a href="pathfinding">pathfinding</a> <a href="artificial%20intelligence">AI</a> as being "less than impressive".

"Planescape: Torment" was given several Editor's Choice awards, was named RPG of the Year for 1999 by both GameSpot and "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>", and won the <a href="Vault%20Network">Vault Network</a>'s Game of the Year for 1999. "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer US</a>" named "Planescape: Torment" "Game of the Month" in their March 2000 issue (the issue in which the game's review appeared). The magazine also nominated "Torment" for its 1999 "Best Roleplaying Game" award, which ultimately went to "<a href="System%20Shock%202">System Shock 2</a>".

"Planescape: Torment" is widely considered to be one of the <a href="greatest%20video%20games%20of%20all%20time">greatest video games of all time</a> and has attracted a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>.

In 2006, "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" included "Planescape: Torment" in their list of "11 of Video Gaming's Strangest Moments", due to the game's use of death as a means to advance the plot. In 2006, <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> polled <a href="video%20game%20industry">video game industry</a> professionals with the question: "Which role playing game over the entire history of the genre do you think has made the biggest 'quantum leap', and why?". "Planescape: Torment" was ranked second overall after "<a href="Fallout%20%28video%20game%29">Fallout</a>", earning it a "Quantum Leap Award". The game also received an honorable mention for the same awards in the "Storytelling" category. In December 2008, IGN listed it as 8th out of 10 in a list of "Franchises We Want Resurrected" and praised the game as having "some of the best writing and characterization seen in gaming".

In 2009, <a href="Bit-tech">Bit-tech</a> included "Planescape: Torment" on their list of "30 PC Games to Play Before You Die". Chris Avellone was awarded Eurogamer's "Gaming Globe" award for Best Designer in 2000 for his work on "Planescape: Torment", and The Nameless One was considered to be the Best Male Lead Character. In 2009, "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" put the game 188th on their list of "The Top 200 Games of All Time", saying that it "allowed players to ... influence the plot to an unheard-of degree for 1999". In 2010, <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO</a> ranked it as #5 on the list of games needing a sequel. A 2011 update of "PC Gamer" magazine's top 100 PC games of all-time ranked "Planescape: Torment" as the 19th greatest PC game.

IGN ranked "Planescape: Torment" second on their list of "The Top 11 Dungeons & Dragons Games of All Time" in 2014. Ian Williams of "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" rated the game #1 on his list of "The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames" in 2015. "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" included "Torment" on their best RPGs on PC list. It was placed at No. 13 on "Game Informer" "Top 100 RPGs Of All Time" list, and was included among <a href="PCGamesN">PCGamesN</a>'s "best RPGs on PC" as well.

In the United States, "Planescape: Torment" sold 73,000 copies by March 2000, a figure that Desslock of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" regarded as substandard. Comparing the game's commercial performance to that of "", Desslock remarked that "most of "Torment"s sales have been in the year 2000, while "Ascension"s sales were predominently in 1999, even though "Ascension" was released later in 1999 than "Torment"." He attributed "Torment"s relative sales growth in its second year to positive reviews and <a href="word%20of%20mouth">word of mouth</a>.

In the United Kingdom, "Torment" appeared at #3 on <a href="Chart-Track">Chart-Track</a>'s weekly computer game sales list for the January 9–15, 2000 period. The game remained in the Chart-Track weekly top 5 for another two weeks, and secured a third-place debut on the firm's monthly top 10. Richie Shoemaker of "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" noted at the time, "January saw only one new release make an impact: the bizarre role-player from Black Isle Studios, "Planescape: Torment"." In the German market, the game sold 50,000 units by mid-2000, after debuting at #6 on the charts in January. It proceeded to claim positions 12, 30 and 53 from February through April. According to "<a href="PC%20Player%20%28German%20magazine%29">PC Player</a>", Virgin Interactive was "only slightly disappointed" by its commercial performance in the region; writer Udo Hoffman noted that the game by nature was tailored to "a more mature and therefore smaller target group."

Ernest Adams of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> later described "Torment"s overall performance as a "commercial disappointment". According to Chris Avellone, the game was not a major monetary success, but was ultimately profitable. In 2017, Brian Fargo estimated the game's lifetime retail sales as roughly 400,000 units.

The game was re-released on DVD in 2009, and for purchase on <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> on September 28, 2010 . Following the announcement of "", <a href="Beamdog">Beamdog</a>'s <a href="Overhaul%20Games">Overhaul Games</a> announced their intention to make overhauls of more games set in the "Dungeons & Dragons" universes, at first naming only "Planescape: Torment". They said that such a release would depend on the success of "Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition". In November 2012, "Penny Arcade Report" wrote that <a href="Brian%20Fargo">Brian Fargo</a>, the head of <a href="inXile%20Entertainment">inXile Entertainment</a>, had acquired the rights to "Torment". In January 2013, Brian Fargo announced that the <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a>, titled "", was in production and would be set in the <a href="Numenera">Numenera</a> universe created by <a href="Monte%20Cook">Monte Cook</a>. The game's design was led by <a href="Colin%20McComb">Colin McComb</a>, who helped design both the "Planescape" setting and "Torment", and was released in February 2017.

"Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition", an upgraded version of the game, was created by <a href="Beamdog">Beamdog</a> and released on April 11, 2017 . It was announced in March 2017 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> PCs, as well as for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> devices. It features similar improvements that Beamdog has done for the other enhanced editions. Avellone provided assistance by helping to curate the improvements to the game. Beamdog had access to the original source code and design documents for the game, and through that were able to recover and include some content that was dropped from the original release, using Avellone's assistance to flesh out parts that were incomplete or missing, they otherwise did not significantly change the game, with the studio's CEO Trent Oster saying that their work was comparable to "basically going in and repainting the smile on the Mona Lisa here". It was also nominated in the "Game, Classic Revival" category at the 2017 <a href="NAVGTR">NAVGTR</a> Awards.

Ranavalona I

Ranavalona I (born Rabodoandrianampoinimerina; 1778 – August 16, 1861), also known as Ramavo and Ranavalo-Manjaka I, was sovereign of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Madagascar">Kingdom of Madagascar</a> from 1828 to 1861. After positioning herself as queen following the death of her young husband and second cousin, <a href="Radama%20I">Radama I</a>, Ranavalona pursued a policy of <a href="isolationism">isolationism</a> and self-sufficiency, reducing economic and political ties with European powers, repelling a French attack on the coastal town of <a href="Mahavelona">Foulpointe</a>, and taking vigorous measures to eradicate the small but growing <a href="Christianity%20in%20Madagascar">Malagasy Christian movement</a> initiated under Radama I by members of the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a>. She made heavy use of the traditional practice of "<a href="Corv%C3%A9e">fanompoana</a>" (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 <a href="Merina">Merina</a> soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the realm. The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign.

Although greatly obstructed by Ranavalona's policies, French and British political interests in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Madagascar">Madagascar</a> remained undiminished. Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited in an attempt to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, <a href="Radama%20II">Radama II</a>. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as expressed in the <a href="Joseph-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lambert%23Lambert%20Charter">Lambert Charter</a> he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.

Ranavalona's European contemporaries generally condemned her policies and characterized her as a tyrant at best and insane at worst. 

Princess Ramavo was born in 1778 at the royal residence at <a href="Ambatomanoina">Ambatomanoina</a>, about east of <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>, to Prince Andriantsalamanjaka and Princess Rabodonandriantompo. When Ramavo was still a young girl, her father alerted King <a href="Andrianampoinimerina">Andrianampoinimerina</a> (1787–1810) to an assassination plot planned by <a href="Andrianjafy">Andrianjafy</a>, the king's uncle, whom Andrianampoinimerina had forced from the throne at the royal city of <a href="Ambohimanga">Ambohimanga</a>. In return for saving his life, Andrianampoinimerina betrothed Ramavo to his son, Prince <a href="Radama%20I">Radama</a>, whom the king designated as his heir. He furthermore declared that any child from this union would be first in the line of succession after Radama.

Despite her elevated rank among the royal wives, Ramavo was not the preferred wife of Radama and did not bear him any children. Upon Andrianampoinimerina's death in 1810, Radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among Ramavo's relatives, an act that may have strained their relationship. Unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage, the neglected Ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with <a href="David%20Griffiths%20%28missionary%29">David Griffiths</a> and his fellow missionaries in Griffiths' home. These visits established a deep friendship between Ramavo and Griffiths that was to endure for three decades.

When Radama died without leaving any descendants on July 27, 1828, according to <a href="Andriamanelo%23Rules%20of%20succession">local custom</a>, the rightful heir was Rakotobe, the eldest son of Radama's eldest sister. An intelligent and amiable young man, Rakotobe was the first pupil to have studied at the <a href="Education%20in%20Madagascar">first school</a> established by the <a href="London%20Missionary%20Society">London Missionary Society</a> in Antananarivo on the grounds of the royal palace. Radama died in the company of two trusted courtiers who were favorable to the succession of Rakotobe. However, they hesitated to report the news of Radama's death for several days, fearing possible reprisals against them for having been involved in denouncing one of the king's rivals, whose family had a stake in the succession after Radama. During this time, another courtier, a high-ranking military officer named Andriamamba, discovered the truth and collaborated with other powerful officers – Andriamihaja, Rainijohary and Ravalontsalama – to support Ramavo's claim to the throne.
These officers hid Ramavo and one of her friends in a safe location, then secured the support of several influential power brokers, including judges and the keepers of the "<a href="sampy">sampy</a>" (royal idols). The officers then rallied the army behind Ramavo, such that on August 11, 1828, when she declared herself the successor to Radama on the pretense that he himself had decreed it, there could be no immediate resistance. Ramavo took the throne name Ranavalona ("folded", "kept aside"), then followed royal custom by systematically capturing and putting to death her political rivals, including Rakotobe, his family, and other members of Radama's family, much as Radama had done to the queen's own family upon his succession to the throne. Her coronation ceremony took place on June 12, 1829.

By succeeding her husband, Ranavalona became the first female sovereign of the <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">Kingdom of Imerina</a> since its founding in 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the "<a href="Vazimba">Vazimba</a>", described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of <a href="Andriamanelo">Andriamanelo</a> (1540–1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen <a href="Rafohy">Rafohy</a> (1530–1540).

Ranavalona's 33-year reign was characterized by her effort to strengthen the domestic authority of the Kingdom of Imerina over subjugated provinces and preserve the political and cultural sovereignty of Madagascar. These policies were enacted in a context of increasing European influence within her kingdom and competing French and English bids for domination over the island. Early in her reign, the queen took incremental steps to distance Madagascar from the purview of European powers, first putting an end to a friendship treaty with Britain, then placing increasing restrictions on the activities of the missionaries of the London Missionary Society, who operated schools where basic education and trade skills were taught in addition to the <a href="Christianity%20in%20Madagascar">Christian religion</a>. In 1835 she forbade the practice of Christianity among the Malagasy population, and within a year nearly all foreigners had left her territory.

Putting an end to most foreign trade relationships, the queen pursued a policy of self-reliance, made possible through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of "<a href="Corv%C3%A9e">fanompoana</a>"—forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods. Ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor, Radama I, in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island, and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will. Due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns, high death rates among "fanompoana" workers, and harsh traditions of justice under her rule, the population of Madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833 and 1839, and from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829 and 1842 in Imerina. These statistics have contributed to a strongly unfavorable view of Ranavalona's rule in historical accounts.

In the tradition of many of her <a href="List%20of%20Malagasy%20monarchs">royal Merina predecessors</a>, the queen ruled from the <a href="Rova%20of%20Antananarivo">royal Rova compound</a> in Antananarivo. Between 1839 and 1842, <a href="Jean%20Laborde">Jean Laborde</a> built the queen a new residence called Manjakamiadana, which became the largest structure on the Rova grounds. The residence was made entirely from wood and bore most of the features of a <a href="Architecture%20of%20Madagascar%23Merina%20aristocratic%20tradition">traditional home</a> of the Merina "<a href="andriana">andriana</a>" (aristocratic class), including a central pillar ("andry") to support the roof. In other ways it showcased distinctly European innovations, as it contained three floors entirely surrounded by wooden verandas and incorporated dormers in the shingled roof. The palace was eventually to be encased in stone in 1867 by <a href="James%20Cameron%20%28missionary%29">James Cameron</a> of the London Missionary Society during the reign of <a href="Ranavalona%20II">Ranavalona II</a>. The original wooden palace of Ranavalona and virtually all other structures of the historic Rova compound were destroyed in a 1995 fire, leaving only the stone shell to mark where her palace had once stood.

In many respects, Ranavalona's rule was a continuation of precedent established under Radama I. Both monarchs encouraged the introduction of new technologies and forms of knowledge from abroad, supported the establishment of an industrialized economy, and adopted measures to professionalize the army. Both viewed foreigners with ambivalence, establishing close personal relationships and drawing upon their expertise while enforcing restrictions on their activities to avert destabilizing changes to existing cultural and political systems. In addition, both contributed to the further development of a complex political bureaucracy that enabled the Merina court to govern remote provinces across an island larger than <a href="metropolitan%20France">metropolitan France</a>.

Ranavalona maintained the tradition of ruling with the support of advisers drawn largely from the aristocratic class. The queen's most powerful ministers were also her consorts. Her first chief adviser was a young army officer from <a href="Twelve%20sacred%20hills%20of%20Imerina%23Hill%20of%20Namehana">Namehana</a> named Andriamihaja, who served as First Minister from 1829 to 1830. Major-General Andriamihaja most likely fathered the queen's only son, Prince Rakoto (later King Radama II), who was born eleven months after the death of his official father, King Radama I. In the early years of Ranavalona's reign, Andriamihaja was the leader of her court's progressive faction, who favored maintaining the relations with Europe initiated under Radama. The conservative faction was led by the brothers Rainimaharo and <a href="Rainiharo">Rainiharo</a>, the latter being the official guardian of one of the most powerful royal "sampy". These talismans were believed to embody and channel the supernatural powers of the kingship and had played a major role in the spiritual life of the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina people</a> since at least the 16th century reign of <a href="Ralambo">Ralambo</a>. The conservative faction conspired to reduce Andriamahaja's progressive influence over the queen, and in September 1830 they managed to persuade her while highly intoxicated to sign his death warrant for charges of witchcraft and treason. He was immediately captured in his home and killed.

Following Andriamihaja's death, the influence of Radama's old guard of progressives was eclipsed by that of conservative advisers at court, who grew ever closer to the queen, eventually resulting in Ranavalona's marriage to "sampy" guardian and conservative figurehead Field Marshal Rainiharo (also called Ravoninahitriniarivo) of <a href="Twelve%20sacred%20hills%20of%20Imerina%23Hill%20of%20Ilafy">Ilafy</a> in 1833. Rainiharo gained initial access to the court through his father, Andriantsilavonandriana, a "<a href="Hova%20%28Madagascar%29">hova</a>" (commoner) who had exceptionally been accorded the privilege of joining King Andrianampoinimerina's inner circle of noble advisers. Field Marshal Rainiharo served as the queen's First Minister from 1830 to 1832, then Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief from 1832 to 1852. Upon Rainiharo's death, the queen wed another conservative, Field Marshal Andrianisa (also called Rainijohary), who remained Ranavalona's husband until her death in 1861. He served as Prime Minister from 1852 to 1862 before being exiled to the royal city of <a href="Ambohimanga">Ambohimanga</a> for his part in a plot against the queen's son, Radama II.

Traditionally, Merina sovereigns relied on the pronouncement of "<a href="kabary">kabary</a>" (oratory) in public gatherings to communicate policy and reaffirm the relationship between sovereign and public. Due in part to her lack of experience in public speaking and politics, Ranavalona preferred to direct and inform her subordinates through letters that she dictated to missionary-educated court scribes. She strengthened her relationship with the public through occasional kabary and fulfilled the traditional role of the Merina sovereign as bestower of "<a href="Hasina%20%28Madagascar%29">hasina</a>" (ancestral blessings) by enacting traditional rituals, including the "<a href="fandroana">fandroana</a>" (new year ritual of renewal), tributes to the royal idols, and offerings of "<a href="Andriamanelo%23Vodiondry">vodiondry</a>" and "<a href="Malagasy%20cuisine%23Prior%20to%201650">jaka</a>" beef at customary occasions. Ranavalona innovated on these traditional rituals by increasing their complexity and symbolism to imbue them with added significance.

Queen Ranavalona continued the military incursions initiated under Radama I to pacify neighboring kingdoms and maintain their submission to Merina rule. These policies had a strongly negative effect on economic and population growth during her reign. "Fanompoana" labor among the population of Imerina could include conscription into the military, enabling the queen to raise a standing army that was estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers. This army, which was sent on repeated expeditions into neighboring provinces, exacted harsh penalties against communities resistant to Merina domination. Mass executions were common, and those who were spared their lives were commonly brought back to Imerina as slaves ("andevo") and their valuables seized as booty to increase the wealth of the Crown. Approximately one million slaves entered Imerina from coastal areas between 1820 and 1853, constituting one-third of the total population in the central highlands and two-thirds of all residents in Antananarivo.

According to Madagascar historian Gwyn Campbell, the number of non-Merina who died in violent conflict during the military campaigns of Ranavalona and her predecessor Radama from 1816 to 1853 was estimated at about 60,000. Additionally, a considerable proportion of the population not killed in battle in the subjugated provinces eventually died from famine as a consequence of <a href="scorched%20earth">scorched earth</a> policies. Deaths among the Merina soldiers engaged in military actions were also high, estimated at about 160,000 for the period 1820–1853. A further 25–50% of the queen's soldiers stationed in lowland areas were estimated to have died each year due to diseases such as malaria. Although prevalent in the coastal parts of the island, malaria was uncommon in the high-altitude zone around Antananarivo, and Merina soldiers possessed little natural resistance against it. An average of 4,500 soldiers died each year for the greater part of Ranavalona's reign, contributing to severe depopulation in Imerina.

One of the chief measures by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of <a href="Trial%20by%20ordeal">trial by the ordeal</a> of "<a href="tangena">tangena</a>". A poison was extracted from the nut of the native "tangena" ("<a href="Cerbera%20manghas">Cerbera manghas</a>") shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while among members of the slave class ("andevo"), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, in the eyes of the greater populace, the "tangena" ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.

Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of "tangena" was routinely obligatory. On average, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of those who underwent the ordeal died. In the 1820s, the "tangena" ordeal caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina died as a result of the "tangena" ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population. Although outlawed in 1863, the ordeal continued to be practiced secretly in Imerina and openly in other parts of the island.

Following a visit by Radama I to Madagascar's first formal school, established in <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a> in 1818 by members of the London Missionary Society (LMS), the king invited the first Christian artisan missionaries to the capital city to share their knowledge. Beginning in December 1820, LMS missionaries established workshops in Antananarivo to teach brick-making, European carpentry and other practical skills, and developed a <a href="Education%20in%20Madagascar">network of public schools</a> where numeracy and English were taught alongside literacy using portions of the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy language</a> Bible. Despite high attendance at the schools, the LMS were initially unsuccessful in converting pupils to <a href="Christianity%20in%20Madagascar">Christianity</a>. Near the end of Radama's reign, the king came to regard the few Malagasy who had been converted as irreverent toward royal authority. He forbade Malagasy people from being baptized or attending Christian services.

Ranavalona's succession initially resulted in a relaxation of state control over Christianity. A printing press, which was imported by LMS missionaries at the end of Radama's reign, was only effectively put into operation in 1828. The press was in heaviest use during the first several years of Ranavalona's reign, when thousands of hymnals and other materials were transcribed and printed. Translation of the New Testament was completed in the second year of her reign, and 3,000 copies were printed and distributed between 1829 and 1830. From the beginning of her reign, Ranavalona forbade the distribution of books within the military to prevent subversion and preserve discipline. She allowed missionaries free rein in operating the printing press, however, and exempted from military service all Malagasy personnel trained to operate the press. In 1835, translation of the Old Testament was completed and the first copies were printed. The freedom allowed to LMS and Malagasy Christians to print religious materials and teach religion in the state schools during the first six years of Ranavalona's reign allowed the religion to become firmly established among a small but growing group of converts in and around the capital. In 1831 Ranavalona authorized Malagasy attendance at church services, administration of the sacrament, and baptism of her subjects. Within a year, hundreds of Malagasies were baptized; these converts were drawn from all social classes, including slaves, commoners, respected elders, court officials and even sampy guardians, who were considered the bulwarks of traditional culture.

The conversion of major religious, political and social leaders sparked a backlash that led Ranavalona to become increasingly wary of the political and cultural effects of Christianity, which she saw as leading the Malagasy to forsake the ancestors and their traditions. In October and November 1831 the queen enacted a ban on Christian marriages, baptisms, and church services for soldiers and members of government studying in the Missionary schools, and in December extended the ban on church service attendance to all Malagasy. From 1832 to 1834, baptisms and church services continued, increasingly in secret. During this time, several Christians each year were charged with witchcraft and exiled or made to undergo the tangena ordeal, and Ranavalona requested the departure of three missionaries, retaining only those whose particular technical skills she viewed as valuable to the state. In 1835, the queen attempted to shut down the press without directly targeting the LMS by banning Malagasy personnel from working at the printing house. The LMS missionaries, capitalizing on the absence of legal decrees against their own work at the press, managed to continue independently printing and distributing materials.

In a kabary speech on February 26, 1835, Queen Ranavalona formally forbade the practice of Christianity among her subjects. In her discourse, she was careful to differentiate between her own people, for whom the new religion was forbidden and its practice a capital offense, and foreigners, to whom she permitted freedom of religion and conscience. She furthermore acknowledged the valuable intellectual and technological contributions that European missionaries had made to the advancement of her country, and invited them to continue working to that end on the condition that their proselytizing would cease:

The majority of the London Missionary Society missionaries, whose primary activity was teaching Christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the Bible as the principal Malagasy-language text, departed the island. James Cameron and other key missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize. The last two remaining missionaries chose to continue teaching practical skills in the hope that the restrictions might loosen, but one year later, after receiving indirect information that the government desired their departure, they shuttered the LMS mission and left Madagascar.

Pursuant to the February 26 decree, those who possessed a Bible, worshiped in congregation or continued to profess adherence to Christianity were fined, jailed, manacled, subjected to <a href="trial%20by%20ordeal">trial by ordeal</a>, or executed. Lurid accounts of the execution and torture of Christians were reported by missionaries with informants on the island who placed emphasis on what they perceived as the savagery of the Queen's actions. For instance, they reported the public execution of 15 Christian leaders near the Queen's palace who were dangled on ropes 150 feet above a rock-filled ravine before the ropes were cut upon their refusal to renounce Christianity. The Andohalo cathedral was constructed on this outcropping to commemorate early Malagasy Christians martyred at the site. The precise number of Malagasy citizens put to death for religious reasons during Ranavalona's reign is difficult to state with certainty. British missionary to Madagascar W.E. Cummins (1878) places the number executed at between 60 and 80. Far more were required to undergo the "tangena" ordeal, condemned to hard labor, or stripped of their land and property, and many of these died. Persecution of Christians intensified in 1840, 1849 and 1857; in 1849, deemed the worst of these years by Cummins, 1,900 people were fined, jailed or otherwise punished for their Christian faith, of whom 18 were executed.

Ranavalona's reign was marked by a struggle between France and Britain to secure control over Madagascar. The French, who held several small islands off Madagascar, were interested in gaining control over the main island but this move was opposed by the British who had an interest in maintaining a safe passage to India. Ranavalona pursued a policy of self-reliance to limit the influence of these foreign powers.

Shortly after taking the throne, Ranavalona annulled the Anglo-Merina treaty that had been concluded between Radama and British envoys, and refused to continue receiving annual payments from Britain in exchange for adherence to the stipulations of the treaty. The most significant of these conditions was the kingdom's non-participation in the international slave trade, which had historically been a major source of revenue for the kingdoms of Imerina, <a href="Betsimisaraka%20people">Betsimisaraka</a>, <a href="Sakalava">Sakalava</a> and others across the island. One consequence of the termination of the Anglo-Merina friendship treaty was an end to the delivery of British weaponry, which rendered the queen vulnerable to designs against her from foreign powers and pockets of local resistance alike. This vulnerability was underscored in 1829 when a fleet of six French ships launched an unprovoked attack against the fort of <a href="Mahavelona">Foulpointe</a> and the nearby town of Ivondro on the eastern coast of Madagascar. The queen's army successfully repelled the French at the next port, forcing the ships to <a href="%C3%8Ele%20Sainte-Marie">Île Sainte-Marie</a>, where they engaged a diplomatic envoy sent from Antananarivo by Ranavalona. The protracted negotiations ensured the French suffered from the malaria prevalent in coastal areas, until the increasing casualties forced the ships' withdrawal from Ranavalona's territory.

It came to the Queen's attention that Frenchman <a href="Jean%20Laborde">Jean Laborde</a>, who had been shipwrecked off Madagascar in 1832, was knowledgeable in the production of cannons, muskets and gunpowder. Ranavalona provided him with the labor and materials to establish factories that met the material needs of her army, thereby ending the kingdom's dependence on Europe for modern weaponry.

The French were eager to hasten Radama II's succession in the interest of capitalizing on the Lambert Charter, an 1855 agreement between French representative <a href="Joseph-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lambert">Joseph-François Lambert</a> and Radama that could only come into effect upon the prince's succession. The charter guaranteed Lambert and his business associates first rights to the exploitation of many of the island's commodities and natural resources. According to a British account, Lambert conspired with Jean Laborde and local leaders to persuade Radama II to sign a document written in French—a language in which the prince was not fluent—which Lambert orally translated as containing only an account of the excessive pressures the Queen's policies were placing on her subjects. Radama, who was sympathetic toward the commoners and interested in easing their burden but suspicious about the letter's true purpose, reluctantly signed the document under intense pressure from the French. He was not told the letter included a request for French military intervention that could have potentially brought Madagascar under French rule. France did not however intend to take such an action without the accord of Britain, whose influence had been so well-established on the island, and refused to intercede on behalf of the prince. In the meantime, Radama, who had been made to swear on the Bible not to speak of the letter to anyone, had grown concerned enough to contact a British diplomat, thereby revealing the true circumstances under which the letter had been signed. The British refused to cooperate in the French plot, and an attack was averted. According to Lambert, however, the prince had indeed been an enthusiastic partner in the bid to end Ranavalona's reign, and his own true feelings about the endeavor had been deliberately misrepresented through a British campaign of propaganda.

Having failed to gain the backing of a European state power to place Radama on the throne and bring the treaty into effect, Lambert decided to instigate a "coup d'état" independently. He traveled to Ranavalona's court in May 1857 in the company of the celebrated 19th-century Austrian globetrotter <a href="Ida%20Pfeiffer">Ida Pfeiffer</a>, who became an unwitting participant in the plot. She documented her perspective on these events in one of her late works. According to Pfeiffer, Radama and Lambert had planned to dethrone the queen on June 20, when ministers and soldiers loyal to Radama would infiltrate the Rova grounds and declare loyalty to the prince and support for a political transition. Pfeiffer blamed the failure of the plot on <a href="Rainilaiarivony">Rainilaiarivony</a>, then Commander-in-Chief of the army who reportedly had been unable to ensure the presence of soldiers in the courtyard who were loyal to Radama. According to a British account, however, Radama himself was credited with warning the queen of the plot, in which his cooperation was merely a ploy to entrap the conspirators. This British view claims that Ranavalona deliberately allowed the plot to unfold almost to its conclusion in order to ascertain the loyalties of her members of government. After the plot's discovery, the Europeans were largely confined to their houses on the palace grounds and prohibited from receiving visitors, until an order was issued to immediately and permanently quit the queen's territory in late July.

While the queen had designated her son, Radama II, as her successor, Rainimaharo and the conservative faction knew of his progressive leanings and tried instead to ensure the queen's nephew, Ramboasalama, would come to power and maintain loyalties to them and their political agenda. The progressive brothers <a href="Rainivoninahitriniony">Rainivoninahitriniony</a> and Rainilaiarivony, who were the queen's co-prime minister and head of the army respectively at the time of her death, supported the succession of Radama and were able to exercise greater influence than Ramboasalama, particularly in ensuring the support of the army for the prince's claim to the throne. As Ranavalona lay on her death bed, Radama took precautions to ensure his succession would be uncontested, surrounding his residence at the Rova of Antananarivo with several hundred soldiers and sending a member of Ramboasalama's family to bring him to the Rova to swear a public oath of allegiance to the new king, to whom he submitted.

On August 16, 1861, Ranavalona died in her sleep at the Manjakamiadana palace in the Rova of Antananarivo. Twelve thousand <a href="zebu">zebu</a> were slaughtered and their meat distributed to the populace in her honor, and the official mourning period lasted nine months. Her body was laid in a coffin made of silver <a href="piastre">piastre</a>s in a tomb at the royal city of Ambohimanga. During her funeral, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined for use in the ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three historic royal residences in the Nanjakana section of the compound where the event was held. In 1897, French colonial authorities disinterred and moved the queen's body and the remains of other Merina sovereigns to the tombs at the Rova of Antananarivo in an attempt to desanctify Ambohimanga. Her bones were placed within the tomb of Queen <a href="Rasoherina">Rasoherina</a>. Her son, Prince Rakoto, succeeded her as King Radama II.

Ranavalona's traditionalist policies were abruptly reversed under the reign of her son, King Radama II. A widespread epidemic of "spirit possession" throughout Imerina followed Radama's public conversion to Christianity and was popularly attributed to the outraged spirit of Ranavalona I.

The queen's foreign contemporaries strongly condemned her policies and viewed them as the actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s. Although Ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic tyrant, in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and cultural sovereignty of her nation from European encroachment. In Madagascar today, the Malagasy of the central highlands hold complex and diverse views ranging across this spectrum. Most condemn her reign, in line with negative depictions of Ranavalona in current Malagasy history textbooks; this view is most common among Malagasy Christians. Others admire her effort to preserve Malagasy traditions and independence. The majority, regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies, consider her a remarkable figure in Malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with European powers.

A fictionalized account of Ranavalona and her court appears in the novel "<a href="Flashman%27s%20Lady">Flashman's Lady</a>" by <a href="George%20MacDonald%20Fraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a>. The main character, an English soldier and agent named <a href="Harry%20Paget%20Flashman">Harry Paget Flashman</a>, becomes Ranavalona's military adviser and lover.

Maiden Castle, Dorset

Maiden Castle is an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a> south west of <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a>, in the English county of <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. Hill forts were fortified hill-top settlements <a href="Hillforts%20in%20Britain">constructed across Britain during the Iron Age</a>.

The earliest <a href="archaeology">archaeological</a> evidence of human activity on the site consists of a <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> <a href="causewayed%20enclosure">causewayed enclosure</a> and <a href="bank%20barrow">bank barrow</a>. In about 1800 BC, during the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, the site was used for growing crops before being abandoned. Maiden Castle itself was built in about 600 BC; the early phase was a simple and unremarkable site, similar to many other hill forts in Britain and covering . Around 450 BC it was greatly expanded and the enclosed area nearly tripled in size to , making it the largest hill fort in Britain and, by some definitions, the largest in Europe. At the same time, Maiden Castle's defences were made more complex with the addition of further <a href="defensive%20wall">rampart</a>s and <a href="ditch%20%28fortification%29">ditches</a>. Around 100 BC, habitation at the hill fort went into decline and became concentrated at the eastern end of the site. It was occupied until at least the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman period</a>, by which time it was in the territory of the <a href="Durotriges">Durotriges</a>, a <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic tribe.

After the <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">Roman conquest of Britain</a> in the 1st century AD, Maiden Castle appears to have been abandoned, although the Romans may have had a military presence on the site. In the late 4th century AD, a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed. In the 6th century AD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period.

Maiden Castle has provided inspiration for composer <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28composer%29">John Ireland</a> and authors <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> and <a href="John%20Cowper%20Powys">John Cowper Powys</a>. The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist <a href="Augustus%20Pitt%20Rivers">Augustus Pitt Rivers</a>. In the 1930s, archaeologist <a href="Mortimer%20Wheeler">Mortimer Wheeler</a> and <a href="Tessa%20Wheeler">Tessa Verney Wheeler</a> undertook the first <a href="archaeology">archaeological excavations</a> at Maiden Castle, raising its profile among the public. Further excavations were carried out under Niall Sharples, which added to an understanding of the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large number of visitors. Today the site is protected as a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a> and is maintained by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>.

Before the hill fort was built, a <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> <a href="causewayed%20enclosure">causewayed enclosure</a> was constructed on the site. Dating from around <a href="4th%20millennium%20BC">4000 BC</a>, it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches, It is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps. These gaps, and the bank being only high, indicate the site would not have been defensive. Instead the ditches may have been symbolic, separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside. Archaeologist Niall Sharples, who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s, has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure's position. Situated on the side of the hill, it would have been visible from several miles away, and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside. The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming. The site does not appear to have been inhabited, although a grave containing the remains of two children, aged 6–7, has been discovered. The enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site.

The purpose of Neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear, and they probably had a variety of functions. In addition to the burials, which indicate the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas to the east and west was found here, indicating that the site was a meeting place that attracted people over long distances. <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3,400 BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end.

Within a period of about 50 years, a <a href="bank%20barrow">bank barrow</a> was built over the enclosure. It was a long mound of earth with a ditch on either side; the parallel ditches were apart. Many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased, but as the barrow at Maiden Castle did not cover any burials, scholars have suggested that it was a boundary marker. This would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 years after the bank barrow's construction. Around 1,800 BC, during the early <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, the hill was cleared and used to grow crops, but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned. This period of abandonment lasted until the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, when the hill fort was built. The bank barrow survived into the Iron Age as a low mound, and throughout this period construction over it was avoided.

Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the <a href="1st%20millennium%20BC">first millennium BC</a>. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been defensive sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and resulting pressure on agriculture. 

Since the 1960s, the dominant view has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze. As a result, trading patterns shifted, and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. 

Archaeologist <a href="Barry%20Cunliffe">Barry Cunliffe</a> believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that 
"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction".

There are around 31 hill forts in Dorset; archaeologist Sharples, who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle, proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community. Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land. Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control. This is supported by Cunliffe, who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and <a href="Danebury">Danebury</a> were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort. They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway, which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with <a href="Sling%20%28weapon%29">slings</a>. Hoards of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites.

Constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 BC, the first hill fort at Maiden Castle was a area surrounded by a single ditch. The hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the South Winterborne valley, which feeds the <a href="River%20Frome%2C%20Dorset">River Frome</a>. At the eastern end of the ridge and rising above sea level, the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge. The highest point is the neighbouring Hog Hill, which is only higher. The hill <a href="Topographic%20prominence">projects</a> about above the surrounding countryside, which is about above sea level. The defences were high and consisted of the V-shaped ditch and a rampart. The rampart would probably have been timber-faced around just the entrances. Elaborate timber facing would have been used to impress visitors. The site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east. The double entrance is unique in hill forts in the British Isles. The reason for a double entrance is unclear; however, archaeologist Niall Sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation. It is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances.

The defences of the first hill fort were rebuilt on at least one occasion; the ditch was deepened by . The <a href="Earthworks%20%28engineering%29">spoil</a> from re-digging the ditch was deposited on the back of the rampart. At the same time, the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex. A bank and ditch were built outside the two entrances, and a bank was erected between them. The bank had a wall faced with limestone, which was brought from more than away. Sharples believes this would have created an impressive entrance and was a demonstration of the settlement's high status. The Early Iron Age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site. However, nearby <a href="Poundbury">Poundbury</a> and <a href="Chalbury%20Hill%20Fort">Chalbury</a> date to the same period, so through comparison it is possible to infer the Early Iron Age activity at Maiden Castle. From parallels at these sites, Sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied, with separate areas for habitation and storage. Not much is known about the <a href="Archaeological%20culture">material culture</a> and economy of the Early Iron Age, and the paucity of finds from this period at Maiden Castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site.

In the Early Iron Age, Maiden Castle was generally unexceptional; it was one of over 100 hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, Dorset, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, and <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. In the Middle Iron Age, Maiden Castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. According to archaeologist Niall Sharples it is, by some definitions, the largest in western Europe. In about 450 BC, Maiden Castle was expanded from . The area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch, with the bank standing high although the ditch was shallow. The hill fort's expansion was not unique; it was one of a series of "developed hill forts" in southern England. As some hill forts were expanded, many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the Early Iron Age fell out of use, as was the case in Dorset. The developed hill forts in Dorset were spaced widely apart. This, and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built, indicates that these developed hill forts were important. The developed hill forts of Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire were equally spaced apart, with roughly equal access to resources such as water.

The emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to Iron Age society becoming more complex. The emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries, possibly through warfare. However, a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic. Hill forts may have become important as centres of trade. This is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts (the technical term for which is "<a href="Hill%20fort%23Types%20of%20hill%20fort">multivallate</a>") were likely to be not just defensive; so many ditches and ramparts, such as those at Maiden Castle, were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority. Developed hill forts were generally densely occupied; this is best demonstrated at Danebury, where 57% of the site has been excavated. While developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors, they were not all equal. Cunliffe states that the Maiden Castle's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts.
Maiden Castle expanded westwards, and the ditch was extended to enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill. The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new, larger hill fort were separated by a <a href="dry%20valley">dry valley</a>. A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source. Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to , work began on making the defences more elaborate. The existing rampart was heightened to , and more ramparts and ditches were added. On the south of the fort, four ramparts and three ditches were added, but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill, the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round, and only three ramparts were built on the northern side. At the same time, the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks, lengthening the approach to the site.

The four-post structures common in hill forts throughout England are also found in Maiden Castle. Their purpose on this site is uncertain however, since at square they have been considered by archaeologists to be too small for dwellings; as a result, it has been concluded that these structures were probably granaries. The presence of granaries suggests that the fort was used to control the area's food supply. Little evidence has been discovered for houses in Maiden Castle during the site's reconstruction in the 5th century BC; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence. It appears that houses were not built near the ramparts until after the defences were complete. Maiden Castle was occupied throughout the Iron Age and its inhabitants lived in <a href="Roundhouse%20%28dwelling%29">roundhouse</a>s. The later houses appear to be organised in rows, and to be roughly similar in size, a reorganisation which indicates the increasing power of the elites over Iron Age society.

Bronze objects such as pins, jewellery, and rivets have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no local source of tin and copper ore, this demonstrates long distance trade, probably with the southwest. Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle, there is evidence of it being reworked. Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area, but the hill fort does not appear to have been a centre for iron production in this period; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production. Early in the Iron Age, most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally – within about  – however later on sources further afield became more important, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the pottery came from the area around <a href="Poole%20Harbour">Poole Harbour</a>, more than away. This long-range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities. Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage, Cunliffe and fellow-archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as "town-like settlements", a form of proto-urbanism.

Across Britain, many hill forts fell out of use in the 100 years around the turn of the millennium. It has been suggested that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.

Around 100 BC, Maiden Castle's organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation. At the same time, the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in the east of the fort. Also during the Late Iron Age, some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance, and into the areas between the banks. Excavations by archaeologist <a href="Mortimer%20Wheeler">Mortimer Wheeler</a> in this area revealed several houses, storage pits, an area used for iron working, and a cemetery. On the industrial site, more than of iron slag was discovered in an area of , and it is believed the site produced around of iron. The amount of ore required could not have been supplied by local sources, so most likely originated from areas of specialist iron production such as the <a href="Weald">Weald</a>, south west England, and Wales. Maiden Castle is one of the most important iron production sites from the Late Iron Age in southern Britain.

There is little evidence for burial in the Iron Age until late on in the period, and it is believed that the prevalent method of disposing of a body was by <a href="excarnation">excarnation</a>. Wheeler's excavations on the cemetery in the eastern gateway revealed 52 burials, but only part of the cemetery was investigated, so the total number of burials is likely to be at least double this figure. One area of the cemetery featured burials of 14 people who had died in violent circumstances, including one body with a Roman catapult bolt in its back. Wheeler used the "war cemetery", as he described it, as evidence of a Roman attack on Maiden Castle.

In AD 43, the <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">Roman conquest of Britain</a> began. Vespasian's subsequent campaign to conquer the tribes of the <a href="Atrebates">Atrebates</a>, <a href="Dumnonii">Dumnonii</a>, and Durotriges in the southwest of Britain took place in AD 43–47. Based on the discovery of a group of bodies in the Late Iron Age formal cemetery that had met a violent death, archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler created a vivid story of the fall of Maiden Castle to Roman forces. He believed a legion wreaked destruction on the site, butchering men, women, and children, before setting fire to the site and <a href="slighting">slighting</a> its defences. However, there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events, or even that the hill fort was attacked by the Romans. Although there is a layer of charcoal, it is associated with the iron works, and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort. Although 14 bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death, there is no evidence that they died at Maiden Castle. 

The eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation, although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain. Many 1st-century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort. It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or <a href="castra">fort</a> and the settlement discontinued, as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces. This was a characteristic of <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>'s campaign in the region; there was military occupation at <a href="Cadbury%20Castle%2C%20Somerset">Cadbury Castle</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, <a href="Hembury">Hembury</a> in <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, and <a href="Hodd%20Hill">Hodd Hill</a> in Dorset.

Maiden Castle had been abandoned by the end of the 1st century, a time when "<a href="Durnovaria">Durnovaria</a>" (Dorchester) rose to prominence as the "<a href="civitas">civitas</a>", or regional capital, of the <a href="Durotriges">Durotriges</a>, a Celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest England. However, in July 2015 archaeologists from <a href="Bournemouth%20University">Bournemouth University</a> discovered the remains of the Iron Age settlement of <a href="Duropolis">Duropolis</a> and believe that the abandonment of the fort may be connected with the new site. According to the ancient geographer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, writing in the 2nd century AD, "Dunium" was the main settlement of the Durotriges. Although "Dunium" has long been thought to refer to Maiden Castle, <a href="Hod%20Hill">Hod Hill</a> and <a href="Hengistbury">Hengistbury</a> have been identified as two other possible sites for "Dunium". "Dunium" may have derived from <a href="British%20language%20%28Celtic%29">British</a> "duno-" which meant "a fort". Sometime after 367, a Romano-Celtic temple was built at Maiden Castle in the eastern half of the hill fort. The date was deduced from a hoard of coins discovered beneath a mosaic floor in the temple. A central room, measuring square, was surrounded by a passageway, similar to many Romano-Celtic temples found in the south of England. Nearby were two other buildings: a rectangular building with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest, and a circular building that may have been a shrine. At the same time as the temple was built, the fort's eastern gateway was refurbished; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway.

The 4th-century temple gradually fell into disuse and Maiden Castle was used predominantly as pasture. There is evidence for activity on the site in the form of a few post-Roman or Anglo Saxon burials, some possibly Christian, but the hill fort was not reused as a settlement. In the 16th and 17th centuries, a barn was built over the "war cemetery". The only other significant activity on the hill top after the Romans was a short period of cultivation in the 17th century, as demonstrated by traces of <a href="ridge%20and%20furrow">ridge and furrow</a> caused by ploughing.

The modern name for the hill fort is first recorded in 1607 as "Mayden Castell"; it is not unique to the site and occurs in several other places in Britain and is widely taken to mean a "fortification that looks impregnable" or one that has never been taken in battle. Alternatively, the name may derive from the <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Brittonic</a> "mai-dun", meaning a "great hill". A more recent explanation has been advanced by <a href="Richard%20Coates">Richard Coates</a> suggesting that the name is only of <a href="medieval">medieval</a> origin, and was applied simultaneously to the considerable number of <a href="Maiden%20Castle%20%28disambiguation%29">identically named locations</a> around the country.

Over the following centuries, the site was abandoned completely and became open pasture, although it was of interest to <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a>s. <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, who built <a href="Max%20Gate">his house</a> within sight of it, described the castle in a short story, "Ancient Earthworks and What Two Enthusiastic Scientists Found Therein" (1885) about a local antiquarian who spent much time investigating the site. In 1921, composer <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28composer%29">John Ireland</a> wrote "Mai-Dun", a symphonic rhapsody, about the hill fort in Dorset. <a href="John%20Cowper%20Powys">John Cowper Powys</a> wrote a novel titled "<a href="Maiden%20Castle%20%28novel%29">Maiden Castle</a>" in 1936, which was set in Dorset.

The first widespread investigation of hill forts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under the direction of <a href="Augustus%20Pitt-Rivers">Augustus Pitt-Rivers</a>, but it was not until the 1930s that Maiden Castle was methodically investigated, the first large-scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort. Between 1934 and 1937, <a href="Mortimer%20Wheeler">Mortimer Wheeler</a> and <a href="Tessa%20Wheeler">Tessa Verney Wheeler</a> excavated both the interior and the defences, work that was funded almost entirely by donations from the public. Wheeler's use of the media to disseminate information about the site resulted in Maiden Castle becoming well known. It was one of about 80 hill forts to have been excavated by 1940, in a period known as "hill fort mania" during the 1920s and 1930s.

Between 1985 and 1986 further excavations under Niall Sharples were prompted by the hill fort's deteriorating condition, partly caused by the large number of visitors to the site. Under the auspices of <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>, repair work and archaeological investigations were undertaken concurrently. Techniques such as radiocarbon dating were available to Sharples that were unavailable to Wheeler, allowing the site to be dated. The structure was made a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a> in 1981, giving Maiden Castle protection against unauthorised change; it is now maintained by English Heritage. With parking facilities and information boards for visitors, Maiden Castle is open to the public all year round. Today, the site is in the <a href="Civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil parish</a> of <a href="Winterborne%20Monkton">Winterborne Monkton</a> at .

in 1921, the English composer <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28composer%29">John Ireland</a> (18791962) wrote the <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> "<a href="Mai-Dun">Mai-Dun</a>, A Symphonic Rhapsody" about the place, adopting Hardy's name for it. In 1931, Ireland arranged his piece for <a href="piano%20four%20hands">piano four hands</a>.

Marble Madness

Marble Madness is an <a href="arcade%20game">arcade</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> designed by <a href="Mark%20Cerny">Mark Cerny</a> and published by <a href="Atari%20Games">Atari Games</a> in 1984. The player uses a <a href="trackball">trackball</a> to guide an onscreen marble through six obstacle-filled courses within a time limit. "Marble Madness" was Atari's first game to use the <a href="Atari%20System%201">Atari System 1</a> hardware and to be programmed in the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C programming language</a>. It was also one of the first games to use true <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereo sound</a>; previous games used either <a href="monaural">monaural</a> sound or <a href="Duophonic">simulated stereo</a>.

Cerny drew inspiration from <a href="miniature%20golf">miniature golf</a>, <a href="Racing%20video%20game">racing game</a>s, and artwork by <a href="M.%20C.%20Escher">M. C. Escher</a>. He applied a <a href="Minimalism">minimalist</a> approach in designing the appearance of the game's courses and enemies.

"Marble Madness" was commercially successful. The game was ported to numerous platforms and inspired the development of other games. A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991 but canceled when location testing showed the game could not compete with other titles.

"Marble Madness" is an <a href="Isometric%20video%20game%20graphics">isometric</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> in which the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a <a href="trackball">trackball</a>, though most home versions use <a href="game%20controller">game controller</a>s with <a href="D-pad">directional pads</a>. The aim of the game is for the player to complete six maze-like, isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock at the end of a race is carried over to the next one, and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.

As the game progresses, the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles. Each course has a distinct visual theme. For example, the first race (titled "Practice") is a simple course that is much shorter than the others, while the fifth race (named "Silly") features polka-dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite that of the other courses.

"Marble Madness" was developed by <a href="Atari%20Games">Atari Games</a>, with <a href="Mark%20Cerny">Mark Cerny</a> as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer. Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game. It uses the <a href="Atari%20System%201">Atari System 1</a> hardware, an interchangeable system of circuit boards, control panels, and artwork. The game features <a href="raster%20graphics">pixel graphics</a> on a 19-inch <a href="Electrohome">Electrohome</a> G07 model <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT monitor</a>, and uses a <a href="Motorola%2068010">Motorola 68010</a> <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a> (CPU) with a <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">MOS Technology 6502</a> subsystem to control the audio and coin operations. "Marble Madness" was Atari's first game to use an <a href="Frequency%20modulation%20synthesis">FM</a> <a href="sound%20chip">sound chip</a> produced by <a href="Yamaha%20Corporation">Yamaha</a>, which is similar to a <a href="Yamaha%20DX7">Yamaha DX7</a> <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a> and creates the music in real time so that it is in <a href="synchronization">synchronization</a> with the game's on-screen action. The game's music was composed by <a href="Brad%20Fuller%20%28composer%29">Brad Fuller</a> and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the capabilities of the sound chip.

Cerny and Flanagan first collaborated on a video game based on <a href="Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Thriller%20%28music%20video%29">Michael Jackson's "Thriller"</a>. The project was canceled and the two began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became "Marble Madness". Development lasted 10 months. Following the <a href="North%20American%20video%20game%20crash%20of%201983">North American video game crash of 1983</a>, video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience through the use of a unique control system and by emphasizing a <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">simultaneous two-player</a> mode. Cerny designed "Marble Madness" in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by <a href="miniature%20golf">miniature golf</a> and captivated by the idea that a play field's contours influenced the ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of <a href="Racing%20video%20game">racing game</a>s and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to a race against time.

The development toolkit for the Motorola CPU included a <a href="compiler">compiler</a> for the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C programming language</a>, which the two programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language. Cerny and Flanagan's decision to program "Marble Madness" in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a>. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of 30 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a> instead of the normal 60 Hz frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a trackball system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and he chose a motorized trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari's design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball's design had an inherent flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and the use of a regular trackball was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>-based <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> to be animated by the CPU, but the available hardware was a less-advanced system using <a href="Read%20Only%20Memory">ROM</a>-based, static sprites.

These technical limitations forced Cerny to simplify the overall designs. Inspired by <a href="M.%20C.%20Escher">M. C. Escher</a>, he designed abstract landscapes for the courses. In retrospect, Cerny partly attributed the designs to his limited artistic skills. He was a fan of the <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D graphics</a> used in "<a href="Battlezone%20%281980%20video%20game%29">Battlezone</a>" and "<a href="I%2C%20Robot%20%28video%20game%29">I, Robot</a>", but felt that the visuals lacked definition and wanted to create a game with "solid and clean" 3D graphics. Unlike most other arcade games of the time, the course images were not drawn on the <a href="pixel">pixel</a> level. Instead, Cerny defined the elevation of every point in the course and stored this information in a <a href="heightmap">heightmap</a> array. The course graphics were then created by a <a href="Ray%20tracing%20%28graphics%29">ray tracing</a> program that traced the path of light rays, using the heightmap to determine the appearance of the course on screen. This format also allowed Cerny to create shadows and use <a href="spatial%20anti-aliasing">spatial anti-aliasing</a>, a technique that provided the graphics with a smoother appearance. Cerny's course generator allowed him more time to experiment with the level designs. When deciding what elements to include in a course, practicality was a big factor; elements that would not work or would not appear as intended were omitted, such as an elastic barricade or a teeter-totter scale. Other ideas dropped from the designs were breakable glass supports, black hole traps, and bumps and obstacles built into the course that chased the marble.

Cerny's personal interests changed throughout the project, leading to the inclusion of new ideas absent from the original design documents. The game's enemy characters were designed by Cerny and Sam Comstock, who also animated them. Enemies had to be small in size due to technical limitations. Cerny and Comstock purposely omitted faces to give them unique designs and create a minimalistic appearance similar to the courses. Atari's management, however, suggested that the marble should have a smiley face to create an identified character, similar to <a href="Pac-Man">Pac-Man</a>. As a compromise, the cabinet's artwork depicts traces of a smiley face on the marbles. Flanagan programmed a three-dimensional <a href="Computer%20simulation">physics model</a> to dictate the marble's motions and an <a href="Interpreter%20%28computing%29">interpreted</a> script for enemy behavior. As "Marble Madness" neared completion, the feedback from Atari's in-house <a href="Focus%20group">focus testing</a> was positive. In retrospect, Cerny wished he had included more courses to give the game greater longevity, but extra courses would have required more time and increased hardware costs. Atari was experiencing severe financial troubles at the time and could not extend the game's development period as it would have left their production factory idle.

"Marble Madness" was commercially successful following its December 1984 release and was positively received by critics. Around 4,000 cabinets were sold, and it soon became the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that Atari tracked the game's success. Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to "Marble Madness"s short gameplay length. He believed that players lost interest after mastering it and moved on to other games. The arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare. Stan Szczepanski holds the official world record of 187,880 points.

Many reviewers felt that the high level of skill required to play the game was part of its appeal. In 1996, "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" ranked the arcade version of "Marble Madness" as number 15 on their "Top 100 Games of All Time", explaining that "The Genesis conversion was cool, but ultimately the "Marble Madness" experience just doesn't happen with a <a href="Gamepad">joypad</a>. This ... is a game that has to be played in the arcade to be appreciated." In 2008, Levi Buchanan of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> listed "Marble Madness" as one of several titles in his "dream arcade", citing the game's difficulty and the fond memories he had playing it. Author John Sellers wrote that difficulty was a major reason that players were attracted. Other engaging factors included the graphics, visual design, and the soundtrack. "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>"s Craig Grannell, in referring to the game as one of the most distinctive arcade games ever made, praised its visuals as "pure and timeless". In 2008, "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" listed it as the number seventy-nine arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact. "Marble Madness" was one of the first games to use true <a href="Stereophonic%20sound">stereo sound</a> and have a recognizable musical score. British composer <a href="Paul%20Weir">Paul Weir</a> commented that the music had character and helped give the game a unique identity. A common complaint about the arcade cabinet was that the track ball controls frequently broke from repeated use.

"Marble Madness" inspired other games that feature similar gameplay based on navigating a ball through progressively more difficult courses; such games are often described in terms that relate them to "Marble Madness". <a href="Krome%20Studios%20Melbourne">Melbourne House's</a> "<a href="Gyroscope%20%28video%20game%29">Gyroscope</a>" and <a href="Electric%20Dreams%20Software">Electric Dreams Software</a>'s "<a href="Spindizzy%20%28video%20game%29">Spindizzy</a>" were the first such games; both met with a good reception. In 1990, Rare released "<a href="Snake%20Rattle%20%27n%27%20Roll">Snake Rattle 'n' Roll</a>", which incorporated elements similar to "Marble Madness". The <a href="Super%20Monkey%20Ball">"Super Monkey Ball" series</a> uses similar gameplay based on rolling a ball, but adds other features such as <a href="minigame">minigame</a>s and monkey characters. <a href="Archer%20Maclean%27s%20Mercury">Archer Maclean's Mercury</a> also contains many elements similar to Marble Madness, but with minor variations, including the ability to change color, added hazards, and that the player controls a blob of liquid mercury rather than a marble.

Beginning in 1986, the game was <a href="Porting">ported</a> to numerous platforms with different companies handling the conversions; several home versions were published by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="Tiger%20Electronics">Tiger Electronics</a> released handheld and tabletop <a href="Liquid%20crystal%20display">LCD</a> versions of the game, and it was ported to the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> by <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>. The Commodore 64 version had a secret extra level not present in other versions.

Early versions featured simplified graphics, and the different ports were met with mixed reception. John Harris of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> thought the arcade's popularity fueled the sales of the home versions, while Thomas Hanley of <a href="ScrewAttack">ScrewAttack</a> commented that most versions were not as enjoyable without a track ball. Grannell echoed similar statements about the controls and added that many had poor visuals and <a href="collision%20detection">collision detection</a>. He listed the <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a>, <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a>, and <a href="Sega%20Mega%20Drive">Sega Mega Drive</a> ports as the better conversions, and the Sinclair <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a>, and <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> versions among the worst. "<a href="Compute%21">Compute!</a>" writers called the Amiga version's graphics and gameplay "arcade-quality". "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" stated that the Amiga version was superior to the arcade original. <a href="Bruce%20Webster">Bruce Webster</a> of "<a href="BYTE">BYTE</a>" wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of "Marble Madness" in December 1986 "are really amazing". While criticizing the lack of a pause function or a top scores list, he stated that it "is definitely worth having if you own an Amiga". <a href="Bil%20Herd">Bil Herd</a> recalled that the Amiga version was so popular at <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore International</a> that employees stole the required memory expansion from colleagues' computers to run the game. He wrote "Not an Amiga" on his <a href="Commodore%20128D">Commodore 128D</a> so others would not open it looking for Amiga memory. "<a href="Info%20%28magazine%29">Info</a>" gave the Amiga version four-plus stars out of five, describing it as "a totally faithful adaptation". It gave the Commodore 64 version three-plus stars out of five, describing it as "just a shadow of the arcade original and the excellent Amiga version" and inferior to "<a href="Spindizzy%20%28video%20game%29">Spindizzy</a>". The magazine liked the graphics but criticized "marbles that handle like intoxicated turtles". "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon</a>"s three reviewers—Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser—praised the <a href="Apple%20IIGS">Apple II</a> port, calling it a "must have" title for arcade fans.

"<a href="MegaTech">MegaTech</a>" reviewers rated the Sega Mega Drive release a favorable 73%. In 2003, "Marble Madness" was included in the multi-platform title "<a href="Midway%20Arcade%20Treasures">Midway Arcade Treasures</a>", a compilation of classic games developed by <a href="WMS%20Industries">Williams Electronics</a>, <a href="Midway%20Games">Midway Games</a>, and Atari Games. Electronic Arts released a <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a> port in 2010 that includes additional levels with different themes and new items that augment the gameplay. "Marble Madness" was also included in the 2012 multi-platform compilation "<a href="Midway%20Arcade%20Origins">Midway Arcade Origins</a>". A port of the game is also playable in <a href="Lego%20Dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a> via an Arcade Dock in the level "Prime Time" and in the Midway Arcade World after unlocking it.

The "Info" review concluded, "Our only hope is that someone, somewhere, may be working (at this very moment) on ... MARBLE MADNESS II !!!" An arcade sequel titled "Marble Man: Marble Madness II" was planned for release in 1991, though Cerny was uninvolved in the development. Development was led by Bob Flanagan who designed the game based on what he felt made "Marble Madness" a success in the home console market. Because the market's demographic was a younger audience, Flanagan wanted to make the sequel more accessible and introduced "Marble Man", which expanded upon the gameplay of the original game. The design also included pinball mini-games between sets of levels and allowed up to three players to traverse isometric courses. Its final wave is called "King of the Mountain". Flanagan intended to address the short length of the first game and, with the help of Mike Hally, developed seventeen courses.

Atari created prototypes for location testing, but the game did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20II">Street Fighter II</a>". Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to "<a href="Guardians%20of%20the%20%27Hood">Guardians of the 'Hood</a>", a <a href="beat%20%27em%20up">beat 'em up</a> game. An <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a> states that when <a href="WMS%20Industries">WMS Industries</a> purchased <a href="Time%20Warner%20Interactive">Time Warner Interactive</a> (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a <a href="steamroller">steamroller</a> over the "Marble Madness II" boards in order to clear inventory for tax purposes. In actuality, no "Marble Madness II" boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become <a href="Collectable">collector items</a>.

Peregrine falcon

The peregrine falcon ("Falco peregrinus"), also known as the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, is a widespread <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a> (raptor) in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Falconidae. A large, <a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">crow</a>-sized <a href="falcon">falcon</a>, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. As is typical of <a href="avivore">bird-eating</a> raptors, peregrine falcons are <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, with females being considerably larger than males. The peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over during its characteristic hunting stoop (high-speed dive), making it the <a href="Fastest%20animals">fastest member of the animal kingdom</a>. According to a "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">National Geographic</a>" TV programme, the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is .

The peregrine's breeding range includes land regions from the <a href="Arctic%20tundra">Arctic tundra</a> to the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>. It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth, except extreme <a href="polar%20region">polar region</a>s, very high mountains, and most <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. This makes it the world's most widespread raptor, and one of the most widely found bird species. In fact, the only land-based bird species found over a larger geographic area is not always naturally occurring, but one widely introduced by humans, the <a href="rock%20pigeon">rock pigeon</a>, which in turn now supports many peregrine populations as a prey species. The peregrine is a highly successful example of <a href="urban%20wildlife">urban wildlife</a> in much of its range, taking advantage of tall buildings as nest sites and an abundance of prey such as pigeons and ducks. Both the English and <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a>s of this <a href="species">species</a> mean "wandering falcon," referring to the <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> habits of many northern populations. Experts recognize 17 to 19 <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, which vary in appearance and range; disagreement exists over whether the distinctive <a href="Barbary%20falcon">Barbary falcon</a> is represented by two subspecies of "Falco peregrinus," or is a separate species, "F. pelegrinoides". The two species' divergence is relatively recent, during the time of the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a>, therefore the genetic differential between them (and also the difference in their appearance) is relatively tiny. They are only about 0.6–0.8% genetically differentiated.

While its diet consists almost exclusively of medium-sized birds, the peregrine will occasionally hunt small mammals, small reptiles, or even insects. Reaching sexual maturity at one year, it <a href="mates%20for%20life">mates for life</a> and nests in a <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a>, normally on cliff edges or, in recent times, on tall human-made structures. The peregrine falcon became an endangered species in many areas because of the widespread use of certain pesticides, especially <a href="DDT">DDT</a>. Since the ban on DDT from the early 1970s, populations have recovered, supported by large-scale protection of nesting places and releases to the wild.

The peregrine falcon is a well respected <a href="falconry">falconry</a> bird due to its strong hunting ability, high trainability, versatility, and – in recent years – availability via <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a>. It is effective on most <a href="game%20bird">game bird</a> species, from small to large.

The peregrine falcon has a body length of and a wingspan from . The male and female have similar markings and <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, but as in many <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> the peregrine falcon displays marked <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male. Males weigh and the noticeably larger females weigh . In most subspecies, males weigh less than and females weigh more than , with cases of females weighing about 50% more than their male breeding mates not uncommon. The standard linear measurements of peregrines are: the wing chord measures , the tail measures and the tarsus measures .

The back and the long pointed wings of the adult are usually bluish black to slate grey with indistinct darker barring (see "Subspecies" <a href="%23species">below</a>); the wingtips are black. The white to rusty underparts are barred with thin clean bands of dark brown or black. The tail, coloured like the back but with thin clean bars, is long, narrow, and rounded at the end with a black tip and a white band at the very end. The top of the head and a "moustache" along the cheeks are black, contrasting sharply with the pale sides of the neck and white throat. The <a href="cere">cere</a> is yellow, as are the feet, and the <a href="beak">beak</a> and <a href="claw">claw</a>s are black. The upper beak is notched near the tip, an <a href="adaptation%20%28biology%29">adaptation</a> which enables falcons to kill prey by severing the <a href="Cervical%20vertebrae">spinal column</a> at the neck. The immature bird is much browner with streaked, rather than barred, underparts, and has a pale bluish cere and orbital ring.

"Falco peregrinus" was first described under its current <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a> by English ornithologist <a href="Marmaduke%20Tunstall">Marmaduke Tunstall</a> in his 1771 work "Ornithologia Britannica". The scientific name "Falco peregrinus" is a <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> phrase that was used by <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> in 1225. The specific name is taken from the fact that juvenile birds were taken while journeying to their breeding location rather than from the nest, as falcon nests were difficult to get at. The Latin term for falcon, , is related to , meaning "<a href="sickle">sickle</a>", in reference to the silhouette of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.

The peregrine falcon belongs to a <a href="genus">genus</a> whose lineage includes the <a href="hierofalcon">hierofalcon</a>s and the <a href="prairie%20falcon">prairie falcon</a> ("F. mexicanus"). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons towards the end of the <a href="Late%20Miocene">Late Miocene</a> or in the <a href="Early%20Pliocene">Early Pliocene</a>, about 5–8 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a> (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> confounding <a href="mtDNA">mtDNA</a> <a href="DNA%20sequence">sequence</a> analyses. For example, a genetic lineage of the <a href="saker%20falcon">saker falcon</a> ("F. cherrug") is known which originated from a male saker producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.

Today, peregrines are regularly paired in captivity with other species such as the <a href="lanner%20falcon">lanner falcon</a> ("F. biarmicus") to produce the "<a href="perilanner">perilanner</a>", a somewhat popular bird in <a href="falconry">falconry</a> as it combines the peregrine's hunting skill with the lanner's hardiness, or the <a href="gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a> to produce large, strikingly coloured birds for the use of falconers. As can be seen, the peregrine is still genetically close to the hierofalcons, though their lineages diverged in the <a href="Late%20Pliocene">Late Pliocene</a> (maybe some 2.5–2 mya in the <a href="Gelasian">Gelasian</a>).

Numerous <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "Falco peregrinus" have been described, with 19 accepted by the 1994 "<a href="Handbook%20of%20the%20Birds%20of%20the%20World">Handbook of the Birds of the World</a>", which considers the <a href="Barbary%20falcon">Barbary falcon</a> of the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> and coastal North <a href="Africa">Africa</a> to be two subspecies ("pelegrinoides" and "babylonicus") of "Falco peregrinus," rather than a distinct species, "F. pelegrinoides." The following map shows the general ranges of these 19 subspecies:




Two of the subspecies listed above ("Falco peregrinus pelegrinoides" and "F. p. babylonicus") are often instead treated together as a distinct <a href="species">species</a>, "Falco pelegrinoides" (the <a href="Barbary%20falcon">Barbary falcon</a>), although they were included within "F. peregrinus" in the 1994 "<a href="Handbook%20of%20the%20Birds%20of%20the%20World">Handbook of the Birds of the World</a>". These birds inhabit <a href="arid">arid</a> regions from the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> along the rim of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> through the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> to <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> and <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>.

Barbary falcons have a red neck patch but otherwise differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to <a href="Gloger%27s%20Rule">Gloger's Rule</a>, relating <a href="pigmentation">pigmentation</a> to <a href="climate">environmental humidity</a>. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only the outer part of its wings like <a href="fulmar">fulmar</a>s sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's <a href="shoulder">shoulder</a> and <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed at different times of year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but they are capable of interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.

Another subspecies of "Falco peregrinus, madens," has also sometimes been treated instead within a separately recognized "F. pelegrinoides."

The peregrine falcon lives mostly along <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a>s, <a href="river%20valley">river valley</a>s, <a href="coastline">coastline</a>s, and increasingly in <a href="cities">cities</a>. In mild-winter regions, it is usually a permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, will remain on the breeding territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic <a href="climate">climate</a>s typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.

The peregrine falcon reaches faster speeds than any other animal on the planet when performing the stoop, which involves soaring to a great height and then diving steeply at speeds of over , hitting one wing of its prey so as not to harm itself on impact. The air pressure from such a dive could possibly damage a bird's <a href="lung">lung</a>s, but small bony tubercles on a falcon's nostrils are theorized to guide the powerful airflow away from the nostrils, enabling the bird to breathe more easily while diving by reducing the change in air pressure. To protect their eyes, the falcons use their <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>s (third eyelids) to spread tears and clear debris from their eyes while maintaining vision. A study testing the flight physics of an "ideal falcon" found a theoretical speed limit at for low-altitude flight and for high-altitude flight. In 2005, Ken Franklin recorded a falcon stooping at a top speed of .

The life span of peregrine falcons in the wild is up to 15.5 years. Mortality in the first year is 59–70%, declining to 25–32% annually in adults. Apart from such <a href="Human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic</a> threats as <a href="bird%20collision%20%28disambiguation%29">collision</a> with human-made objects, the peregrine may be killed by larger <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and <a href="owl">owl</a>s.

The peregrine falcon is <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> to a range of <a href="parasitism">parasites</a> and <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s. It is a <a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vector</a> for <a href="Avipoxvirus">Avipoxvirus</a>, <a href="Newcastle%20disease%20virus">Newcastle disease virus</a>, <a href="Falconid%20herpesvirus%201">Falconid herpesvirus 1</a> (and possibly other <a href="Herpesviridae">Herpesviridae</a>), and some <a href="mycoses">mycoses</a> and <a href="bacterial%20infection">bacterial infection</a>s. <a href="Endoparasite">Endoparasite</a>s include "<a href="Plasmodium%20relictum">Plasmodium relictum</a>" (usually not causing <a href="malaria">malaria</a> in the peregrine falcon), <a href="Strigeidae">Strigeidae</a> <a href="trematode">trematode</a>s, "<a href="Serratospiculum%20amaculata">Serratospiculum amaculata</a>" (<a href="nematode">nematode</a>), and <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a>s. Known peregrine falcon <a href="ectoparasite">ectoparasite</a>s are <a href="chewing%20lice">chewing lice</a>, "<a href="Ceratophyllus%20garei">Ceratophyllus garei</a>" (a <a href="flea">flea</a>), and <a href="Hippoboscidae">Hippoboscidae</a> flies ("<a href="Icosta%20nigra">Icosta nigra</a>", "<a href="Ornithoctona%20erythrocephala">Ornithoctona erythrocephala</a>").

The peregrine falcon feeds almost exclusively on medium-sized birds such as <a href="Columbidae">pigeons and doves</a>, <a href="waterfowl">waterfowl</a>, <a href="songbird">songbird</a>s, and <a href="wader">wader</a>s. Worldwide, it is estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 bird species (up to roughly a fifth of the world's bird species) are predated somewhere by these falcons. In North America, prey has varied in size from <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a>s ("<a href="Selasphorus">Selasphorus</a>" and "<a href="Archilochus%20%28bird%29">Archilochus</a>" ssp.) to a <a href="sandhill%20crane">sandhill crane</a> (killed in Alaska by a peregrine in a stoop), although most prey taken by peregrines weigh from (small <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s) to (such as <a href="duck">duck</a>s and <a href="gull">gull</a>s). The peregrine falcon takes the most diverse range of bird species of any raptor in North America, with more than 300 species having fallen victim to the falcon, including nearly 100 <a href="shorebird">shorebird</a>s. Smaller <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and <a href="owl">owl</a>s are regularly predated, mainly smaller falcons such as the <a href="American%20kestrel">American kestrel</a>, <a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">merlin</a> and <a href="sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned hawk</a>s. In urban areas, the main component of the peregrine's diet is the <a href="rock%20pigeon">rock</a> or <a href="feral%20pigeon">feral pigeon</a>, which comprise 80% or more of the dietary intake for peregrines in some cities. Other common city birds are also taken regularly, including <a href="mourning%20dove">mourning dove</a>s, <a href="common%20wood%20pigeon">common wood pigeon</a>s, <a href="common%20swift">common swift</a>s, <a href="northern%20flicker">northern flicker</a>s, <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a>s, <a href="American%20robin">American robin</a>s, <a href="common%20blackbird">common blackbird</a>s, and <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s (such as <a href="magpie">magpie</a>s or <a href="Carrion%20crow">carrion</a>, <a href="House%20crow">house</a>, and <a href="American%20crow">American crow</a>s). Other than bats taken at night, the peregrine rarely hunts mammals, but will on occasion take small species such as <a href="rat">rat</a>s, <a href="vole">vole</a>s, <a href="hare">hare</a>s, <a href="shrew">shrew</a>s, <a href="mouse">mice</a> and <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s. Coastal populations of the large subspecies "pealei" feed almost exclusively on <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s. In the Brazilian <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> swamp of <a href="Cubat%C3%A3o">Cubatão</a>, a wintering falcon of the subspecies "tundrius" was observed while successfully hunting a juvenile <a href="scarlet%20ibis">scarlet ibis</a>. Insects and reptiles make up a small proportion of the diet, which varies greatly depending on what prey is available.

The peregrine falcon hunts most often at dawn and dusk, when prey are most active, but also nocturnally in cities, particularly during migration periods when hunting at night may become prevalent. Nocturnal migrants taken by peregrines include species as diverse as <a href="yellow-billed%20cuckoo">yellow-billed cuckoo</a>, <a href="black-necked%20grebe">black-necked grebe</a>, <a href="virginia%20rail">virginia rail</a>, and <a href="common%20quail">common quail</a>. The peregrine requires open space in order to hunt, and therefore often hunts over open water, <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es, <a href="valley">valley</a>s, fields, and <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, searching for prey either from a high perch or from the air. Large congregations of migrants, especially species that gather in the open like shorebirds, can be quite attractive to hunting peregrines. Once prey is spotted, it begins its stoop, folding back the tail and wings, with feet tucked. Prey is typically struck and captured in mid-air; the peregrine falcon strikes its prey with a clenched foot, stunning or killing it with the impact, then turns to catch it in mid-air. If its prey is too heavy to carry, a peregrine will drop it to the ground and eat it there. If they miss the initial strike, peregrines will chase their prey in a twisting flight. Although previously thought rare, several cases of peregrines contour-hunting, i.e. using natural contours to surprise and ambush prey on the ground, have been reported and even rare cases of prey being pursued on foot. In addition, peregrines have been documented preying on chicks in nests, from birds such as kittiwakes. Prey is plucked before consumption. A recent study showed the presence of peregrines benefits non-preferred species while at the same time causing a decline in its preferred prey. As of 2018, the fastest recorded falcon was at 242 mph (nearly 390 km/h). Researchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and at Oxford University used 3D computer simulations in 2018 to show that the high speed allows peregrines to gain better maneuverability and precision in strikes.

The peregrine falcon is sexually mature at one to three years of age, but in healthy populations they breed after two to three years of age. A pair <a href="mates%20for%20life">mates for life</a> and returns to the same nesting spot annually. The courtship flight includes a mix of aerial acrobatics, precise spirals, and steep dives. The male passes prey it has caught to the female in mid-air. To make this possible, the female actually flies upside-down to receive the food from the male's talons.

During the breeding season, the peregrine falcon is territorial; nesting pairs are usually more than apart, and often much farther, even in areas with large numbers of pairs. The distance between nests ensures sufficient food supply for pairs and their chicks. Within a breeding territory, a pair may have several nesting ledges; the number used by a pair can vary from one or two up to seven in a 16-year period.
The peregrine falcon nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges. The female chooses a nest site, where she scrapes a shallow hollow in the loose soil, sand, gravel, or dead vegetation in which to lay eggs. No nest materials are added. Cliff nests are generally located under an overhang, on ledges with vegetation. South-facing sites are favoured. In some regions, as in parts of <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and on the west coast of northern North America, large tree hollows are used for nesting. Before the demise of most European peregrines, a large population of peregrines in central and western Europe used the disused nests of other large birds. In remote, undisturbed areas such as the Arctic, steep slopes and even low rocks and mounds may be used as nest sites. In many parts of its range, peregrines now also nest regularly on tall buildings or bridges; these human-made structures used for breeding closely resemble the natural cliff ledges that the peregrine prefers for its nesting locations.

The pair defends the chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against <a href="raven">raven</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s, and <a href="gull">gull</a>s, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s, <a href="felid">felid</a>s, <a href="bear">bear</a>s, <a href="gray%20wolf">wolves</a>, and <a href="mountain%20lion">mountain lion</a>s. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, large <a href="Horned%20owl">owls</a>, or <a href="gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a>s. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a> and the <a href="Eurasian%20eagle%20owl">Eurasian eagle owl</a>. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s and <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come too close to the nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a <a href="snowy%20owl">snowy owl</a> killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.

The date of egg-laying varies according to locality, but is generally from February to March in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, and from July to August in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>, although the Australian subspecies "macropus" may breed as late as November, and <a href="equator">equator</a>ial populations may nest anytime between June and December. If the eggs are lost early in the nesting season, the female usually lays another clutch, although this is extremely rare in the Arctic due to the short summer season. Generally three to four eggs, but sometimes as few as one or as many as five, are laid in the scrape. The eggs are white to buff with red or brown markings. They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female, with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day, but only the female incubating them at night. The average number of young found in nests is 2.5, and the average number that fledge is about 1.5, due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings.

After hatching, the chicks (called "es") are covered with creamy-white down and have disproportionately large feet. The male (called the "") and the female (simply called the "falcon") both leave the nest to gather prey to feed the young. The hunting territory of the parents can extend a radius of from the nest site. Chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 42 to 46 days after hatching, and remain dependent on their parents for up to two months.

The peregrine falcon is a highly admired falconry bird, and has been used in <a href="falconry">falconry</a> for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in <a href="central%20Asia">central Asia</a>. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The peregrine falcon has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high-speed diving stoop to take the <a href="quarry%20%28prey%29">quarry</a>. The speed of the stoop not only allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, it also enhances the falcon's ability to exert maneuvers to catch highly agile prey, and allows the falcon to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500 g to 300 g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.

Peregrine falcons handled by falconers are also occasionally used to scare away birds at airports to reduce the risk of <a href="Bird%20strike">bird-plane strikes</a>, improving air-traffic safety. They were also used to intercept homing pigeons during World War II.

Peregrine falcons have been successfully bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release back into the wild. Until 2004 nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the US were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the US <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a> was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances. Peregrine falcons were removed from the United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with <a href="The%20Peregrine%20Fund">The Peregrine Fund</a> and state and federal agencies – through a technique called <a href="hack%20%28falconry%29">hacking</a>. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.

The development of captive breeding methods has led to peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines at this point is to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and <a href="gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a>s are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the <a href="sage-grouse">sage-grouse</a>. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.

The peregrine falcon became an endangered species over much of its range because of the use of <a href="organochlorine%20pesticide">organochlorine pesticide</a>s, especially <a href="DDT">DDT</a>, during the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. Pesticide <a href="biomagnification">biomagnification</a> caused <a href="organochlorine">organochlorine</a> to build up in the falcons' fat tissues, reducing the amount of calcium in their eggshells. With thinner shells, fewer falcon eggs survived to hatching. In several parts of the world, such as the eastern <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, this species became <a href="local%20extinction">extirpated</a> (locally extinct) as a result. An alternate point of view is that populations in the eastern North America had vanished due to hunting and egg collection. Following the ban of organochlorine pesticides, the reproductive success of Peregrines increased in Scotland in terms of territory occupancy and breeding success, although spatial variation in recovery rates indicate that in some areas Peregrines were also impacted by other factors such as persecution.

Peregrine falcon recovery teams breed the species in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute or with a <a href="hand%20puppet">hand puppet</a> mimicking a peregrine's head, so they cannot see to <a href="Imprinting%20%28psychology%29">imprint</a> on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called <a href="hack%20%28falconry%29">hacking back to the wild</a>. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage at the top of a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.

Worldwide recovery efforts have been remarkably successful. The widespread restriction of DDT use eventually allowed released birds to breed successfully. The peregrine falcon was removed from the <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> <a href="Endangered%20Species">Endangered Species</a> list on 25 August 1999.

Some controversy has existed over the origins of captive breeding stock used by <a href="The%20Peregrine%20Fund">The Peregrine Fund</a> in the recovery of peregrine falcons throughout the contiguous United States. Several peregrine subspecies were included in the breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin. Due to the <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpation</a> of the eastern "anatum" ("Falco peregrinus anatum"), the near extirpation of the "anatum" in the Midwest, and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> was justified to optimize the <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> found within the species as a whole.

During the 1970s, peregrine falcons in Finland experienced a <a href="population%20bottleneck">population bottleneck</a> as a result of large declines associated with <a href="bio-accumulation">bio-accumulation</a> of <a href="organochloride">organochloride</a> pesticides. However, the genetic diversity of peregrines in Finland is similar to other populations, indicating that high dispersal rates have maintained the genetic diversity of this species.

Since Peregrine eggs and chicks are still often targeted by illegal poachers, it is common practice not to publicize unprotected nest locations.

Populations of the peregrine falcon have bounced back in most parts of the world. In the United Kingdom, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a>. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. In Canada, where peregrines were identified as endangered in 1978 (in the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> territory of northern <a href="Canada">Canada</a> that year, only a single breeding pair was identified), the <a href="Committee%20on%20the%20Status%20of%20Endangered%20Wildlife%20in%20Canada">Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada</a> declared the species no longer at risk in December 2017.

Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban <a href="feral%20pigeon">feral pigeon</a> populations for food. In <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a> engineers despatched to repair a faulty <a href="transmitter%20mast">transmitter mast</a> discovered a nest in the mast, and were prevented by the <a href="Wildlife%20and%20Countryside%20Act">Wildlife and Countryside Act</a> – on pain of a possible prison sentence – from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world peregrine falcons have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a>s, <a href="skyscraper">skyscraper</a> window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a>s. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.

From an ecological perspective, raptor populations in urban areas are highly beneficial. Compared with Europe, where <a href="pigeon">pigeon</a> populations have exploded to the point they are both a tourist attraction and a public nuisance. Pigeons' faeces are highly acidic, corroding historic buildings and stone statues and rusting bridge ironwork. In the United States, falcon and other raptors are in numbers high enough to ward off pigeon nest building in major highrises.

Due to its striking hunting technique, the peregrine has often been associated with aggression and martial prowess. <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> of the <a href="Mississippian%20culture">Mississippian culture</a> (c. 800–1500) used the peregrine, along with several other birds of prey, in imagery as a symbol of "aerial (celestial) power" and buried men of high status in costumes associating to the ferocity of raptorial birds. In the <a href="late%20Middle%20Ages">late Middle Ages</a>, the Western European nobility that used peregrines for hunting, considered the bird associated with <a href="prince">prince</a>s in formal hierarchies of birds of prey, just below the <a href="gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a> associated with <a href="king">king</a>s. It was considered "a royal bird, more armed by its courage than its claws". Terminology used by peregrine breeders also used the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> term , "of noble birth; aristocratic", particularly with the peregrine.

The peregrine falcon is the <a href="list%20of%20national%20animals">national animal</a> of the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>. Since 1927, the peregrine falcon has been the official mascot of <a href="Bowling%20Green%20State%20University">Bowling Green State University</a> in <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Ohio">Bowling Green, Ohio</a>. The 2007 U.S. <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> <a href="50%20State%20Quarters">state quarter</a> features a peregrine falcon. The peregrine falcon has been designated the <a href="List%20of%20official%20city%20birds">official city bird</a> of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>.

"The Peregrine", by <a href="J.%20A.%20Baker">J. A. Baker</a>, is widely regarded as one of the best nature books in English written in the twentieth century. Admirers of the book include <a href="Robert%20Macfarlane%20%28writer%29">Robert Macfarlane</a>, <a href="Mark%20Cocker">Mark Cocker</a>, who regards the book as "one of the most outstanding books on nature in the twentieth century" and <a href="Werner%20Herzog">Werner Herzog</a>, who called it "the one book I would ask you to read if you want to make films", and said elsewhere "it has prose of the calibre that we have not seen since <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>". In the book, Baker recounts, in diary form, his detailed observations of peregrines (and their interaction with other birds) near his home in <a href="Chelmsford">Chelmsford</a>, Essex, over a single winter from October to April.

William de St-Calais

William de St-Calais (died 2 January 1096) was a medieval <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="monk">monk</a>, <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of the in <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> in <a href="Maine%20%28province%29">Maine</a>, who was nominated by King <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William I of England</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a> in 1080. During his term as bishop, St-Calais replaced the <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> of his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> with monks, and began the construction of <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a>. In addition to his ecclesiastical duties, he served as a commissioner for the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>". He was also a councilor and advisor to both King William I and his son, King <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II</a>, known as William Rufus. Following William Rufus' accession to the throne in 1087, St-Calais is considered by scholars to have been the new king's chief advisor.

However, when the king's uncle, <a href="Odo%20of%20Bayeux">Odo of Bayeux</a>, raised a rebellion against the king in 1088, St-Calais was implicated in the revolt. William Rufus laid siege to St-Calais in the bishop's stronghold of Durham, and later put him on trial for treason. A contemporary record of this trial, the "<a href="De%20Iniusta%20Vexacione%20Willelmi%20Episcopi%20Primi">De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi</a>", is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial. Imprisoned briefly, St-Calais was allowed to go into exile after his castle at Durham was surrendered to the king. He went to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, where he became a leading advisor to <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>, the elder brother of William Rufus. By 1091, St-Calais had returned to England and regained royal favour.

In England, St-Calais once more became a leading advisor to the king. In 1093 he negotiated with <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm, Abbot of Bec</a>, concerning Anselm's becoming <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>; in 1095 it was St-Calais who prosecuted the royal case against Anselm after he had become archbishop. During his bishopric, St-Calais stocked the cathedral library with books, especially <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> texts. He was also active in defending the north of England against Scots raids. Before his death, he had made his peace with Anselm, who blessed and consoled St-Calais on his deathbed.

St-Calais was a Norman, and a native of <a href="Bayeux">Bayeux</a>; he may have been a member of one of its clerical dynasties. His mother's name, Ascelina or Anselma, is given in Durham's records; his father, whose name is unknown, became a monk at the monastery of <a href="Saint-Calais">Saint-Calais</a> in Maine, and may previously have been a knight. Although St-Calais is generally referred to as Saint Calais or St-Calais, the main source of information about his life, the monastic chronicle of <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a>, does not call him such.

St-Calais studied under Odo, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Bayeux">Bishop of Bayeux</a>, the half-brother of the future William I of England, who was then Duke of Normandy. Other bishops educated at Bayeux around this time included Archbishop <a href="Thomas%20of%20Bayeux">Thomas of York</a> and <a href="Samson%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Samson, Bishop of Worcester</a>. Symeon of Durham considered St-Calais to be well-educated in <a href="Classics">classical literature</a> and the scriptures; at some point St-Calais also acquired a knowledge of canon law. He became a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monk at Saint-Calais in Maine, where his father had become a monk, and soon became the prior of that house. He became abbot of St Vincent-des-Prés near Le Mans in Maine, sometime around 1078. As abbot, his only appearance in historical records is his upholding of the monasteries' right to some property, and his acceptance of a gift of property in the town.

William the Conqueror nominated him to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">see of Durham</a> on 9 November 1080, and he was duly consecrated on either 27 December 1080 or 3 January 1081. His elevation may have been a reward for diplomatic services he rendered to the king in France, or to help secure the see from further disorder following the death of the previous bishop, <a href="William%20Walcher">William Walcher</a>, during a feud. However, it was most likely in recognition of his administrative ability. Symeon of Durham stated that St-Calais was chosen as a bishop for this reason, describing him as "very well versed in sacred and secular learning, very conscientious in matters of divine and worldly business, and so remarkable for good conduct that he had no equal amongst his contemporaries".

The chronicler Symeon of Durham asserted that when St-Calais was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Thomas of York, he managed to avoid professing obedience to the archbishop, which, if true, would have freed St-Calais from interference in his diocese. After his appointment, St-Calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of <a href="Clergy">secular clergy</a> with monks, and consulted the king and <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, before going to Rome to receive permission from Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Gregory VII</a>. These consultations, and the conditions within his diocese, may have kept St-Calais from visiting Durham until some time after his elevation. In 1083 he expelled the married clergy from the cathedral, and moved a small community of monks from <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s old monastery at <a href="Jarrow">Jarrow</a> to <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>, to form the new chapter. This community had been founded at Jarrow by Reinfrid, a Norman ex-knight and monk of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a>, and Eadwine, an English monk from <a href="Winchcombe%20Abbey">Winchcombe Abbey</a>. After the community had settled in Durham, St-Calais named Eadwine as <a href="prior">prior</a>, and arranged for lands to be set aside to support the monks. The expelled clergy were offered the option of joining the new monastic house, but only one actually joined.

St-Calais enjoyed good relations with his cathedral chapter, and they supported him when construction began on a new cathedral in 1093. He also gave a set of constitutions to the cathedral chapter, modeled on Lanfranc's rule for Canterbury. Symeon of Durham said that the bishop acted towards the monks of his chapter as a "loving father", and that the monks fully returned the sentiment. St-Calais is said to have researched exhaustively the pre-<a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> customs of the cathedral, before re-establishing monks in the cathedral. He imposed the "<a href="Monastic%20Constitutions">Monastic Constitutions</a>" of Lanfranc on the community, instead of the older "<a href="Regularis%20Concordia%20%28Winchester%29">Regularis Concordia</a>".

During William the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais was a frequent witness on charters. While it is often difficult to determine who was considered most important on a charter's witness list, placement near the top of the list is usually understood to mean that the signatory was considered important. Almost always during the Conqueror's reign, St-Calais is listed right below the royal family and the archbishops.

The king sent St-Calais on diplomatic missions to the French royal court and to Rome. After the king's imprisonment of Odo of Bayeux, Pope Gregory VII complained to him. The pope was also concerned about the king's refusal to allow the delivery of papal letters to the English bishops unless royal permission was secured. To placate the pope, the king dispatched St-Calais to Rome, possibly with Lanfranc, to explain to the pope the reasons for imprisoning Odo. St-Calais also served as a commissioner in the south-western part of England for the Domesday Book, which aimed to survey the whole of England and record who owned the lands. Some historians, including <a href="David%20Bates%20%28historian%29">David Bates</a>, have argued that St-Calais was the driving force behind the organization of the entire Domesday survey, although other candidates have been put forward, including Samson, Bishop of Worcester, before he became bishop. <a href="Pierre%20Chaplais">Pierre Chaplais</a>, who argues for St-Calais being the main organizer of the survey, argues the bishop's exile in 1088 interrupted work on the "Little Domesday Book", a subproject of the survey which was left uncompleted.

Soon after the accession of William Rufus, St-Calais became one of the king's most trusted lieutenants, along with the recently released Odo of Bayeux. Later chroniclers often referred to the position that St-Calais held as <a href="justiciar">justiciar</a>, although the formal office did not yet exist. Around Easter 1088, Odo of Bayeux and many of the nobles revolted against the king and tried to place the king's elder brother Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy, on the throne. After the king had set off with St-Calais and some troops to counter Odo in Kent, St-Calais suddenly deserted, shutting himself in Durham Castle. Why St-Calais joined the rebellion, or at least did nothing to aid the king, is unclear. He and Odo had never been close, and despite the fact that St-Calais was educated at Bayeux, there is no evidence that Odo helped St-Calais' career. Some historians, including W. M. Aird, have suggested that St-Calais felt the division of the Conqueror's realm between two sons was unwise. It has been suggested that St Calais joined the rebellion to reunite the Normans and English under one ruler.

St-Calais was the only bishop who did not actively aid the king; the rebelling magnates included <a href="Roger%20de%20Montgomerie%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Roger de Montgomery</a> <a href="Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Earl of Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="Robert%20de%20Mowbray">Robert de Mowbray</a> <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Earl of Northumbria</a>, and Odo's brother <a href="Robert%2C%20Count%20of%20Mortain">Robert</a> <a href="List%20of%20Counts%20of%20Mortain">Count of Mortain</a>. The rebellion had failed by the end of the summer, but St-Calais continued to hold out in Durham, at first claiming he had never actually rebelled. When the king's army arrived, St-Calais agreed to come out, but only after receiving a safe conduct that would allow him to attend a trial while his men continued to hold the castle. St-Calais's actions suggest that he did rebel, whatever his claims to the contrary and affirmations of his innocence in northern chronicles.

St-Calais was brought before the king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at <a href="Salisbury">Salisbury</a>, before which the king seized his lands. At the trial, St-Calais held that as a bishop he could not be tried in a secular court, and refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc presented the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as <a href="Fiefdom">fiefs</a>, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a <a href="vassal">vassal</a>, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, the court held that St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a <a href="feudal">feudal</a> court. St-Calais then asked for an appeal to Rome, which was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or lands, was forfeit. Although St-Calais claimed to be defending the rights of clergy to be tried in clerical courts and to appeal to Rome, his fellow bishops believed otherwise. Lending support to their belief is the fact that St-Calais never pursued his appeal to Rome, and that later, in 1095, he took the side of the king against Anselm of Canterbury when Anselm tried to assert a right to appeal to Rome.

During the course of the trial, Lanfranc is said to have stated that the court was "trying you not in your capacity as bishop, but in regard to your fief; and in this way we judged the bishop of Bayeux in regard to his fief before the present king's father, and that king did not summon him to that plea as bishop but as brother and earl." Unlike the later case of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, St-Calais received little sympathy from his fellow bishops. Most of the bishops and barons that judged the case seem to have felt that the appeal to Rome was made to avoid having to answer an accusation that St-Calais knew was true. The final judgement was only reached after the king lost his temper and exclaimed: "Believe me, bishop, you're not going back to Durham, and your men aren't going to stay at Durham, and you're not going to go free, until you release the castle." The extant "De Iniusta Vexacione Willelmi Episcopi Primi", or "Of the Unjust Persecution of the Bishop William I", details the trial of St-Calais before the king. This work is the earliest surviving detailed contemporary report of an English state-trial; some have doubted its authenticity, however, claiming St-Calais would not have been as knowledgeable in canon law as the work portrays him. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of the canon law, the "<a href="Pseudo-Isidore">False Decretals</a>", which still survives.

After the court adjourned, St-Calais was held as a prisoner at <a href="Wilton%20Abbey">Wilton Abbey</a> until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, and left for Normandy, and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Urban II</a> did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his see, but nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return, perhaps in recognition of a service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering the end of a siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.

St-Calais returned to Durham on 11 September 1091, with a large sum of money and gifts for his church. Thereafter he remained in the king's favour. In fact, in 1093 his lands were restored without the need to perform feudal services. For the rest of his life, St-Calais remained a frequent advisor to the king. It was St-Calais, along with <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert, Count of Meulan</a> who negotiated with Anselm, the abbot of Bec, in 1093 over the conditions under which Anselm would allow himself to be elected Archbishop of Canterbury.

St-Calais managed the king's case against Anselm at <a href="Rockingham%2C%20Northamptonshire">Rockingham</a> in 1095, when Anselm wished to go to receive his <a href="pallium">pallium</a> from Pope Urban II. At that time St-Calais opposed Anselm's attempt to appeal to Rome over the issue, and steadfastly maintained the king's position against Anselm, even advocating that the archbishop be deprived of his lands and sent into exile. Later, when the king was negotiating with <a href="Walter%20of%20Albano">Walter of Albano</a>, the papal legate sent by Urban to convey the pallium to Anselm and to secure the king's recognition of Urban as pope, St-Calais was the king's chief negotiator. The clerical reformers, <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a> among them, who supported Anselm in these quarrels, later tried to claim that St-Calais had supported the king out of a desire to succeed Anselm as archbishop if Anselm was deposed, but it is unlikely that St-Calais seriously believed that Anselm would be deposed. St-Calais secured grants from the king in return for his services. His efforts on behalf of the king earned him hostile accounts in Eadmer's later writings.

Durham's location in the north left it insecure, as <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm Canmore</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Scottish%20monarchs">King of Scots</a>, raided and invaded the north of England on a number of occasions. Malcolm claimed <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, <a href="Cuthbert%20of%20Lindisfarne">Saint Cuthbert</a>. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in their attempts to secure the Scottish throne.

Later, in 1095, an English noble, Robert de Mowbray, who was Earl of Northumbria, challenged the bishop's authority in the north. When Mowbray rebelled again in 1095, St-Calais helped the king put down the rebellion, and Mowbray was captured. The death of Malcolm and the capture of Mowbray did much to make the north more secure.

In St-Calais' time as bishop, a long-running dispute began between the monks of the cathedral chapter and successive bishops. This arose because St-Calais did not make a formal division of the diocesan revenues between the bishop's household and the monks of the chapter. Nor had he allowed free elections of the prior. He may have promised these things to the monks before his death, but nothing was in writing. Thus, when a non-monk was selected to replace St-Calais, the monks began a long struggle to secure what they felt had been promised to them, including the forging of charters ascribed to St-Calais that supported their case. These forged charters date from the second half of the 12th century.

St-Calais also ordered the destruction of the old cathedral that had been built by Aldhun, to make way for the construction of a new, larger cathedral, the current <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque-style</a> Durham Cathedral. The construction of the new cathedral began on 29 July 1093, when St-Calais led his cathedral chapter in dedicating the site. The first stones were laid shortly afterwards, on 11 August 1093. However, St-Calais' exile after his trial as well as his employment in the royal service meant that he was often absent from his bishopric, and this probably is the cause of the medieval chronicler Symeon of Durham's comparatively neutral treatment of St-Calais in his works. There is no evidence of St-Calais performing any of the normal episcopal functions, including consecrating priests or churches.

Probably dating from St-Calais' time is the <a href="confraternity">confraternity</a> relationship between the monks of Durham and the monks of the monastery of Saint Calais in Maine. The cult of Saint Calais appears to have been confined to the region around the monastery which the saint had founded. St-Calais appears to have been a devotee of the cult, and the most likely date for the creation of the confraternity link between the two houses is during St-Calais' time as bishop.

Shortly before Christmas 1095, one of St-Calais' knights, Boso, fell ill and dreamed he was transported to the afterlife, where he found a large house with gates made of iron. Suddenly, St-Calais emerged from the gates, asking the knight the whereabouts of one of his servants. Boso's guide in the dream then informed Boso that this was a warning that St-Calais would soon die. Boso recovered and warned St-Calais of the dream.

St-Calais died on 2 January 1096 after falling gravely ill on the previous <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a>. Before his death he was consoled by Anselm and was blessed by his former opponent. He was buried on 16 January 1096 in the <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> at Durham. The king had summoned St-Calais shortly before Christmas to answer an unknown charge, and it is possible that the stress of this threat caused his death. In 1796 St-Calais' grave was supposedly found during the demolition of the chapter house at Durham Cathedral. Found in the grave were a pair of sandals, which still survive, and fragments of a gold embroidered robe.

While in office as bishop, St-Calais gave a copy of the "False Decretals" to his cathedral library. The manuscript was an edition that had been collected or prepared by Lanfranc for the use of the chapter of Canterbury. St-Calais may have used this copy in his trial. His plea for an appeal to Rome was grounded in the "False Decretals", whether or not it was based on this particular manuscript. The manuscript itself is now in the <a href="Peterhouse%2C%20Cambridge">Peterhouse Library</a>. St-Calais also gave a copy of Bede's "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>" to his cathedral chapter; this copy still survives. Other works that St-Calais gave to the cathedral library were copies of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>'s "<a href="City%20of%20God%20%28book%29">De Civitae Dei</a>" and "<a href="Confessions%20%28St.%20Augustine%29">Confessions</a>"; <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a>'s "<a href="Pastoral%20Care">Pastoral Care</a>", "<a href="Commentary%20on%20Job">Moralia</a>", and "Homilies"; and <a href="Ambrose">Ambrose</a>'s "De Poenitentia".

St-Calais was known to his contemporaries as an intelligent and able man. He had an excellent memory. <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28historian%29">Frank Barlow</a>, a historian, describes him as a "good scholar and a monk of blameless life". Besides his copy of the "Decretals", he left at his death over fifty books to the monks of Durham, and the list of those volumes still exists. His best-known legacy is the construction of Durham Cathedral, although the <a href="nave">nave</a> was not finished until 1130. The construction technique of combining a pointed arch with another <a href="rib%20vault">rib</a> allowed a six-pointed <a href="vault%20%28architecture%29">vault</a>, which enabled the building to attain a greater height than earlier churches. This permitted larger <a href="Clerestory">celestory</a> windows, and let more light into the building. The technique of the six-pointed vault spread to <a href="Abbaye-aux-Hommes">Saint-Etienne</a> in <a href="Caen">Caen</a> from which it influenced the development of <a href="Gothic%20architecture">early Gothic architecture</a> near Paris. The system of rib vaulting in the choir was the earliest use of that technique in Europe. The historian Frank Barlow called the cathedral "one of the architectural jewels of western Christendom".

Roland TR-808

The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, commonly known as the 808, is a <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a> manufactured by the <a href="Roland%20Corporation">Roland Corporation</a> between 1980 and 1983. It was one of the first drum machines to allow users to <a href="Programming%20%28music%29">program rhythms</a> instead of using preset patterns. Unlike its nearest competitor at the time, the more expensive <a href="Linn%20LM-1">Linn LM-1</a>, the 808 generates sounds using <a href="Analog%20synthesizer">analog synthesis</a> rather than playing <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> (prerecorded sounds). 

Launched when <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> had yet to become mainstream, the 808 received mixed reviews for its unrealistic drum sounds and was a commercial failure. After building approximately 12,000 units, Roland discontinued the 808 after its <a href="Semiconductor%20device">semiconductors</a> became impossible to restock, but units remain in use around the world. It was succeeded in 1984 by the <a href="Roland%20TR-909">TR-909</a>.

Over the course of the 1980s, the 808 attracted a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> among underground musicians for its affordability on the used market, ease of use, and idiosyncratic sounds, particularly its deep, "booming" <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>. It became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic, <a href="Dance%20music%20%28popular%29">dance</a>, and <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> genres, popularized by early hits such as "<a href="Sexual%20Healing">Sexual Healing</a>" by <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> and "<a href="Planet%20Rock%20%28song%29">Planet Rock</a>" by <a href="Afrika%20Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a> and the <a href="Soulsonic%20Force">Soulsonic Force</a>. 

The 808 was eventually used on more <a href="Hit%20record">hit records</a> than any other drum machine. Its popularity with hip hop in particular has made it one of the most influential inventions in popular music, comparable to the <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a>'s influence on <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a>. Its sounds are used as samples included with music software and modern drum machines, and it has inspired numerous <a href="Synthesiser%20clone">clones</a>.

In the late 1960s, the <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond Organ Company</a> hired American musician and engineer Don Lewis to demonstrate its products, including an <a href="electronic%20organ">electronic organ</a> with a built-in <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a> designed by the Japanese company <a href="Ace%20Tone">Ace Tone</a>. At the time, drum machines were most often used to accompany home organs; the machines did not allow users to <a href="Programming%20%28music%29">program</a> rhythms, but had preset patterns such as <a href="bossa%20nova">bossa nova</a>. Lewis was known for performances using electronic instruments he had modified himself, decades before the popularization of instrument "hacking" via <a href="circuit%20bending">circuit bending</a>. He made extensive modifications to the Ace Tone drum machine, creating his own rhythms and wiring the device through his organ's <a href="expression%20pedal">expression pedal</a> to <a href="Accent%20%28music%29">accent</a> the percussion.Lewis was approached by Ace Tone president and founder <a href="Ikutaro%20Kakehashi">Ikutaro Kakehashi</a>, who wanted to know how he had achieved the sounds using the machine Kakehashi had designed. In 1972, Kakehashi formed the <a href="Roland%20Corporation">Roland Corporation</a>, and hired Lewis to help design drum machines. By the late 1970s, <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s were appearing in instruments such as the <a href="Roland%20MC-8%20Microcomposer">Roland MC-8 Microcomposer</a>, and Kakehashi realized they could be used to program drum machines. In 1978, Roland released the <a href="Roland%20CR-78">CompuRhythm CR-78</a>, the first drum machine with which users could write, save, and replay their own patterns.

With its next machine, the TR-808, Roland aimed to develop a drum machine for the professional market, expecting that it would mainly be used to create <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demos</a>. Though the engineers aimed to emulate real percussion, the prohibitive cost of <a href="Computer%20memory">memory</a> drove them to design sound-generating hardware instead of using <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> (prerecorded sounds). Kakehashi deliberately purchased faulty <a href="transistor">transistor</a>s that created the machine's distinctive "sizzling" sound. Chief engineer Makoto Muroi credited the design of the analog voice circuits to "Mr. Nakamura" and the software to "Mr. Matsuoka".

The 808 produces sounds in imitation of acoustic percussion: the <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>, <a href="Snare%20drum">snare</a>, <a href="Tom-tom%20drum">toms</a>, <a href="conga">conga</a>, <a href="rimshot">rimshot</a>, <a href="claves">claves</a>, <a href="Clapping">handclap</a>, <a href="maraca">maraca</a>, <a href="Cowbell%20%28instrument%29">cowbell</a>, <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>, and <a href="hi-hat">hi-hat</a> (open and closed). Rather than playing samples, the machine generates sounds using <a href="Analog%20synthesizer">analog synthesis</a>; the TR in TR-808 stands for "Transistor Rhythm". Users can program up to 32 patterns using the <a href="Music%20sequencer%23Step%20sequencers">step sequencer</a>, chain up to 768 <a href="Bar%20%28music%29">measures</a>, and place <a href="Accent%20%28music%29">accents</a> on individual beats, a feature introduced with the CR-78. Users can also set the <a href="tempo">tempo</a> and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>, including unusual signatures such as <a href="Quintuple%20meter"></a> and <a href="Septuple%20meter"></a>. 

The 808 was the first drum machine with which users could program a percussion track from beginning to end, complete with <a href="Break%20%28music%29">breaks</a> and <a href="Drum%20roll">rolls</a>. It includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs, and a <a href="DIN%20sync">DIN sync</a> port (a precursor to <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a>) to synchronize with other devices through the <a href="Digital%20Control%20Bus">Digital Control Bus</a> interface, which was considered groundbreaking. Its three trigger outputs can synchronize with <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s and other equipment.

The 808's sounds do not resemble real percussion, and have been described as "clicky and hypnotic", "robotic", "spacey", "toy-like" and "futuristic". <a href="Fact%20%28UK%20magazine%29">"Fact"</a> described them as a combination of "synth tones and <a href="white%20noise">white noise</a> ... more akin to bursts coming from the <a href="BBC%20Radiophonic%20Workshop">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a> [than] a proper rhythm section". The machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a <a href="Sine%20wave">sine</a> oscillator, <a href="low-pass%20filter">low-pass filter</a>, and <a href="voltage-controlled%20amplifier">voltage-controlled amplifier</a>. The bass drum <a href="Decay%20%28music%29">decay</a> control allows users to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that <a href="Flat%20%28music%29">flatten</a> slightly over time, possibly not by design. According to the <a href="The%20New%20Yorker">"New Yorker"</a>, "Less a product of engineering than a force of nature, this bass-rolling subsonic boom has come to be what people mean when they refer to 'an 808'."

The 808 launched in 1980 with a <a href="list%20price">list price</a> of . Roland marketed it as an affordable alternative to the <a href="Linn%20LM-1">Linn LM-1</a>, manufactured by <a href="Linn%20Electronics">Linn Electronics</a>, which used samples of real drum kits. The 808 sounded simplistic and synthetic by comparison; <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> had yet to become mainstream and many musicians and producers wanted realistic-sounding drum machines. Many reports state that one review dismissed the machine as sounding like "marching anteaters", though this was likely referring to machines that predated it. "<a href="Keyboard%20%28magazine%29">Contemporary Keyboard</a>" wrote a positive review, predicting that it would become "the standard for rhythm machines of the future".

Despite some early adopters, the 808 was a commercial failure and fewer than 12,000 units were sold. Roland ended production in 1983 after <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> improvements made it impossible to restock the faulty transistors essential to its design.

Though the 808 was commercially unsuccessful, it has had a lasting influence on <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> and was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine. Roland credits the first use in a live performance to the Japanese electronic group <a href="Yellow%20Magic%20Orchestra">Yellow Magic Orchestra</a> with "<a href="BGM%20%28album%29">1000 Knives</a>" in 1980. The first records to feature the 808 were released in 1981: Yellow Magic Orchestra's "<a href="BGM%20%28album%29">BGM</a>" and the <a href="The%20Monitors%20%28Australian%20band%29">Monitors</a>' "Nobody Told Me". In 1982, the American <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> artist <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> released the first hit single that featured the 808, "<a href="Sexual%20Healing">Sexual Healing</a>". Gaye was drawn to the instrument because he could use it to create music without other musicians or producers.

By the time Roland discontinued the 808 in 1983, it had become common on the used market, often selling for under $100. Its ease of use, affordability, and idiosyncratic sound earned it a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> among underground musicians and producers, and it became a cornerstone of the developing <a href="Electronic%20music">electronic</a> and <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> genres. In 1982, <a href="Afrika%20Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a> and the <a href="Soulsonic%20Force">Soulsonic Force</a> released their single "<a href="Planet%20Rock%20%28song%29">Planet Rock</a>", which made extensive use of the 808 to create "strange, futuristic percussion that became hugely popular on dancefloors". The track informed the development of electronic and hip hop and subgenres including <a href="Miami%20bass">Miami bass</a> and <a href="Detroit%20techno">Detroit techno</a>, and popularized the 808 as a "fundamental element of futuristic sound". According to "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>," "Planet Rock" "didn't so much put the 808 on the map so much as reorient an entire world of <a href="post-disco">post-disco</a> dance music around it".

The 808 was subsequently used by hip hop acts including <a href="Run-DMC">Run-DMC</a>, <a href="LL%20Cool%20J">LL Cool J</a>, and <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28group%29">Public Enemy</a>. It has been described as hip hop's equivalent to the <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> guitar, which dramatically influenced the development of <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>. The 808 bass drum, in particular, became so essential that Hank Shocklee of the <a href="The%20Bomb%20Squad">Bomb Squad</a> production group declared that "it's not hip hop without that sound". The "New Yorker" wrote that the "trembling feeling of [the 808 bass drum], booming down boulevards in Oakland, the Bronx, and Detroit, are part of America's cultural DNA". Even after the 808 fell out of use by <a href="East%20Coast%20hip%20hop">East Coast hip hop</a> producers in the 1990s, it remained a staple of <a href="southern%20hip%20hop">southern hip hop</a>.

The 808's limited pattern storage encouraged artists to push its limits; according to "Slate", "those eight-bar units became veritable playgrounds for invention and creativity." Artists manipulated the bass drum to produce new sounds, such as on the 1984 single "Set it Off", in which producer <a href="Strafe%20%28band%29">Strafe</a> used it to imitate the sound of an underground <a href="Nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear test</a>. Producer <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> popularized the technique of lengthening the bass drum decay and tuning it to different pitches to create <a href="bassline">bassline</a>s. On their 1986 track "<a href="Paul%20Revere%20%28song%29">Paul Revere</a>", the <a href="Beastie%20Boys">Beastie Boys</a> reversed a recording of an 808 to produce backwards-sounding percussion.

The 808 also saw extensive use beyond hip hop, such as on <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston's</a> 1987 pop hit "<a href="I%20Wanna%20Dance%20with%20Somebody%20%28Who%20Loves%20Me%29">I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)</a>". In the 1984 <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a> concert film "<a href="Stop%20Making%20Sense">Stop Making Sense</a>", singer <a href="David%20Byrne">David Byrne</a> performs "<a href="Psycho%20Killer">Psycho Killer</a>" on acoustic guitar accompanied by an 808, stumbling against its "gunshot"-like sounds. Songwriter <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a> found the machine useful for <a href="Loop%20%28music%29">looping</a> rhythms for long periods, since human drummers would be tempted to add variations and <a href="Fill%20%28music%29">fills</a>. <a href="Chris%20Norris%20%28journalist%29">Chris Norris</a> of "The New Yorker" wrote that "the introduction of Roland's magic box was indisputably the big bang of pop's great age of disruption, from 1983 to 1986. The 808's defiantly inorganic timbres ... sketched out the domain of a new world of music." 

The 808 was popularized in the United Kingdom by the electronic group <a href="808%20State">808 State</a>, which took its name from the machine and used it extensively. 808 State's <a href="Graham%20Massey">Graham Massey</a> said, "The Roland gear began to be a kind of <a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> in music. The whole world began to be less separated through this technology, and there was a classiness to it—you could transcend your provincial music with this equipment." With the rise of UK <a href="Rave">rave culture</a>, a precursor to <a href="acid%20house">acid house</a>, the 808 became a staple sound on British radio.Rapper <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a> used the 808 on every track on his 2008 album "<a href="808s%20%26amp%3B%20Heartbreak">808s & Heartbreak</a>", which "Slate" described as "an explicit love letter to the device". Other artists who have used the 808 include <a href="Bassnectar">Bassnectar</a>, <a href="Damon%20Albarn">Damon Albarn</a>, <a href="Diplo">Diplo</a>, <a href="Norman%20Cook">Fatboy Slim</a>, <a href="David%20Guetta">David Guetta</a>, and <a href="New%20Order%20%28band%29">New Order</a>. It has been referenced in lyrics by artists including the Beastie Boys, <a href="Outkast">Outkast</a>, <a href="Kelis">Kelis</a>, <a href="T.I.">TI</a>, <a href="Lil%20Wayne">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a>, <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="R.%20Kelly">R Kelly</a>, and <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a>. Its bass drum has been used as a metaphor for a heartbeat in songs by artists including <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>, <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, and <a href="Kesha">Kesha</a>.

The 808 is one of the most influential inventions in popular music. Samples of its sounds are common in music software, and it has inspired numerous <a href="Synthesiser%20clone">unlicensed clones</a>. "Flavorwire" wrote that "the 808 has become so ubiquitous over the years that its beats are almost a language of their own—you know the sounds even if you have no idea what a drum machine is, and as such, you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts". The "New Yorker" wrote in 2015 that the 808 was the bedrock of the modern "urban-youth-culture soundtrack", particularly in <a href="trap%20music">trap music</a>, and had influenced a new blend of dance and <a href="Retro%20style">retro</a> hip hop that "embraces and fetishizes ... street music from the past". According to "Slate", it was instrumental in <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>'s shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to "thinking in terms of "sequences", discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised "ad infinitum"".

The 808 was followed in 1983 by the <a href="Roland%20TR-909">TR-909</a>, the first Roland drum machine to use samples. Like the 808, the 909 was influential on popular music, influencing genres such as <a href="techno">techno</a>, <a href="House%20music">house</a> and <a href="Acid%20house">acid</a>.

In the 1990s, Roland included samples of the 808 in its successful <a href="Groovebox">Groovebox</a> devices. In 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 through a combination of modeling and sampling. It was followed in 2017 by the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 featuring an <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> display, MIDI and <a href="USB">USB</a> connections, expanded sequencer control, and a built-in speaker. In 2018, Roland released the first official <a href="Software%20synthesizer">software emulations</a> of the 808 and 909.

Stanley Holloway

Stanley Augustus Holloway, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a> (1 October 1890 – 30 January 1982) was an English stage and film actor, humourist, singer, poet and <a href="monologist">monologist</a>. He was famous for his comic and character roles <a href="Stanley%20Holloway%20on%20stage%20and%20screen">on stage and screen</a>, especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>". He was also renowned for his <a href="Songs%20and%20monologues%20of%20Stanley%20Holloway">comic monologues and songs</a>, which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70-year career.

Born in London, Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in "<a href="Kissing%20Time">Kissing Time</a>" when the musical transferred to the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> from <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a>. In 1921, he joined a <a href="Concert%20party%20%28entertainment%29">concert party</a>, "<a href="The%20Co-Optimists">The Co-Optimists</a>", and his career began to flourish. At first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by <a href="Marriott%20Edgar">Marriott Edgar</a>, were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in <a href="variety%20show">variety</a>, <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> and musical comedy, including several <a href="revue">revue</a>s.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> and <a href="Path%C3%A9%20News">Pathé News</a> and took character parts in a series of war films including "<a href="Major%20Barbara%20%28film%29">Major Barbara</a>", "<a href="The%20Way%20Ahead">The Way Ahead</a>", "<a href="This%20Happy%20Breed%20%28film%29">This Happy Breed</a>" and "<a href="The%20Way%20to%20the%20Stars">The Way to the Stars</a>". After the war, he appeared in the film "<a href="Brief%20Encounter">Brief Encounter</a>" and made a series of films for Ealing Studios, including "<a href="Passport%20to%20Pimlico">Passport to Pimlico</a>", "<a href="The%20Lavender%20Hill%20Mob">The Lavender Hill Mob</a>" and "<a href="The%20Titfield%20Thunderbolt">The Titfield Thunderbolt</a>".

In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in "My Fair Lady", a role that he played on Broadway, the West End and in the <a href="My%20Fair%20Lady%20%28film%29">film version in 1964</a>. The role brought him international fame, and his performances earned him nominations for a <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Featured%20Actor%20in%20a%20Musical">Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical</a> and an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>. In his later years, Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US, toured in revues, appeared in stage plays in Britain, Canada, Australia and the US, and continued to make films into his eighties. Holloway was married twice and had five children, including the actor <a href="Julian%20Holloway">Julian Holloway</a>.

Holloway was born in <a href="Manor%20Park%2C%20London">Manor Park</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a> (now in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Newham">London Borough of Newham</a>), the younger child and only son of George Augustus Holloway (1860–1919), a lawyer's clerk, and Florence May "née" Bell (1862–1913), a housekeeper and dressmaker. He was named after <a href="Henry%20Morton%20Stanley">Henry Morton Stanley</a>, the journalist and explorer famous for his exploration of Africa and for his search for <a href="David%20Livingstone">David Livingstone</a>. There were theatrical connections in the Holloway family going back to Charles Bernard (1830–1894), an actor and theatre manager, who was the brother of Holloway's maternal grandmother.

Holloway's paternal grandfather, Augustus Holloway (1829–1884), an orphan, was brought up by John Stone, a sailmaker, and his wife Mary, in <a href="Poole">Poole</a>, <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. Augustus became a wealthy shopkeeper, running his own brush-making business. He married Amelia Catherine Knight in September 1856, and they had three children, Maria, Charles and George.

In the early 1880s the family moved to <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar, London</a>. When Augustus died, George Holloway (Stanley's father) moved to nearby Manor Park and became a clerk for a city lawyer, Robert Bell. George married Bell's daughter Florence in 1884, and they had two children, Millie (1887–1949) and Stanley. George left Florence in 1905 and was never seen or heard from again by his family.

During his early teenage years, Holloway attended the Worshipful School of Carpenters in nearby <a href="Stratford%2C%20London">Stratford</a> and joined a local choir, which he later called his "big moment". He left school at the age of 14 and worked as a junior clerk in a boot polish factory, where he earned ten shillings a week. He began performing part-time as "Master Stanley Holloway – The Wonderful Boy Soprano" from 1904, singing sentimental songs such as "<a href="The%20Lost%20Chord">The Lost Chord</a>". A year later, he became a clerk at <a href="Billingsgate%20Fish%20Market">Billingsgate Fish Market</a>, where he remained for two years before commencing training as an infantry soldier in the <a href="London%20Rifle%20Brigade">London Rifle Brigade</a> in 1907.

Holloway's stage career began in 1910, when he travelled to <a href="Walton-on-the-Naze">Walton-on-the-Naze</a> to audition for "The White <a href="Coon%20song">Coon</a>s Show", a <a href="Concert%20party%20%28entertainment%29">concert party</a> <a href="variety%20show">variety show</a> arranged and produced by Will C. Pepper, father of <a href="Harry%20S.%20Pepper">Harry S. Pepper</a>, with whom Holloway later starred in "<a href="The%20Co-Optimists%20%28film%29">The Co-Optimists</a>". This seaside show lasted six weeks. From 1912 to 1914, Holloway appeared in the summer seasons at the West Cliff Gardens Theatre, <a href="Clacton-on-Sea">Clacton-on-Sea</a>, where he was billed as a romantic baritone.

In 1913 Holloway was recruited by the comedian <a href="Leslie%20Henson">Leslie Henson</a> to feature as a support in Henson's more prestigious concert party called "Nicely, Thanks". In later life, Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson, citing him as a great influence on his career. The two became firm friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs. In his 1967 autobiography, Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson, whom he described as "the greatest friend, inspiration and mentor a performer could have had". Later in 1913, Holloway decided to train as an operatic <a href="baritone">baritone</a>, and so he went to Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. However, a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re-appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley's concert party at the <a href="West%20Cliff%20Theatre">West Cliff Theatre</a> caused him to return home after six months.

In the early months of 1914, Holloway made his first visit to the United States and then went to <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> and <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a> with the concert party "The Grotesques". At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, he decided to return to England, but his departure was delayed for six weeks due to his contract with the troupe. At the age of 25, Holloway enlisted in the <a href="Connaught%20Rangers">Connaught Rangers</a> in which he was commissioned as a <a href="subaltern">subaltern</a> in December 1915 because of his previous training in the London Rifle Brigade. He was stationed in Cork and initially fought against the rebels in the <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a> of 1916. Later that year, he was sent to France, where he fought in the trenches alongside <a href="Michael%20John%20O%27Leary">Michael O'Leary</a>, who later won the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for gallantry. Holloway and O'Leary stayed in touch after the war and remained close friends.

Holloway spent much of his time in the later part of the war organising shows to boost army morale in France. One such <a href="revue">revue</a>, "Wear That Ribbon", was performed in honour of O'Leary winning the VC. He, Henson and his newly established "Star Attractions" concert party, entertained the British troops in <a href="Wimereux">Wimereux</a>. The party included such performers as <a href="Jack%20Buchanan">Jack Buchanan</a>, <a href="Eric%20Blore">Eric Blore</a>, <a href="Binnie%20Hale">Binnie Hale</a>, and <a href="Phyllis%20Dare">Phyllis Dare</a>, as well as the performers who would later form "The Co-Optimists". Upon his return from France, Holloway was stationed in <a href="Hartlepool">Hartlepool</a>, and immediately after the war ended he starred in "The Disorderly Room" with Leslie Henson, which Eric Blore had written while serving in the <a href="South%20Wales%20Borderers">South Wales Borderers</a>. The production toured theatres on England's coast, including <a href="Walton-on-the-Naze">Walton-on-the-Naze</a> and <a href="Clacton-on-Sea">Clacton-on-Sea</a>.

After relinquishing his army commission in May 1919, Holloway returned to London and resumed his singing and acting career, finding success in two <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> musicals at the <a href="New%20London%20Theatre">Winter Garden Theatre</a>. Later that month, he created the role of Captain Wentworth in <a href="Guy%20Bolton">Guy Bolton</a> and <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a>'s "<a href="Kissing%20Time">Kissing Time</a>", followed in 1920 by the role of René in "<a href="A%20Night%20Out%20%28musical%29">A Night Out</a>". Following its provincial success, "The Disorderly Room" was given a West End production at the <a href="Victoria%20Palace%20Theatre">Victoria Palace Theatre</a> in late 1919, in which Holloway starred alongside Henson and <a href="Tom%20Walls">Tom Walls</a>. Holloway made his film debut in a 1921 silent comedy called "The Rotters".

From June 1921, Holloway had considerable success in "<a href="The%20Co-Optimists">The Co-Optimists</a>", a concert party formed with performers whom he had met during the war in France, which "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" called "an all-star '<a href="Concert%20party%20%28entertainment%29">pierrot</a>' entertainment in the West-end." It opened at the small <a href="Royalty%20Theatre">Royalty Theatre</a> and soon transferred to the much larger <a href="Palace%20Theatre%2C%20London">Palace Theatre</a>, where the initial version of the show ran for over a year, giving more than 500 performances. The entertainment was completely rewritten at regular intervals to keep it fresh, and the final edition, beginning in November 1926, was the 13th version. "The Co-Optimists" closed in 1927 at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">His Majesty's Theatre</a> after 1,568 performances over eight years. In 1929, <a href="The%20Co-Optimists%20%28film%29">a feature film version</a> was made, with Holloway rejoining his former co-stars.

In 1923 Holloway established himself as a <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a> performer. The early BBC broadcasts brought variety and classical artists together, and Holloway could be heard in the same programme as the cellist <a href="John%20Barbirolli">John Barbirolli</a> or the <a href="Band%20of%20the%20Scots%20Guards">Band of the Scots Guards</a>. He developed his solo act throughout the 1920s while continuing his involvement with the musical theatre and "The Co-Optimists". In 1924 he made his first gramophone discs, recording for <a href="HMV%20Records">HMV</a> two songs from "The Co-Optimists": "London Town" and "Memory Street". After "The Co-Optimists" disbanded in 1927, Holloway played at the <a href="Hippodrome%2C%20London">London Hippodrome</a> in <a href="Vincent%20Youmans">Vincent Youmans</a>'s musical comedy "<a href="Hit%20the%20Deck%20%28musical%29">Hit the Deck</a>" as Bill Smith, a performance judged by "The Times" to be "invested with many shrewd touches of humanity". In "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", <a href="Ivor%20Brown">Ivor Brown</a> praised him for a singing style "which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head."
Holloway began regularly performing monologues, both on stage and on record, in 1928, with his own creation, Sam Small, in "Sam, Sam, Pick oop thy Musket". Over the following years, he recorded more than 20 monologues based around the character, most of which he wrote himself. He created Sam Small after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and told him a story about an insubordinate old soldier from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>. Holloway developed the character, naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small; the name Sam was chosen at random. Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character. "The Times" commented, "For absolute delight ... there is nothing to compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway's monologue, concerning a military contretemps on the eve of Waterloo ... perfect, even to the curled moustache and the <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero."

In 1929 Holloway played another leading role in musical comedy, Lieutenant Richard Manners in "Song of the Sea", and later that year he performed in the revue "Coo-ee", with <a href="Billy%20Bennett%20%28comedian%29">Billy Bennett</a>, <a href="Dorothy%20Dickson">Dorothy Dickson</a> and <a href="Claude%20Hulbert">Claude Hulbert</a>. When "The Co-Optimists" re-formed in 1930, he rejoined that company, now at the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a>, and at the same venue appeared in "Savoy Follies" in 1931, where he introduced to London audiences the monologue "The Lion and Albert". The monologue was written by <a href="Marriott%20Edgar">Marriott Edgar</a>, who based the story on a news item about a boy who was eaten by a lion in the zoo. In the monologue, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom react in a measured way when their son Albert is swallowed. Neither Edgar nor Holloway was convinced that the piece would succeed, but needing material for an appearance at a Northern Rugby League dinner Holloway decided to perform it. It was well received, and Holloway introduced it into his stage act. Subsequently, Edgar wrote 16 monologues for him. In its obituary of Holloway, "The Times" wrote that Sam and Albert "became part of English folklore during the 1930s, and they remained so during the Second World War." These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called "the understated look-on-the-bright-side world of the cockney working class. ... Holloway's characters are [mischievous, like Albert, or] obstinate, and hilariously clueless. He often told his stories in costume; sporting outrageous attire and bushy moustaches." In 1932 <a href="Harry%20S.%20Pepper">Harry S. Pepper</a>, with Holloway and others, revived the White Coons Concert Party show for <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a>.

Beginning in 1934, Holloway appeared in a series of British films, three of which featured his creation Sam Small. He started his association with the filmmakers <a href="Ealing%20Studios">Ealing Studios</a> in 1934, appearing in the fifth <a href="Gracie%20Fields">Gracie Fields</a> picture "<a href="Sing%20As%20We%20Go">Sing As We Go</a>". His other films from the 1930s included "Squibs" (1935) and "<a href="The%20Vicar%20of%20Bray%20%28film%29">The Vicar of Bray</a>" (1937). In December 1934, Holloway made his first appearance in <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>, playing Abanazar in "<a href="Aladdin">Aladdin</a>". In his first season in the part, he was overshadowed by his co-star, <a href="Henry%20Lytton">Sir Henry Lytton</a>, as the Emperor, but he quickly became established as a favourite in his role, playing it in successive years in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, London, Edinburgh and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>.

On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Holloway, who was 49, was too old for active service. Instead, he appeared in short propaganda pieces for the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> and <a href="Path%C3%A9%20News">Pathé News</a>. He narrated documentaries aimed at lifting morale in war-torn Britain, including "Albert's Savings" (1940), written by Marriott Edgar and featuring the character Albert Ramsbottom, and "Worker and Warfront No.8" (1943), with a script written by <a href="Edmund%20Clerihew%20Bentley">E. C. Bentley</a> about a worker who neglects to have an injury examined and contracts blood poisoning. Both films were included on a 2007 <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum">Imperial War Museum</a> DVD "Britain's Home Front at War: Words for Battle."

On stage during the war years, Holloway appeared in revues, first "Up and Doing", with Henson, <a href="Binnie%20Hale">Binnie Hale</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Ritchard">Cyril Ritchard</a> in 1940 and 1941, and then "Fine and Dandy", with Henson, <a href="Dorothy%20Dickson">Dorothy Dickson</a>, <a href="Douglas%20Byng">Douglas Byng</a> and <a href="Graham%20Payn">Graham Payn</a>. In both shows, Holloway presented new monologues, and "The Times" thought a highlight of "Fine and Dandy" was a parody of the BBC radio programme "<a href="The%20Brains%20Trust">The Brains Trust</a>", with Holloway "ponderously anecdotal" and Henson "gigglingly omniscient".

In 1941 Holloway took a character part in <a href="Gabriel%20Pascal">Gabriel Pascal</a>'s film of <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>'s "<a href="Major%20Barbara%20%28film%29">Major Barbara</a>", in which he played a policeman. He had leading parts in later films, including "<a href="The%20Way%20Ahead">The Way Ahead</a>" (1944), "<a href="This%20Happy%20Breed%20%28film%29">This Happy Breed</a>" (1944) and "<a href="The%20Way%20to%20the%20Stars">The Way to the Stars</a>" (1945). After the war, he played Albert Godby in "<a href="Brief%20Encounter">Brief Encounter</a>" and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>'s 1948 film of "<a href="Hamlet%20%281948%20film%29">Hamlet</a>". In 1951 Holloway played the same role on the stage to the Hamlet of <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>. For Pathé News, he delivered the commentary for documentaries in a series called "Time To Remember", where he narrated over old newsreels from significant dates in history from 1915 to 1942. Holloway also starred in a series of films for Ealing Studios, beginning with "<a href="Champagne%20Charlie%20%281944%20film%29">Champagne Charlie</a>" in 1944 alongside <a href="Tommy%20Trinder">Tommy Trinder</a>. After that he made "<a href="The%20Life%20and%20Adventures%20of%20Nicholas%20Nickleby%20%281947%20film%29">Nicholas Nickleby</a>" (1947) and "<a href="Another%20Shore">Another Shore</a>" (1948). He next appeared in three of the most famous <a href="Ealing%20Comedies">Ealing Comedies</a>, "<a href="Passport%20to%20Pimlico">Passport to Pimlico</a>" (1949), "<a href="The%20Lavender%20Hill%20Mob">The Lavender Hill Mob</a>" (1951) and "<a href="The%20Titfield%20Thunderbolt">The Titfield Thunderbolt</a>" (1953). His final film with the studio was "<a href="Meet%20Mr.%20Lucifer">Meet Mr. Lucifer</a>" (1953).

In 1948 Holloway conducted a six-month tour of Australia and New Zealand and supported by the band leader <a href="Billy%20Mayerl">Billy Mayerl</a>. He made his Australian début at The Tivoli Theatre, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, and recorded television appearances to publicise the forthcoming release of "Passport to Pimlico". Holloway wrote the monologue "Albert Down Under" especially for the tour.

In 1954 Holloway joined the <a href="Old%20Vic">Old Vic</a> theatre company to play Bottom in "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>", with <a href="Robert%20Helpmann">Robert Helpmann</a> as Oberon and <a href="Moira%20Shearer">Moira Shearer</a> as Titania. After playing at the <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> took the production to New York, where it played at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera House</a> and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression. Holloway said of the experience: "Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>" and from then on, well, just let's say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age." Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy "<a href="Jumping%20for%20Joy">Jumping for Joy</a>". American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.
In 1956 Holloway created the role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the original <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> production of "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>". The librettist, <a href="Alan%20Jay%20Lerner">Alan Jay Lerner</a>, remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at <a href="Claridge%27s">Claridge's</a>: Lerner recalled, "He put down his knife and fork, threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted." Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the <a href="Mark%20Hellinger%20Theatre">Mark Hellinger Theatre</a>, the 1958 London version at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, and the <a href="My%20Fair%20Lady%20%28film%29">film version</a> in 1964, which he undertook instead of the role of Admiral Bloom in "<a href="Mary%20Poppins%20%28film%29">Mary Poppins</a>" that he had been offered the same year. In "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", <a href="Alistair%20Cooke">Alistair Cooke</a> wrote, "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England." Also in 1964, he appeared as Bellomy in the <a href="Hallmark%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hallmark Hall of Fame</a> television production of "<a href="The%20Fantasticks">The Fantasticks</a>".
Looking back in 2004, Holloway's biographer <a href="Eric%20Midwinter">Eric Midwinter</a> wrote, "With his cockney authenticity, his splendid baritone voice, and his wealth of comedy experience, he made a great success of this role, and, as he said, it put him 'bang on top of the heap, in demand' again at a time when, in his mid-sixties, his career was beginning to wane". His performances earned him a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Following his success on Broadway, Holloway played Pooh-Bah in a 1960 US television <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Hour">Bell Telephone Hour</a> production of "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>", produced by the veteran <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> performer <a href="Martyn%20Green">Martyn Green</a>. Holloway appeared with <a href="Groucho%20Marx">Groucho Marx</a> and <a href="Helen%20Traubel">Helen Traubel</a> of the Metropolitan Opera. His notable films around this time included "<a href="Alive%20and%20Kicking%20%281959%20film%29">"Alive and Kicking"</a>" in 1959, co-starring <a href="Sybil%20Thorndike">Sybil Thorndike</a> and <a href="Kathleen%20Harrison">Kathleen Harrison</a>, and "<a href="No%20Love%20for%20Johnnie">No Love for Johnnie</a>" in 1961 opposite <a href="Peter%20Finch">Peter Finch</a>. In 1962, Holloway took part in a studio recording of "<a href="Oliver%21">Oliver!</a>" with <a href="Alma%20Cogan">Alma Cogan</a> and <a href="Violet%20Carson">Violet Carson</a>, in which he played Fagin.

In 1962 Holloway played the role of an English butler called Higgins in a US television sitcom called "<a href="Our%20Man%20Higgins">Our Man Higgins</a>". It ran for only a season. His son <a href="Julian%20Holloway">Julian</a> also appeared in the series. In 1964 he again appeared on stage in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in "Cool Off!", a short-lived <a href="Faust">Faust</a>ian spoof. He returned to the US a few more times after that to take part in "<a href="The%20Dean%20Martin%20Show">The Dean Martin Show</a>" three times and "<a href="The%20Red%20Skelton%20Show">The Red Skelton Show</a>" twice. He also appeared in the 1965 war film "<a href="In%20Harm%27s%20Way">In Harm's Way</a>", together with <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> and <a href="Kirk%20Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>.

Holloway appeared for the first time in a major British television series in the BBC's 1967 adaptation of <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a>'s "<a href="Blandings%20Castle">Blandings Castle</a>" stories, playing Beach, the butler, to <a href="Ralph%20Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>'s Lord Emsworth. His portrayal of Beach was received with critical reservation, but the series was a popular success. After "My Fair Lady", Holloway was able to get film roles in "<a href="Mrs.%20Brown%2C%20You%27ve%20Got%20a%20Lovely%20Daughter%20%28film%29">Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter</a>" (1968), which starred the 1960s British pop group <a href="Herman%27s%20Hermits">Herman's Hermits</a>, "<a href="The%20Private%20Life%20of%20Sherlock%20Holmes">The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes</a>", "<a href="Flight%20of%20the%20Doves">Flight of the Doves</a>" and "<a href="Up%20the%20Front">Up the Front</a>", all in the early 1970s. His final film was "<a href="Journey%20into%20Fear%20%281975%20film%29">Journey into Fear</a>" (1974).

In 1970, Holloway began an association with the <a href="Shaw%20Festival">Shaw Festival</a> in Canada, playing Burgess in "<a href="Candida%20%28play%29">Candida</a>". He made what he considered his West End debut as a straight actor in "Siege" by <a href="David%20Ambrose">David Ambrose</a> at the <a href="Cambridge%20Theatre">Cambridge Theatre</a> in 1972, co-starring with <a href="Alastair%20Sim">Alastair Sim</a> and <a href="Michael%20Bryant%20%28actor%29">Michael Bryant</a>. He returned to <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Shaw</a> and Canada, playing the central character Walter/William in "<a href="You%20Never%20Can%20Tell%20%28play%29">You Never Can Tell</a>" in 1973.

Holloway continued to perform until well into his eighties, touring Asia and Australia in 1977 together with <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks%2C%20Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.</a> and <a href="David%20Langton">David Langton</a> in "<a href="The%20Pleasure%20of%20His%20Company">The Pleasure of His Company</a>", by <a href="Samuel%20A.%20Taylor">Samuel A. Taylor</a> and <a href="Cornelia%20Otis%20Skinner">Cornelia Otis Skinner</a>. He made his last appearance performing at the <a href="Royal%20Variety%20Performance">Royal Variety Performance</a> at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a> in 1980, aged 89.

Holloway died of a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> at the Nightingale Nursing Home in <a href="Littlehampton">Littlehampton</a>, <a href="West%20Sussex">West Sussex</a>, on 30 January 1982, aged 91. He is buried, along with his wife Violet, at St Mary the Virgin Church in <a href="East%20Preston%2C%20West%20Sussex">East Preston</a>, West Sussex.

Holloway was married twice, first to Alice "Queenie" Foran. They met in June 1913 in Clacton, while he was performing in a concert party and she was selling charity flags on behalf of the <a href="Royal%20National%20Lifeboat%20Institution">Royal National Lifeboat Institution</a>. Queenie was orphaned at the age of 16, something that Holloway felt he and Queenie had in common, as his mother had died that year and his father had earlier abandoned the family. He married Queenie in November 1913.

Holloway and Queenie had four children: Joan, born on Holloway's 24th birthday in 1914, Patricia (b. 1920), John (1925–2013) and Mary (b. 1928). Upon the death of her mother, Queenie inherited some property in <a href="Southampton%20Row">Southampton Row</a> and relied on the rents from the property for her income. During the First World War, while Holloway was away fighting in France, Queenie began to have financial trouble, as the tenants failed to pay their rent. Out of desperation, she approached several loan sharks, incurring a huge debt about which Holloway knew nothing. She also started to drink heavily as the pressures from the war and of supporting her daughter took their toll. On Holloway's return from the war, the debt was paid off and they moved to <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, West London. By the late 1920s, Holloway found himself in financial difficulties with the British tax authorities and was briefly declared bankrupt. In the 1930s, Holloway and Queenie moved to <a href="Bayswater">Bayswater</a> and remained there until Queenie's death in 1937 at the age of 45, from <a href="cirrhosis%20of%20the%20liver">cirrhosis of the liver</a>. Of the children from this first marriage, John worked as an engineer in an electrics company, and Mary worked for <a href="British%20Petroleum">British Petroleum</a> for many years.

On 2 January 1939, Holloway married a 25-year-old actress and former chorus dancer named Violet Marion Lane (1913–1997) and they moved to <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>. Violet was born into a working-class family from <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>. Her mother was Scottish, and her civil engineer father, Alfred Lane, was a <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>man. Holloway's second marriage lasted over 40 years until his death in 1982. Although he was a client of the Aza Agency in London, Violet effectively managed Holloway's career, and no project was taken on without her approval. In his autobiography, Holloway said of her, "I suppose I am committing lawful bigamy. Not only is she my wife, lover, mother, cook, chauffeuse, private secretary, house keeper, hostess, electrician, business manager, critic, handy woman, she is also my best friend." Together, they had one son, <a href="Julian%20Holloway">Julian</a>, who also became an actor and is best known for appearing in the "<a href="Carry%20On%20%28franchise%29">Carry On</a>" films. Julian had a brief relationship with <a href="Patricia%20Neal">Patricia Neal</a>'s daughter <a href="Tessa%20Dahl">Tessa Dahl</a> which produced a daughter, the model and author <a href="Sophie%20Dahl">Sophie Dahl</a>.

Holloway, Violet and Julian lived mainly in the tiny village of <a href="Penn%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Penn, Buckinghamshire</a>. Holloway also owned other properties including a flat in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a> in North West London, which he used when working in the capital, and a flat in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> during the "My Fair Lady" Broadway years. The final years of his life were spent in <a href="Angmering">Angmering</a>, West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, <a href="Maurice%20Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a>, Laurence Olivier and <a href="Arthur%20Askey">Arthur Askey</a>, who said of him, "He was the nicest man I ever knew. He never had a wrong word to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show." While working in the US, Holloway numbered among his friends <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a>, <a href="Burgess%20Meredith">Burgess Meredith</a> and Groucho Marx.

Holloway was appointed an Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) in the <a href="1960%20New%20Year%20Honours">1960 New Year Honours</a> for his services to entertainment. In 1978 he was honoured with a special award by the <a href="Variety%20Club%20of%20Great%20Britain">Variety Club of Great Britain</a>.

There is a memorial plaque dedicated to Holloway in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's, Covent Garden</a>, London, which is known as "the actors' church". The plaque is next to a memorial to Gracie Fields. In 2009 <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> unveiled a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> at 25 Albany Road, Manor Park, Essex, the house in which he was born in 1890. There is a building named after him at 2 Coolfin Road, Newham, London, called Stanley Holloway Court.

Holloway entitled his autobiography "Wiv a Little Bit o' Luck" after <a href="With%20a%20Little%20Bit%20of%20Luck">the song</a> he performed in "My Fair Lady". The book was ghostwritten by the writer and director <a href="Dick%20Richards">Dick Richards</a> and published in 1967. Holloway oversaw the publication of three volumes of the monologues by or associated with him: "Monologues" (1979); "The Stanley Holloway Monologues" (1980); and "More Monologues" (1981).

Holloway had a 54-year recording career, beginning in the age of <a href="Gramophone%20record%23%26quot%3BAcoustical%26quot%3B%20recording">acoustic recording</a>, and ending in the era of the <a href="Gramophone%20record%23Stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic LP</a>. He mainly recorded songs from musicals and revues, and he recited many monologues on various subjects. Most prominent among his recordings (aside from his participation in recordings of "My Fair Lady") are those of three series of monologues that he made at intervals throughout his career. They featured Sam Small, Albert Ramsbottom, and historical events such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>. In all, his discography runs to 130 recordings, spanning the period 1924 to 1978. A review in "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">The Gramophone</a>" of one of his 1957 albums containing recordings of his old "concert party" songs commented, "what a fine voice he has and how well he can use it – diction, phrasing, range and the interpretative insight of the artist".

Hattie Jacques

Hattie Jacques (; born Josephine Edwina Jaques; 7 February 1922 – 6 October 1980) was an English comedy actress of stage, radio and screen. She is best known as a regular of the <a href="Carry%20On%20%28franchise%29">"Carry On"</a> films, where she typically played strict, no-nonsense characters, but was also a prolific television and radio performer.

Jacques started her career in 1944 with an appearance at the <a href="Players%27%20Theatre">Players' Theatre</a> in London, but came to national prominence through her appearances on three highly popular radio series on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>: with <a href="Tommy%20Handley">Tommy Handley</a> on "<a href="It%27s%20That%20Man%20Again">It's That Man Again</a>"; with ventriloquist <a href="Peter%20Brough">Peter Brough</a> on "<a href="Educating%20Archie">Educating Archie</a>"; and then with <a href="Tony%20Hancock">Tony Hancock</a> on "<a href="Hancock%27s%20Half%20Hour">Hancock's Half Hour</a>". After the Second World War Jacques made her cinematic debut in "<a href="Green%20for%20Danger%20%28film%29">Green for Danger</a>", in which she had a brief, uncredited role. From 1958 to 1974 she appeared in 14 "Carry On" films, playing various roles including the formidable hospital <a href="matron">matron</a>. On television she had a long professional partnership with <a href="Eric%20Sykes">Eric Sykes</a>, with whom she co-starred in his long-running series "<a href="Sykes">Sykes</a>" and "<a href="Sykes%20and%20a...">Sykes and a...</a>". The role endeared her to the public and the two became staples of British television.

In private, Jacques led a turbulent life. She was married to the actor <a href="John%20Le%20Mesurier">John Le Mesurier</a> from 1949 until their divorce in 1965, a separation caused by her five-year affair with another man. Jacques, who had been overweight since her teenage years, suffered ill-health soon after the separation from Le Mesurier and her weight rose to nearly 20 stone (130 kg). She died of a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> on 6 October 1980, at the age of 58. Her biographer, Francis Gray, considers Jacques had a "talent for larger-than-life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity", while she could also display "a broader comic mode" as a result of her "extraordinary versatility".

Jacques was born Josephine Edwina Jaques on 7 February 1922 at 125 Sandgate High Street, <a href="Sandgate%2C%20Kent">Sandgate</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. She was the youngest child of Robin Rochester Jaques (1897–1923), a serviceman in the British Army and later the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, and Mary Jaques ( Thorne), a nurse who served in the <a href="Voluntary%20Aid%20Detachment">Voluntary Aid Detachment</a> (VAD).

The Jaques family were predominantly non-theatrical, with the exception of Mary who appeared in the small role of Harry Hathaway in the Christmas <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> "<a href="Robinson%20Crusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a>" at the Palace Theatre, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, in 1920. Mary enjoyed the theatre, and took Jacques to live performances from an early age. The result had a "profound effect" on the young girl, particularly a love of dance. Robin Rochester Jaques, who attained the rank of <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> with the RAF, was a keen sportsman and became a semi-professional footballer. He signed to Clapton Orient and <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham F.C.</a>, but his career was cut short when he died in a flying accident on 8 August 1923. Upon his death, Mary, Jacques and her elder brother <a href="Robin%20Jacques">Robin</a> moved from <a href="Newton%20and%20Haceby">Newton</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> to London, where Jacques was sent to the Lady Margaret primary school in Chelsea. In July 1930 Jacques started her secondary schooling at the <a href="Godolphin%20and%20Latymer%20School">Godolphin and Latymer School</a> in <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>, and also attended a local dance school, the Dean Sisters Academy, where she was a principal dancer in the Academy's shows. She left Godolphin and Latymer in the summer of 1939 with unremarkable grades. She continued intermittently with amateur theatricals, and in May 1939 appeared with the Curtain Club in Barnes in productions of "<a href="Fumed%20Oak">Fumed Oak</a>" and "Borgia".

At the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> Jacques became a nurse in the VAD; she served in a mobile unit in London, attending bombed sites during <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>. After a reorganisation in the VAD, Jacques sought new work and, in the summer of 1943, she became a <a href="welder">welder</a> in a factory in north London, a job that lasted until the end of the year. Around this time she became romantically involved with an American soldier, Major Charles Kearney. Jacques later claimed that the pair had been engaged and that Kearney had been killed in action, although her biographer, Andy Merriman, discovered that Kearney had a wife and children in the United States when he had proposed to Jacques, and had returned to them after the war.

In 1944, after being auditioned by <a href="Leonard%20Sachs">Leonard Sachs</a>, Jacques made her professional theatrical debut as Josephine Jacques—adding a "c" to her birth name as she did so—at the <a href="Players%27%20Theatre">Players' Theatre</a>, London in a revue called "Late Joys". Almost immediately she became a regular performer with the company, appearing in <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> revues and playing the <a href="Fairy%20Queen">Fairy Queen</a> in their Victorian-style pantomimes. Her biographer, Frances Gray, described the Players' as being Jacques's drama school, as she acted, directed, wrote lyrics and "developed the persona she was to use in pantomime for years, the large, bossy, but vulnerable fairy queen". It was while appearing in a "Late Joys" revue in June 1946 that she made her debut on television, when the show was broadcast on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>. While appearing at the Players' in 1946 she acquired the nickname "Hattie" after performing in the <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrel show</a> "Coal Black Mammies for Dixie". A member of the backstage staff compared her "blacked up" appearance with the American actress <a href="Hattie%20McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a>, known for her work in "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>", and Jacques adopted the name for the rest of her life.

Jacques made her big-screen debut, briefly and uncredited, in the 1946 film "<a href="Green%20for%20Danger%20%28film%29">Green for Danger</a>", directed by <a href="Sidney%20Gilliat">Sidney Gilliat</a>. In December that year, she joined the <a href="Young%20Vic%23Young%20Vic%20Theatre">Young Vic Theatre Company</a> and played Smeraldina in "The King Stag". The play ran at the <a href="Lyric%20Theatre%20%28Hammersmith%29">Lyric Theatre</a> for a month before going on a five-month tour of the UK. It received favourable reviews; the "<a href="Gloucestershire%20Echo">Gloucestershire Echo</a>" described the piece as "a noble play", and thought that Jacques was "very solidly in step". In March 1947 <a href="Alberto%20Cavalcanti">Alberto Cavalcanti</a>'s film "<a href="Nicholas%20Nickleby%20%281947%20film%29">Nicholas Nickleby</a>" was released, in which Jacques had her first credited big-screen role as Mrs Kenwick. While engaged at the Players' in June 1947, Jacques was introduced to the actor <a href="John%20Le%20Mesurier">John Le Mesurier</a> and the two began a relationship. Le Mesurier was married but estranged from his wife.
In August 1947 <a href="Ted%20Kavanagh">Ted Kavanagh</a>, the scriptwriter of the <a href="BBC%20Home%20Service">BBC Home Service</a> show "<a href="It%27s%20That%20Man%20Again">It's That Man Again</a>" ("ITMA"), visited the Players' and invited Jacques to audition for the series, which she did on 18 September, for a fee of five <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a>. She became so nervous during the audition that <a href="Tommy%20Handley">Tommy Handley</a>, the show's star, held her hand, which she found made her more nervous. Jacques joined the cast of "ITMA" as the greedy schoolgirl Sophie Tuckshop, where she "would regale listeners with terrifying accounts of epic binges", before finishing her stories with the catchphrase "But I'm all right now". Jacques started her run in "ITMA" in September 1947, at the beginning of series eleven, which ran for 38 episodes, and was paid ten guineas per episode.

For much of 1948 Jacques continued to record episodes of "ITMA" for half the week, while spending evenings in the Players' Theatre; she also found time during the spring to record the role of Flora in "<a href="No%2C%20No%2C%20Nanette">No, No, Nanette</a>" for the BBC and appear at the <a href="Whitehall%20Theatre">Whitehall Theatre</a> in "Bates Wharf" with the Under Thirty Theatre Group. Later that year she appeared as a singer at the Three Cripples tavern in the <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a> film "<a href="Oliver%20Twist%20%281948%20film%29">Oliver Twist</a>". In September she started recording her second series of "ITMA"—the show's twelfth—before returning to the Players' for the Christmas pantomime, "The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood". In the latter performance, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented that Jacques "must surely be among the funniest fairies" in her role as the Fairy Queen Antedota—which was one of her favourite parts.

Tommy Handley died suddenly on 9 January 1949; the BBC decided that he was "so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance" of "ITMA", that they cancelled the show immediately. Jacques later remarked that Handley was "one of the greatest radio performers we have ever known. I learned ... so much from him". Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife; shortly after the divorce came through, Jacques proposed to him, asking, "don't you think it's about time we got married?" The couple wed on 10 November that year, at Kensington Registrar's Office. After a week's honeymoon in <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a>, she returned to the Players' where she was engaged to appear as Marrygolda in the Christmas pantomime "<a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast">Beauty and the Beast</a>".

In the early months of 1950 "<a href="Chance%20of%20a%20Lifetime%20%281950%20film%29">Chance of a Lifetime</a>" was released into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques "really made her mark", according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. "Chance of a Lifetime" is a social and <a href="industrial%20relations">industrial relations</a> drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I know how hard it is. That's not enough money!" and the offer was raised accordingly. The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had "the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front of an angry <a href="Niall%20MacGinnis">[Niall] MacGinnis</a>".

On 6 June 1950 Jacques was cast in the first episode of the weekly radio show "<a href="Educating%20Archie">Educating Archie</a>" as Agatha Dinglebody. The "Archie" of the title was the <a href="ventriloquism">ventriloquist</a>'s dummy <a href="Archie%20Andrews%20%28puppet%29">Archie Andrews</a>, operated by <a href="Peter%20Brough">Peter Brough</a>. The first series ran for 29 weeks until 19 December. In the show Jacques appeared alongside <a href="Max%20Bygraves">Max Bygraves</a>, <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>, <a href="Beryl%20Reid">Beryl Reid</a> and—in the second series—<a href="Tony%20Hancock">Tony Hancock</a>. It was on this programme that she first worked with <a href="Eric%20Sykes">Eric Sykes</a>, who was providing scripts for the series. Sykes had been impressed with Jacques since he visited the Players' in 1948. He later wrote that she "moved about the stage with an elegance and grace as if she owned it. At the end of her act, to great applause, she leapt in the air, finishing in the splits, landing as softly as a snowflake in July". After the show Sykes was introduced to Jacques backstage and thought that the meeting was "the beginning of a new flight" in his professional life. At the end of the series Jacques returned to the Players' to appear in the Christmas pantomime, "Ali Baba and the Thirty-nine Thieves", which she and <a href="Joan%20Sterndale-Bennett">Joan Sterndale-Bennett</a> had adapted after they had copied it out long-hand at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. The reviewer in "The Times" thought that Jacques was "as appealing as last year", in her performance as <a href="Ali%20Baba">Ali Baba</a>'s wife, Cogia.

Throughout 1951 Jacques continued to mix work in different media, including appearing as Mrs Fezziwig in the film "<a href="Scrooge%20%281951%20film%29">Scrooge</a>" starring <a href="Alastair%20Sim">Alastair Sim</a>; from 3 August until 25 January 1952 she appeared in a second radio series of "Educating Archie", as well as appearing in the related stage show, "The Archie Andrews Christmas Show" at the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Theatre">Prince of Wales Theatre</a> from December 1952 to January 1953. She again appeared in—and co-adapted—a Christmas pantomime at the Players' Theatre, "<a href="Riquet%20with%20the%20Tuft">Riquet with the Tuft</a>", a French <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a> by <a href="Charles%20Perrault">Charles Perrault</a>. In 1952 Jacques also portrayed Mrs Jenks in <a href="John%20Gilling">John Gilling</a>'s comedy horror film "<a href="Mother%20Riley%20Meets%20the%20Vampire">Mother Riley Meets the Vampire</a>", co-starring <a href="Arthur%20Lucan">Arthur Lucan</a> and <a href="Bela%20Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a>.
Jacques became pregnant in 1952, but worked though most of her pregnancy, appearing in the Players' revue "The Bells of St Martins" between August and November 1952: she slid down the table and did the splits at the end—something "The Times" thought was "especially good", although "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" considered that she was "monumental of person but surprisingly thin of voice". Le Mesurier reported that he was "faintly relieved" when the revue came to an end because of her exertions, added to which she appeared in the 27 episodes of the third series of "Educating Archie" between September 1952 and June 1953. She then directed—but did not appear in—the Players' Christmas pantomime of 1952, "<a href="Babes%20in%20the%20Wood">Babes in the Wood</a>". In March 1953 Jacques gave birth to her first son, Robin, and returned to work after a few days to film "<a href="Up%20to%20His%20Neck">Up to His Neck</a>". Later that year she provided the lead alongside Le Mesurier in the 38-minute "movie-<a href="masque">masque</a>" "<a href="The%20Pleasure%20Garden%20%281953%20film%29">The Pleasure Garden</a>"; filmed in 1952, it won the at the 1954 <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. From October until April 1954 she was in series four of "Educating Archie", while in December 1953 she also appeared in and directed "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>" at the Players'; "The Times" commented that "Miss Jacques as actress, playing a deliciously arch and absent-minded Fairy Queen, goes a long way to retrieve the failure of Miss Jacques as dramatist".

In 1954 Jacques continued to work on radio. Between April and July she was in "Paradise Street", a spin-off series from "Educating Archie", while in June she was in "Archie in Goonland", a one-off special programme that was a collaboration between "Educating Archie" and "<a href="The%20Goon%20Show">The Goon Show</a>". As well as recording in series five of "Educating Archie", she was also cast as Mrs Leathers for 18 episodes of "<a href="Mrs%20Dale%27s%20Diary">Mrs Dale's Diary</a>" between February and April 1955. She both produced and directed "Twenty Minutes South", first at the Players' Theatre, and then for 105 performances at the <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Theatre">St Martin's Theatre</a> and finished the year by appearing in seven episodes of "The Granville Melodramas" on <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> between October and December.

A second pregnancy led to the birth of a son, Kim, "who came rollicking and laughing into the world in October 1956, a trifle before his allotted time", according to Le Mesurier. In June 1956 Jacques appeared in an episode of "<a href="The%20Tony%20Hancock%20Show">The Tony Hancock Show</a>" on ITV; this led to the role of Hancock's secretary, Griselda Pugh, in the BBC radio series "<a href="Hancock%27s%20Half%20Hour">Hancock's Half Hour</a>". She appeared in 16 episodes from November 1956 to February 1957, alongside Hancock and regulars <a href="Sid%20James">Sidney James</a>, <a href="Bill%20Kerr">Bill Kerr</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Williams">Kenneth Williams</a>. Jacques's arrival on "Hancock" "provided an additional boost to the series", according to television historian Richard Webber. She appeared again in five further episodes of "Hancock's Half Hour" between April and June 1957, and again for a further 20 episodes between January and June 1958, before a special edition on Christmas Day 1958. She spent much of 1958 at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a>, undertaking 380 performances of the revue "Large as Life", alongside <a href="Terry-Thomas">Terry-Thomas</a>, Eric Sykes and <a href="Harry%20Secombe">Harry Secombe</a>. She appeared in the sketches "Concerto for Three Buffoons" with Secombe and Sykes, "<a href="The%20Good%20Old%20Days%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">The Good Old Days</a>", and the two full company numbers that closed each of the two halves of the show.

When the first "<a href="Carry%20On%20%28film%20series%29">Carry On</a>" film was made in 1958, Jacques formed part of the cast. This series would go on to employ the same group of actors who would collectively become known as the "<a href="List%20of%20Carry%20On%20films%20cast%20members">Carry On team</a>". Jacques appeared in 14 of these films over a 15-year period and like many of her "Carry On" co-stars, she quickly became typecast. A recurring role for Jacques was a no-nonsense matron which she played in five of the films – "<a href="Carry%20On%20Nurse">Carry On Nurse</a>", "<a href="Carry%20On%20Doctor">Carry On Doctor</a>", "<a href="Carry%20On%20Again%20Doctor">Carry On Again Doctor</a>", "<a href="Carry%20On%20Camping">Carry On Camping</a>" and "<a href="Carry%20On%20Matron">Carry On Matron</a>". She became known by the team as a "Mother Hen" figure, and was a close friend to many of her co-stars, including Kenneth Williams and <a href="Joan%20Sims">Joan Sims</a>, whom Jacques provided with a great deal of advice and practical help. In return, Sims regarded Jacques as her "greatest friend", and as "both a sister and a mother to me". Jacques would frequently invite Sims, Williams and Hawtrey to her house for Christmas dinner.

Jacques began her association with the "Carry On" series in March 1958 with the first film in the series, "<a href="Carry%20On%20Sergeant">Carry On Sergeant</a>". She played the small role of Captain Clark, a "battleaxe medical officer" who fails to believe the fabricated ailments of the <a href="hypochondriac">hypochondriac</a> Private Horace Strong, played by <a href="Kenneth%20Connor">Kenneth Connor</a>. The following year she played "Matron" for the first time in "Carry On Nurse", a film which broke that year's box office records, selling more than 10 million tickets in British cinemas. Although Jacques's role was still relatively small, she appeared in perhaps the best known scene of the film, in which she retrieves a daffodil from <a href="Wilfrid%20Hyde-White">Wilfrid Hyde-White</a>'s buttocks, put there by a mischievous nurse as revenge for his constant harassment of the staff. So popular was Jacques's scene, that the producers imported two million plastic daffodils from Japan which were then used to promote the comedy. Other characterisations followed, including the formidable maths mistress Grace Short in "<a href="Carry%20On%20Teacher">Carry On Teacher</a>" (1959) and the friendly Police Sergeant Laura Moon in "<a href="Carry%20On%20Constable">Carry On Constable</a>" (1960). Of the former film, Derek Prouse of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" thought that Jacques "triumph[ed] over material so remorselessly juvenile that one is battered into a kind of fascinated admiration".

On 29 January 1960 Jacques appeared in the first episode of the BBC comedy series "<a href="Sykes%20and%20a...">Sykes and a...</a>", co-starring with Eric Sykes as a pair of twins; <a href="Richard%20Wattis">Richard Wattis</a> and <a href="Deryck%20Guyler">Deryck Guyler</a> were also regulars in the cast. Jacques's character—Hattie (Hat) Sykes—was "a middle-class, slightly pretentious lady struggling to keep her dignity as the men made fools of themselves". "Sykes and a..." went on to run for sixty episodes over nine series during the next five years. According to the media historian Graham McCann, the show was "one of the best-natured, least pretentious and most successful British sitcoms of the 1960s". Because of the success, Jacques and Sykes "became embedded in the public mind as a priceless comic partnership"; to capitalise, they released a comedy album entitled "Eric and Hattie and Things<nowiki>!!!</nowiki>", but it failed to chart. In September 1960 she starred in her second television series, "<a href="Our%20House%20%281960%20TV%20series%29">Our House</a>", alongside <a href="Charles%20Hawtrey%20%28actor%20born%201914%29">Charles Hawtrey</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Bresslaw">Bernard Bresslaw</a> and Joan Sims; Jacques played the librarian Georgina Ruddy, who was forced to keep quiet at work and so made up for it by being extremely noisy at home. Later that year she played minor roles in two films: "<a href="Watch%20Your%20Stern">Watch Your Stern</a>", with many of the "Carry On" regulars, and "<a href="School%20for%20Scoundrels%20%281960%20film%29">School for Scoundrels</a>", opposite <a href="Ian%20Carmichael">Ian Carmichael</a>. After these her screen time increased with the part of Nanette Parry in "<a href="Make%20Mine%20Mink">Make Mine Mink</a>" in which she co-starred with Terry-Thomas and <a href="Athene%20Seyler">Athene Seyler</a>. She later described this as her favourite film.

In October 1961 Jacques appeared on "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>", and said that she would be too lonely on such a quiet island for someone of her temperament. By this time "Carry On" had become a leading film franchise, with the author Robert Ross describing it as a "phenomenon". That year's film, "<a href="Carry%20On%20Regardless">Carry On Regardless</a>", was the fifth in the series; Jacques received a fee of £100 for the small role of a disgruntled hospital nurse, who appeared briefly on screen alongside the English character actor <a href="Kynaston%20Reeves">Kynaston Reeves</a> who played her cantankerous boss. Jacques was initially intended for a major part in the film, but she was unable to commit to a longer role because of ill health. She appeared in her sixth "Carry On", "<a href="Carry%20On%20Cabby">Carry On Cabby</a>", in 1963, as "Peggy Hawkins", the emotionally neglected wife of taxi-firm boss "Charlie", played by Sid James. Jacques later named the film as her favourite of the series, as she was allowed to drop her "battleaxe" persona and play the romantic lead opposite James.

Jacques's private life became complicated in 1963. The previous year she had met John Schofield, a <a href="cockney">cockney</a> used-car dealer, who chauffeured her to a <a href="Leukaemia%20Research%20Fund">Leukaemia Research Fund</a> event. The couple became romantically involved after the driver gave her the attention and support that Le Mesurier did not. When Jacques decided to move Schofield into the family home, Le Mesurier moved into a separate room. He later commented about this period: "I could have walked out, but, whatever my feelings, I loved Hattie and the children and I was certain—I had to be certain—that we could repair the damage". During these upheavals in her personal life, Jacques was surprised to be the subject of "<a href="This%20Is%20Your%20Life%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">This Is Your Life</a>" in February 1963, when she was approached by <a href="Eamonn%20Andrews">Eamonn Andrews</a> during rehearsal for the sixth series of "<a href="Sykes%20and%20a...">Sykes and a...</a>". Although Le Mesurier did not mention the marital situation when being questioned by Andrews, he made the comment that for Jacques "the home comes first", which Merriman considered had been said "rather pointedly". Despite the matrimonial upsets, Jacques and Le Mesurier both appeared in the 1963 Tony Hancock film, "<a href="The%20Punch%20and%20Judy%20Man">The Punch and Judy Man</a>". In 1964 Le Mesurier moved out of the marital home, made a decision to protect Jacques from any negative publicity, and allowed her to bring a divorce suit on grounds of his own infidelity. This ensured that the press blamed him for the break-up, casting Jacques as the victim in the matter.

In 1964, as well as recording four episodes of the radio show "<a href="Housewives%27%20Choice">Housewives' Choice</a>", Jacques starred in her own television series, "Miss Adventure", as the private investigator Stacey Smith. Although Jacques wanted the series to be full of suspense, the programmes were more comedic and she was disappointed with the results. In August that year she appeared as Madame Arcati in an ITV production of "<a href="Blithe%20Spirit%20%28play%29">Blithe Spirit</a>". The play's writer, <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>, felt that "finally someone had delivered a performance that wasn't overshadowed by <a href="Margaret%20Rutherford">Margaret Rutherford</a>", who had originated the stage role in 1940 and played it in the 1945 <a href="Blithe%20Spirit%20%28film%29">film version</a>.

Jacques went to Rome in 1966 to film "<a href="The%20Bobo">The Bobo</a>" with <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>; before this she went on a strict diet and lost five stone (31 kg), although she was disappointed that so few people noticed. She enjoyed the filming experience, calling it "one of the loveliest things I've worked on". While she was in Italy, Schofield came out to stay, started an affair with an Italian heiress and broke off his relationship with Jacques; deeply upset, Jacques, who had had a weight problem since her teens, began eating <a href="comfort%20food">comfort food</a> and her weight increased to nearly .

In the summer of 1967 the "Carry On" producer <a href="Peter%20Rogers">Peter Rogers</a> assembled the cast for the 15th film of the series, "Carry On Doctor". Rogers initially chose Joan Sims to play the role of the hospital matron but she declined the part, stating that Jacques's performance of the role in "Carry On Nurse" could not be bettered. As such, Rogers cast Jacques as Matron, with Sims accepting a smaller role as the timid assistant of the film's lead character Francis Bigger, played by <a href="Frankie%20Howerd">Frankie Howerd</a>. Jacques's screen time was increased from "Carry On Nurse", as the producers considered her part to be an extension of the earlier role. "Carry On Doctor" was released in December of that year, to much success.

Jacques started 1968 by appearing with <a href="Spike%20Milligan">Spike Milligan</a> and <a href="Frank%20Thornton">Frank Thornton</a> in thirteen episodes of the sketch show "<a href="The%20World%20of%20Beachcomber">The World of Beachcomber</a>", based on the <a href="Beachcomber%20%28Pen%20name%29">Beachcomber</a> column in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" newspaper and broadcast on the BBC from January to April. Shortly after the series finished, she appeared alongside Frankie Howerd in his sketch show, "Howerd's Hour", on ITV. She continued her busy schedule with appearances in six films for 1969, including another with Sellers, "<a href="The%20Magic%20Christian%20%28film%29">The Magic Christian</a>". Here she portrayed a character named Ginger, who was described as a "grotesque figure", with an "insatiable lust for bestsellers on the atrocities of World War Two". She also appeared on television alongside Harry Secombe and <a href="Roy%20Castle">Roy Castle</a> in "<a href="Pickwick%20%28TV%20movie%29">Pickwick</a>", which was based on the musical <a href="Pickwick%20%28musical%29">of the same name</a>, and in "<a href="Carry%20On%20Christmas%20Specials%23Carry%20On%20Christmas">Carry On Christmas</a>", broadcast on Christmas Eve. Although 1969 had been busy, 1970 was relatively quiet in terms of her professional output: apart from an episode of "<a href="Catweazle">Catweazle</a>", she appeared alongside <a href="Willoughby%20Goddard">Willoughby Goddard</a> in a six-episode series of "Charley's Grants". She spent May and June filming "<a href="Carry%20On%20Loving">Carry On Loving</a>", in which she played Sophie Bliss, released in September that year. Another "Carry On" film followed in 1971, "<a href="Carry%20On%20at%20Your%20Convenience">Carry On at Your Convenience</a>", where she played Beattie Plummer, the housebound wife of Sid Plummer, played by Sid James. In the same year she completed another series with Sykes, "<a href="Sykes%20and%20a%20Big%2C%20Big%20Show">Sykes and a Big, Big Show</a>", a music and sketch programme which had six episodes, broadcast between February and April.

Two further "Carry On" films followed for Jacques in 1972: "Carry On Matron", for which she was engaged in the title role, and "<a href="Carry%20On%20Abroad">Carry On Abroad</a>", as Floella, the fiery Spanish cook at a half-finished hotel. As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey's last, it also marked a reduction in Jacques's screen time; she spent only one week filming her scenes. During post-production, the film's insurers became concerned about Jacques's deteriorating health. In a letter to the series producer Peter Rogers, they expressed their reluctance to insure her on set in any future film.

During the course of 1972 Jacques co-starred in the first series of "<a href="Sykes">Sykes</a>", in which she played Hattie Sykes, "the wide-eyed, less-knowing but remarkably patient sister-cum-mother-figure"; at its height, "Sykes" had 17 million viewers. In February 1972 Jacques was at home with her son Robin to watch Le Mesurier win the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> "Best Television Actor" award for his portrayal of a "boozy British aristocrat ... who became a spy for the Soviets" in <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a>'s television play "<a href="Traitor%20%28TV%20drama%29">Traitor</a>". Jacques cried when her ex-husband won the award, and divulged to her son that she "wasn't crying out of professional resentment or even envy about <a href="Joan%20Le%20Mesurier">Joan Le Mesurier</a> ... but from an unhappiness that, through her own actions, she lost John or there was now no-one with whom to spend her life".

In 1974 Jacques' sons were arrested for <a href="Drug%20possession">possession of cannabis</a>, and her house was searched by police. In the same week that the two boys appeared in court, she received official notification of the intention to appoint her as an <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a>. In order to protect her sons from further press intrusion she declined the honour. Later that year, while filming the third series of "Sykes", she suffered a cancer scare and lost a considerable amount of weight. Despite this she refused to interrupt the busy production schedule; when filming was completed on 5 December she underwent surgery at <a href="Charing%20Cross%20Hospital">Charing Cross Hospital</a> for what proved to be benign tumours on her kidneys.

In 1976 Jacques appeared in a promotional advertising film for <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>, which pitted her against racing driver <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a> in a race to London. From 1976 onwards Sykes and Jacques appeared together in the stage play "A Hatful of Sykes", both in the UK and internationally. During the course of the different tours relations between the two stars became increasingly strained and Sykes altered the act several times to ensure he received more acclaim than Jacques. While appearing in Blackpool in 1977 Jacques's health became problematic as she suffered from <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a> and ulcerated legs, which required daily dressing. Because a dressing room was arranged that avoided her needing to use stairs, Sykes accused her of receiving special treatment. When the show moved to Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Sykes "began to behave rather strangely ... and he even accused Hattie ... of not being able to deliver a proper feed line". By the time the show appeared in Brighton in 1979 the relationship between the two "was rapidly deteriorating", and, although the pair praised each other in public, Jacques felt hurt by Sykes's treatment of her. Despite the differences, the pair filmed the seventh series of "Sykes" in 1979, and—in April 1980—the television film "<a href="Rhubarb%20Rhubarb">Rhubarb Rhubarb</a>"; although her part was a small one, she looked "a little unsteady on her feet", according to Merriman.

In May 1980 Jacques's doctor advised her against travelling to Greece on holiday as planned, so she visited Ireland instead. During the return ferry crossing she told her friend Bruce Copp that "You know I'm not going to live long". Her health remained poor, and insurance companies refused to insure her for film work. By October her weight had risen again; she had problems breathing and was again admitted to Charing Cross Hospital. She took a weekend break from hospital and returned home to Eardley Crescent, where on 6 October she died from a heart attack at the age of 58; she was also suffering from kidney failure.

Jacques's funeral took place at <a href="Putney%20Vale%20Cemetery">Putney Vale Crematorium</a>, where her ashes were scattered. Her sons refused to allow Sykes entry to the funeral because they resented the way he had treated her during the stage show; Sykes was upset by the exclusion and failed to understand why he had been banned. The other notable absentee from the funeral was Joan Sims, who "stayed in her home and spent the day drinking, reading old letters from Hattie and wallowing in self pity", according to Merriman.

Kenneth Williams was deeply saddened by the loss of his friend, and wrote that "all the chums have died ... one is left marooned on the shore ... the tide is receding and leaving some incongruous wrecks exposed ... I fear I am one of them". John Le Mesurier described Jacques as "a remarkable lady ... [who] had an aura of love and kindness about her", while her obituary in "The Times" observed that "she will be remembered with affection by all who saw her". A month after the funeral, a memorial service was held at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">St Paul's, Covent Garden</a>, otherwise known as the Actors' Church, which was described by Le Mesurier as a "joyous occasion".

A memorial plaque to Jacques is situated in St Paul's, Covent Garden. In November 1995 a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> was unveiled by Eric Sykes and <a href="Clive%20Dunn">Clive Dunn</a>—a colleague from her Players' Theatre days—at her former house: 67 Eardley Crescent, <a href="Earls%20Court">Earls Court</a>, London. In 2002 plaques were unveiled for Jacques, Sid James and Tony Hancock at BBC <a href="Broadcasting%20House">Broadcasting House</a> in London.

In 2011 Jacques and Le Mesurier's marriage was the subject of a <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> biographical film called "<a href="Hattie%20%28film%29">Hattie</a>", which focused on Jacques's affair with John Schofield. She was played by <a href="Ruth%20Jones">Ruth Jones</a>, who Robin Le Mesurier thought "had captured my mother perfectly". Jones was thrilled at playing Jacques whom she considered to be her comedy heroine, describing her as an "incredibly talented and fascinating woman both on and off screen".

The writer Susan Leckey described Jacques as "one of the best-loved British comedy stars", while Jacques's obituarist in "The Times" observed that "she was invariably successful" at making people "laugh with, rather than at you". Peter Chapman of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" stated that Jacques was "blessed with remarkable grace, delicacy and warmth, giving her an almost unique comic appeal". "<a href="Sunday%20Life%20%28newspaper%29">Sunday Life</a>" said that for decades she was "Britain's favourite silly, sexually frustrated, fat woman". <a href="Nina%20Wadia">Nina Wadia</a> of "<a href="Goodness%20Gracious%20Me%20%28BBC%29">Goodness Gracious Me</a>" considers Jacques along with Joan Sims and <a href="Barbara%20Windsor">Barbara Windsor</a> to have "paved the way for younger comediennes in Britain today", remarking that "if it had not been for women like Hattie and Barbara, there is no way that younger actresses would have any role model, or probably the ambition to do what they do".

Jacques's biographer, Francis Gray, highlighted two aspects of the actress's abilities; in her appearances in the sequence of post-war Dickens adaptations ("Nicholas Nickleby", "Oliver Twist", "Scrooge" and "Pickwick") Jacques "reflected her talent for larger-than-life comedy which never lost its grip on humanity", while in other films, such as "Mother Riley Meets the Vampire", she displayed "a broader comic mode". In her later career Jacques showed "a comic talent of extraordinary versatility. In "Sykes" her performance had to be a foil for the main character; in the "Carry Ons" she blossomed". As a singer she was also praised; <a href="Jonathan%20Cecil">Jonathan Cecil</a> of "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" said that her "bell-tone voice with its cut-crystal diction—perfect for radio—had an edge of pain which suggested a greater depth to her talents than she was generally allowed to express". The actor Neville Phillips, who toured with Jacques, described her as having a "pretty voice" and able to "take an innocuous old Victorian or Edwardian ballad and with just a few intonations and expressions give it another meaning entirely".

Gray observes that "Jacques is enduringly associated with the role of hospital matron" and her portrayal of the character in five films had a lasting impact on both her legacy and on the role and view of <a href="Matron">Matron</a>s in the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">National Health Service</a>. An article in "The Guardian" by <a href="Mark%20Lawson">Mark Lawson</a> mixed fiction with reality when he wrote that "standards of hygiene have slipped since Hattie Jacques ran NHS wards". According to "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>", the 2003 <a href="Labour%20Party%20Conference">Labour Party Conference</a> "applauded deliriously because the government has revived Hattie Jacques", in relation to a change in government policy. After complaints about the NHS in 2008, the "<a href="Western%20Morning%20News">Western Morning News</a>" suggested the government should "clone a Hattie Jacques-type matron to run a tight ship everywhere". NHS nurses have complained about the stereotype: in August 2013 the "<a href="Nursing%20Times">Nursing Times</a>" quoted one matron, who protested that they were "not like Hattie Jacques anymore".

<a href="Galton%20and%20Simpson">Alan Simpson</a>, the co-writer of "Hancock", enjoyed writing for Jacques, and thought that she was "almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy; you didn't write for her thinking she's a woman so we've got to write the feminine point of view. That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a "complete revelation", adding "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great <a href="Beatrice%20Lillie">Beatrice Lillie</a> ... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend <a href="Bob%20Monkhouse">Bob Monkhouse</a> thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: "She was such a great comedienne ... everyone wanted her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the "Daily Express", noted that "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. <a href="Morwenna%20Banks">Morwenna Banks</a> and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" in "ITMA", while in "Sykes", her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".

Emily Dickinson

Emily Elizabeth Dickinson (December 10, 1830 – May 15, 1886) was an American poet. 

Dickinson was born in <a href="Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts">Amherst</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> into a prominent family with strong ties to its community. After studying at the <a href="Amherst%20College%23Amherst%20Academy">Amherst Academy</a> for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the <a href="Mount%20Holyoke%20College">Mount Holyoke Female Seminary</a> before returning to her family's house in Amherst.

Some argue that Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to even leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon correspondence.

While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were published during her lifetime. The work that was published during her lifetime was usually altered significantly by the publishers to fit the conventional poetic rules of the time. Her poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use <a href="Half%20rhyme">slant rhyme</a> as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.

Although Dickinson's acquaintances were most likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%20Higginson">Thomas Wentworth Higginson</a> and <a href="Mabel%20Loomis%20Todd">Mabel Loomis Todd</a>, though both heavily edited the content. A 1998 "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" article revealed that of the many edits made to Dickinson's work, the name "Susan" was often deliberately removed. At least 11 of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to sister-in-law <a href="Susan%20Huntington%20Gilbert%20Dickinson">Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson</a>, though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published "The Poems of Emily Dickinson" in 1955.

Emily Elizabeth Dickinson was born at the <a href="Emily%20Dickinson%20Museum">family's homestead</a> in <a href="Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts">Amherst, Massachusetts</a>, on December 10, 1830, into a prominent, but not wealthy, family. Her father, <a href="Edward%20Dickinson">Edward Dickinson</a> was a lawyer in Amherst and a trustee of Amherst College. Two hundred years earlier, her patrilineal ancestors had arrived in the New World—in the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28Puritan%29">Great Migration</a>—where they prospered. Emily Dickinson's paternal grandfather, Samuel Dickinson, was one of the founders of <a href="Amherst%20College">Amherst College</a>. In 1813, he built the Homestead, a large mansion on the town's Main Street, that became the focus of Dickinson family life for the better part of a century. Samuel Dickinson's eldest son, <a href="Edward%20Dickinson">Edward</a>, was treasurer of Amherst College for nearly forty years, served numerous terms as a State Legislator, and represented the Hampshire district in the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. On May 6, 1828, he married Emily Norcross from <a href="Monson%2C%20Massachusetts">Monson</a>. They had three children:

By all accounts, young Emily was a well-behaved girl. On an extended visit to Monson when she was two, Emily's Aunt Lavinia described Emily as "perfectly well & contented—She is a very good child & but little trouble." Emily's aunt also noted the girl's affinity for music and her particular talent for the piano, which she called "the "moosic"".

Dickinson attended primary school in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl". Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when I come home, how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests that her mother was regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she "always ran Home to Awe [Austin] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none."

On September 7, 1840, Dickinson and her sister Lavinia started together at Amherst Academy, a former boys' school that had opened to female students just two years earlier. At about the same time, her father purchased a house on North Pleasant Street. Emily's brother Austin later described this large new home as the "mansion" over which he and Emily presided as "lord and lady" while their parents were absent. The house overlooked Amherst's burial ground, described by one local minister as treeless and "forbidding".

Dickinson spent seven years at the Academy, taking classes in English and classical literature, <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, botany, geology, history, "mental philosophy," and <a href="arithmetic">arithmetic</a>. Daniel Taggart Fiske, the school's principal at the time, would later recall that Dickinson was "very bright" and "an excellent scholar, of exemplary deportment, faithful in all school duties". Although she had a few terms off due to illness—the longest of which was in 1845–1846, when she was enrolled for only eleven weeks—she enjoyed her strenuous studies, writing to a friend that the Academy was "a very fine school".

Dickinson was troubled from a young age by the "deepening menace" of death, especially the deaths of those who were close to her. When Sophia Holland, her second cousin and a close friend, grew ill from <a href="typhus">typhus</a> and died in April 1844, Emily was traumatized. Recalling the incident two years later, Emily wrote that "it seemed to me I should die too if I could not be permitted to watch over her or even look at her face." She became so melancholic that her parents sent her to stay with family in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> to recover. With her health and spirits restored, she soon returned to Amherst Academy to continue her studies. During this period, she first met people who were to become lifelong friends and correspondents, such as Abiah Root, Abby Wood, Jane Humphrey, and <a href="Susan%20Huntington%20Gilbert%20Dickinson">Susan Huntington Gilbert</a> (who later married Emily's brother Austin).

In 1845, a <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">religious revival</a> took place in Amherst, resulting in 46 confessions of faith among Dickinson's peers. Dickinson wrote to a friend the following year: "I never enjoyed such perfect peace and happiness as the short time in which I felt I had found my savior." She went on to say that it was her "greatest pleasure to commune alone with the great God & to feel that he would listen to my prayers." The experience did not last: Dickinson never made a formal declaration of faith and attended services regularly for only a few years. After her church-going ended, about 1852, she wrote a poem opening: "Some keep the Sabbath going to Church – / I keep it, staying at Home".

During the last year of her stay at the Academy, Emily became friendly with Leonard Humphrey, its popular new young principal. After finishing her final term at the Academy on August 10, 1847, Dickinson began attending <a href="Mary%20Lyon">Mary Lyon</a>'s <a href="Mount%20Holyoke%20College">Mount Holyoke Female Seminary</a> (which later became <a href="Mount%20Holyoke%20College">Mount Holyoke College</a>) in <a href="South%20Hadley%2C%20Massachusetts">South Hadley</a>, about ten miles (16 km) from Amherst. She was at the seminary for only ten months. Although she liked the girls at Holyoke, Dickinson made no lasting friendships there. The explanations for her brief stay at Holyoke differ considerably: either she was in poor health, her father wanted to have her at home, she rebelled against the evangelical fervor present at the school, she disliked the discipline-minded teachers, or she was simply homesick. Whatever the specific reason for leaving Holyoke, her brother Austin appeared on March 25, 1848, to "bring [her] home at all events". Back in Amherst, Dickinson occupied her time with household activities. She took up baking for the family and enjoyed attending local events and activities in the budding college town.

When she was eighteen, Dickinson's family befriended a young attorney by the name of Benjamin Franklin Newton. According to a letter written by Dickinson after Newton's death, he had been "with my Father two years, before going to Worcester – in pursuing his studies, and was much in our family." Although their relationship was probably not romantic, Newton was a formative influence and would become the second in a series of older men (after Humphrey) that Dickinson referred to, variously, as her tutor, preceptor or master.

Newton likely introduced her to the writings of <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>, and his gift to her of <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>'s first book of collected poems had a liberating effect. She wrote later that he, "whose name my Father's Law Student taught me, has touched the secret Spring". Newton held her in high regard, believing in and recognizing her as a poet. When he was dying of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, he wrote to her, saying that he would like to live until she achieved the greatness he foresaw. Biographers believe that Dickinson's statement of 1862—"When a little Girl, I had a friend, who taught me Immortality – but venturing too near, himself – he never returned"—refers to Newton.

Dickinson was familiar not only with the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> but also with contemporary popular literature. She was probably influenced by <a href="Lydia%20Maria%20Child">Lydia Maria Child</a>'s "Letters from New York", another gift from Newton (after reading it, she gushed "This then is a book! And there are more of them!"). Her brother smuggled a copy of <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>'s "<a href="Kavanagh%20%28novel%29">Kavanagh</a>" into the house for her (because her father might disapprove) and a friend lent her <a href="Charlotte%20Bront%C3%AB">Charlotte Brontë</a>'s "<a href="Jane%20Eyre">Jane Eyre</a>" in late 1849. "Jane Eyre"s influence cannot be measured, but when Dickinson acquired her first and only dog, a <a href="Newfoundland%20%28dog%29">Newfoundland</a>, she named him "Carlo" after the character St. John Rivers' dog. <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> was also a potent influence in her life. Referring to his plays, she wrote to one friend, "Why clasp any hand but this?" and to another, "Why is any other book needed?"

In early 1850, Dickinson wrote that "Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, a very great town this is!" Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died suddenly of "brain congestion" at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some of my friends are gone, and some of my friends are sleeping – sleeping the churchyard sleep – the hour of evening is sad – it was once my study hour – my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school "alone", make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.
During the 1850s, Emily's strongest and most affectionate relationship was with her sister-in-law, <a href="Susan%20Huntington%20Gilbert%20Dickinson">Susan Gilbert</a>. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, over the course of their relationship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of "most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser" whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed. In an 1882 letter to Susan, Emily said, "With the exception of Shakespeare, you have told me of more knowledge than any one living." 

The importance of Emily's relationship with Susan has widely been overlooked due to a point of view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin Dickinson's longtime mistress, who diminished Susan's role in Emily's life due to her own poor relationship with her lover's wife. However, the notion of a "cruel" Susan—as promoted by her romantic rival—has been questioned, most especially by Susan and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close. Many scholars interpret the relationship between Emily and Susan as a romantic one. In "<a href="The%20Emily%20Dickinson%20Journal">The Emily Dickinson Journal</a>" Lena Koski wrote, "Dickinson's letters to Gilbert express strong homoerotic feelings." She quotes from many of their letters, including one from 1852 in which Emily proclaims, "Susie, will you indeed come home next Saturday, and be my own again, and kiss me ... I hope for you so much, and feel so eager for you, feel that I cannot wait, feel that now I must have you—that the expectation once more to see your face again, makes me feel hot and feverish, and my heart beats so fast ... my darling, so near I seem to you, that I disdain this pen, and wait for a warmer language." The relationship between Emily and Susan is portrayed in the film "<a href="Wild%20Nights%20with%20Emily">Wild Nights with Emily</a>".

Sue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it <a href="Emily%20Dickinson%20Museum%23The%20Evergreens">the Evergreens</a>, a stand of which was located on the west side of the Homestead. 

Until 1855, Dickinson had not strayed far from Amherst. That spring, accompanied by her mother and sister, she took one of her longest and farthest trips away from home. First, they spent three weeks in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a>, where her father was representing <a href="Massachusetts%27s%2010th%20congressional%20district">Massachusetts</a> in <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>. Then they went to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> for two weeks to visit family. In Philadelphia, she met Charles Wadsworth, a famous minister of the Arch Street Presbyterian Church, with whom she forged a strong friendship which lasted until his death in 1882. Despite seeing him only twice after 1855 (he moved to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> in 1862), she variously referred to him as "my Philadelphia", "my Clergyman", "my dearest earthly friend" and "my Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood".

From the mid-1850s, Emily's mother became effectively bedridden with various chronic illnesses until her death in 1882. Writing to a friend in summer 1858, Emily said that she would visit if she could leave "home, or mother. I do not go out at all, lest father will come and miss me, or miss some little act, which I might forget, should I run away – Mother is much as usual. I Know not what to hope of her". As her mother continued to decline, Dickinson's domestic responsibilities weighed more heavily upon her and she confined herself within the Homestead. Forty years later, Lavinia stated that because their mother was chronically ill, one of the daughters had to remain always with her. Emily took this role as her own, and "finding the life with her books and nature so congenial, continued to live it".

Withdrawing more and more from the outside world, Emily began in the summer of 1858 what would be her lasting legacy. Reviewing poems she had written previously, she began making clean copies of her work, assembling carefully pieced-together manuscript books. The forty <a href="wikt%3Afascicle">fascicles</a> she created from 1858 through 1865 eventually held nearly eight hundred poems. No one was aware of the existence of these books until after her death.

In the late 1850s, the Dickinsons befriended <a href="Samuel%20Bowles%20%28journalist%29">Samuel Bowles</a>, the owner and editor-in-chief of the "<a href="Springfield%20Republican">Springfield Republican</a>", and his wife, Mary. They visited the Dickinsons regularly for years to come. During this time Emily sent him over three dozen letters and nearly fifty poems. Their friendship brought out some of her most intense writing and Bowles published a few of her poems in his journal. It was from 1858 to 1861 that Dickinson is believed to have written a trio of letters that have been called "The Master Letters". These three letters, drafted to an unknown man simply referred to as "Master", continue to be the subject of speculation and contention amongst scholars.

The first half of the 1860s, after she had largely withdrawn from social life, proved to be Dickinson's most productive writing period. Modern scholars and researchers are divided as to the cause for Dickinson's withdrawal and extreme seclusion. While she was diagnosed as having "nervous prostration" by a physician during her lifetime, some today believe she may have suffered from illnesses as various as <a href="agoraphobia">agoraphobia</a> and <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>.

In April 1862, <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%20Higginson">Thomas Wentworth Higginson</a>, a literary critic, radical <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a>, and ex-minister, wrote a lead piece for "<a href="The%20Atlantic%20Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a>" titled, "Letter to a Young Contributor". Higginson's essay, in which he urged aspiring writers to "charge your style with life", contained practical advice for those wishing to break into print. Dickinson's decision to contact Higginson suggests that by 1862 she was contemplating publication and that it may have become increasingly difficult to write poetry without an audience. Seeking literary guidance that no one close to her could provide, Dickinson sent him a letter, which read in full:

This highly nuanced and largely theatrical letter was unsigned, but she had included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope, along with four of her poems. He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her "not to read them – because he fears they joggle the Mind".

Dickinson valued his advice, going from calling him "Mr. Higginson" to "Dear friend" as well as signing her letters, "Your Gnome" and "Your Scholar". His interest in her work certainly provided great moral support; many years later, Dickinson told Higginson that he had saved her life in 1862. They corresponded until her death, but her difficulty in expressing her literary needs and a reluctance to enter into a cooperative exchange left Higginson nonplussed; he did not press her to publish in subsequent correspondence. Dickinson's own ambivalence on the matter militated against the likelihood of publication. Literary critic <a href="Edmund%20Wilson">Edmund Wilson</a>, in his review of Civil War literature, surmised that "with encouragement, she would certainly have published".

In direct opposition to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson may have been too overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, <a href="Margaret%20Maher">Margaret Maher</a>, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.
Around this time, Dickinson's behavior began to change. She did not leave the Homestead unless it was absolutely necessary and as early as 1867, she began to talk to visitors from the other side of a door rather than speaking to them face to face. She acquired local notoriety; she was rarely seen, and when she was, she was usually clothed in white. Dickinson's one surviving article of clothing is a white cotton dress, possibly sewn circa 1878–1882. Few of the locals who exchanged messages with Dickinson during her last fifteen years ever saw her in person. Austin and his family began to protect Emily's privacy, deciding that she was not to be a subject of discussion with outsiders. Despite her physical seclusion, however, Dickinson was socially active and expressive through what makes up two-thirds of her surviving notes and letters. When visitors came to either the Homestead or the Evergreens, she would often leave or send over small gifts of poems or flowers. Dickinson also had a good rapport with the children in her life. Mattie Dickinson, the second child of Austin and Sue, later said that "Aunt Emily stood for "indulgence."" MacGregor (Mac) Jenkins, the son of family friends who later wrote a short article in 1891 called "A Child's Recollection of Emily Dickinson", thought of her as always offering support to the neighborhood children.

When Higginson urged her to come to Boston in 1868 so that they could formally meet for the first time, she declined, writing: "Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town". It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as "a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair ... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqué & a blue net worsted shawl." He also felt that he never was "with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her."

Scholar Judith Farr notes that Dickinson, during her lifetime, "was known more widely as a gardener, perhaps, than as a poet". Dickinson studied botany from the age of nine and, along with her sister, tended the garden at Homestead. During her lifetime, she assembled a collection of pressed plants in a sixty-six page leather-bound <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a>. It contained 424 pressed flower specimens that she collected, classified, and labeled using the <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">Linnaean</a> system. The Homestead garden was well-known and admired locally in its time. It has not survived but efforts to revive it have begun. Dickinson kept no garden notebooks or plant lists, but a clear impression can be formed from the letters and recollections of friends and family. Her niece, Martha Dickinson Bianchi, remembered "carpets of <a href="Lily%20of%20the%20Valley">lily-of-the-valley</a> and <a href="Pansy">pansies</a>, platoons of <a href="Sweet%20pea">sweetpeas</a>, <a href="Hyacinth%20%28plant%29">hyacinths</a>, enough in May to give all the bees of summer dyspepsia. There were ribbons of <a href="peony">peony</a> hedges and drifts of <a href="Narcissus%20%28genus%29">daffodils</a> in season, <a href="Calendula">marigolds</a> to distraction—a butterfly utopia". In particular, Dickinson cultivated scented exotic flowers, writing that she "could inhabit the <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Spice Isles</a> merely by crossing the dining room to the conservatory, where the plants hang in baskets". Dickinson would often send her friends bunches of flowers with verses attached, but "they valued the posy more than the poetry".

On June 16, 1874, while in Boston, Edward Dickinson suffered a stroke and died. When the simple funeral was held in the Homestead's entrance hall, Emily stayed in her room with the door cracked open. Neither did she attend the memorial service on June 28. She wrote to Higginson that her father's "Heart was pure and terrible and I think no other like it exists." A year later, on June 15, 1875, Emily's mother also suffered a stroke, which produced a partial lateral <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a> and impaired memory. Lamenting her mother's increasing physical as well as mental demands, Emily wrote that "Home is so far from Home".
Otis Phillips Lord, an elderly judge on the <a href="Massachusetts%20Supreme%20Judicial%20Court">Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court</a> from <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem</a>, in 1872 or 1873 became an acquaintance of Dickinson's. After the death of Lord's wife in 1877, his friendship with Dickinson probably became a late-life romance, though as their letters were destroyed, this is surmised. Dickinson found a kindred soul in Lord, especially in terms of shared literary interests; the few letters which survived contain multiple quotations of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s work, including the plays "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>", "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" and "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>". In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's "Complete Concordance to Shakespeare" (1877). Dickinson wrote that "While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?" She referred to him as "My lovely Salem" and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that "Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day".

After being critically ill for several years, Judge Lord died in March 1884. Dickinson referred to him as "our latest Lost". Two years before this, on April 1, 1882, Dickinson's "Shepherd from 'Little Girl'hood", Charles Wadsworth, also had died after a long illness.

Although she continued to write in her last years, Dickinson stopped editing and organizing her poems. She also exacted a promise from her sister Lavinia to burn her papers. Lavinia, who never married, remained at the Homestead until her own death in 1899.
The 1880s were a difficult time for the remaining Dickinsons. Irreconcilably alienated from his wife, Austin fell in love in 1882 with <a href="Mabel%20Loomis%20Todd">Mabel Loomis Todd</a>, an Amherst College faculty wife who had recently moved to the area. Todd never met Dickinson but was intrigued by her, referring to her as "a lady whom the people call the "Myth"". Austin distanced himself from his family as his affair continued and his wife became sick with grief. Dickinson's mother died on November 14, 1882. Five weeks later, Dickinson wrote "We were never intimate ... while she was our Mother – but Mines in the same Ground meet by tunneling and when she became our Child, the Affection came." The next year, Austin and Sue's third and youngest child, Gilbert—Emily's favorite—died of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>.

As death succeeded death, Dickinson found her world upended. In the fall of 1884, she wrote that "The Dyings have been too deep for me, and before I could raise my Heart from one, another has come." That summer she had seen "a great darkness coming" and fainted while baking in the kitchen. She remained unconscious late into the night and weeks of ill health followed. On November 30, 1885, her feebleness and other symptoms were so worrying that Austin canceled a trip to Boston. She was confined to her bed for a few months, but managed to send a final burst of letters in the spring. What is thought to be her last letter was sent to her cousins, Louise and Frances Norcross, and simply read: "Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily". On May 15, 1886, after several days of worsening symptoms, Emily Dickinson died at the age of 55. Austin wrote in his diary that "the day was awful ... she ceased to breathe that terrible breathing just before the [afternoon] whistle sounded for six." Dickinson's chief physician gave the cause of death as <a href="Bright%27s%20disease">Bright's disease</a> and its duration as two and a half years. 

Lavinia and Austin asked Susan to wash Emily’s body upon her death. Susan also wrote Emily’s obituary for the Springfield Republican, ending it with four lines from one of Emily's poems: "Morns like these, we parted; Noons like these, she rose; Fluttering first, then firmer, To her fair repose." Lavinia was perfectly satisfied that Sue should arrange everything, knowing it would be done lovingly. Dickinson was buried, laid in a white coffin with <a href="Heliotropium%20arborescens">vanilla-scented heliotrope</a>, a <a href="Lady%27s%20Slipper">Lady's Slipper</a> <a href="Orchidaceae">orchid</a>, and a "knot of blue field <a href="Viola%20%28plant%29">violets</a>" placed about it. The funeral service, held in the Homestead's library, was simple and short; Higginson, who had met her only twice, read "No Coward Soul Is Mine", a poem by <a href="Emily%20Bront%C3%AB">Emily Brontë</a> that had been a favorite of Dickinson's. At Dickinson's request, her "coffin [was] not driven but carried through fields of buttercups" for burial in the family plot at <a href="Amherst%20West%20Cemetery">West Cemetery</a> on Triangle Street.

Despite Dickinson's prolific writing, fewer than a dozen of her poems were published during her lifetime. After her younger sister Lavinia discovered the collection of nearly 1800 poems, Dickinson's first volume was published four years after her death. Until Thomas H. Johnson published Dickinson's "Complete Poems" in 1955, Dickinson's poems were considerably edited and altered from their manuscript versions. Since 1890 Dickinson has remained continuously in print.

A few of Dickinson's poems appeared in <a href="Samuel%20Bowles%20%28journalist%29">Samuel Bowles'</a> "Springfield Republican" between 1858 and 1868. They were published anonymously and heavily edited, with conventionalized punctuation and formal titles. The first poem, "Nobody knows this little rose", may have been published without Dickinson's permission. The "Republican" also published "A narrow Fellow in the Grass" as "The Snake", "Safe in their Alabaster Chambers –" as "The Sleeping", and "Blazing in the Gold and quenching in Purple" as "Sunset". The poem "<a href="I%20taste%20a%20liquor%20never%20brewed">I taste a liquor never brewed</a> –" is an example of the edited versions; the last two lines in the first stanza were completely rewritten.

In 1864, several poems were altered and published in "Drum Beat", to raise funds for medical care for Union soldiers in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">war</a>. Another appeared in April 1864 in the "Brooklyn Daily Union".

In the 1870s, <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%20Higginson">Higginson</a> showed Dickinson's poems to <a href="Helen%20Hunt%20Jackson">Helen Hunt Jackson</a>, who had coincidentally been at the Academy with Dickinson when they were girls. Jackson was deeply involved in the publishing world, and managed to convince Dickinson to publish her poem "<a href="Success%20is%20Counted%20Sweetest">Success is counted sweetest</a>" anonymously in a volume called "<a href="A%20Masque%20of%20Poets">A Masque of Poets</a>". The poem, however, was altered to agree with contemporary taste. It was the last poem published during Dickinson's lifetime.

After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson kept her promise and burned most of the poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no instructions about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for more than half a century.
The first volume of Dickinson's "Poems," edited jointly by Mabel Loomis Todd and T. W. Higginson, appeared in November 1890. Although Todd claimed that only essential changes were made, the poems were extensively edited to match punctuation and capitalization to late 19th-century standards, with occasional rewordings to reduce Dickinson's obliquity. The first 115-poem volume was a critical and financial success, going through eleven printings in two years. "Poems: Second Series" followed in 1891, running to five editions by 1893; a third series appeared in 1896. One reviewer, in 1892, wrote: "The world will not rest satisfied till every scrap of her writings, letters as well as literature, has been published".

Nearly a dozen new editions of Dickinson's poetry, whether containing previously unpublished or newly edited poems, were published between 1914 and 1945. Martha Dickinson Bianchi, the daughter of Susan and Austin Dickinson, published collections of her aunt's poetry based on the manuscripts held by her family, whereas Mabel Loomis Todd's daughter, Millicent Todd Bingham, published collections based on the manuscripts held by her mother. These competing editions of Dickinson's poetry, often differing in order and structure, ensured that the poet's work was in the public's eye.

The first scholarly publication came in 1955 with a complete new three-volume set edited by Thomas H. Johnson. Forming the basis of later Dickinson scholarship, Johnson's <a href="variorum">variorum</a> brought all of Dickinson's known poems together for the first time. Johnson's goal was to present the poems very nearly as Dickinson had left them in her manuscripts. They were untitled, only numbered in an approximate chronological sequence, strewn with dashes and irregularly capitalized, and often extremely <a href="wikt%3Aelliptical">elliptical</a> in their language. Three years later, Johnson edited and published, along with Theodora Ward, a complete collection of Dickinson's letters, also presented in three volumes.

In 1981, "The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson" was published. Using the physical evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended to be published in their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.

Dickinson biographer Alfred Habegger wrote in "My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson" (2001) that "The consequences of the poet's failure to disseminate her work in a faithful and orderly manner are still very much with us".

Dickinson's poems generally fall into three distinct periods, the works in each period having certain general characters in common.

The extensive use of <a href="dash">dash</a>es and unconventional <a href="capitalization">capitalization</a> in Dickinson's manuscripts, and the <a href="idiosyncratic">idiosyncratic</a> vocabulary and imagery, combine to create a body of work that is "far more various in its styles and forms than is commonly supposed". Dickinson avoids pentameter, opting more generally for trimeter, tetrameter and, less often, dimeter. Sometimes her use of these meters is regular, but oftentimes it is irregular. The regular form that she most often employs is the <a href="ballad%20stanza">ballad stanza</a>, a traditional form that is divided into quatrains, using tetrameter for the first and third lines and trimeter for the second and fourth, while rhyming the second and fourth lines (ABCB). Though Dickinson often uses perfect rhymes for lines two and four, she also makes frequent use of <a href="half%20rhyme">slant rhyme</a>. In some of her poems, she varies the meter from the traditional ballad stanza by using trimeter for lines one, two and four, while only using tetrameter for line three.

Since many of her poems were written in traditional ballad stanzas with ABCB rhyme schemes, some of these poems can be sung to fit the melodies of popular folk songs and hymns that also use the <a href="common%20meter">common meter</a>, employing alternating lines of <a href="iambic%20tetrameter">iambic tetrameter</a> and <a href="iambic%20trimeter">iambic trimeter</a>. Familiar examples of such songs are "<a href="O%20Little%20Town%20of%20Bethlehem">O Little Town of Bethlehem</a>" and "<a href="Amazing%20Grace">Amazing Grace</a>'".

Dickinson scholar and poet <a href="Anthony%20Hecht">Anthony Hecht</a> finds resonances in Dickinson's poetry not only with hymns and song-forms but also with <a href="psalms">psalms</a> and <a href="riddle">riddle</a>s, citing the following example: "Who is the East? / The Yellow Man / Who may be Purple if he can / That carries the Sun. / Who is the West? / The Purple Man / Who may be Yellow if He can / That lets Him out again."

Late 20th-century scholars are "deeply interested" by Dickinson's highly individual use of punctuation and lineation (line lengths and line breaks). Following the publication of one of the few poems that appeared in her lifetime – "A narrow Fellow in the Grass", published as "The Snake" in the "Republican" – Dickinson complained that the edited punctuation (an added comma and a full stop substitution for the original dash) altered the meaning of the entire poem.

As Farr points out, "snakes instantly notice you"; Dickinson's version captures the "breathless immediacy" of the encounter; and "The Republican"s punctuation renders "her lines more commonplace". With the increasingly close focus on Dickinson's structures and syntax has come a growing appreciation that they are "aesthetically based". Although Johnson's landmark 1955 edition of poems was relatively unaltered from the original, later scholars critiqued it for deviating from the style and layout of Dickinson's manuscripts. Meaningful distinctions, these scholars assert, can be drawn from varying lengths and angles of dash, and differing arrangements of text on the page. Several volumes have attempted to render Dickinson's handwritten dashes using many typographic symbols of varying length and angle. R. W. Franklin's 1998 variorum edition of the poems provided alternate wordings to those chosen by Johnson, in a more limited editorial intervention. Franklin also used typeset dashes of varying length to approximate the manuscripts' dashes more closely.

Dickinson left no formal statement of her aesthetic intentions and, because of the variety of her themes, her work does not fit conveniently into any one genre. She has been regarded, alongside <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Emerson</a> (whose poems Dickinson admired), as a <a href="Transcendentalism">Transcendentalist</a>. However, Farr disagrees with this analysis, saying that Dickinson's "relentlessly measuring mind ... deflates the airy elevation of the Transcendental". Apart from the major themes discussed below, Dickinson's poetry frequently uses humor, puns, <a href="irony">irony</a> and <a href="satire">satire</a>.

Flowers and gardens: Farr notes that Dickinson's "poems and letters almost wholly concern flowers" and that allusions to gardens often refer to an "imaginative realm ... wherein flowers [are] often emblems for actions and emotions". She associates some flowers, like <a href="gentian">gentian</a>s and <a href="anemone">anemone</a>s, with youth and humility; others with prudence and insight. Her poems were often sent to friends with accompanying letters and <a href="nosegay">nosegay</a>s. Farr notes that one of Dickinson's earlier poems, written about 1859, appears to "conflate her poetry itself with the posies": "My nosegays are for Captives – / Dim – long expectant eyes – / Fingers denied the plucking, / Patient till Paradise – / To such, if they sh'd whisper / Of morning and the moor – / They bear no other errand, / And I, no other prayer".

The Master poems: Dickinson left a large number of poems addressed to "Signor", "Sir" and "Master", who is characterized as Dickinson's "lover for all eternity". These confessional poems are often "searing in their self-inquiry" and "harrowing to the reader" and typically take their metaphors from texts and paintings of Dickinson's day. The Dickinson family themselves believed these poems were addressed to actual individuals but this view is frequently rejected by scholars. Farr, for example, contends that the Master is an unattainable composite figure, "human, with specific characteristics, but godlike" and speculates that Master may be a "kind of Christian muse".

Morbidity: Dickinson's poems reflect her "early and lifelong fascination" with illness, dying and death. Perhaps surprisingly for a New England spinster, her poems allude to death by many methods: "crucifixion, drowning, hanging, suffocation, freezing, premature burial, shooting, stabbing and guillotinage". She reserved her sharpest insights into the "death blow aimed by God" and the "funeral in the brain", often reinforced by images of thirst and starvation. Dickinson scholar Vivian Pollak considers these references an autobiographical reflection of Dickinson's "thirsting-starving persona", an outward expression of her needy self-image as small, thin and frail. Dickinson's most psychologically complex poems explore the theme that the loss of hunger for life causes the death of self and place this at "the interface of murder and suicide".

Gospel poems: Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems reflecting a preoccupation with the teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him. She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with "wit and American colloquial language". Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the "salient feature uniting Christian poets ... is their reverential attention to the life of Jesus Christ" and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the "poetic tradition of Christian devotion" alongside <a href="Gerard%20Manley%20Hopkins">Hopkins</a>, <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">Eliot</a> and <a href="W.%20H.%20Auden">Auden</a>. In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: "The Savior must have been / A docile Gentleman – / To come so far so cold a Day / For little Fellowmen / The Road to Bethlehem / Since He and I were Boys / Was leveled, but for that twould be / A rugged billion Miles –".

The Undiscovered Continent: Academic Suzanne Juhasz considers that Dickinson saw the mind and spirit as tangible visitable places and that for much of her life she lived within them. Often, this intensely private place is referred to as the "undiscovered continent" and the "landscape of the spirit" and embellished with nature imagery. At other times, the imagery is darker and forbidding—castles or prisons, complete with corridors and rooms—to create a dwelling place of "oneself" where one resides with one's other selves. An example that brings together many of these ideas is: "Me from Myself – to banish – / Had I Art – / Impregnable my Fortress / Unto All Heart – / But since myself—assault Me – / How have I peace / Except by subjugating / Consciousness. / And since We're mutual Monarch / How this be / Except by Abdication – / Me – of Me?".

The surge of posthumous publication gave Dickinson's poetry its first public exposure. Backed by Higginson and with a favorable notice from <a href="William%20Dean%20Howells">William Dean Howells</a>, an editor of "<a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>", the poetry received mixed reviews after it was first published in 1890. Higginson himself stated in his preface to the first edition of Dickinson's published work that the poetry's quality "is that of extraordinary grasp and insight", albeit "without the proper control and chastening" that the experience of publishing during her lifetime might have conferred. His judgment that her opus was "incomplete and unsatisfactory" would be echoed in the essays of the <a href="New%20Criticism">New Critics</a> in the 1930s.

<a href="Maurice%20Thompson">Maurice Thompson</a>, who was literary editor of "The Independent" for twelve years, noted in 1891 that her poetry had "a strange mixture of rare individuality and originality". Some critics hailed Dickinson's effort, but disapproved of her unusual non-traditional style. <a href="Andrew%20Lang">Andrew Lang</a>, a British writer, dismissed Dickinson's work, stating that "if poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme. The wisdom of the ages and the nature of man insist on so much". <a href="Thomas%20Bailey%20Aldrich">Thomas Bailey Aldrich</a>, a poet and novelist, equally dismissed Dickinson's poetic technique in "<a href="The%20Atlantic%20Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a>" in January 1892: "It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and <a href="grotesque">grotesque</a> fancy. She was deeply tinged by the mysticism of <a href="William%20Blake">Blake</a>, and strongly influenced by the mannerism of <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Emerson</a> ... But the incoherence and formlessness of her — versicles are fatal ... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar".

Critical attention to Dickinson's poetry was meager from 1897 to the early 1920s. By the start of the 20th century, interest in her poetry became broader in scope and some critics began to consider Dickinson as essentially <a href="modernism">modern</a>. Rather than seeing Dickinson's poetic styling as a result of lack of knowledge or skill, modern critics believed the irregularities were consciously artistic. In a 1915 essay, <a href="Elizabeth%20Shepley%20Sergeant">Elizabeth Shepley Sergeant</a> called the poet's inspiration "daring" and named her "one of the rarest flowers the sterner New England land ever bore". With the growing popularity of <a href="Modernist%20poetry%20in%20English">modernist poetry</a> in the 1920s, Dickinson's failure to conform to 19th-century poetic form was no longer surprising nor distasteful to new generations of readers. Dickinson was suddenly referred to by various critics as a great woman poet, and a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a> began to form.

In the 1930s, a number of the New Critics – among them <a href="R.%20P.%20Blackmur">R. P. Blackmur</a>, <a href="Allen%20Tate">Allen Tate</a>, <a href="Cleanth%20Brooks">Cleanth Brooks</a> and <a href="Yvor%20Winters">Yvor Winters</a> – appraised the significance of Dickinson's poetry. As critic Roland Hagenbüchle pointed out, their "affirmative and prohibitive tenets turned out to be of special relevance to Dickinson scholarship". Blackmur, in an attempt to focus and clarify the major claims for and against the poet's greatness, wrote in a landmark 1937 critical essay: "... she was a private poet who wrote as indefatigably as some women cook or knit. Her gift for words and the cultural predicament of her time drove her to poetry instead of <a href="antimacassar">antimacassar</a>s ... She came... at the right time for one kind of poetry: the poetry of sophisticated, eccentric vision."

The <a href="Second-wave%20feminism">second wave</a> of <a href="feminism">feminism</a> created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language. Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as a woman and a poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book "This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson", "Perhaps as a poet [Dickinson] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman." Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet. <a href="Adrienne%20Rich">Adrienne Rich</a> theorized in "Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson" (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: "[she] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed. ... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time ... neither eccentric nor quaint; she was determined to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics."

Some scholars question the poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating about how this may have influenced her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and <a href="Martha%20Nell%20Smith">Martha Nell Smith</a> have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.

In the early 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the achievement of Emily Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens as well as the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as "Emily Dickinson Face to Face" and "Letters of Emily Dickinson", which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.

Emily Dickinson is now considered a powerful and persistent figure in American culture. Although much of the early reception concentrated on Dickinson's eccentric and secluded nature, she has become widely acknowledged as an innovative, proto-modernist poet. As early as 1891, William Dean Howells wrote that "If nothing else had come out of our life but this strange poetry, we should feel that in the work of Emily Dickinson, America, or New England rather, had made a distinctive addition to the literature of the world, and could not be left out of any record of it." Critic <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> has placed her alongside <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, <a href="Wallace%20Stevens">Wallace Stevens</a>, <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a>, <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, and <a href="Hart%20Crane">Hart Crane</a> as a major American poet, and listed her among the 26 central writers of Western civilization.

Dickinson is taught in <a href="American%20literature">American literature</a> and <a href="Poetry%20of%20the%20United%20States">poetry</a> classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and has been used as text for art songs by composers such as <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a>, <a href="Nick%20Peros">Nick Peros</a>, <a href="John%20Adams%20%28composer%29">John Adams</a> and <a href="Michael%20Tilson%20Thomas">Michael Tilson Thomas</a>. Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in <a href="Bozeman%2C%20Montana">Bozeman, Montana</a>,<a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond, Washington</a>, and New York City. A few literary journals—including "<a href="The%20Emily%20Dickinson%20Journal">The Emily Dickinson Journal</a>", the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society—have been founded to examine her work. An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson was issued by the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> on August 28, 1971 as the second stamp in the "American Poet" series. Dickinson was inducted into the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a> in 1973. A one-woman play titled "<a href="The%20Belle%20of%20Amherst">The Belle of Amherst</a>" appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.

Dickinson's <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a>, which is now held in the <a href="Houghton%20Library">Houghton Library</a> at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, was published in 2006 as "Emily Dickinson's Herbarium" by <a href="Harvard%20University%20Press">Harvard University Press</a>. The original work was compiled by Dickinson during her years at Amherst Academy, and consists of 424 pressed specimens of plants arranged on 66 pages of a bound album. A digital facsimile of the herbarium is available online. The town of Amherst <a href="Jones%20Library">Jones Library</a>'s Special Collections department has an Emily Dickinson Collection consisting of approximately seven thousand items, including original manuscript poems and letters, family correspondence, scholarly articles and books, newspaper clippings, theses, plays, photographs and contemporary artwork and prints. The Archives and Special Collections at <a href="Amherst%20College">Amherst College</a> has substantial holdings of Dickinson's manuscripts and letters as well as a lock of Dickinson's hair and the original of the only positively identified image of the poet. In 1965, in recognition of Dickinson's growing stature as a poet, the Homestead was purchased by Amherst College. It opened to the public for tours, and also served as a faculty residence for many years. The <a href="Emily%20Dickinson%20Museum">Emily Dickinson Museum</a> was created in 2003 when ownership of the Evergreens, which had been occupied by Dickinson family heirs until 1988, was transferred to the college.

Emily Dickinson's life and works have been the source of inspiration to artists, particularly to <a href="feminist">feminist</a>-oriented artists, of a variety of mediums. A few notable examples are as follows:

A public garden is named in her honor in Paris: , in the <a href="20th%20arrondissement">20th arrondissement</a> of the French capital.

Emily Dickinson's poetry has been translated into languages including <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="Spanish%20dialects%20and%20varieties">Spanish</a>, <a href="Farsi">Farsi</a>, <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish</a>, <a href="Georgian%20language">Georgian</a> and <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>.

Affleck is the co-founder of the <a href="Eastern%20Congo%20Initiative">Eastern Congo Initiative</a>, a <a href="Grant%20%28money%29">grantmaking</a> and advocacy-based nonprofit organization. He is also a stalwart member of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. Affleck and Damon are co-owners of the production company <a href="Pearl%20Street%20Films">Pearl Street Films</a>. His younger brother is actor <a href="Casey%20Affleck">Casey Affleck</a>, with whom he has worked on several films, including "Good Will Hunting" and "Gone Baby Gone".

Benjamin Géza Affleck-Boldt was born on August 15, 1972, in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>. His family moved to Massachusetts when he was three, living in <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Falmouth</a>, where his brother <a href="Casey%20Affleck">Casey</a> was born, before settling in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>. His mother, Christopher Anne "Chris" (née Boldt), was a <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>-educated elementary school teacher. His father, Timothy Byers "Tim" Affleck, was an aspiring playwright who made a living as a carpenter, auto mechanic, <a href="bookmaker">bookie</a>, electrician, bartender, and janitor at Harvard. In the mid-1960s, he had been an actor and stage manager with the <a href="Theater%20Company%20of%20Boston">Theater Company of Boston</a>. During Affleck's childhood, his father had a self-described "severe, chronic problem with alcoholism", and Affleck has recalled him drinking "all day ... every day". He and his younger brother attended <a href="Al-Anon/Alateen">Al-Anon</a> support meetings from a young age. His parents divorced when he was 12, and he and Casey lived with their mother. His father continued to drink, and spent two years homeless. When Affleck was 16, his father moved to <a href="Indio%2C%20California">Indio, California</a>, to enter a rehabilitation facility and, after gaining sobriety, he lived at the facility for many years while working as an addiction counselor.

Affleck was raised in a politically active, liberal household. He and his brother were surrounded by people who worked in the arts, regularly attended theater performances with their mother, and were encouraged to make their own home movies. The brothers auditioned for roles in local commercials and film productions because of their mother's friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, and Affleck first acted professionally at the age of seven. His mother saved his wages in a college trust fund, and hoped her son would ultimately become a teacher, worrying that acting was an insecure and "frivolous" profession. <a href="David%20Wheeler%20%28stage%20director%29">David Wheeler</a>, a family friend, was Affleck's acting coach and later described him as a "very bright and intensely curious" child. When Affleck was 13, he filmed a children's television program in Mexico and learned to speak Spanish during a year spent traveling around the country with his mother and brother.

As a <a href="Cambridge%20Rindge%20and%20Latin%20School">Cambridge Rindge and Latin</a> high school student, Affleck acted in theater productions and was inspired by drama teacher Gerry Speca. During this time he became close friends with <a href="Matt%20Damon">Matt Damon</a>, whom he had known since the age of eight. Although Damon was two years older, the two had "identical interests", and traveled to New York together for acting auditions. They saved their acting earnings in a joint bank account to buy train and airline tickets. While Affleck had high <a href="SAT">SAT</a> scores, he was an unfocused student with poor attendance. He spent a few months studying Spanish at the <a href="University%20of%20Vermont">University of Vermont</a>, chosen because of its proximity to his then-girlfriend, but left after fracturing his hip while playing basketball. At 18, Affleck moved to Los Angeles, studying Middle Eastern affairs at <a href="Occidental%20College">Occidental College</a> for a year and a half.

Affleck acted professionally throughout his childhood but, in his own words, "not in the sense that I had a mom that wanted to take me to Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ... I kind of chanced into something." He first appeared, at the age of seven, in a local independent film called "Dark Side of the Street" (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the <a href="PBS">PBS</a> children's series "<a href="The%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Mimi">The Voyage of the Mimi</a>" (1984) and "<a href="The%20Second%20Voyage%20of%20the%20Mimi">The Second Voyage of the Mimi</a>" (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked "sporadically" on "Mimi" from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> <a href="after%20school%20special">after school special</a> "Wanted: A Perfect Man" (1986), the television film "Hands of a Stranger" (1987), and a 1989 <a href="Burger%20King">Burger King</a> commercial.

After high school, Affleck moved briefly to New York in search of acting work. Later, while studying at Occidental College in Los Angeles, Affleck directed <a href="I%20Killed%20My%20Lesbian%20Wife%2C%20Hung%20Her%20on%20a%20Meat%20Hook%2C%20and%20Now%20I%20Have%20a%20Three-Picture%20Deal%20at%20Disney">student films</a>. As an actor, he had a series of "knock-around parts, one to the next". He played <a href="Patrick%20Duffy">Patrick Duffy</a>'s son in the television film "<a href="Daddy%20%281991%20film%29">Daddy</a>" (1991), made an uncredited appearance as a basketball player in the "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28film%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>" film (1992), and had a supporting role as a prep school student in "<a href="School%20Ties">School Ties</a>" (1992). He played a high school quarterback in the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> television series "<a href="Against%20the%20Grain%20%28TV%20series%29">Against the Grain</a>" (1993), and a steroid-abusing high school football player in "" (1994). Affleck's most notable role during this period was as a high school bully in <a href="Richard%20Linklater">Richard Linklater</a>'s cult classic "<a href="Dazed%20and%20Confused%20%28film%29">Dazed and Confused</a>" (1993). Linklater wanted a likeable actor for the villainous role and, while Affleck was "big and imposing," he was "so smart and full of life ... I just liked him." Affleck later said Linklater was instrumental in demystifying the filmmaking process for him.

Affleck's first starring film role was as an aimless art student in the college drama "<a href="Glory%20Daze%20%28film%29">Glory Daze</a>" (1995), with Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" remarking that his "affably mopey performance finds just the right balance between obnoxious and sad sack". He then played a bully in filmmaker <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a>'s comedy "<a href="Mallrats">Mallrats</a>" (1995), and became friends with Smith during the filming. Affleck began to worry that he would be relegated to a career of "throwing people into their lockers", but Smith put him in the lead role in Smith's romantic comedy "<a href="Chasing%20Amy">Chasing Amy</a>" (1997). The film was Affleck's breakthrough. <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "The New York Times" praised Affleck's "wonderful ease" playing the role, combining "suave good looks with cool comic timing". Owen Gleiberman of "Entertainment Weekly" described it as a "wholesome and quick-witted" performance. When Affleck starred as a recently returned Korean War veteran in the coming-of-age drama "<a href="Going%20All%20the%20Way">Going All the Way</a>" (1997), Todd McCarthy of "Variety" found him "excellent", while Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" noted that his "flair for comic self-doubt made a strong impression."
The success of 1997's "<a href="Good%20Will%20Hunting">Good Will Hunting</a>", which Affleck co-wrote and acted in, marked a turning point in his career. The screenplay originated in 1992 when Damon wrote a 40-page script for a playwriting class at Harvard University. He asked Affleck to act out the scenes with him in front of the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script in earnest. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to <a href="Castle%20Rock%20Entertainment">Castle Rock</a> in 1994 when Affleck was 22 years old. During the development process, they received notes from industry figures including <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a> and <a href="William%20Goldman">William Goldman</a>. Following a lengthy dispute with Castle Rock about a suitable director, Affleck and Damon persuaded <a href="Miramax">Miramax</a> to purchase the screenplay. The two friends moved back to Boston for a year before the film finally went into production, directed by <a href="Gus%20Van%20Sant">Gus Van Sant</a>, and co-starring Damon, Affleck, <a href="Minnie%20Driver">Minnie Driver</a>, and <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a>. On its release, Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" praised the "smart and touching screenplay", while Emanuel Levy of "Variety" found it "funny, nonchalant, moving and angry". Jay Carr of "The Boston Globe" wrote that Affleck brought "a beautifully nuanced tenderness" to his role as the working-class friend of Damon's mathematical prodigy character. Affleck and Damon eventually won both the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay">Golden Globe</a> and the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Writing%20Original%20Screenplay">Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay</a>. Affleck has described this period of his life as "dreamlike": "It was like one of those scenes in an old movie when a newspaper comes spinning out of the black on to the screen. You know, '$100 Million Box Office! Awards!' " He remains the youngest writer (at age 25) to ever win an Oscar for screenwriting.

"<a href="Armageddon%20%281998%20film%29">Armageddon</a>", released in 1998, established Affleck as a viable leading man for Hollywood studio films. "Good Will Hunting" had not yet been released during the casting process and, after Affleck's <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>, director <a href="Michael%20Bay">Michael Bay</a> dismissed him as "a geek". He was convinced by producer <a href="Jerry%20Bruckheimer">Jerry Bruckheimer</a> that Affleck would be a star, but the actor was required to lose weight, become tanned, and get his teeth capped before filming began. The film, where he starred opposite <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a> as a blue-collar driller tasked by <a href="NASA">NASA</a> with stopping an asteroid from colliding with Earth, was a box office success. Daphne Merkin of "The New Yorker" remarked: "Affleck demonstrates a sexy <a href="Paul%20Newman">Paul Newman</a>ish charm and is clearly bound for stardom." Later in 1998, Affleck had a supporting role as an arrogant English actor in the period romantic comedy "<a href="Shakespeare%20in%20Love">Shakespeare in Love</a>", starring his then-girlfriend <a href="Gwyneth%20Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>. Lael Loewenstein of "Variety" remarked that Affleck "does some of his very best work, suggesting that comedy may be his true calling," while Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" found him "very funny". "Shakespeare in Love" won seven <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, including <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, while the cast won the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Cast%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture">Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast</a>. Affleck then appeared as a small-town sheriff in the supernatural horror film "<a href="Phantoms%20%28film%29">Phantoms</a>". Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" wondered why actors like Affleck and <a href="Peter%20O%27Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> had agreed to appear in the "junky" film: "Affleck's thudding performance suggests he is reading his dialogue for the first time, directly from cue cards."

Affleck and Damon had an on-screen reunion in Kevin Smith's religious satire "<a href="Dogma%20%28film%29">Dogma</a>" (after having appeared in Smith's previous films, "Mallrats" and "Chasing Amy"), which premiered at the <a href="1999%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">1999 Cannes Film Festival</a>. Janet Maslin of "The New York Times" remarked that the pair, playing fallen angels, "bring great, understandable enthusiasm to Mr. Smith's smart talk and wild imaginings". Affleck starred opposite <a href="Sandra%20Bullock">Sandra Bullock</a> in the romantic comedy "<a href="Forces%20of%20Nature%20%281999%20film%29">Forces of Nature</a>" (1999), playing a groom whose attempts to get to his wedding are complicated by his free-spirited traveling companion. <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> of "Entertainment Weekly" remarked that Affleck "has the fast-break charm you want in a screwball hero," while <a href="Joe%20Leydon">Joe Leydon</a> of "Variety" praised "his winning ability to play against his good looks in a self-effacing comic turn". Affleck then appeared opposite <a href="Courtney%20Love">Courtney Love</a> in the little-seen ensemble comedy "<a href="200%20Cigarettes">200 Cigarettes</a>" (1999).

Interested in a directorial career, Affleck shadowed <a href="John%20Frankenheimer">John Frankenheimer</a> throughout pre-production of the action thriller "<a href="Reindeer%20Games">Reindeer Games</a>" (2000). Frankenheimer, directing his last feature film, described Affleck as having "a very winning, likable quality about him. I've been doing this for a long time and he's really one of the nicest." He starred opposite <a href="Charlize%20Theron">Charlize Theron</a> as a hardened criminal, with Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" enjoying the unexpected casting choice: "Affleck often suggests one of the <a href="Kennedy%20family">Kennedys</a> playing <a href="Clark%20Kent">Clark Kent</a> ... He looks as if he has never missed a party or a night's sleep. He's game, though, and his slight dislocation works to the advantage of "Reindeer Games"." He then had a supporting role as a ruthless stockbroker in the crime drama "<a href="Boiler%20Room%20%28film%29">Boiler Room</a>" (2000). A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" felt Affleck had "traced over" <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>'s performance in "<a href="Glengarry%20Glen%20Ross">Glengarry Glen Ross</a>", while Peter Rainer of "New York Magazine" said he "does a series of riffs on Baldwin's aria, and each one is funnier and crueler than the next". He then provided the voice of Joseph in the animated "". In his last film role of 2000, Affleck starred opposite his girlfriend Paltrow in the romantic drama "<a href="Bounce%20%28film%29">Bounce</a>". Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" praised the "understated intensity and exquisite detail" of his performance: "His portrait of a young, sarcastically self-defined 'people person' who isn't half as confident as he would like to appear is close to definitive."

Affleck reunited with director Michael Bay for the critically derided war drama "<a href="Pearl%20Harbor%20%28film%29">Pearl Harbor</a>" (2001). He later characterized it as a film he did "for money – for the wrong reasons". A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" felt Affleck and <a href="Kate%20Beckinsale">Kate Beckinsale</a> "do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars". But Todd McCarthy of "Variety" said, "the blandly handsome Affleck couldn't convince that he'd ever so much as been turned down for a date, much less lost the love of his life to his best friend". Affleck then parodied "Good Will Hunting" with Damon and Van Sant in Kevin Smith's "<a href="Jay%20and%20Silent%20Bob%20Strike%20Back">Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</a>" (2001), made a cameo in the comedy "<a href="Daddy%20and%20Them">Daddy and Them</a>" (2001), and had a supporting role in the little-seen "<a href="The%20Third%20Wheel%20%28film%29">The Third Wheel</a>" (2002). He portrayed the <a href="CIA">CIA</a> analyst <a href="Jack%20Ryan%20%28Tom%20Clancy%29">Jack Ryan</a> in the thriller "<a href="The%20Sum%20of%20All%20Fears%20%28film%29">The Sum of All Fears</a>" (2002). Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" felt he was miscast in a role previously played by both <a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a> and Alec Baldwin: "Although Mr. Affleck can be appealing when playing earnest young men groping toward maturity, he simply lacks the gravitas for the role." Affleck had an "amazing experience" making the thriller "<a href="Changing%20Lanes">Changing Lanes</a>" (2002), and later cited <a href="Roger%20Michell">Roger Michell</a> as someone he learned from as a director. Robert Koehler of "Variety" described it as one of the actor's "most thoroughly wrought" performances: "The journey into a moral fog compels him to play more inwardly and thoughtfully than he ever has before."

Affleck became more involved with television and film production in the early 2000s. He and Damon had set up <a href="Pearl%20Street%20Films">Pearl Street Films</a> in 1998, named after the street that ran between their childhood homes. Their next production company <a href="LivePlanet">LivePlanet</a>, co-founded in 2000 with <a href="Sean%20Bailey">Sean Bailey</a> and <a href="Chris%20Moore%20%28film%20producer%29">Chris Moore</a>, sought to integrate the Internet into mainstream television and film production. LivePlanet's biggest success was the documentary series "<a href="Project%20Greenlight">Project Greenlight</a>", aired on <a href="HBO">HBO</a> and later <a href="Bravo%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">Bravo</a>, which focused on first-time filmmakers being given the chance to direct a feature film. "Project Greenlight" was nominated for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Reality%20Program">Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program</a> in 2002, 2004 and 2005. "<a href="Push%2C%20Nevada">Push, Nevada</a>" (2002), created, written and produced by Affleck and Bailey, was an <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> mystery drama series that placed a viewer-participation game within the frame of the show. <a href="Caryn%20James">Caryn James</a> of "The New York Times" praised the show's "nerve, imagination and clever writing", but Robert Bianco of "USA Today" described it as a "knock-off" of "<a href="Twin%20Peaks">Twin Peaks</a>". The show was cancelled by ABC after seven episodes due to low ratings. Over time, LivePlanet's focus shifted from multimedia projects to more traditional film production. Affleck and his partners signed a film production deal with <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> in 2002; it expired in 2007.

While Affleck had been a tabloid figure for much of his career, and was named Sexiest Man Alive by "People Magazine" in 2002, he was the subject of increased media attention in 2003 because of his relationship with Jennifer Lopez. By the end of the year, Affleck had become, in the words of "GQ", the "world's most over-exposed actor". His newfound tabloid notoriety coincided with a series of poorly received films.

The first of these was "<a href="Daredevil%20%28film%29">Daredevil</a>" (2003), in which Affleck starred as the <a href="Daredevil%20%28Marvel%20Comics%20character%29">blind superhero</a>. Affleck was a longtime comic book fan, and had written a foreword for Kevin Smith's "<a href="Guardian%20Devil">Guardian Devil</a>" (1999) about his love for the character of Daredevil. The film was a commercial success, but received a mixed response from critics. Elvis Mitchell of "The New York Times" said Affleck was "lost" in the role: "A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role ... [Only his scenes with <a href="Jon%20Favreau">Jon Favreau</a> have] a playful side that allows Mr. Affleck to show his generosity as an actor." In 2014, Affleck described "Daredevil" as the only film he regretted making. He next appeared as a low-ranking mobster in the romantic comedy "<a href="Gigli%20%28film%29">Gigli</a>" (2003), co-starring Lopez. The film was almost uniformly panned, with Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" remarking that "Affleck doesn't have the chops or the charm to maneuver around (or past) bad material." Yet Affleck has repeatedly defended director <a href="Marty%20Brest">Marty Brest</a> since the film's release, describing him as "one of the really great directors". In his last film role of 2003, Affleck starred as a <a href="Reverse%20engineering">reverse engineer</a> in the sci-fi thriller "<a href="Paycheck%20%28film%29">Paycheck</a>" (2003). Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" remarked on Affleck's "self-deprecating charm" and wondered why he could not find better scripts. Manohla Dargis of the "Los Angeles Times" found it "almost unfair" to critique Affleck, given that he "had such a rough year".

Affleck's poor critical notices continued in 2004 when he starred as a bereaved husband in the romantic comedy "<a href="Jersey%20Girl%20%282004%20film%29">Jersey Girl</a>", directed by longtime collaborator Smith. Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" described Affleck as an actor "whose talent has curdled as his tabloid notoriety has spread," while Joe Leydon of "Variety" found his onscreen role as a father "affecting". Later that year, he starred opposite <a href="James%20Gandolfini">James Gandolfini</a> in the holiday comedy "<a href="Surviving%20Christmas">Surviving Christmas</a>". Holden noted in "The New York Times" that the film "found a clever way to use Ben Affleck's disagreeable qualities. The actor's shark-like grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character." At this point, the quality of scripts offered to Affleck "was just getting worse and worse" and he decided to take a career break. The "Los Angeles Times" published a piece on the downfall of Affleck's career in late 2004. The article noted that, unlike film critics and tabloid journalists, "few industry professionals seem to be gloating over Affleck's travails".

After marrying actress Jennifer Garner in 2005, and welcoming their first child, Affleck began a career comeback in 2006. Following a starring role in the little-seen "<a href="Man%20About%20Town%20%282006%20film%29">Man About Town</a>" and a minor role in the crime drama "<a href="Smokin%27%20Aces">Smokin' Aces</a>", Affleck won acclaim for his performance as <a href="George%20Reeves">George Reeves</a> in the noir biopic "<a href="Hollywoodland">Hollywoodland</a>". <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" praised "an award-caliber performance ... This is feeling, nuanced work from an actor some of us had prematurely written off." Geoffrey Macnab of "The Guardian" said he "beautifully" captured "the character's curious mix of charm, vulnerability and fatalism". He was awarded the <a href="Volpi%20Cup">Volpi Cup</a> at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> and was nominated for a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor</a>. Also in 2006, he made a cameo in Smith's "<a href="Clerks%20II">Clerks II</a>". Although they remain fans of each other's work, Affleck and Smith have had little contact since the making of "Clerks II".

In 2007, Affleck made his feature film directorial debut with "<a href="Gone%20Baby%20Gone">Gone Baby Gone</a>", a crime drama set in a working-class Boston neighborhood, starring his brother Casey. Affleck co‑wrote the screenplay, based on the <a href="Gone%2C%20Baby%2C%20Gone%20%28novel%29">book</a> by <a href="Dennis%20Lehane">Dennis Lehane</a>, with childhood friend Aaron Stockard, having first mentioned his intention to adapt the story in 2003. It opened to enthusiastic reviews. Manohla Dargis of "The New York Times" praised the film's "sensitivity to real struggle", while Stephen Farber of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" described it as "thoughtful, deeply poignant, [and] splendidly executed".

While Affleck intended to "keep a primary emphasis on directing" going forward in his career, he acted in three films in 2009. In the ensemble romantic comedy "<a href="He%27s%20Just%20Not%20That%20Into%20You%20%28film%29">He's Just Not That Into You</a>", the chemistry between Affleck and <a href="Jennifer%20Aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> was praised. Affleck played a congressman in the political thriller "<a href="State%20of%20Play%20%28film%29">State of Play</a>". Wesley Morris of "The Boston Globe" found him "very good in the film's silliest role," but David Edelstein of "New York Magazine" remarked of Affleck: "He might be smart and thoughtful in life [but] as an actor his wheels turn too slowly." He had a supporting role as a bartender in the little-seen comedy film "<a href="Extract%20%28film%29">Extract</a>". Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" described his performance as "a goofball delight", while Manhola Dargis of "The New York Times" declared it "a real performance". In 2010, Affleck starred in "<a href="The%20Company%20Men">The Company Men</a>" as a mid-level sales executive who is made redundant during the <a href="financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%932008">financial crisis of 2007–2008</a>. David Denby of "The New Yorker" declared that Affleck "gives his best performance yet", while Richard Corliss of "Time" found he "nails Bobby's plunge from hubris to humiliation".

Following the modest commercial success of "Gone Baby Gone", <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> developed a close working relationship with Affleck and offered him his choice of the studio's scripts. He decided to direct the crime drama "<a href="The%20Town%20%282010%20film%29">The Town</a>" (2010), an adaptation of <a href="Chuck%20Hogan">Chuck Hogan</a>'s novel "Prince of Thieves". He also co-wrote the screenplay and starred in the film as a bank robber. The film became a surprise box office hit, and gained further critical acclaim for Affleck. A.O. Scott of "The New York Times" praised his "skill and self-confidence as a serious director," while Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" noted: "Affleck has the stuff of a real director. Everything is here. It's an effective thriller, he works closely with actors, he has a feel for pacing." Also in 2010, Affleck and Damon's production company, Pearl Street Films, signed a <a href="first%20look%20deal">first-look producing deal</a> at Warner Bros.

Affleck soon began work on his next directorial project, "<a href="Argo%20%282012%20film%29">Argo</a>" (2012), for Warner Bros. Written by <a href="Chris%20Terrio">Chris Terrio</a> and starring Affleck as a CIA operative, the film tells the story of the CIA plan to save six U.S. diplomats during the 1979 <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">Iran hostage crisis</a> by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film. Anthony Lane of "The New Yorker" said the film offered "further proof that we were wrong about Ben Affleck". Peter Travers of "Rolling Stone" remarked: "Affleck takes the next step in what looks like a major directing career ... He directs the hell out of it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense." A major critical and commercial success, "Argo" won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Golden Globe Award</a>, and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Picture. The cast won the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Cast%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture">Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast</a>. Affleck himself won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Golden Globe Award</a>, <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Directing%20%E2%80%93%20Feature%20Film">Directors Guild of America Award</a>, and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Direction">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Director, becoming the first director to win these awards without a nomination for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a>.

The following year Affleck played a romantic lead in <a href="Terrence%20Malick">Terrence Malick</a>'s experimental drama "<a href="To%20the%20Wonder">To the Wonder</a>". Malick, a close friend of Affleck's godfather, had first met with the actor in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of "Good Will Hunting". Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" enjoyed "a performance of dignity and sensitivity," while "The New Yorker" 's Richard Brody described Affleck as "a solid and muscular performer" who "conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality". Affleck's performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly-reviewed thriller "<a href="Runner%20Runner%20%28film%29">Runner Runner</a>" (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the "Los Angeles Times" remarked that it was "one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a> concerto – every note perfectly played." Also in 2013, Affleck hosted the sketch comedy show "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" for the fifth time since 2000, becoming a member of the <a href="List%20of%20Saturday%20Night%20Live%20guests%23Five-Timers%20Club">Five Timers Club</a>. He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star as a husband accused of murder in <a href="David%20Fincher">David Fincher</a>'s psychological thriller "<a href="Gone%20Girl%20%28film%29">Gone Girl</a>" (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood what it felt like to be misrepresented by tabloid media: "What many people don't know is that he's crazy smart, but since he doesn't want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm." David Edelstein of "New York Magazine" noted that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a "remarkable" effect on Affleck's acting: "I never thought I'd write these words, but he carries the movie. He's terrific." Justin Chang of "Variety" found Affleck "perfectly cast": "It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely." In 2015, Affleck and Damon's "Project Greenlight" was resurrected by HBO for one season.

Given Affleck's growing reputation as a filmmaker, his decision to star as <a href="Batman">Batman</a> in the 2016 superhero film "" was regarded by Anthony Lane of "The New Yorker" as a "backward step into the realm of beefcake", and by Dave Itzkoff of "The New York Times" as "a somewhat bewildering choice". Although the casting choice was met with intense fan backlash, Affleck's performance ultimately earned a positive reception. Andrew Barker of "Variety" found him "a winningly cranky, charismatic presence," while Brian Truitt of "USA Today" enjoyed his "strong" and "surprisingly emotional" take on the character. Affleck reprised his role as Batman twice, making a cameo appearance in "<a href="Suicide%20Squad%20%28film%29">Suicide Squad</a>" (2016) and starring in "<a href="Justice%20League%20%28film%29">Justice League</a>" (2017). "Justice League" drew mixed opinions from critics; Todd McCarthy of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote that Affleck "looks like he'd rather be almost anywhere else but here." 

In addition to his various Batman commitments, Affleck appeared in two other films in 2016. He starred as an autistic accountant in the action thriller "<a href="The%20Accountant%20%282016%20film%29">The Accountant</a>" (2016), which was an unexpected commercial success. Peter Debruge of "Variety" felt Affleck's "boy-next-door" demeanor – "so normal and non-actorly that most of his performances feel like watching one of your buddies up on screen" – was "a terrific fit" for the role. Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" wondered why Affleck, "looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable," committed himself to the film. "<a href="Live%20by%20Night%20%28film%29">Live by Night</a>", which Affleck wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in, was released in late 2016. Adapted from <a href="Dennis%20Lehane">Dennis Lehane</a>'s <a href="Live%20by%20Night">novel of the same name</a>, the <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. David Sims of "The Atlantic" described it as "a fascinating mess of a movie" and criticized Affleck's "stiff, uncomfortable" performance. He noted that one of the last action scenes "is so wonderfully staged, its action crisp and easy to follow, that it reminds you what skill Affleck has with the camera". In October 2016, Affleck and Damon made a one-off stage appearance for a live reading of the "Good Will Hunting" screenplay at New York's <a href="Skirball%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Skirball Theater</a>.

Affleck stepped down as director and writer of "<a href="DC%20Extended%20Universe%23Films%20in%20development">The Batman</a>" in 2017 and ultimately left the project entirely. He returned to the screen in "<a href="Triple%20Frontier%20%28film%29">Triple Frontier</a>" (2019). Although the drug-trafficking thriller was initially scheduled to film in 2017, director <a href="J.C.%20Chandor">J.C. Chandor</a> delayed filming until 2018 to accomodate Affleck's treatment for alcoholism. Affleck has filmed a role opposite <a href="Anne%20Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a> in <a href="Dee%20Rees">Dee Rees</a>'s political thriller "<a href="The%20Last%20Thing%20He%20Wanted%20%28film%29">The Last Thing He Wanted</a>" and reunited with director Gavin O'Connor to star as a recovering alcoholic in the sports drama "Torrance".

During visits to Washington D.C., Affleck has testified before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Foreign%20Affairs%20Subcommittee%20on%20Africa%2C%20Global%20Health%2C%20Global%20Human%20Rights%20and%20International%20Organizations">House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">House Armed Services Committee</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a>, and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Appropriations%20Subcommittee%20on%20State%2C%20Foreign%20Operations%2C%20and%20Related%20Programs">Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Projects</a>.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Affleck expressed concerns about <a href="Barack%20Obama%20religion%20conspiracy%20theories">conspiracy theories claiming Barack Obama was an Arab or a Muslim</a>: "This prejudice that we have allowed to fester in this campaign ... the acceptance of both of those things as a legitimate slur is really a problem."

When told that an ancestor of his had been a <a href="slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slave owner</a> in Georgia, Affleck responded: "God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, you know, there it is, part of our history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." Leaked emails from the <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Entertainment%20hack">2015 Sony email hacking scandal</a> showed that, after filming, Affleck's representative emailed the documentary maker to say the actor felt "uncomfortable" about the segment, which was not included in the final broadcast. PBS denied the claim that it had censored the show at Affleck's behest, and the show's host, professor <a href="Henry%20Louis%20Gates%20Jr.">Henry Louis Gates Jr.</a>, stated "we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry".

In 2017, actress and former "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>" ("TRL") host <a href="Hilarie%20Burton">Hilarie Burton</a> retweeted a video clip from "TRL Uncensored", in which Burton is seen recalling how Affleck "wraps his arm around me, and comes over and tweaks my left boob" during an appearance in 2003.

Having no real political experience, the new king was stripped of his powers by the <a href="Venizelism">Venizelists</a> and effectively imprisoned in his own palace. Venizelos, as prime minister, was the effective ruler with the support of the Entente. Though reduced to the status of a <a href="puppet%20monarch">puppet king</a>, Alexander supported Greek troops during their war against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. Under his reign, the territorial extent of Greece considerably increased, following the victory of the Entente and their <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> in the First World War and the early stages of the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%931922%29">Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922</a>.

Alexander controversially married the commoner <a href="Aspasia%20Manos">Aspasia Manos</a> in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced the couple to leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic <a href="Barbary%20macaque">Barbary macaque</a> and died of <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival and contributed to the fall of the Venizelist regime. After a <a href="Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%201920">general election</a> and a <a href="Greek%20referendum%2C%201920">referendum</a>, Constantine I was restored to the throne.

Alexander was born at <a href="Tatoi%20Palace">Tatoi Palace</a> on 1 August 1893 (20 July in the <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>), the second son of <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20Greece">Crown Prince Constantine of Greece</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Gl%C3%BCcksburg">House of Glücksburg</a> and his wife <a href="Sophia%20of%20Prussia">Princess Sophia of Prussia</a>. He was related to royalty throughout Europe. His father was the eldest son and heir apparent of <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">King George I of Greece</a> by his wife <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Constantinovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia</a>; his mother was the daughter of <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Emperor Frederick III of Germany</a> and his wife <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom</a>. Constantine was a grandson of <a href="Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">King Christian IX of Denmark</a> and a cousin of both <a href="George%20V">King George V of the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Emperor Nicholas II of Russia</a>. Sophia was the sister of <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany</a>, and was also a cousin of King George V through her grandmother, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>.

Alexander's early life alternated between the <a href="Presidential%20Mansion%2C%20Athens">Royal Palace</a> in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, and Tatoi Palace in the city's suburbs. With his parents he undertook several trips abroad and regularly visited <a href="Schloss%20Friedrichshof">Schloss Friedrichshof</a>, the home of his maternal grandmother, who had a particular affection for her Greek grandson.

Though he was very close to his younger sister, <a href="Helen%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Princess Helen</a>, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother <a href="George%20II%20of%20Greece">George</a>, with whom he had little in common. While his elder brother was a serious and thoughtful child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother <a href="Paul%20of%20Greece">Paul</a> were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.

As his father's second son, Alexander was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, George. His education was expensive and carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany, Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious <a href="Hellenic%20Military%20Academy">Hellenic Military Academy</a>, where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for his intellectual capacity. He was passionate about cars and motors, and was one of the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.

He distinguished himself in combat during the <a href="Greece%20in%20the%20Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a> of 1912–13. As a young officer, he was stationed, along with his elder brother, in the field staff of his father; and he accompanied the latter at the head of the <a href="Army%20of%20Thessaly">Army of Thessaly</a> during the capture of <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a> in 1912. King George I was assassinated in Thessaloniki soon afterwards, and Alexander's father ascended the throne as Constantine I.

In 1915, at a party held in Athens by court marshal Theodore <a href="Ypsilantis">Ypsilantis</a>, Alexander became re-acquainted with one of his childhood friends, <a href="Aspasia%20Manos">Aspasia Manos</a>. She had just returned from education in France and Switzerland, and was reckoned as very beautiful by her acquaintances. She was the daughter of Constantine's <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Horse">Master of the Horse</a>, Colonel Petros Manos, and his wife Maria Argyropoulos. The 21-year-old Alexander was smitten, and was so determined to seduce her that he followed her to the island of <a href="Spetses">Spetses</a> where she holidayed that year. Initially, Aspasia was resistant to his charm; although considered very handsome by his contemporaries, Alexander had a reputation as a ladies' man from numerous past liaisons. Despite this, he finally won her over, and the couple were engaged in secret. However, for King Constantine I, Queen Sophia and much of European society of the time, it was inconceivable for a royal prince to marry someone of a different social rank.

During World War I, Constantine I followed a formal policy of neutrality, yet he was openly benevolent towards <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>, which was fighting alongside <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> against the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a> of <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>, <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a>. Constantine was the brother-in-law of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and had also become something of a Germanophile following his military training in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>. His pro-German attitude provoked a split between the monarch and the prime minister, <a href="Eleftherios%20Venizelos">Eleftherios Venizelos</a>, who wanted to support the Entente in the hope of expanding Greek territory to incorporate the Greek minorities in the Ottoman Empire and the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. Protected by the countries of the Entente, particularly France, in 1916 Venizelos formed a <a href="Movement%20of%20National%20Defence">parallel government to that of the king</a>.

Parts of Greece were occupied by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the <a href="Venizelism">Venizelists</a>. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved <a href="Princess%20Katherine%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Princess Katherine</a> by carrying her through the woods for more than two kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.

Finally on 10 June 1917, <a href="Charles%20Jonnart">Charles Jonnart</a>, the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine to give up his power. On the threat of Entente forces landing in <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while determined to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), <a href="Prince%20George%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Prince George</a>, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of <a href="Crete">Crete</a> between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.

The dismissal of Constantine was not unanimously supported by the Entente powers; while France and Britain did nothing to stop Jonnart's actions, the <a href="Russian%20provisional%20government">Russian provisional government</a> officially protested to Paris. <a href="Petrograd">Petrograd</a> demanded that Alexander should not receive the title of king but only that of regent so as to preserve the rights of the deposed sovereign and the Crown Prince. Russia's protests were brushed aside, and Alexander ascended the Greek throne.

Alexander swore the oath of loyalty to the <a href="Greek%20Constitution%20of%201911">Greek constitution</a> on the afternoon of 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Athens">Archbishop of Athens</a>, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, <a href="Alexandros%20Zaimis">Alexandros Zaimis</a>, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a <a href="regent">regent</a>, rather than a true monarch.

In the evening, after the ceremony, the royal family decided to leave their palace in Athens for <a href="Tatoi">Tatoi</a>, but city residents opposed the exile of their sovereign and crowds formed outside the palace to prevent Constantine and his family from leaving. On 12 June, the former king and his family escaped undetected from their residence by feigning departure from one gate while exiting through another. At Tatoi, Constantine again impressed upon Alexander that he held the crown in trust only. It was the last time that Alexander would be in direct contact with his family. The next day, Constantine, Sophia and all of their children except Alexander arrived at the small port of <a href="Oropos">Oropos</a> and set off into exile.

With his parents and siblings in exile, Alexander found himself isolated. The royals remained unpopular with the Venizelists, and Entente representatives advised the king's aunts and uncles, particularly <a href="Prince%20Nicholas%20of%20Greece%20and%20Denmark">Prince Nicholas</a>, to leave. Eventually, they all followed Constantine into exile. Royal household staff were gradually replaced by enemies of the former king, and Alexander's allies were either imprisoned or distanced from him. Portraits of the royal family were removed from public buildings, and Alexander's new ministers openly called him the "son of a traitor".

On 26 June 1917, the king was forced to name Eleftherios Venizelos as head of the government. Despite promises given by the Entente on Constantine's departure, the previous prime minister, Zaimis, was effectively forced to resign as Venizelos returned to Athens. Alexander immediately opposed his new prime minister's views and, annoyed by the king's rebuffs, Venizelos threatened to remove him and set up a regency council in the name of Alexander's brother Prince Paul, then still a minor. The Entente powers intervened and asked Venizelos to back down, allowing Alexander to retain the crown. Spied on day and night by the prime minister's supporters, the monarch quickly became a prisoner in his own palace, and his orders went ignored.

Alexander had no experience in affairs of state. However, he was determined to make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the <a href="Macedonian%20front">Macedonian front</a> to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a>, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.

By the end of World War I, Greece had grown beyond its 1914 borders, and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Neuilly-sur-Seine">treaties of Neuilly</a> (1919) and <a href="Treaty%20of%20S%C3%A8vres">Sèvres</a> (1920) confirmed the Greek territorial conquests. The majority of <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> (previously split between Bulgaria and Turkey) and several <a href="Aegean%20Islands">Aegean Islands</a> (such as <a href="Imbros">Imbros</a> and <a href="Tenedos">Tenedos</a>) became part of Greece, and the region of <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>, in <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>, was placed under Greek <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">mandate</a>. Alexander's kingdom increased in size by around a third. In Paris, Venizelos took part in the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">peace negotiations</a> with the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. Upon his return to Greece in August 1920, Venizelos received a laurel crown from the king for his work in support of <a href="panhellenism">panhellenism</a>. 

Despite their territorial gains following the Paris Peace Conference, the Greeks still hoped to achieve the "<a href="Megali%20Idea">Megali Idea</a>" and annex <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and larger areas of Ottoman <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>; they invaded <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> beyond Smyrna and sought to take <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, with the aim of destroying the Turkish resistance led by <a href="Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk">Mustafa Kemal</a> (later known as Atatürk). Thus began the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%931922%29">Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)</a>. Although Alexander's reign saw success after success for the Greek armies, it was eventually Atatürk's revolutionary forces that obtained victory in 1922.

On 12 June 1917, the day after his accession, Alexander revealed his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait until the end of the war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed. In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's only source of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.

The ruling dynasty of Greece (the <a href="House%20of%20Gl%C3%BCcksburg">House of Glücksburg</a>) was of German-Danish origin, and Constantine and Sophia were seen as far too German by the Venizelists, but even though the marriage of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms that it was a foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner. Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos, the prime minister warned the king that marrying her would be unpopular in the eyes of the people.

When <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn</a>, visited Athens in March 1918, to confer the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Order of the Bath</a> upon the king, Alexander feared that a marriage between him and <a href="Mary%2C%20Princess%20Royal%20and%20Countess%20of%20Harewood">Princess Mary of the United Kingdom</a> would be discussed as part of an attempt to consolidate the relationship between Greece and Britain. To Alexander's relief, Arthur asked to meet Aspasia, and declared that, if he were younger, he would have sought to marry her himself. For the foreign powers, and particularly the British ambassador, the marriage was seen as positive. The British authorities feared that Alexander would abdicate in order to marry Aspasia if the wedding was blocked, and they wanted to avoid Greece becoming a republic in case it led to instability or an increase in French influence at their expense.

Alexander's parents were not so happy about the match. Sophia disapproved of her son marrying a commoner, while Constantine wanted a delay but was prepared to be his son's best man if Alexander would be patient. Alexander visited Paris at the end of 1918, raising hopes among his family that they would be able to contact him once he was outside Greece. When Queen Sophia attempted to telephone her son in his Parisian hotel, a minister intercepted the call and informed her that "His Majesty is sorry, but he cannot respond to the telephone". He was not even informed that she had called.

With the help of Aspasia's brother-in-law, Christo Zalocostas, and after three unsuccessful attempts, the couple eventually married in secret before a royal chaplain, <a href="Archimandrite">Archimandrite</a> Zacharistas, on the evening of 17 November 1919. After the ceremony, the archimandrite was sworn to silence but soon broke his promise by confessing to the Archbishop of Athens, <a href="Patriarch%20Meletius%20IV%20of%20Constantinople">Meletios Metaxakis</a>. According to the Greek constitution, members of the royal family had to obtain permission to marry from both the sovereign and the head of the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox Church</a>. By marrying Aspasia without the permission of the Archbishop, Alexander caused a major scandal.

Despite his disapproval of the union, Venizelos allowed Aspasia and her mother to move into the Royal Palace on condition that the marriage remain secret. The information leaked, however, and to escape public opprobrium Aspasia was forced to leave Greece. She fled to Rome, and then to Paris, where Alexander was allowed to join her, six months later, on condition that they did not attend official functions together. On their Parisian honeymoon, while motoring near <a href="Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a>, the couple witnessed a serious car crash in which Count Kergariou's chauffeur lost control of his master's vehicle. Alexander avoided the count's car, which swerved and hit a tree. The king drove the injured to hospital in his own car, while Aspasia, who had trained as a nurse during World War I, rendered first aid. The count was seriously injured and died shortly afterward, after having both legs amputated.

The government allowed the couple to return to Greece in mid-1920. Although their marriage was legalized, Aspasia was not recognized as queen, but was instead known as "Madame Manos". At first, she stayed at her sister's house in the Greek capital before transferring to Tatoi, and it was during this period that she became pregnant with Alexander's child.

Alexander visited the newly acquired territories of <a href="West%20Thrace">West Thrace</a>, and on 8 July 1920 the new name for the region's main town—<a href="Alexandroupoli">Alexandroupoli</a> (meaning "city of Alexander" in Greek)—was announced in the king's presence. The city's previous name of Dedeagatch was considered too Turkish. On 7 September, Venizelos, counting on a surge of support in the wake of the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres and the expansion of Greek territory, announced a general election for early November.

On 2 October 1920, Alexander was injured while walking through the grounds of the Tatoi estate. A domestic <a href="Barbary%20macaque">Barbary macaque</a> belonging to the steward of the palace's grapevines attacked or was attacked by the king's <a href="German%20Shepherd">German Shepherd Dog</a>, Fritz, and Alexander attempted to separate the two animals. As he did so, another monkey attacked Alexander and bit him deeply on the leg and torso. Eventually servants arrived and chased away the monkeys, and the king's wounds were promptly cleaned and dressed but not <a href="cauterize">cauterize</a>d. He did not consider the incident serious and asked that it not be publicized.

That evening, his wounds became infected; he suffered a strong fever and <a href="septicemia">septicemia</a> set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished to take responsibility for so drastic an act. On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the <a href="queen%20dowager">queen dowager</a>, <a href="Olga%20Constantinovna%20of%20Russia">Olga</a>, George I's widow and Alexander's grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens to tend to the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a> twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920. The other members of the royal family received the news by telegram that night.

Two days later, Alexander's body was conveyed to <a href="Athens%20Cathedral">Athens Cathedral</a>, where it lay in state until his funeral on 29 October. Once again, the royal family were refused permission to return to Greece, and Queen Olga was the only member who attended. Foreign powers were represented by the <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Prince Regent of Serbia</a> with his sister <a href="Princess%20Helen%20of%20Serbia">Princess Helen</a> wife of <a href="Prince%20John%20Konstantinovich%20of%20Russia">John Constantinovich of Russia</a>, the <a href="Gustaf%20VI%20Adolf%20of%20Sweden">Crown Prince of Sweden</a> with his uncle <a href="Prince%20Eugen%2C%20Duke%20of%20N%C3%A4rke">Prince Eugene, Duke of Nericia</a>, and Rear-Admirals <a href="George%20Hope%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Sir George Hope</a> of Britain and Dumesnil of France, as well as members of the Athens diplomatic corps.

After the cathedral service, Alexander's body was interred on the grounds of the royal estate at Tatoi. The Greek royal family never regarded Alexander's reign as fully legitimate. In the royal cemetery, while other monarchs are given the inscription "King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark", Alexander's reads "Alexander, son of the King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark. He ruled in the place of his father from 14 June 1917 to 25 October 1920." According to Alexander's favorite sister, Queen Helen of Romania, this feeling of illegitimacy was also shared by Alexander himself, a sentiment that helps explain his mésalliance with Aspasia Manos.

Alexander's death raised questions about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage, his descendants were not in the line of succession. The <a href="Hellenic%20Parliament">Hellenic Parliament</a> demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting under the direction of the Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.

The throne remained vacant and the <a href="Greek%20legislative%20election%2C%201920">legislative elections of 1920</a> turned into an open conflict between the Venizelists, who favored republicanism, and the supporters of the ex-King Constantine. On 14 November 1920, with the war with Turkey dragging on, the monarchists won, and <a href="Dimitrios%20Rallis">Dimitrios Rallis</a> became prime minister; Venizelos (who lost his own parliamentary seat) chose to leave Greece in self-exile. Rallis asked Queen Olga to become regent until Constantine's return.

Under the restored King Constantine I, whose return was endorsed overwhelmingly in a <a href="Greek%20referendum%2C%201920">referendum</a>, Greece went on to lose the Greco–Turkish War with heavy military and civilian casualties. The territory gained on the Turkish mainland during Alexander's reign was lost. Alexander's death in the midst of an election campaign helped destabilize the Venizelos regime, and the resultant loss of Allied support contributed to the failure of Greece's territorial ambitions. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> wrote, "it is perhaps no exaggeration to remark that a quarter of a million persons died of this monkey's bite."

Alexander's daughter by Aspasia Manos, <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexandra</a> (1921–1993), was born five months after his death. Initially, the government took the line that since Alexander had married Aspasia without the permission of his father or the church, his marriage was illegal and his posthumous daughter was illegitimate. However, in July 1922, Parliament passed a law which allowed the King to recognize royal marriages retroactively on a non-dynastic basis. That September, Constantine—at Sophia's insistence—recognized his son's marriage to Aspasia and granted her the style of "Princess Alexander". Her daughter (Constantine I's granddaughter) was legitimized as a princess of Greece and Denmark, and later married King <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Yugoslavia">Peter II of Yugoslavia</a> in London in 1944. They had one child: <a href="Alexander%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia</a>.

Timor Leste Defence Force

The Timor Leste Defence Force (, or <a href="Falintil">Falintil</a>-FDTL, often F-FDTL) is the <a href="Armed%20forces">military body</a> responsible for the defence of <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>. The F-FDTL was established in February 2001 and comprised two small infantry battalions, a small naval component and several supporting units.

The F-FDTL's primary role is to protect East Timor from external threats. It also has an internal security role, which overlaps with that of the <a href="National%20Police%20of%20East%20Timor">Policia Nacional de Timor Leste</a> (PNTL). This overlap has led to tensions between the services, which have been exacerbated by poor morale and lack of discipline within the F-FDTL.

The F-FDTL's problems came to a head in 2006 when almost half the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is currently being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan.

The constitution of East Timor assigns the F-FDTL responsibility for protecting East Timor against external attack. The constitution states that the F-FDTL "shall guarantee national independence, territorial integrity and the freedom and security of the populations against any aggression or external threat, in respect for the constitutional order." The constitution also states that the F-FDTL "shall be non-partisan and shall owe obedience to the competent organs of sovereignty in accordance with the Constitution and the laws, and shall not intervene in political matters." The <a href="National%20Police%20of%20East%20Timor">National Police of East Timor</a> (or PNTL) and other civilian security forces are assigned responsibility for internal security. In practice the responsibilities of the F-FDTL and PNTL were not clearly delineated, and this led to conflict between the two organisations.

The East Timorese Government has broadened the F-FDTL's role over time. As what have been designated "new missions", the F-FDTL has been given responsibility for crisis management, supporting the suppression of civil disorder, responding to humanitarian crises and facilitating co-operation between different parts of the government.

The F-FDTL was formed from the national liberation movement <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla army</a> known as <a href="FALINTIL">FALINTIL</a> (<a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> <a href="acronym">acronym</a> for "Forças Armadas de Libertação de Timor-Leste" or Armed Forces for the Liberation of East Timor). During the period before 1999 some East Timorese leaders, including the current President <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ramos-Horta">José Ramos-Horta</a>, proposed that a future East Timorese state would not have a military. The widespread violence and destruction that followed the independence referendum in 1999 and the need to provide employment to FALINTIL veterans led to a change in policy, however. Following the end of Indonesian rule, FALINTIL proposed the establishment of a large military of about 5,000 personnel.

In mid-2000 the <a href="United%20Nations%20Transitional%20Administration%20in%20East%20Timor">United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor</a> (UNTAET) invited a team from <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a> to conduct a study of East Timor's security force options. The team's report identified three options for an East Timorese military. Option 1 was based on FALINTIL's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3,000–5,000 personnel, option 2 was a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 conscripts and option 3 was for a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 volunteer reservists. The study team recommended option 3 as being best suited to East Timor's security needs and economic situation. This recommendation was accepted by UNTAET in September 2000 and formed the basis of East Timor's defence planning. The plan was also accepted by all the countries that had contributed peacekeeping forces to East Timor. The King's College report has been criticised on the grounds that it led East Timor to establish a large police force and a large Army when its security needs may have been better met by a single smaller paramilitary force.

While East Timor's decision to form a military has been criticised by some commentators, the East Timorese government has consistently believed that the force is necessary for political and security reasons. Critics of the F-FDTL's establishment argue that as East Timor does not face any external threats the government's limited resources would be better spent on strengthening the PNTL. While East Timor's political leadership recognises that the country does not currently face an external threat, they believe that it is necessary to maintain a military capacity to deter future aggression. The establishment of the F-FDTL was also seen as an effective means of integrating FALINTIL into an independent East Timor.

FALINTIL officially became F-FDTL on 1 February 2001. The first 650 members of the F-FDTL were selected from 1,736 former FALINTIL applicants and began training on 29 March. The FDTL's 1st Battalion was established on 29 June 2001 and reached full strength on 1 December. Most members of the battalion were from East Timor's eastern provinces. The 2nd Battalion was established in 2002 from a <a href="En%20cadre">cadre</a> of the 1st Battalion and was manned mainly by new personnel under the age of 21 who had not participated in the independence struggle. Due to the force's prestige and relatively high pay, there were 7,000 applications for the first 267 positions in the battalion. The F-FDTL's small naval component was established in December 2001. The Australian UNTAET contingent provided most of the F-FDTL's training, and the United States equipped the force.

Some of the problems that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, on the basis of applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans feeling that they had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military. These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002.

The F-FDTL gradually assumed responsibility for East Timor's security from the UN peacekeeping force. The <a href="Laut%C3%A9m%20District">Lautém District</a> was the first area to pass to the F-FDTL in July 2002. After further training the F-FDTL took over responsibility for the entire country's external security on 20 May 2004, although some foreign peacekeepers remained in East Timor until mid-2005. The F-FDTL conducted its first operation in January 2003 when an army unit was called in to quell criminal activity caused by west Timorese militia gangs in the <a href="Ermera%20district">Ermera district</a>. While the F-FDTL operated in a "relatively disciplined and orderly fashion" during this operation, it illegally arrested nearly 100 people who were released 10 days later without being charged.

The F-FDTL has suffered from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of these problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.

Tensions between the F-FDTL and PNTL have also reduced the effectiveness of East Timor's security services. During 2003 and 2004, members of the police and F-FDTL clashed on a number of occasions, and groups of soldiers attacked police stations in September 2003 and December 2004. These tensions were caused by the overlapping roles of the two security services, differences of opinion between members of East Timor's leadership and the fact that many members of the PNTL had served with the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Police">Indonesian National Police</a> prior to East Timor's independence while the F-FDTL was based around FALINTIL. In 2003, the East Timorese Government established three new paramilitary police forces equipped with modern weapons. The formation of these units led to dissatisfaction with the Government among some members of the F-FDTL.

The tensions within the F-FDTL came to a head in 2006. In January, 159 soldiers from most units in the F-FDTL complained in a petition to then President <a href="Xanana%20Gusm%C3%A3o">Xanana Gusmão</a> that soldiers from the east of the country received better treatment than westerners. The 'petitioners' received only a minimal response and left their barracks three weeks later, leaving their weapons behind. They were joined by hundreds of other soldiers and on 16 March the F-FDTL's commander, <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Taur%20Matan%20Ruak">Taur Matan Ruak</a>, dismissed 594 soldiers, which was nearly half of the force. The soldiers dismissed were not limited to the petitioners, and included about 200 officers and other ranks who had been chronically absent without leave in the months and years before March 2006.

The crisis escalated into violence in late April. On 24 April, the petitioners and some of their supporters held a four-day demonstration outside the Government Palace in Dili calling for the establishment of an independent commission to address their grievances. Violence broke out on 28 April when some of the petitioners and gangs of youths who had joined the protest attacked the Government Palace. The PNTL failed to contain the protest and the Palace was badly damaged. After violence spread to other areas of Dili, Prime Minister <a href="Mari%20Alkatiri">Mari Alkatiri</a> requested that the F-FDTL help restore order. Troops with no experience in crowd control were deployed to Dili on 29 April and three deaths resulted. On 3 May Major <a href="Alfredo%20Reinado">Alfredo Reinado</a>, the commander of the F-FDTL's <a href="military%20police">military police</a> unit, and most of his soldiers including Lt <a href="Gast%C3%A3o%20Salsinha">Gastão Salsinha</a> abandoned their posts in protest at what they saw as the army's deliberate shooting of civilians.

Fighting broke out between the remnants of the East Timorese security forces and the rebels and gangs in late May. On 23 May Reinado's rebel group opened fire on F-FDTL and PNTL personnel in the Fatu Ahi area. On 24 May F-FDTL personnel near the Force's headquarters were attacked by a group of rebel police officers, petitioners and armed civilians. The attack was defeated when one of the F-FDTL naval component's patrol boats fired on the attackers. During the crisis the relationship between the F-FDTL and PNTL had deteriorated further, and on 25 May members of the F-FDTL attacked the PNTL's headquarters, killing nine unarmed police officers.

As a result of the escalating violence the government was forced to appeal for international peacekeepers on 25 May. Peacekeepers <a href="Operation%20Astute">began to arrive in Dili</a> the next day and eventually restored order. A total of 37 people were killed in the fighting in April and May and 155,000 fled their homes. A United Nations inquiry found that the interior and defence ministers and the commander of the F-FDTL had illegally transferred weapons to civilians during the crisis and recommended that they be prosecuted.

The 2006 crisis left the F-FDTL "in ruins". The F-FDTL's strength fell from 1,435 in January 2006 to 715 in September and the proportion of westerners in the military fell from 65 percent to 28 percent. The F-FDTL started a rebuilding process with support from several nations and the United Nations, but was still not ready to resume responsibility for East Timor's external security two years after the crisis.
In 2004 the commander of the F-FDTL formed a team, which included international contractors, to develop a long-term strategic vision document for the military. This study was supported by the Australian Government. The resulting "Force 2020" document was completed in 2006 and made public in 2007. The document sets out an 'aspirational' vision for the development of the F-FDTL to 2020 and beyond and is of equivalent status to a defence <a href="white%20paper">white paper</a>. It proposes expanding the military to a strength of 3,000 regular personnel in the medium term through the introduction of <a href="conscription">conscription</a>. It also sets longer-term goals such as establishing an air component and purchasing modern weapons, such as <a href="Anti-tank%20warfare">anti-armour weapons</a>, <a href="armoured%20personnel%20carrier">armoured personnel carrier</a>s and <a href="missile%20boat">missile boat</a>s, by 2020.

The "Force 2020" plan is similar to option 1 in the King's College report. The King's College study team strongly recommended against such a force structure, labelling it "unaffordable" and raising concerns over the impact of conscription upon East Timorese society and military readiness. The team estimated that sustaining such a force structure would cost 2.6 to 3.3 percent of East Timor's annual gross domestic product and would "represent a heavy burden on the East Timor economy". Moreover, the "Force 2020" plan may not be realistic or suitable as it appears to emphasise military expansion to counter external threats over spending on other government services and internal security and outlines ideas such as the long-term (~2075) development of <a href="Militarisation%20of%20space">space forces</a>.

While the "Force 2020" plan has proven controversial, it appears to have been adopted by the East Timorese government. The plan was criticised by the United Nations and the governments of Australia and the United States as unaffordable and in excess of East Timor's needs. East Timorese President José Ramos-Horta defended the plan, however, arguing that its adoption will transform the F-FDTL into a professional force capable of defending East Timor's sovereignty and contributing to the nation's stability. East Timorese defence officials have also stressed that "Force 2020" is a long-term plan and does not propose acquiring advanced weapons for some years.

The repercussions of the 2006 crisis continue to be felt. On 11 February 2008, a group of rebels led by Alfredo Reinado <a href="2008%20East%20Timorese%20assassination%20attempts">attempted to kill or kidnap</a> President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmão. Although Ramos-Horta and one of his guards were badly wounded, these attacks were not successful and Reinado and another rebel were killed. A joint F-FDTL and PNTL command was established to pursue the surviving rebels and the military and police have demonstrated a high degree of co-operation during this operation. The joint command was disbanded on 19 June 2008. While the joint command contributed to the surrender of many of Reinado's associates, it has been alleged that members of this unit committed human rights violations. In June 2008 the Government offered to provide financial compensation to the petitioners who wished to return to civilian life. This offer was accepted, and all the petitioners returned to their homes by August that year. In May 2009, the F-FDTL accepted its first intake of recruits since the 2006 crisis. While the regional diversity of the 579 new recruits was generally much greater than that of the pre-crisis intakes, 60.3 percent of officer candidates were from the country's eastern districts. From 2009 the F-FDTL established platoon-sized outposts to support the PNTL border police in the Bobonaro and Covalima border districts, and it has increasingly been deployed to undertake internal security tasks. From February to August 2010, 200 members of the F-FDTL were deployed to support PNTL operations against "Ninja" gangs. These troops undertook community engagement tasks, and were unarmed and not closely integrated with the PNTL efforts.

In 2011 the F-FDTL was still under-strength and yet to reform its training and discipline standards. Tensions within the F-FDTL also continued to threaten the stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government placed a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2012 the Government authorised an expansion of the F-FDTL to 3,600 personnel by 2020, of whom approximately one quarter will be members of the Naval Component. 

The F-FDTL is still in the process of rebuilding from the events of 2006. The 2016 edition of the <a href="International%20Institute%20for%20Strategic%20Studies">International Institute for Strategic Studies</a>' (IISS) publication "The Military Balance" stated that the F-FDTL was "only capable of internal and border-security roles". In 2016 the Australian <a href="Defence%20Intelligence%20Organisation">Defence Intelligence Organisation</a> also reported that little progress had been made in implementing the Force 2020 plans.

The constitution of East Timor states that the president is the supreme commander of the defence force and has the power to appoint the F-FDTL's commander and chief of staff. The <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20East%20Timor">Council of Ministers</a> and <a href="National%20Parliament%20of%20East%20Timor">National Parliament</a> are responsible for funding the F-FDTL and setting policy relating to East Timor's security. <a href="Cirilo%20Jos%C3%A9%20Cristov%C3%A3o">Cirilo José Cristovão</a> serves as the current minister of Defence and Security, and <a href="Julio%20Tomas%20Pinto">Julio Tomas Pinto</a> is the Secretary of State for Defense. Both men were sworn into these roles on 8 August 2012. A Superior Council for Defence and Security was established in 2005 to advise the president on defence and security policy and legislation and the appointment and dismissal of senior military personnel. The council is chaired by the president and includes the prime minister, the defence, justice, interior and foreign affairs ministers, the heads of the F-FDTL and PNTL a national state security officer and three representatives from the national parliament. The council's role is not clear, however, and neither it nor the parliament served as a check against the decision to sack large numbers of F-FDTL personnel in 2006. A parliamentary committee also provides oversight of East Timor's security sector. Major General <a href="Lere%20Anan%20Timor">Lere Anan Timor</a> is the current commander of the F-FDTL, and was appointed to this position on 6 October 2011.

A small ministry of defence (which was renamed the Ministry of Defence and Security in 2007) was established in 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's defence policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited the extent to which foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of Defence and Security was organised into elements responsible for defence (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited the extent to which the ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.

The F-FDTL is organised into a headquarters, a land component, a naval component and supporting units. When <a href="Taur%20Matan%20Ruak">Taur Matan Ruak</a> moved into politics, the two most senior officers in the Defence Force became Major General Lere Anan Timor as CDF and Brigadier General <a href="Meno%20Paixao">Meno Paixao</a> as Vice Chief of Defence Force. The supporting units include a logistics support company and a military police <a href="platoon">platoon</a>. East Timor does not have an air force and the F-FDTL does not currently operate any aircraft. Following its establishment the F-FDTL also had the "largest and most sophisticated" <a href="HUMINT">human intelligence</a> network in East Timor, which was based on the clandestine resistance reporting networks built up during the Indonesian occupation. However, in May 2008 the national parliament legislated to place the F-FTDL's intelligence branch under the authority of the head of the National Information Service.

In 2011 F-FDTL had an authorised strength of 1,500 regular personnel and 1,500 reservists. It had not reached these totals as funding shortfalls prevented the reserve component from being formed and the Army's two regular battalions were under-strength. While all the F-FDTL's personnel were initially FALINTIL veterans the force's composition has changed over time and few soldiers from the insurgency remain due to the force's narrow age requirement. After the F-FDTL's 1st Battalion was established in 2001 recruitment was opened to all East Timorese above the age of 18, including women. Few women have joined the F-FDTL, however, and as at February 2010 only seven percent of new recruits were female.

When initially established, the F-FDTL land force comprised two <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s, each with an authorised strength of 600 personnel. each battalion had three rifle companies, a support company and a headquarters company. Although the army is small, the <a href="Guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla tactics</a> employed by FALINTIL before the departure in 1999 of the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Armed%20Forces">Indonesian National Armed Forces</a> were effective against overwhelming numbers and it has the potential to form a credible deterrent against invasion. The Army's current doctrine is focused on low-intensity infantry combat tactics as well as counter-insurgency tasks. Most of the force's training and operations are conducted at the <a href="Section%20%28military%20unit%29">section</a> level, and company or battalion-sized exercises are rare.

Logistics and service support is provided through Headquarters F-FDTL in <a href="Dili">Dili</a>. There is also a military police platoon that polices the F-FDTL and performs traditional policing tasks, resulting in conflicting roles with the PNTL. The military police have also been responsible for presidential security since February 2007. In 2010 the United States Embassy in Dili reported that the F-FDTL also planned to raise two engineer squadrons during that year; these two units were to have a total strength of 125 personnel.

The F-FDTL is armed only with <a href="small%20arms">small arms</a> and does not have any <a href="crew-served%20weapon">crew-served weapon</a>s. The 2007 edition of "Jane's Sentinel" stated that the F-FDTL had the following equipment in service: 1,560 <a href="M16%20rifle">M16 rifle</a>s and 75 <a href="M203%20grenade%20launcher">M203 grenade launcher</a>s, 75 <a href="FN%20Minimi">FN Minimi</a> <a href="squad%20automatic%20weapon">squad automatic weapon</a>s, 8 <a href="sniper%20rifle">sniper rifle</a>s and 50 <a href="M1911">.45 M1911A1</a> pistols. A further 75 Minimis were to be ordered at that time. The majority of the F-FDTL's weapons were donated by other countries. An assessment of East Timor's security forces published by the <a href="Centre%20for%20International%20Governance%20Innovation">Centre for International Governance Innovation</a> in 2010 stated that "F-FDTL weapons management and control systems, while superior to that of PNTL, are underdeveloped".

The naval component of the F-FDTL was established in December 2001 when Portugal transferred two small <a href="Albatroz%20class%20patrol%20boat">"Albatroz"-class</a> patrol boats from the <a href="Portuguese%20Navy">Portuguese Navy</a>. Its establishment was not supported by the King's College study team, the UN, or East Timor's other donor countries on the grounds that East Timor could not afford to operate a naval force. The role of the naval component is to conduct fishery and border protection patrols and ensure that the maritime line of communication to the <a href="Oecussi">Oecussi</a> enclave remains open. All of the force's warships are based at Hera Harbour, which is located a few kilometres east of Dili. Under the "Force 2020" plan the naval component may eventually be expanded to a light patrol force equipped with <a href="corvette">corvette</a>-sized ships and <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a>.
On 12 April 2008 East Timor signed a contract for two new Chinese-built 43-metre <a href="Type%20062%20class%20gunboat">Type-62 class</a> patrol boats. These ships were to replace the "Albatroz"-class vessels and to be used to protect East Timor's fisheries. The contract for the ships also involved 30 to 40 East Timorese personnel being trained in China. The two new patrol boats arrived from China in June 2010, and were commissioned as the <a href="Jaco%20class%20patrol%20boat">"Jaco"-class</a> on the eleventh of the month. In November 2010 it was reported that East Timor would order a further two patrol boats from <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>. In the event, three ex-<a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Navy">Republic of Korea Navy</a> <a href="Chamsuri%20class%20patrol%20boat">Chamsuri class patrol boat</a>s were donated, and these entered service with the naval component on 26 September 2011. The East Timorese government also ordered two fast patrol boats from the Indonesian company PT Pal in March 2011 for the price of $US40 million.

The 2016 edition of the IISS "Military Balance" listed the naval component's size as 80 personnel. The 2011 edition of "Jane's Sentinel" put the strength of the naval component at 250; this source also stated that recruitment for an approximately 60-person strong <a href="Marine%20%28military%29">marine</a> unit began in 2011 from existing naval component personnel, members of the Army and civilians. The marines will serve as a <a href="special%20forces">special operations</a> force.

In 2017 Timor-Leste accepted an offer of two new <a href="Guardian%20class%20patrol%20vessel">Guardian class patrol vessel</a>s and associated training and logistics assistance from the Australian Government. The vessels are scheduled to be delivered in 2023.

The military ranks of the F-FDTL are similar to the <a href="Military%20ranks%20of%20Portugal">military ranks</a> of the <a href="Portuguese%20Armed%20Forces">Portuguese Armed Forces</a>.

The F-FDTL's budget for 2015 is $US19.9 million. The Ministry of Defence and Security and Secretariat of State for Defence are funded separately from the F-FDTL, and were allocated $US4.6 million and $US7.9 million respectively in 2015. The total expenditure on defence during 2016 was $US27.2 million, which was equivalent to 0.9 of a percent of gross domestic product.

Most of the F-FDTL's weapons and other equipment have been provided by foreign donors, and this is likely to remain the case in the future. The East Timor government has used some of the revenue it earns from the country's oil and gas sector to purchase military equipment, however. No military production currently takes place in East Timor.

Funding shortfalls have constrained the development of the F-FDTL. The government has been forced to postpone plans to form an independent company stationed in the Oecussi enclave and two reserve infantry battalions. These units formed an important part of the King's College report's option 3 force structure and their absence may have impacted on East Timor's defence policy. As of 2011 the government was yet to announce what, if any, reserve units would be formed, though provisions for such units had been included in legislation.

While the UN was reluctant to engage with the F-FDTL, several bilateral donors have assisted the force's development. Australia has provided extensive training and logistical support to the F-FDTL since it was established, and currently provides advisors who are posted to the F-FDTL and Ministry of Defence and Security. Portugal also provides advisors and trains two naval officers each year in Portugal. China provided US$1.8 million in aid to the F-FDTL between 2002 and 2008 and agreed to build a new US$7 million headquarters for the force in late 2007. East Timor is one of <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>'s main destinations for aid and the <a href="Brazilian%20Army">Brazilian Army</a> is responsible for training the F-FDTL's military police unit (Maubere Mission). The United States also provides a small amount of assistance to the F-FDTL through the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department's</a> International Military Education and Training Program. While Malaysia has provided training courses and financial and technical aid, this assistance was suspended after the 2006 crisis. Under current arrangements Portugal provides the F-FDTL with basic and advanced training while Australia and other nations provide training in specialised skills. , the East Timorese government had posted three F-FDTL members to serve overseas as observers with the <a href="United%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20South%20Sudan">United Nations Mission in South Sudan</a>.

East Timor and Indonesia have sought to build friendly relations since 2002. While movements of people and drug smuggling across their international border has caused tensions, both countries have worked with the UN to improve the security situation in the region. The East Timorese and Indonesian governments signed a defence agreement in August 2011 which aims to improve co-operation between their national militaries. The Timor Leste-Indonesia Defense Joint Committee was also established at this time to monitor the agreement's implementation.

East Timor ratified the <a href="Nuclear%20Non-Proliferation%20Treaty">Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty</a>, <a href="Biological%20and%20Toxin%20Weapons%20Convention">Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention</a> and <a href="Chemical%20Weapons%20Convention">Chemical Weapons Convention</a> in 2003. The East Timorese Government has no plans to acquire nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The country also became a party to the <a href="Ottawa%20Treaty">Ottawa Treaty</a>, which bans <a href="anti-personnel%20mine">anti-personnel mine</a>s, in 2003.

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is a 1991 American <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> released by <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. It is the sixth feature film based on "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>", and a <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to the 1966–1969 "" television series. Taking place after the events of "", it is the last <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%20series%29">film</a> featuring the entire cast of . After the destruction of the Klingon moon Praxis leads the <a href="Klingon%20Empire">Klingon Empire</a> to pursue peace with their long-time adversary the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation</a>, the crew of the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-A%29">USS "Enterprise"</a> must race against unseen conspirators with a militaristic agenda.

The sixth film in the series was initially planned as a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to the original series, with younger actors portraying the crew of the "Enterprise" while attending <a href="Starfleet%20Academy">Starfleet Academy</a>, but the idea was discarded because of negative reaction from the original cast and the fans. Faced with producing a new film in time for Star Trek's 25th anniversary, <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a>, the director of "", and <a href="Denny%20Martin%20Flinn">Denny Martin Flinn</a> wrote a script based on a suggestion from <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> about what would happen if "<a href="Berlin%20Wall">the Wall</a> came down in space", touching on the contemporary events of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

Principal photography took place between April and September 1991. The production budget was smaller than anticipated because of the critical and commercial disappointment of "The Final Frontier". Because of a lack of sound stage space on the Paramount lot, many scenes were filmed around Hollywood. Meyer and cinematographer Hiro Narita aimed for a darker and more dramatic mood, subtly altering sets originally used for the television series "". Producer <a href="Steven-Charles%20Jaffe">Steven-Charles Jaffe</a> led a <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> that filmed on an Alaskan glacier that stood in for a Klingon gulag. <a href="Cliff%20Eidelman">Cliff Eidelman</a> produced the film's score, which is intentionally darker than previous "Star Trek" offerings.

The film was released in North America on December 6, 1991. "The Undiscovered Country" garnered positive reviews, with publications praising the lighthearted acting and facetious references. The film performed strongly at the box office. It posted the largest opening weekend gross of the series before going on to earn $96,888,996 worldwide. The film earned two <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nominations, for Best Makeup and Best Sound Effects, and is the only "Star Trek" movie to win the <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Science%20Fiction%20Film">Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film</a>. A special collectors' edition DVD version of the film was released in 2004, to which Meyer had made minor alterations. "Star Trek" creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> died shortly before the movie's premiere, just days after viewing the film.

No longer able to maintain a hostile footing, the Klingons <a href="Suing%20for%20peace">sue for peace</a> with their longstanding enemy, the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">United Federation of Planets</a>. Accepting the proposal before the Klingons choose to revert to a more belligerent approach and die fighting, <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> sends the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-A%29">USS "Enterprise"-A</a> to meet with the Klingon Chancellor, Gorkon, and escort him to negotiations on Earth. Captain <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>, whose son <a href="David%20Marcus%20%28Star%20Trek%29">David</a> was murdered by Klingons, opposes the negotiations and resents the assignment.

"Enterprise" and Gorkon's battlecruiser rendezvous and continue towards Earth, with the two command crews sharing a tense meal aboard "Enterprise". Later that night, "Enterprise" appears to fire torpedoes at the Klingon ship, disabling its <a href="artificial%20gravity">artificial gravity</a>. During the confusion, two figures wearing Starfleet spacesuits beam aboard the Klingon ship and grievously wound Gorkon before escaping. Kirk surrenders to avoid armed conflict, and beams aboard the Klingon ship with Doctor <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> to attempt to save Gorkon's life. The chancellor dies, and Gorkon's chief of staff, <a href="Chang%20%28Star%20Trek%29">General Chang</a>, arrests and tries Kirk and McCoy for his assassination. The pair are found guilty and sentenced to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> on the frozen asteroid . Gorkon's daughter Azetbur becomes the new chancellor, and continues diplomatic negotiations; for reasons of security, the conference is relocated and the new location is kept secret. While several senior Starfleet officers want to rescue Kirk and McCoy, the Federation President refuses to risk full-scale war. Azetbur likewise refuses to invade Federation space.

Kirk and McCoy arrive at the Rura Penthe mines and are befriended by a <a href="shapeshifting">shapeshifter</a> named Martia, who offers them an escape route; in reality, it is a ruse to make their arranged deaths appear accidental. Once her betrayal is revealed, Martia transforms into Kirk's double and fights him, but is killed by the prison guards to silence any witnesses. Kirk and McCoy are beamed aboard "Enterprise" by Captain <a href="Spock">Spock</a>, who had assumed command and undertaken an investigation in Kirk's absence. Determining that "Enterprise" did not fire the torpedoes but that the assassins are still aboard, the crew has begun a search for them. The two assassins are found dead, but Kirk and Spock trick their accomplice into believing they are still alive. When the culprit arrives in <a href="sick%20bay">sick bay</a> to finish them off, Kirk and Spock discover that the killer is Spock's protégé, <a href="Valeris">Valeris</a>. To discover the identity of the conspirators, Spock initiates a forced <a href="mind-meld">mind-meld</a>, and learns that a group of Federation, Klingon, and <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a> officers plotted to sabotage the peace talks. The torpedoes that struck Gorkon's cruiser came from Chang's prototype <a href="Bird%20of%20Prey%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Bird of Prey</a> that can fire while <a href="cloaking%20device">cloaked</a>.

"Enterprise" and "Excelsior" race to the location of the peace talks. Chang's cloaked Bird of Prey attacks and inflicts heavy damage on both ships. At the suggestion of <a href="Uhura">Uhura</a>, Spock and McCoy modify a torpedo to home in on the exhaust emissions of Chang's vessel. The torpedo impact reveals the Bird of Prey's location, and "Enterprise" and "Excelsior" destroy the ship with a volley of torpedoes. Crew from both ships beam to the conference and halt an attempt on the Federation President's life. Having saved the peace talks, "Enterprise" is ordered back to Earth by Starfleet Command to be decommissioned, but Kirk orders a course set for '<a href="Peter%20Pan">the second star to the right, and straight on 'til morning</a>'. As "Enterprise" cruises towards a nearby star, Kirk records in his log that though this mission is the final cruise of "Enterprise" under his command, others will continue 'to boldly go where no one has gone before'.

"The Undiscovered Country"s cast includes the final group appearance of the major characters from the original television series, and new actors and characters. Casting director <a href="Mary%20Jo%20Slater">Mary Jo Slater</a> loaded the film with as many Hollywood stars as the production could afford, including a minor appearance by <a href="Christian%20Slater">Christian Slater</a>, her son; "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" considered the cameo a likely attempt to lure younger audiences. Meyer was interested in casting actors who could project and articulate feelings, even through alien makeup. Producer <a href="Ralph%20Winter%20%28producer%29">Ralph Winter</a> said, "We were not looking for someone to say 'Okay, I'll do it', but people who were excited by the material [...] and would treat it as if it was the biggest picture ever being made."


"The Final Frontier", the previous film in the series, was a critical and financial disappointment; the cast and crew were worried that the franchise would not be able to recover from the blow. With the looming 25th anniversary of in 1991, producer <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> revisited an idea <a href="Ralph%20Winter%20%28producer%29">Ralph Winter</a> had for the fourth film: a prequel featuring young versions of Kirk and Spock at <a href="Starfleet%20Academy">Starfleet Academy</a>. The prequel was designed to be a way of keeping the characters, if not the actors, in what was called ""<a href="Top%20Gun">Top Gun</a>" in outer space". Bennett and "The Final Frontier" writer David Loughery wrote a script entitled "The Academy Years", where Dr. <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> talks about how he met Kirk and Spock while addressing a group of Academy graduates. The script shows Kirk and Spock's upbringing, their meeting McCoy and <a href="Montgomery%20Scott">Montgomery Scott</a> at the Academy and defeating a villain before parting ways. The script would have established that George Kirk, James T. Kirk's father, was a pilot who went missing—presumed dead—during a warp experiment with Scott. The script is set before the "enlightenment" of the Federation; slavery and racism are common, with Spock being bullied because he is the only Vulcan student. Nurse <a href="Christine%20Chapel">Christine Chapel</a> cameos in the script's climax.
Actor <a href="James%20Doohan">James Doohan</a> claimed that Paramount chief <a href="Frank%20Mancuso%2C%20Sr.">Frank Mancuso</a> had fired Bennett following negative reaction from the core cast, Roddenberry, and fans. Bennett claimed that after he rewrote the script to include Shatner and Nimoy, Paramount had still rejected it and that he decided it was time he left the franchise. He said, "My term was up. I was offered $1.5 million to do "Star Trek VI" and I said 'Thanks, I don't want to do that. I want to do the Academy.'" Actor <a href="Walter%20Koenig">Walter Koenig</a> approached Mancuso with a new script outline codenamed "<a href="In%20Flanders%20Fields">In Flanders Fields</a>"; in it, the <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a>s join the Federation and go to war with the Klingons. The "Enterprise" crew, except Spock, are forced to retire for not meeting fitness tests. When Spock and his new crew are captured by a monstrous worm-like race of aliens (which Koenig described as "things that the monsters in "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" evolved "from""), the old crew must rescue them. In the end, all of the characters except McCoy and Spock die.

Mancuso asked <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> to conceive the new film to serve as a <a href="swan%20song">swan song</a> for the original cast. Nimoy, <a href="Mark%20Rosenthal">Mark Rosenthal</a> and <a href="Lawrence%20Konner">Lawrence Konner</a> suggested Kirk meeting <a href="Jean-Luc%20Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a>, but ""s producers refused to end their show. <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a>, who directed "" and co-wrote "" was also approached for an idea for the sixth film, but had none. Ralph Winter was brought on to the project as producer shortly after Bennett's departure, and said Paramount's mandate was to produce a 25th anniversary film that would not cost a lot of money.

Nimoy visited Meyer's house and suggested, "[What if] <a href="Berlin%20Wall">the wall</a> comes down in outer space? You know, the Klingons have always been our stand-ins for the Russians..." Meyer recalled that he replied "'Oh, wait a minute! Okay, we start with an intergalactic <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl</a>! Big explosion! We got no more Klingon Empire...!' And I just spilled out the whole story!" The story deliberately included references to the contemporary political climate; the character of Gorkon was based on <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, while the assassination storyline was Meyer's idea. He thought it was plausible that the Klingon leader who turned soft towards the enemy would be killed like similar peacemakers throughout history: <a href="Anwar%20El%20Sadat">Anwar El Sadat</a>, <a href="Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi">Gandhi</a>, and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Nimoy's hiring of Meyer was not only beneficial because Meyer knew the material and could write fast (having produced "The Wrath of Khan"s screenplay in twelve days), but if Meyer was to direct it would offset any acrimony from Shatner, whose ire would have been aroused if Nimoy returned to direct his third "Star Trek" feature after "" and "The Voyage Home". Meyer said that when he started work on the screenplay it did not occur to him that he would direct the film. Meyer's wife was the first person to suggest that he should direct.

Meyer and his friend Denny Martin Flinn wrote the screenplay by the nascent means of <a href="e-mail">e-mail</a>; Meyer lived in Europe while Flinn was based in Los Angeles. The pair worked out a system where Flinn would write all day and then send the draft to Meyer, who would read and make revisions. The script constantly changed because of demands made not only by the core cast, but also the supporting players. Flinn was aware that the film would be the last to feature the cast of the original television series, so he wrote an opening that embraced the passage of time. In the opening, each of the crew was to be rounded up out of unhappy retirement for one final mission.

Flinn recalled that "the scenes demonstrated who [the characters] were and what they did when they weren't on the "Enterprise". [...] It added some humanity to the characters. In early drafts, Spock plays <a href="Polonius">Polonius</a> in a Vulcan version of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", while Sulu drives a taxicab in an overcrowded metropolis. The revised opening featured Captain Sulu bringing his friends out of their retirement: Spock's whereabouts are classified; Kirk was to have married Carol Marcus (played by <a href="Bibi%20Besch">Bibi Besch</a> in "The Wrath of Khan"), the mother of his late son, leading a settled life before a special envoy arrives at his door. McCoy is drunk at a posh medical dinner; Scott is teaching Engineering while the Bird of Prey from "The Voyage Home" is pulled from San Francisco Bay; Uhura hosts a call-in radio show and is glad to escape; and Chekov is playing chess at a club.

The opening was rejected as too expensive to film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would have pushed the budget to $50 million. While they tried to hold on to the opening as long as they could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.

The script was finished by October 1990, five months after Nimoy was approached to write the story. Several months were spent working out the budget; because of the disappointing box office returns of "The Final Frontier", Paramount wanted to keep the sixth film's budget approximately the same as the previous installment, although the script called for space battles and new aliens. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley's salaries were cut with the understanding that they would share in box office profits. Meyer estimated that almost two months were spent fighting with the studio about the budget. "To some degree, almost every area of the production was affected by the cuts—but the script was the one thing that did not become a casualty," Meyer said. The original budget hovered around $41 million. While not expensive for a Hollywood production, this would have presented a risk due to "Star Trek" films' niche audience and lower international appeal. The final budget came in at $27 million.

"Star Trek"'s creator, <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>, who wielded significant influence despite his ill health, hated the script. Meyer's first meeting with Roddenberry resulted in Meyer storming out of the room within five minutes. As with Meyer's previous "Star Trek" film ("The Wrath of Khan"), the script had strong military overtones, with a naval theme present throughout. Far from being idealized, the characters were shown as bigoted and flawed. In contrast to Roddenberry's vision of the future, Meyer thought there was no evidence that bigotry would disappear by the 23rd century. When Roddenberry protested about the villainization of <a href="Saavik">Saavik</a>, Meyer replied that "I created Saavik. She was not Gene's. If he doesn't like what I plan on doing with her, maybe he should give back the money he's made off my films. Maybe then I'll care what he has to say." After the stormy first meeting, a group including Meyer, Roddenberry, and producer Ralph Winter discussed the revised draft. Roddenberry would voice his disapproval of elements of the script line by line, and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. Overall, the tone of the meeting was conciliatory, but the producers ultimately ignored many of Roddenberry's concerns. By February 13, 1991, the film was officially put into production with the agreement it would be in theaters by the end of the year.

As he had when he directed "The Wrath of Khan", Meyer attempted to modify the look of "Star Trek" to fit his vision. Cinematographer <a href="Hiro%20Narita">Hiro Narita</a>'s previous work had been on effects films such as "<a href="The%20Rocketeer%20%28film%29">The Rocketeer</a>", where he had time and money to make a lavish period fantasy; with "The Undiscovered Country", he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about "Star Trek", Meyer replied that he did not want him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.

Effects supervisor Scott Farrar said that Narita did a "good job of keeping [the set] dark. When you get into a stage situation of aluminum walls and shiny metal, it can be a problem. But by keeping the light down, you see a little less and it becomes more textural. Hiro was very keen to avoid that over-bright stage look." The budget meant that many of the "Enterprise" sets were redresses of those used in "". Meyer and production designer <a href="Herman%20Zimmerman">Herman Zimmerman</a> were only able to make minor adjustments to these sets, as the television series was still in production at the time of filming.

The set used for Spock's quarters was the same as the one for Kirk's, but with the addition of a central column. The set was being used at the time for <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Data</a>'s room in "The Next Generation", and had originally been built as Kirk's quarters for "" in 1979. The transporter room set was also reused from "The Next Generation", with alterations that included the addition of a glowing pattern along the transporter's walls inspired by one of Zimmerman's sweaters; the set had previously been used on "The Final Frontier". The galley was the set used for <a href="Deanna%20Troi">Deanna Troi</a>'s office, the dining hall was a redress of the <a href="USS%20Enterprise-D">USS Enterprise-D</a>'s Observation lounge, and the Federation president's office was a redesign of the Ten-Forward lounge, the exterior doors to which accidentally retained their "Enterprise"-D markings. Alien costumes in the Rura Penthe prison were reused from "The Next Generation"s premiere episode, "<a href="Encounter%20at%20Farpoint">Encounter at Farpoint</a>". The "Excelsior" bridge was a redress of "Enterprise"s command center, with consoles taken from the <a href="battle%20bridge">battle bridge</a> of the "Enterprise"-D to convey the impression that the "Excelsior" was a more advanced ship.

Meyer had never been happy with the brightly lit corridors and feel of the "Enterprise", a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on "The Wrath of Khan". For "The Undiscovered Country", Meyer wanted the "Enterprise" interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used without looking beat up. Narita's plans to transform the look of the "Enterprise" on a scale not seen since "The Wrath of Khan" were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.

The corridors were reduced in width and included angled bulkhead dividers, with exposed conduits added to the ceiling to convey a claustrophobic feel reminiscent of the submarine film "<a href="The%20Hunt%20for%20Red%20October%20%28film%29">The Hunt for Red October</a>". Narita changed the bright, smooth look of the "Enterprise" bridge that had been created by Zimmerman for "The Final Frontier" by lighting the set as spottily as possible. "I didn't want to use too much smoke on the "Enterprise", because I didn't want it to end up looking too much like the Klingon starship. For that reason I decided to keep the look of the "Enterprise" pretty clean, but with a little more contrasty lighting," Narita said. Meyer acknowledged that had he been the creator of the franchise, "I would have probably designed a much more claustrophobic world because it's much more dramatic."

The director was insistent that <a href="LCARS">panel labels</a> contain descriptive instructions that might be found on a starship, rather than made-up gibberish, <a href="greeking">greeking</a>, or gag text. Designer <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael Okuda</a> had finished a schematic of the "Enterprise"s decks when Nimoy pointed out he had misspelled "reclamation"; while Okuda was fairly certain no one else would notice the single spelling error on the print, he had to fix it. Meyer also made a contentious decision to feature a kitchen in the film, a move that attracted fan controversy. Although the original series mentioned a <a href="galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a> in the episode "<a href="Charlie%20X">Charlie X</a>", only machines able to synthesize food had been shown before.

Paramount made a decision early on to use existing ship models for filming, meaning the old models—some more than a decade old—had to be refurbished, adapted, and reused. As some ships had not been examined for some time, electrical problems had developed. The Klingon cruiser first seen in 1979's "The Motion Picture" was altered to suggest an important flagship, with a flared design applied to the underside of the vessel. Effects supervisor William George wanted to make it distinct from the earlier ships, since it was one of the few models that could be altered: "We did some research into military costuming, and came up with the concept that when these ships return victorious from battle, the Klingons build some sort of epaulet onto their wings or paint a new stripe on." The model was repainted brown and red and etched with brass.

Despite representing a new vessel, the "Enterprise"-A was the same model that had been used since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the "Enterprise"s hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in "The Voyage Home", where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. The cement instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.

<a href="Greg%20Jein">Greg Jein</a>, best known as the builder of the alien mothership from "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>", was called on to build props for the film. Jein was a longtime "Star Trek" fan who had constructed the props for "The Final Frontier", but was forced to remake props that had since mysteriously disappeared. Jein added references to the original television series and other science fiction franchises throughout the prop designs; the Rura Penthe warden's staff contained parts of a spaceship from "<a href="Buck%20Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>", while the frong was detailed with a prop from "<a href="Buckaroo%20Banzai">Buckaroo Banzai</a>". Elements from "The Final Frontier" were modified and reused; a medical implement from the film became Chekov's blood tester, and the assault phasers first seen in "The Final Frontier" became standard issue. Gorkon's staff was intended to be a massive bone from an alien creature he had killed, with the designs shaped out of green foam and approved by Meyer. Two copies were strong enough to support David Warner's weight; another two were designed to be light enough to be hung from wires for the <a href="Weightlessness">zero gravity</a> scenes. Since the Klingon phasers were redesigned for the third film, the original holsters no longer fit the weaponry; as a result, no Klingons had ever been seen drawing a phaser. Meyer was adamant about having the actors be able to unholster their weapons, so the existing pistols had to be redesigned. The Klingon sniper rifle was broken into sections, with parts modeled from real weapons.

The Klingons received the first major revision in design since their appearance in "The Motion Picture". Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged that it would be unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's "The Motion Picture" uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.
The main reason for the diversity of Klingon designs, hairstyles, and appliances stemmed from the fact that there were more Klingons featured than in all the previous films combined. Eighteen unique designs were used for the main characters, with another thirty "A" makeups, forty "B" foam latex makeups, and fifty polyurethane plastic masks for background extras. Makeup artist <a href="Richard%20Snell%20%28make-up%20artist%29">Richard Snell</a> was in charge of the principal Klingon actors' appliances. The designs for the foreheads came from Snell's own ideas and co-workers, but the actors were also allowed input into their character's appearances. Christopher Plummer requested his character's forehead have more subdued spinal ridges than Klingons in previous films, to look unique and to humanize his character. During makeup tests, Snell was about to apply Plummer's wig when the actor muttered that he wanted no wig, with Chang's small amount of hair swept back into a warrior's topknot.

Snell worked through several nights to redesign the back of Chang's head and add more detail. This design change meant only Plummer's front could be photographed during the first few days of filming while the makeup department created appliances to cover the back of his head. Azetbur, portrayed by <a href="Rosanna%20DeSoto">Rosanna DeSoto</a>, was initially conceived as barbaric, but Meyer insisted on a more refined look. Like Plummer, DeSoto requested more subdued ridges, and the result was, according to artist Kenny Myers, a "very regal woman who just happened to be Klingon".

The design changes forced Kenny Myers to abdicate his other makeup job, that of Warner's Gorkon, to Margaret Bessera. Gorkon's appearance was of special concern to Meyer, who had two specific role models: Ahab and Abraham Lincoln. "[Meyer] loves to play the classics," Kenny Myers explained, "and incorporating these two images was really genius on his part. He wanted there to be uncertainty about Gorkon's true intentions. Did he want peace, or was there something sinister in his mind? From his appearance, it was impossible to tell if he was friend or foe. Subliminally, there were aspects of both."

Along with Klingon cosmetics, makeup supervisor <a href="Michael%20J.%20Mills">Michael J. Mills</a> was kept busy preparing the large number of other aliens called for in the script. Mills and his team created the largest makeup endeavor ever seen in a "Star Trek" film until then; custom makeup was applied to 22 principal actors, and as many as 126 prosthetic makeups each day. Because the alien creatures played such an important role in the film, there was a concerted push to provide enough money to the makeup department to make sure the complex work was finished. According to Mills, "[if] we could prove to [Ralph Winter] that we needed something to get the shot done, then we'd have it." The makeup lab employed a staff of 25 and produced over 300 prosthetics, from Klingon foreheads to Vulcan and Romulan ears. Work on the many extras began as early as one o'clock in the morning to be ready for the eight o'clock call.

The large, hulking form the shapeshifter Martia assumes while on the surface of Rura Penthe was dubbed "The Brute" by the production team. The creature's Yeti-like appearance was based on a "<a href="Smithsonian%20%28magazine%29">Smithsonian</a>" cover of a <a href="marmoset">marmoset</a>. Also created for the Rura Penthe shoot was a frozen Klingon with a horrified expression. Makeup artist <a href="Ed%20French%20%28make-up%20artist%29">Ed French</a> found a spare Klingon headpiece in Richard Snell's possession and attached it to his own head. A cast of his tortured expression was used as the foundation for the dummy used on location. The designers used striking colors and new techniques for some of the aliens; ultraviolet pigments were used to create a particularly hostile alien that fights Kirk in Rura Penthe.

As it was intended to be Nimoy's last portrayal of Spock, the actor was adamant that his appearance be faithful to the original 1960s Fred Phillips and Charlie Schram design of the character. Mills consulted photos from the original television series as reference, and created five ear sculptings before Nimoy was satisfied. The result was tall ears with the tips pointing forward—considerably different from Richard Snell's swept-back look for "The Voyage Home". The character of Valeris was designed to be more ivory-hued than Spock's yellow tone, with sleeker eyebrows and a severe haircut favored by Meyer. "We went to great pains to establish that this is the way a Vulcan woman—a sexy Vulcan woman—would look," said Mills.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took place between April 16, 1991 and September 27, 1991, using a mix of fixed sets and on-location footage. The production suffered from a lack of available set space because of shortages; the Starfleet Headquarters set was actually built a few blocks away from Paramount Pictures at the Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Meyer copied a technique used during filming of "<a href="Citizen%20Kane">Citizen Kane</a>", where the filmmakers let the set fall into darkness to save money on construction. The film was shot in <a href="Super%2035">Super 35</a> instead of <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic format</a>, because of the former's greater flexibility in framing and lens selection, larger depth of field, and faster lenses.

Because of budget cuts, plans for filming were constantly revised and reduced, but sometimes this proved to be an asset rather than a hindrance. Meyer would often say that "art thrives on restrictions", and Zimmerman agreed, saying that the design and filming created a rich environment that supported and enhanced the action.

The dinner scene was shot in a revamped version of the "Enterprise"-D's observation lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father <a href="Sarek">Sarek</a> (<a href="Mark%20Lenard">Mark Lenard</a>), and an unnamed <a href="Andorian">Andorian</a> ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), and it became a running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.

Because of the multiple angles and takes required for a single mouthful of food, Meyer offered a bounty of $20 per every shot of a character eating. For Shatner, the incentive was enough that he became the only cast member to consume purple-dyed squid. The shoot lasted several days because of what Plummer called the "horror" of filming the dinner.

The Klingon courtroom where Kirk and McCoy are sentenced was designed like an arena, with high walls and a central platform for the accused. Originally planned for construction on the largest soundstage, cutbacks in location footage for Rura Penthe forced a smaller set to be constructed. Sixty-six Klingons were used for the scene, with six actors in custom makeups and an additional fifteen in "A-level" makeup; the high quality designs were used for the Klingons in the first row of the stands, while those actors to the rear used masks.

The illusion of endless rows of Klingons was created by brightly lighting the accused in the center of the room with a bright blue light, then letting the rest of the set fall into shadow. To give the set a larger appearance, a shot from high above the courtroom was created using <a href="miniature%20effect">miniatures</a>. Inspired by a scene in "<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281959%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>", matte supervisor Craig Barron used two hundred commercially available <a href="Worf">Worf</a> dolls sent by Ralph Winter. Angry Klingons were created by rocking the dolls back and forth with motors, waving sticks lit by twelve-volt light bulbs dyed red. The resulting courtroom miniature was ten feet long.
Flinn conceived the penal colony Rura Penthe as on an arid, undeveloped world with odorous aliens; Meyer suggested that it be turned into an ice world instead. The exterior shots of Martia, Kirk, and McCoy traveling across the frozen wastes were filmed on top of a glacier in Alaska, forty minutes east of <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage</a>. Because of budget and time constraints, the <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> was tasked with getting the footage. The location was accessible only by helicopter, and was scouted months before filming began.

The main problem the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the temperatures peaked at around −22 °F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to −50°. The stuntmen, dressed in woolen costumes, were in danger of catching pneumonia. Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had to do the best they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.

Scenes featuring the main characters at Rura Penthe were filmed on a soundstage. Massive fans blew dusty fake snow that, according to Shatner, got into "every orifice", as well as into the camera. Creating a fake blizzard was challenging; two types of plastic snow were mixed together to provide flakes and powdery accumulation. Camera magazines were changed off the stage so that there was no chance the snow could get into the film; crewmembers found the snow in their socks for weeks afterwards.

The underground prison was shot in real caves left by mining at <a href="Griffith%20Park">Griffith Park</a>, in the <a href="Bronson%20Canyon">Bronson Canyon</a>, previously used as the <a href="Batcave">Batcave</a> and in the <a href="Flash%20Gordon%20%28serial%29">1930s "Flash Gordon" serial</a>. Shots of the interior of the mine were captured at night so it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared to be part of the set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being cranked in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of <a href="judo">judo</a> and <a href="karate">karate</a>.

The battle above Khitomer was one of the last sequences to be shot, which proved fortuitous as the bridge of the "Enterprise" was damaged by the simulated sparks and explosions. The officer's mess set was blown up for a sequence where the "Enterprise"s hull is compromised by a torpedo. When the set was rebuilt for use on "The Next Generation", the forward wall was rebuilt and redesigned. While the Khitomer conference interior and exteriors were filmed at the <a href="Brandeis-Bardin%20Institute">Brandeis-Bardin Institute</a> in California, the window from which Colonel West prepares to assassinate the president was a separate set built at Paramount. Footage from Brandeis, matte paintings, and the backlot were combined to create an open outdoor view.

The division of labor for shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was an equal amount of work if one crew did all the "Enterprise" shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and "Excelsior" shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by <a href="Filter%20%28optics%29">filtration</a> in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.

Using a technique pioneered on "<a href="Back%20to%20the%20Future%20Part%20II">Back to the Future Part II</a>", another shot with a different lighting scheme was filmed. By combining separate <a href="key%20light">key light</a> and <a href="fill%20light">fill light</a> passes, optical effects could generate any amount of contrast they wanted without causing spillage. Because Paramount continued to add new shots to the busy schedule and tight budget, some elements were flipped for reuse, including the star fields and a shot of the Bird of Prey firing. Whenever possible, the ships were filmed from below to reinforce the nautical theme, with their movements intended to remind the audience of galleons or other large seafaring vessels.

The approach to <a href="Earth%20Spacedock">Spacedock</a> was filmed from below the station model, which Bill George found visually interesting and appropriate. He felt that the tracking of a shuttle from the planet evoked "". The shuttle used in the scene was the only new model created for the film. It measured twelve inches and was fabricated in less than a week. The shot of the "Enterprise" leaving Spacedock was difficult to produce because the interior dock miniature had disappeared. Stock footage from "The Voyage Home" was used for one shot to compensate. Since the only other shot needed was the "Enterprise"s point of view leaving Spacedock through the doors, it was the only section recreated for the film.

The last scene in the film was arranged for the last day of filming. Initially, the language was supposed to be more somber and classical, but Meyer made some last minute changes. Flinn said that Meyer "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote "<a href="Peter%20Pan">Peter Pan</a>" for the last lines: "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, there was a sense of irritation. We raised a glass of champagne, but everybody was actually a little antsy."

The majority of the <a href="visual%20effects">visual effects</a> were created by <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> (ILM) under the supervision of Scott Farrar (who served as visual effects cameraman on the first three "Star Trek" films) and animator <a href="Wes%20Takahashi">Wes Takahashi</a>. After receiving the script, ILM created storyboards for the effects sequences before meeting Meyer and producers Winter and Steven-Charles Jaffe to discuss the planned scenes. These discussions began before the film was greenlit. ILM's initial cost estimates were over Paramount's budget, so to save money the filmmakers redesigned some shots and outsourced some to other companies.

Elements of the zero gravity scenes were handled by <a href="Pacific%20Data%20Images">Pacific Data Images</a>, while phaser beams and transporter effects were generated by <a href="Visual%20Concept%20Engineering">Visual Concept Engineering</a>, an offshoot of ILM that had contributed to "The Wrath of Khan" and "The Final Frontier". Despite the overall count of effects shots being dropped from over 100 to 51, the project was still large, and required virtually the entire ILM staff to complete. Farrar's goal was to economize the remaining effects; if three shots were similar, they would try to tell the story with only one. Cheap <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Animatic">animatics</a> provided Meyer with placeholders to cut into the film and avoid costly surprises. Stock footage from previous films were used whenever possible, but it was often unfeasible to do so; as the original USS "Enterprise" had been destroyed in "", all shots of the USS "Enterprise"-A had to feature the updated ship registry.

ILM's <a href="computer%20generated%20imagery">computer graphics</a> division was responsible for creating three sequences, including the explosion of Praxis. Meyer's idea for the effect was influenced by "<a href="The%20Poseidon%20Adventure%20%281972%20film%29">The Poseidon Adventure</a>"; Farrar used imagery of an immense wave hitting the "Poseidon" to inform the scale of their shock wave. The department built on a <a href="lens%20flare">lens flare</a> simulation to create a plasma burst composed of two expanding disc shapes with swirling detail <a href="texture%20mapping">texture mapped</a> to the surface.

Farrar settled on the preliminary look of the wave, and graphics supervisor Jay Riddle used <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a> on a <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> to establish the final color scheme. Initially the team thought they would be able to use the same methods to create the wave that hits the "Excelsior", but found that it did not convey the scale of the wave—in Riddle's words, "this thing had to look really enormous." The shot was created by manipulating two curved pieces of computer geometry, expanding them as they approached the camera's view. Textures that changed every frame were added to the main wave body and over the top of it to give the impression of great speed. Motion control footage of the "Excelsior" was then scanned into the computer system and made to interact with the digital wave. ILM's "<a href="Praxis%20effect">Praxis effect</a>" shockwave became a common feature in science fiction films depicting the destruction of large objects.

Meyer came upon the idea of having assassins in special boots kill a weightless Gorkon after searching for a novel way to "blow away" the character in space that had not been seen before. The final sequence married physical effects and stuntwork with computer graphics. Responsibility for shooting the live action footage fell to the second unit under Jaffe's direction. While the sequence read well on paper, there was not enough time or money to do the effects "the right way"—for example, shooting the actors on a bluescreen and then inserting them into the Klingon corridors.

Jaffe noted that the low-tech method of suspending actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires had to be removed digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors up and down on the rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on <a href="gimbal">gimbal</a>s so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.
The blood that spurts out of the Klingon's wounds was created using computer generated imagery; the animators had to make sure that the blood floated in a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at <a href="NASA">NASA</a> footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.

The final color was violet, a color Meyer disliked but had to go ahead with, because his first choice—red—would almost certainly earn the film an "R" rating from the <a href="MPAA">MPAA</a>. The initial killing of the Klingon in the transporter room as the assassins beam aboard was the testing ground for tweaking the color of the blood and how it would move around the room. Most of the blood droplets were "blobbies", groups of spheres smoothed together by computer, creating a continuous shape. The further apart the spheres, the more the shape could stretch and even break apart. The phasers used in the scene and throughout the film were redesigned versions of earlier models and were first used in "The Final Frontier". The props featured blue lights that turned on when the trigger was pressed, so effects artists knew when to add the phaser beam effects.

For the zero gravity sequences, the ILM team matched Visual Concepts Engineering's phaser blasts by hand-painting the effect in Photoshop. ILM also did minor touchup to the scenes as required, adding clothing tears where the phaser blasts hit the actors and adding the hazy Klingon atmosphere to the computer-rendered objects. These zero gravity scenes were the most expensive sequences to complete.

Rura Penthe was created with a mixture of on-set and location shots, along with an establishing sequence created by <a href="Matte%20World%20Digital">Matte World</a>. The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on fiberfill clouds with lights behind them to create a lightning storm underway in the background.

Martia was not the first shapeshifter on "Star Trek", but the character was the first to be created using computer-generated digital <a href="morphing">morphing</a> technology. The effects, dubbed "morfs", were more advanced revisions of the technology used for films such as "". Animator John Berton attempted new, more complicated morfs, including moving the camera and morphing two characters talking; special care had to be taken to line up the characters properly in plate photography. Martia becomes Kirk while talking, requiring similar line deliveries from Iman and Shatner; Farrar supervised the set photography for the morfs and had the actors speak their lines in sync via a loudspeaker.

Kirk's fight scene with Martia in the form of Kirk was mostly filmed with a double dressed in similar clothes; in the majority of the shots the camera allowed only one of the combatants' faces to be seen. When Kirk talked with his double directly, two separate takes of Shatner facing opposite directions were combined, with the camera motion carefully controlled so that the resulting image looked realistic.

For the final space battle, Bill George redesigned the photon torpedoes to have a hotter core and larger flare, because he felt that the weapons in earlier films looked "too pretty". The torpedoes also moved like guided missiles rather than cannonballs. George told Farrar that he had always wanted to see something penetrate the thin saucer section of the "Enterprise", so a replica of the saucer was recreated and blown up; the model was hung upside down so that the explosion could be flipped to approximate the zero gravity effects. Rather than destroy the Bird of Prey model in the climax, pyrotechnic footage was reduced and placed in the appropriate locations to simulate rippling explosions throughout the vessel.

A special "pyro model" was created from a rubber cast of the Bird of Prey and exploded instead, with a lap dissolve making the transition from the motion control ship to the pyro vessel. ILM knew that there was already footage of Chang reacting to the torpedo hit, but knew Meyer was unhappy with the result. Using footage of Plummer as reference, the effects team created a dummy that was detonated in the same position. Steve Jaffe said, "[Editor] Ron Roose and I pored through the footage to find what amounted to three usable frames that we could use to tell the audience 'we got him!

Meyer's original plan for the score was to adapt <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>'s orchestral suite "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>". The plan proved unfeasibly expensive, so Meyer began listening to demo tapes submitted by composers. Meyer described most of the demos as generic "movie music", but was intrigued by one tape by a young composer named <a href="Cliff%20Eidelman">Cliff Eidelman</a>. Eidelman, then 26, had made a career in composing for ballets, television, and film, but despite work on fourteen features, no film had been the hit needed to propel Eidelman to greater fame.

In conversations with Eidelman, Meyer mentioned that since the marches that accompanied the main titles for the previous "Star Trek" films were so good, he had no desire to compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt that since the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Firebird">The Firebird</a>" as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of <a href="Bernard%20Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.

Eidelman's previous project had been creating a compilation of music from the past five "Star Trek" films, and he consciously avoided taking inspiration from those scores. "[The compilation] showed me what to stay away from, because I couldn't do <a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a> [composer for "The Wrath of Khan" and "The Search for Spock"] as well as James Horner," he said. Since he was hired early on in production, Eidelman had an unusually long time to develop his ideas, and he was able to visit the sets during filming. While the film was in early production Eidelman worked on electronic drafts of the final score, to placate executives who were unsure about using a relatively unknown composer.

Eidelman stated that he finds science fiction the most interesting and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old "Star Trek" themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for "<a href="to%20be%2C%20or%20not%20to%20be">to be, or not to be</a>" (""taH pagh, taHbe"") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme was designed to be an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the "Enterprise", aimed at capturing "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.

The soundtrack was released on December 10, 1991 through <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> and features thirteen tracks of score with a running time of forty-five minutes. In 2005, a bootleg copy of the soundtrack also surfaced with thirty-six tracks of score and a running time of nearly seventy minutes. <a href="Intrada%20Records">Intrada Records</a> released a two-disc set in 2012. The first disc is made up of the complete score and four extra cues. The second disc contains the material from the original MCA release.

"The Undiscovered Country"s <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> allegory and references to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, "The Undiscovered Country" has more references to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> than any other "Star Trek" work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", <a href="To%20be%2C%20or%20not%20to%20be">Act III, Scene 1</a>. Meyer had originally intended "The Wrath of Khan" to be called "The Undiscovered Country". Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in "Hamlet" (and its intended meaning in "The Wrath of Khan") is death, "Star Trek VI"s use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.

A phrase from "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%28play%29">The Tempest</a>" is mentioned by Gorkon as representing the new galactic order, that of a "brave new world". Chang recites most of the lines from Shakespeare used in the film, including quotes from "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>" and "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">Henry IV, Part 2</a>" in his parting words to Kirk after dinner. During Kirk's trial, Chang also mocks Kirk with lines from "<a href="Richard%20II%20%28play%29">Richard II</a>". The final battle above Khitomer contains seven references to five of Shakespeare's plays. Two references are drawn from the title character's lines in "<a href="King%20Henry%20V">King Henry V</a>" ("Once more unto the breach"/"The game's afoot"), while two more quotations are from "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>" ("I am as constant as the <a href="North%20Star">Northern Star</a>"/"Cry 'havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war"). There is a single reference to Prospero from "The Tempest" ("Our revels now are ended"), and Chang shortens the wronged <a href="Shylock">Shylock</a>'s speech from "<a href="The%20Merchant%20of%20Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a>": "Tickle us, do we not laugh; prick us, do we not bleed; and wrong us, shall we not revenge?"

The final lines spoken by Chang before he is obliterated by torpedo fire are lifted from Hamlet's famous soliloquy: "to be, or not to be..." Flinn was initially unsure about the numerous classical quotations, but when Plummer was cast, Meyer enthusiastically added more. He said, "Whether it's pretentious or not, I think it depends on how it's used. [...] I don't quite agree with using too much of that sort of thing, but once you get Plummer, suddenly it's working."

Scholars have noted that the Klingons, not humans, are the ones who quote Shakespeare; Gorkon claims at one point in the film that "You have not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon." Translating Shakespeare into <a href="Klingon%20language">Klingon</a> proved problematic because <a href="Marc%20Okrand">Marc Okrand</a> had not created a verb for "<a href="to%20be">to be</a>" when he developed the language. Shakespeare scholar Paul A. Cantor argues that this association is appropriate—the warlike Klingons find their literary matches in the characters <a href="Othello">Othello</a>, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, and <a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>—but that it also reinforces a claim that the end of the Cold War means the end of heroic literature such as Shakespeare's. Meyer said the idea for having the Klingons claim Shakespeare as their own was based on Nazi Germany's attempt to claim <a href="William%20Shakespeare">the Bard</a> as German before World War II. According to Kay Smith, the use of Shakespeare has meaning in itself and also derives new meaning (underscoring cultural politics in the film) by its rearticulation in a new form.

The association of General Chang with the politics of the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> that involved attempted appeasement of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> are brought up twice in the film. The first is with Chang with other Klingon officials at a dinner with Kirk and Federation officers, where Chang declares that the Klingon Empire needs "<a href="Lebensraum">breathing room</a>", to which Kirk responds by imitating Spock's earlier quoting of Hamlet, saying that Chang's reference is "Earth, Hitler, 1938". Later when Kirk confronts Chang's warship, Chang mocks the historic British Prime Minister <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> who attempted to appease Hitler; with Chang saying that there will be "no <a href="peace%20for%20our%20time">peace in our time</a>".

A major theme of the film is change, and people's response to that change. Meyer considered Valeris and Chang "frightened people, who are frightened of change", who cling to old ways despite the changing world. He hoped that the fictionalization of a current events story allowed for an objective look at the issues, rather than being blinded by personal bias. At the beginning of the film, Kirk operates under a similar bias, calling the Klingons "animals" and putting him at odds with Spock. The Vulcan sees the Gorkon peace initiative as logical, responding to the sudden change in the "status quo" in a collected manner; he even opens the peace dialog at the behest of <a href="Sarek">his father</a>.

Kirk, meanwhile, is willing to "let them (the Klingons) die", unwilling to listen to Spock's words because of his biased understanding. Kirk undergoes a transformation through the film by way of his incarceration; realizing that his hatred is outmoded he allows for a cleansing that restores his son to him in some way.

While "Star Trek" in general features few overt references to religion, there is a clear recognition that a laying aside of past hurts is necessary for peace, similar to the concept of "<a href="shalom">shalom</a>" in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.

"The Undiscovered Country" was released in North America on December 6, 1991. The film was initially planned for release a week later on December 13. To promote the film and the 25th anniversary of "Star Trek", Paramount held marathon screenings of the previous five films in 44 select U.S. and Canadian cities. The 12-hour showings also included footage of "The Undiscovered Country". The day before the film's release, the core cast was inducted into <a href="Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a>, and signed their names on <a href="Hollywood%20Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>. Nimoy, who had earlier requested $1 million to cameo on "The Next Generation", appeared in the two-part episode "" that aired during November 1991 to increase interest in the feature film. The previous five films were released in collectors' box sets with new packaging; retailers were offered the chance to photograph their retail setups for a chance to win an expenses-paid tour of "The Next Generation"s set and tickets to an advance screening of "The Undiscovered Country".

Roddenberry did not live to see the film's release, dying of heart failure on October 24, 1991. Before the film's release he viewed a near-final version of "The Undiscovered Country", and according to the film's producer and Kelley's biographer, approved a final version of the film. In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused, and within 48 hours he was dead. Paramount considered spending close to $240,000 to send Roddenberry's ashes into space—a move that had the backing of fans—but decided against it; his remains would make it into space along with 22 others in 1997. The film's opening included a note to Roddenberry's memory; at early showings, the crowds of "Star Trek" fans applauded loudly. While the producers had begun work on the film anticipating it as the last film, by the premiere it was obvious the film would make money and that a "Star Trek VII" would soon be in the works. The cast was split on the possibility of a sequel; Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley said that the film would be their last, while the supporting cast strongly lobbied for another film. The consensus was for the next film to star the cast of "The Next Generation". The seventh "Star Trek" feature, "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Generations">Star Trek Generations</a>" (1994), would blend the old and new cast.

"The Undiscovered Country" opened in 1,804 theaters in North America and grossed $18,162,837 in its opening weekend; the showing was a record for the film series and was the top-grossing film of the weekend. The film grossed $74,888,996 in North America, for a total of $96,888,996 worldwide. "The Undiscovered Country"s strong showing was one of the big successes of 1991, a year in which the film industry experienced disappointing box office results overall. The film was nominated in the Sound effects editing and Makeup categories at the <a href="64th%20Academy%20Awards">64th Academy Awards</a>. The film also won a <a href="Saturn%20Award">Saturn Award</a> for best science fiction film, making it the only "Star Trek" film to win the award. The film's novelization by <a href="Jeanne%20Kalogridis">J.M. Dillard</a> was also a commercial success, reaching the "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" mass market paperback bestsellers list.

"The Undiscovered Country" received a much kinder reception from reviewers and audiences than "The Final Frontier". Critics approved of the blend of humor and adventure in the film. Review aggregator <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reported that 83% of critics have given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 52, with an <a href="weighted%20mean">average</a> score of 6.8/10.

The "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" reported that "those who found "" weighed down by emotional gravity and over-the-top spiritualism [welcomed] the follow-up with its suspense, action and subtle good humor." The dialogue and banter was considered a positive and defining aspect of the film. <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said that ""Star Trek VI" is definitely colorful, but even more of its color comes from conversation, which can take some amusingly florid turns." Critic Hal Hinson commented that Meyer "[is] capable of sending up his material without cheapening it or disrupting our belief in the reality of his yarn," and called the one-liners an organic part of the film's "jocular, tongue-in-cheek spirit". Susan Wloszczyna of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" said that with Meyer directing, "this last mission gets almost everything right—from the nod to late creator Gene Roddenberry to in-jokes about Kirk's rep as an alien babe magnet."

The acting of the main cast was conflictingly received. Lloyd Miller of the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" said the characters "return to their original roles with a vigor and wit unseen in earlier episodes of the film series". Rob Salem of "<a href="The%20Toronto%20Star">The Toronto Star</a>" quipped that though the actors looked silly on occasion, this was a benefit; "as their capacity for action has diminished, their comedic talents have blossomed [...] they have all become masters of self-deprecating self-parody." "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>"s Matthew Gilbert called the actors' performances "photocopies" of previous films: "Shatner and Nimoy are respectable, but lack energy. There's nowhere else to go with their roles, and they know it. DeForest Kelley is oddly out of it." Plummer and Warner's portrayals of their Klingon characters were well-received; Maslin commented that "whenever a skilled actor [...] manages to emerge from behind all this [makeup] with his personality intact, it's a notable accomplishment." The other supporting characters received similar praise; H.J. Kirchhoff, writing for "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>", said that the guest stars joined the "family fun" of the film as "zesty, exotic and colorful good guys and bad guys". A "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" retrospective review considered the film to have the finest guest stars ever assembled for a "Star Trek" film.

The Cold War allegory and the <a href="whodunit">whodunit</a> aspects of the film were less positively received. Mary Boson of the "Sydney Morning Herald" considered the comparisons to real-world situations timely, and praised the plot for exploring the reactions of those who have invested themselves in a life of belligerence. David Sterritt of "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" felt that the film veered away from the intriguing Cold War allegory premise to unsatisfying results. Instead of maintaining suspense, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>"s Gary Arnold noted the Rura Penthe sideplot offered "scenic distraction without contributing significantly to the whodunit crisis [...] The crime itself has a promising 'closed-room' aspect that never gets elaborated adequately [...] You look forward to a cleverly fabricated solution." Arnold felt that instead of developing this mystery, the filmmakers defused the potential for suspense by shifting away from the search of the "Enterprise". Brian Lowry of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" felt Rura Penthe dragged down the film's pace, and that Meyer paid so much attention to one-liners that there was a lack of tension in the film, a complaint echoed by John Hartl of the "<a href="Seattle%20Times">Seattle Times</a>".

The special effects were alternately lauded and criticized; "USA Today" called them "just serviceable", though Wloszczyna's review for the paper said the Klingon assassination sequence was "dazzling", with "fuchsia blood spilling out in <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Dalí</a>-esque blobs". Desson Howe, writing for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s Weekend section, said that "the Klingons' spilled blood floats in the air in eerily beautiful purplish globules; it's space-age <a href="Sam%20Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>." Maslin considered some effects garish, but appreciated the filmmakers' tirelessness "in trying to make their otherworldly characters look strange".

"The Undiscovered Country" was released on VHS and in widescreen and <a href="pan%20and%20scan">full screen</a> formats on <a href="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a> in June 1992; the release added a few minutes of new footage to the film. Because of a trend in supermarket video sales and rentals, Paramount offered rebates for the home video release of "The Undiscovered Country" through boxes of <a href="Kellogg%20Company">Kellogg's</a> <a href="Frosted%20Mini-Wheats">Frosted Mini-Wheats</a>. The Laserdisc version of the film was the tenth highest-selling video during 1992. The home video cut was later released for the film's 1999 DVD debut.

As with the other nine "Star Trek" films, "The Undiscovered Country" was re-released on DVD as a Special Edition in 2004. Meyer, who stated he dislikes <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a>s, nevertheless found "a couple of moments that I thought were not clear", and re-edited them as "I suddenly saw how to make them clear." Among the elements added for home video were a briefing with the Federation president where Admiral Cartwright and Colonel West unveil their plan for rescuing Kirk and McCoy, and a scene where Spock and Scott inspect the torpedoes. Some shots were reordered or replaced, with wide-angle shots replacing close angles and vice versa. The special features included a <a href="Audio%20commentary">commentary track</a> with Meyer and Flinn, featurettes detailing the special effects, production, and historical inspiration of the film, and a tribute to actor DeForest Kelley.

The film's original theatrical cut was released on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> in May 2009 to coincide with the new "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" feature, along with the other five films featuring the original crew in "Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection". "The Undiscovered Country" was remastered in <a href="1080p">1080p</a> <a href="High-definition%20video">high-definition</a> from the 2000 DVD transfer. The film, like the others in the set, features 7.1 <a href="Dolby%20TrueHD">Dolby TrueHD</a> audio. The disc also contains a new commentary track by "Star Trek" screenwriters <a href="Larry%20Nemecek">Larry Nemecek</a> and <a href="Ira%20Steven%20Behr">Ira Steven Behr</a>.
