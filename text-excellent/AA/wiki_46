John J. Crittenden

John Jordan Crittenden (September 10, 1787July 26, 1863) was an American politician from the U.S. state of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He represented the state in both the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> and twice served as <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">United States Attorney General</a> in the administrations of <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> and <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>. He was also the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">17th</a> <a href="governor%20of%20Kentucky">governor of Kentucky</a> and served in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">state legislature</a>. Although frequently mentioned as a potential candidate for the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. presidency</a>, he never consented to run for the office.

During his early political career, Crittenden served in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> and was chosen as speaker on several occasions. With the advent of the <a href="Second%20Party%20System">Second Party System</a>, he allied with the <a href="National%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">National Republican</a> (later <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a>) Party and was a fervent supporter of <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> and opponent of <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> and <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>.

<a href="Lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">Lame duck</a> president <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> nominated Crittenden to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> on December 17, 1828 but Senators who supported <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">president-elect</a> Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Secretary of State</a>, the state legislature elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a>.

He was returned to the Senate in 1842, serving until 1848, when he resigned to run for governor, hoping his election would help <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> win Kentucky's vote in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201848">1848 presidential election</a>. Taylor was elected, but Crittenden refused a post in his cabinet, fearing he would be charged with making a "<a href="corrupt%20bargain">corrupt bargain</a>", as Clay had been in 1825. Following Taylor's death in 1850, Crittenden resigned the governorship and accepted <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>'s appointment as attorney general.

As the Whig Party crumbled in the mid-1850s, Crittenden joined the <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothing</a> (or American) Party. After the expiration of his term as attorney general, he was again elected to the U.S. Senate, where he urged compromise on the issue of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> to prevent the breakup of the United States. As bitter partisanship increased the threat of <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a>, Crittenden sought out moderates from all parties and formed the <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Union Party</a>, though he refused the party's nomination for president in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">1860 election</a>. In December 1860, he authored the <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a>, a series of resolutions and constitutional amendments he hoped would avert the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, but <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> would not approve them.

One of Crittenden's sons, <a href="George%20B.%20Crittenden">George B. Crittenden</a>, became a general in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate Army</a>. Another son, <a href="Thomas%20Leonidas%20Crittenden">Thomas Leonidas Crittenden</a>, became a general in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>. The elder Crittenden was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1861, and supported the Union. However, he criticized many of the policies of President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and the U.S. Congress, including the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and the <a href="West%20Virginia%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War%23Political%20events">admission of West Virginia</a> to the Union. He continued to work for reconciliation of the states throughout his time in office. He declared his candidacy for re-election to the House in 1863, but died before the election took place.

John Jordan Crittenden was born September 10, 1787, near <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles, Kentucky</a>. He was the second child and first son of <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> veteran Major <a href="John%20Crittenden%2C%20Sr.">John Crittenden</a> and his wife Judith Harris. John and Judith Crittenden had four sons and five daughters, all but one of whom survived infancy. On his father's side, he was of <a href="Wales">Welsh</a> ancestry, while his mother's family was French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>. His father had surveyed land in Kentucky with <a href="George%20Rogers%20Clark">George Rogers Clark</a>, and settled there just after the end of the American Revolution. Two of Crittenden's brothers, Thomas and <a href="Robert%20Crittenden">Robert</a>, became lawyers, while the third, Henry, was a farmer.

Crittenden began a college preparatory curriculum at Pisgah Academy in Woodford County. He was then sent to a <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> in <a href="Jessamine%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jessamine County</a>. Among his classmates were <a href="Thomas%20Alexander%20Marshall">Thomas Alexander Marshall</a> and <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis P. Blair</a>. Crittenden became especially close friends with Blair, and later political differences did little to diminish their friendship. After a year at boarding school, Crittenden moved to the <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, home of Judge <a href="George%20M.%20Bibb">George M. Bibb</a> to study law. He began more advanced studies at Washington College (now <a href="Washington%20and%20Lee%20University">Washington and Lee University</a>) in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Virginia">Lexington, Virginia</a>. During his brief tenure there, he studied mathematics and <a href="belles-lettres">belles-lettres</a> and became friends with <a href="Hugh%20Lawson%20White">Hugh Lawson White</a>. Dissatisfied with the curriculum at Washington College, Crittendon moved to <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a> and transferred to the <a href="The%20College%20of%20William%20%26amp%3B%20Mary">College of William and Mary</a>. He studied law under <a href="St.%20George%20Tucker">St. George Tucker</a> and became acquainted with future president <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a>.

On May 27, 1811, Crittenden married Sarah O. Lee at her home in Versailles. Lee was a cousin of future <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> and aunt of U.S. Senator <a href="Wilkinson%20Call">Wilkinson Call</a>. They had seven children before Sarah died in mid-September 1824. Among their children were <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">major general</a> <a href="George%20B.%20Crittenden">George Crittenden</a> and <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> <a href="General%20officer">general</a> <a href="Thomas%20Leonidas%20Crittenden">Thomas Leonidas Crittenden</a>. Their daughter Sallie Lee "Maria" Crittenden was the mother of <a href="John%20C.%20Watson">John C. Watson</a>, a <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> during the late 19th century.

Completing his studies in 1806, Crittenden was admitted to the <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> the following year. He began his practice in Woodford County, but found central Kentucky already well supplied with able lawyers. Critenden then moved to <a href="Logan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Logan County, Kentucky</a>, on the then western frontier and opened his practice in <a href="Russellville%2C%20Kentucky">Russellville</a>. At age twenty-two, moved across the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> to <a href="Illinois%20Territory">Illinois Territory</a>, and Governor <a href="Ninian%20Edwards">Ninian Edwards</a> appointed him its <a href="attorney%20general">attorney general</a>. The following year, Edwards also made Crittenden his <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>.

In addition to his legal practice when he returned to Kentucky, Crittenden also operated plantations and owned enslaved people. In 1830, his family of 12 free white persons included 6 enslaved people. In 1850, Crittenden owned 44 enslaved people (11 women above age 16, 7 men, 13 boys and 13 girls. In 1860, after distributing some property to his now-adult children, Crittenden owned ten enslaved people, all mulattos (females aged 60, 25, 21, 18 and 16 and males aged 28, 16, 14, 10 and 1 year).

Crittenden's career as an elected official began in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>, where he represented Logan County from 1811 to 1817. After the 1811 legislative session, he volunteered as an aide to General <a href="Samuel%20Hopkins%20%28congressman%29">Samuel Hopkins</a> in an expedition against the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indians</a>. On the outbreak of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, Kentucky governor <a href="Charles%20Scott%20%28governor%29">Charles Scott</a> appointed him as an aide-de-camp for the First Kentucky Militia. In 1813, he became an aide-de-camp to Governor <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>, serving at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Thames">Battle of the Thames</a> in Canada. Following the war, the governor issued him a special commendation for faithfulness in carrying out his orders. He then resumed his law practice in Russellville.

In 1814, Governor Shelby appointed Crittenden to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by his former teacher, George M. Bibb; later, however, Shelby learned that Crittenden was only twenty-seven years old, three years shy of the . Hence he returned to his seat in the Kentucky House, where was elected <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">speaker</a> over <a href="John%20Rowan%20%28Kentucky%29">John Rowan</a>. He would retain the position from 1815 to 1817.

As speaker, Crittenden presided over a particularly tumultuous time in the legislature. In October 1816, recently elected governor <a href="George%20Madison">George Madison</a> died. He was succeeded by <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Lieutenant Governor</a> <a href="Gabriel%20Slaughter">Gabriel Slaughter</a>. Slaughter immediately made two extremely unpopular appointments, and quickly fell out of favor with many Kentuckians. A group of legislators, led by John C. Breckinridge, pointed out that the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a> provided only that the lieutenant governor would serve as governor until a new gubernatorial election was held and a qualified successor was chosen. Slaughter, they claimed, was only the "acting governor". The group presented a bill to the House that called for new elections. The bill was defeated, but Crittenden supported it.

Crittenden's support of a new election was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of <a href="Martin%20D.%20Hardin">Martin D. Hardin</a>, one of Slaughter's unpopular nominees, expired in 1817, the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> chose Crittenden to fill the vacancy. Though he was the youngest member of the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Committee on the Judiciary</a>. He was also a member of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Naval Affairs</a>. During his term, he introduced legislation to <a href="Reimbursement">reimburse</a> and <a href="Indemnity">indemnify</a> persons who were fined under the 1798 <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Sedition Act</a>. He found state politics more interesting, however, and this fact, coupled with increased financial responsibilities incurred by the birth of his third and fourth children, prompted his decision to resign his seat on March 3, 1819.

After leaving Congress, Crittenden moved to <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>, the state capital, to attract more legal clients and be nearer to the center of the state's political activity. Among his clients after moving to Frankfort were former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Presidents</a> <a href="James%20Madison">Madison</a> and <a href="James%20Monroe">Monroe</a>, future Vice-President <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>, and future governors <a href="James%20Turner%20Morehead%20%28Kentucky%29">James T. Morehead</a>, <a href="John%20Breathitt">John Breathitt</a>, and <a href="Robert%20P.%20Letcher">Robert P. Letcher</a>. During this period, he collaborated with <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> in defending Charles Wickliffe, son of <a href="Robert%20C.%20Wickliffe">Robert C. Wickliffe</a>. Wickliffe was charged with the murder of the editor of the "<a href="Kentucky%20Gazette">Kentucky Gazette</a>". Crittenden argued that the slaying was <a href="right%20of%20self-defense">self-defense</a>, and Clay delivered a passionate closing argument. The jury returned a verdict of "not guilty" only minutes after the case was submitted to them.

In January 1820, Crittenden and John Rowan were chosen to help resolve <a href="Kennessee">Kentucky's boundary dispute with Tennessee</a>. The boundary was supposed to run along the line at 36 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude, but when Dr. <a href="Thomas%20Walker%20%28explorer%29">Thomas Walker</a> surveyed it, he erroneously marked the line farther south. Crittenden and Rowan proposed either that the "Walker Line" remain the boundary from the <a href="Cumberland%20Mountains">Cumberland Mountains</a> to the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> and Tennessee would compensate for the error west of the Tennessee River, or that the boundary be reset at 36 degrees, 30 minutes throughout. Tennessee's commissioners rejected both proposals, asking instead that the Walker Line be accepted east of the Tennessee River and a more southerly line west of it, with reciprocal agreements between the states to honor existing land grants. Crittenden was inclined to accept the offer, but Rowan was not. The Kentucky commissioners proposed that the matter be submitted to <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a>, but Tennessee refused. In a report to the General Assembly, Crittenden recommended that Kentucky accept the Tennessee proposal. The legislators were swayed by Crittenden's report, and the articles of agreement were signed on February 2, 1820.

Crittenden was elected to the board of trustees for <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a> in 1823, possibly due to lobbying by Henry Clay. A year later, the faculty of the university awarded him an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="doctor%20of%20law">doctor of law</a>s. Crittenden also served as a trustee and attorney for the Kentucky Seminary in Frankfort. Crittenden used his influence in support of Clay in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">1824 presidential election</a> until Clay was eliminated from contention. He then threw his support to <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> until he learned that <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, if elected, would likely make Clay <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. Critics termed Adams' alleged promise to Clay the "<a href="Corrupt%20Bargain%23Election%20of%201824">corrupt bargain</a>", but it resulted in Adams' election. Upon his appointment as Secretary of State, Clay was prepared to recommend Crittenden to replace him as chief counsel in Kentucky for the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a>, but the bank chose not to hire a replacement.

Crittenden was drawn back into public service by the <a href="Old%20Court%20%E2%80%93%20New%20Court%20controversy">Old Court – New Court controversy</a>. When legislation aimed at providing relief to the state's debtors was struck down by the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, supporters of the legislation in the General Assembly passed a bill abolishing the Court and creating a new court, which they stocked with sympathetic justices. Opponents of the legislation held that the Assembly's action was unconstitutional, and for a time, both courts claimed authority as the <a href="Supreme%20court">court of last resort</a> in the state. Though he had served as president of the New Court-backed Bank of the Commonwealth since its formation in 1820, Crittenden publicly identified himself with the Old Court supporters in April 1825. In the legislative election of 1825, friends called on Crittenden to seek election to the state House of Representatives. Many believed that he was the only Old Court supporter that commanded enough respect to win one of the two seats allotted to <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Franklin County</a>, a bastion of the New Court. When Crittenden consented to run, New Court supporters nominated the state's <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Attorney General</a> <a href="Solomon%20P.%20Sharp">Solomon P. Sharp</a> and Lewis Sanders, a prominent lawyer. Crittenden and Sharp were elected to the two seats.

In the early hours of the morning of November 7, 1825, the very morning the legislature was to convene, <a href="Beauchamp%E2%80%93Sharp%20Tragedy">Sharp was assassinated</a>. Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin <a href="Jereboam%20O.%20Beauchamp">Jereboam O. Beauchamp</a> was apprehended, it became clear that the motivation for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.

The court controversy dominated the legislative session. Crittenden joined the Old Court majority in the House in passing a measure to abolish the New Court. The bill was killed in the Senate, however, by the tie-breaking vote of Lieutenant Governor <a href="Robert%20B.%20McAfee">Robert B. McAfee</a>. Crittenden later served on a committee of six to resolve the conflict, but to no avail. He was unwilling to accept a solution whereby all the justices resigned from both courts, and the governor would appoint a reorganized court made up equally of Old Court and New Court supporters. This position cost him the support of some New Court partisans that had voted for him in the previous election, and he was not returned to the House in 1826. Ultimately, Old Court partisans gained control of both houses of the legislature, and the New Court was abolished permanently in December 1826.

On November 15, 1826, Crittenden married Maria Knox Todd, a widow who was the daughter of Judge <a href="Harry%20Innes">Harry Innes</a>. Crittenden took Todd's three children as his own, and the couple had two more children: John and Eugene. Todd's daughter Catherine married her <a href="stepfamily">stepbrother</a>, Crittenden's son Thomas; their son, <a href="John%20Jordan%20Crittenden%20III">John Jordan Crittenden III</a>, was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Little%20Bighorn">Battle of the Little Bighorn</a>. Maria Knox Todd Crittenden died on September 8, 1851 of an unknown illness.

As a result of the Old Court – New Court controversy, Kentucky's politicians became divided between the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> and the <a href="National%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">National Republicans</a>. Crittenden's alliance with Henry Clay and his own personal political views put him squarely in the National Republican Party. Because of Crittenden's support of his presidential bid, President Adams appointed him <a href="List%20of%20former%20United%20States%20district%20courts%23Kentucky">United States district attorney for the district of Kentucky</a> in 1827. In 1828, Adams nominated him to replace Kentuckian <a href="Robert%20Trimble">Robert Trimble</a> as an <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">associate justice of the Supreme Court</a>, but Jackson supporters in the Senate refused to confirm him. When Jackson defeated Adams in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828 presidential election</a>, he removed Crittenden from his post as district attorney because of his association with Clay and his opposition to Jackson's financial policies.

Crittenden supporters sought to make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828. Though his nomination was all but certain, Crittenden declined the opportunity, fearing that his association with Clay, who was losing popularity in the state, would cost his party the election. Instead, he threw his support behind <a href="Thomas%20Metcalfe%20%28US%20politician%29">Thomas Metcalfe</a>, who went on to carry a very close election over Democrat <a href="William%20T.%20Barry">William T. Barry</a>. Crittenden instead sought another term in the Kentucky House, but was again denied the seat.

In 1829, Crittenden was elected to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to nominate Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether he would be able to secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>, John Rowan, <a href="Charles%20A.%20Wickliffe">Charles A. Wickliffe</a>, and <a href="John%20Breathitt">John Breathitt</a>. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused to vote for himself because he wanted Clay to be the nominee. Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.

The following year, a clear majority of the House of Representatives were pledged to Crittenden for the open Senate seat. However, Clay allies pressured Crittenden to step aside and allow Clay to be the Whig nominee. Crittenden obliged, and Clay was elected by a margin of nine votes over Richard M. Johnson. Crittenden went on to manage both the unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign of <a href="Richard%20Aylett%20Buckner">Richard Aylett Buckner</a> and the campaign to help Clay win Kentucky in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">1832 presidential election</a>. After Clay's defeat in 1832, he offered to resign his Senate seat and allow Crittenden to succeed him, but Crittenden refused the offer. Later that year, Crittenden retired from the General Assembly.

Crittenden was active in organizing the Whig Party from the remnants of the defunct National Republican Party in 1834. On July 4, 1834, he called to order the party's first organizational meeting in the state at <a href="Cove%20Spring%2C%20Kentucky">Cove Spring, Kentucky</a>. He was chosen as chair of the committee on resolutions and in a speech on July 5, bitterly condemned President Jackson. Later in 1834, Kentucky governor <a href="James%20Turner%20Morehead%20%28Kentucky%29">James T. Morehead</a> appointed Crittenden <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Secretary of State</a>. In the August elections, Whigs won a majority in both houses of the General Assembly. When the Assembly convened, they elected Crittenden to the U.S. Senate over Democrat <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28American%20politician%29">James Guthrie</a> by a vote of 94–40.

Immediately upon taking his seat in the Senate, Crittenden was named to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Energy%20and%20Natural%20Resources">Committee on Public Lands</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Committee on the Judiciary</a>, probably due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28senator%29">Thomas H. Benton</a>'s proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the <a href="Specie%20Circular">Specie Circular</a>, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been <a href="Table%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29">tabled</a> by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a> to prevent it from becoming law.

During his term, Crittenden remained an outspoken critic of Jackson and his successor, <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>. He supported Henry Clay's plan for distributing proceeds from the sale of public lands among the states, and also joined Clay in opposing the administration-backed <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a>. One of the few administration proposals he supported was the recognition of the new <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>. During this period of Crittenden's service in the Senate, the issue of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> rose to prominence. Crittenden was regarded as a moderate on the issue, seeking to keep it out of politics altogether. In 1836, he resisted petitions by the <a href="Religious%20Society%20of%20Friends">Quakers</a> to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C., but he also opposed radical pro-slavery measures such as <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>'s proposal to ban abolitionist literature from being delivered by mail in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern states</a>.

In contrast to his usually conciliatory nature, Crittenden was drawn into a disagreement between congressmen <a href="Jonathan%20Cilley">Jonathan Cilley</a> and <a href="William%20J.%20Graves">William J. Graves</a> that ended in a <a href="duel">duel</a>. On the floor of the House, Cilley had attacked the integrity of Whig newspaper editor <a href="James%20Watson%20Webb">James Watson Webb</a>. Webb demanded a retraction of Cilley's comments through his friend, Congressman Graves. When Cilley refused to receive the communication from Graves, Graves charged that Cilley was questioning Webb's honor and challenged him to a duel. Graves, accompanied by Kentucky Congressman <a href="Richard%20Menefee">Richard Menefee</a> and Virginia Congressman <a href="Richard%20Wise">Richard Wise</a> asked Crittenden to serve as a second for Graves in the duel; Crittenden initially protested, but finally agreed. After two misses by both combatants, Cilley was killed on the third exchange. The House proposed the expulsion of Graves and the <a href="censure">censure</a> of the other participants (excluding Crittenden, who was a senator and not subject to House censure). The resolutions of expulsion and censure were eventually tabled, but Crittenden personally felt the sting of what he considered an indirect censure and later regretted his actions.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840 presidential election</a>, Crittenden again encouraged Kentucky Whigs to support the nomination of Henry Clay. After Clay lost the nomination, Crittenden supported eventual victor <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>. Crittenden was re-elected to the Senate in 1840 even though he was widely expected to be named to a position in Harrison's presidential cabinet. He was apparently given his choice of cabinet positions, and chose that of <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Attorney General</a>. He resigned his Senate seat to take this post.

As attorney general, Crittenden issued only one notable opinion. The plaintiff in the case was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of what would become the <a href="Florida%20Territory">Florida Territory</a> in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A <a href="Florida">Florida</a> court found in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Thomas%20Ewing">Thomas Ewing</a> asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a <a href="precedent">precedent</a> in similar cases by future attorneys general.

Only a week after being appointed by Harrison, Crittenden was dispatched to New York City to mediate tensions with Great Britain over the <a href="Caroline%20affair">sinking of the steamboat "Caroline"</a> by a group of <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> militia, who were attempting to suppress a rebellion in Canada. In this diplomatic endeavor, Crittenden was acting separately from his official duties as attorney general. He spoke with <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">New York Governor</a> <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a> and secured his promise to pardon <a href="Alexander%20McLeod">Alexander McLeod</a>, who had seized and burned the "Caroline", if he were convicted of a crime in New York. Ultimately, McLeod was acquitted.

Shortly after the "Caroline" affair, President Harrison died and Vice-President John Tyler ascended to the presidency. Tyler resisted Clay's attempts to set the Whig agenda, and vetoed two bank bills against Crittenden's advice. Crittenden and the other Whigs in Tyler's <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a>—excepting <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>—resigned in protest of Tyler's deviation from the traditional Whig agenda. Crittenden's resignation was effective September 11, 1841. He returned to Kentucky with no political office and very little money. A group of his friends in Woodford County purchased his boyhood home and presented it to him as a gift on his return to Kentucky.

Crittenden was appointed to the United States Senate in 1842, filling the vacancy caused by Clay's resignation. In January 1843, he was elected to a full term over <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>. The Whigs' feud with President Tyler continued unabated, and some even talked of <a href="impeachment">impeaching</a> him, but Crittenden condemned that course of action. During the <a href="27th%20United%20States%20Congress">27th</a> and <a href="28th%20United%20States%20Congress">28th</a> Congresses, he served on the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Military Affairs</a>. He was an advocate of moderate protective tariffs and federal <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a>. He opposed giving states the option to forgo <a href="Apportionment%20%28politics%29">apportionment</a>, which would have allowed them to elect their congressmen <a href="at-large">at-large</a>.

Crittenden again supported Clay's presidential bid in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844</a>. Clay was widely considered the favorite not only for the Whig nomination, but to win the general election. None of the traditional campaign issues—Tyler's "executive usurpation", Clay's "corrupt bargain" with John Quincy Adams, or the protective tariff—seemed to excite the electorate. However, the issue of the <a href="Texas%20Annexation">annexation of Texas</a> changed the entire campaign. Clay made a tour of the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a> just before the Whig nominating convention and concluded that the sentiment in favor of annexation in that part of the country was not as strong as had been assumed in Washington, D.C. Acting on this belief, and against Crittenden's advice, Clay sent a letter opposing annexation to Crittenden, asking him to have it published in the "<a href="National%20Intelligencer">National Intelligencer</a>".

Clay believed the Democrats would again nominate Martin Van Buren, who was ardently opposed to annexation, and this would keep annexation from becoming an issue in the campaign. Clay was nominated by <a href="acclamation">acclamation</a> at the Whig convention in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> a week later. At the Democratic nominating convention a month later, however, Van Buren was unable to secure his party's nomination, and the Democrats instead nominated <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>, who strongly favored annexation. Clay tried to moderate his views on annexation, but his changes of position drew opposition from supporters of both sides of the issue as he attempted to find a middle ground. Polk went on to win the election in a close race. This was the last time Clay would be nominated for president, and many Whigs believed that, following Clay's defeat, Crittenden was the new leader of their party.

In 1845, the Senate took up the question of ending the joint occupancy of the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a> with Great Britain. <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a>, a senator from <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended in order to allow time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the <a href="49th%20parallel%20north">49th parallel north</a>.

In 1846, the United States entered the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> in an attempt to gain control of Texas. Crittenden did not support the war, and after war was declared, he insisted that commissioners accompany the U.S. armies and attempt to broker peace at every opportunity. Throughout the war, he corresponded regularly with Generals <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> and <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>. Crittenden's sons, George and Thomas, both served in the war; Thomas Crittenden served on Scott's staff. President Polk consulted Crittenden regarding the terms of peace that should be accepted to end the war. Crittenden insisted that the terms of peace should not include the acquisition of territory to which the United States did not have a "just claim", but the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe%20Hidalgo">Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> submitted to Congress in 1848 called for Mexico to give up not only its claims to Texas, but also to <a href="Mexican%20Cession">New Mexico, California, and all the territory in between</a>. A few Whigs joined the Democratic majority in Congress to ratify the treaty and defeat the <a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a>, which would have banned slavery in the newly acquired territory.

Friends encouraged Crittenden to run for president in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201848">1848 election</a>. A <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> newspaper declared its support for him as early as 1846. A Democratic senator from <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> opined that Crittenden could win support from a sizable number of Democrats in addition to the support of his own party. <a href="George%20B.%20Kinkead">George B. Kinkead</a> desired to have the Kentucky General Assembly nominate Crittenden for president in 1847. None of these overtures swayed Crittenden. "For Heaven's sake don't talk to me about the Presidency", he said, rebuffing one early offer. Clay hoped Crittenden would again support him, but Crittenden concluded that Clay was no longer a viable candidate and threw his support behind Kentuckian Zachary Taylor. This decision caused a rift between the two friends, and they were not reconciled until years later when Clay lay on his deathbed.

The Whig Party was also divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of politics since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor <a href="William%20Owsley">William Owsley</a>, while <a href="Archibald%20Dixon">Archibald Dixon</a> had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an injurious effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He would also have to abandon his growing legal practice before the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions that grew out of the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.

<a href="Elijah%20Hise">Elijah Hise</a>, Chief Justice of the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, was the leading candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, but after the Whig nomination of Crittenden, Hise withdrew from consideration. The Democratic state convention then nominated Congressman <a href="Linn%20Boyd">Linn Boyd</a>, but Boyd also declined the nomination. The Democrats were finally able to nominate <a href="Henderson%2C%20Kentucky">Henderson</a> lawyer <a href="Lazarus%20W.%20Powell">Lazarus W. Powell</a>. As Crittenden canvassed the state, his opponents charged him with disloyalty to Clay because he refused to support him in the 1848 election. Crittenden maintained that he supported Clay for the presidency over anyone else, but he had believed that Clay did not intend to seek the Whig nomination in 1848. After Clay announced his candidacy, Crittenden said, he remained neutral in the Whigs' choice. In the gubernatorial election, Crittenden defeated Powell by a vote of 65,860 to 57,397. He resigned his Senate seat to assume the governorship.

With his own campaign at a close, Crittenden resumed direction of Taylor's presidential campaign, dispatching accomplished Whig speakers to all parts of the country. After Taylor was elected, he offered Crittenden the post of Secretary of State. Appeals came in from both Whig and Democratic leaders across the country urging him to serve in the cabinet; Taylor was inexperienced, and many felt that without Crittenden to guide him, his administration would fail. Taylor personally visited Crittenden in Frankfort on February 15, 1849, in hopes of persuading him to accept the appointment. Crittenden refused Taylor's overtures, and Taylor similarly rejected Crittenden's appeals to appoint his friend, Robert P. Letcher, as <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Postmaster General</a>. Crittenden's input is believed to have contributed significantly to the appointments of <a href="John%20M.%20Clayton">John M. Clayton</a> as Secretary of State and <a href="Orlando%20Brown%20%28Kentucky%29">Orlando Brown</a> as Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

Crittenden's reasons for refusing Taylor's appointment were many. Partially, he declined out of respect for Clay's feelings and partially he felt it would be viewed in the same way as Clay and Adams' "corrupt bargain" in 1825. Resigning the governorship also would have amounted to admitting to the Democrats' charges that he only sought the office to help Taylor win the presidency. Finally, he had not been able to fully heal the breach in the Whig Party, and he wanted to remedy that situation.

During Crittenden's term, he gave strong support to <a href="Superintendent%20%28education%29">superintendent</a> of public education, <a href="Robert%20Jefferson%20Breckinridge">Robert Jefferson Breckinridge</a>, who would come to be known as the "Father of public school system in Kentucky." In response to Crittenden's call for financial support for the improvement of public education, the General Assembly passed a common school law on February 26, 1849. This law established guidelines for several public officials regarding their administration of the common schools. The Assembly also reserved <a href="tariff">tolls</a> collected on the <a href="Kentucky%20River">Kentucky</a>, <a href="Green%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Green</a>, and <a href="Barren%20River">Barren</a> rivers for education, and passed a two percent <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a> to fund the state's schools.

Crittenden ordered the refurbishing of the state penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised the creation of a <a href="sinking%20fund">sinking fund</a> to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the <a href="Constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a> and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.

With the question of slavery becoming even more critical following the territorial acquisitions of the Mexican–American War, John C. Calhoun delivered an inflammatory address in December 1848 urging leaders of the southern states to resist "Northern aggression", even if it meant secession from the Union. Crittenden strongly denounced secession in his annual messages to the legislature in 1848 and 1849. In response, the state senate passed a resolution calling on Kentucky's citizens to cherish the Union and resist any efforts to secede.

Vice-President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> ascended to the presidency upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on the constitutionality of the <a href="fugitive%20slave%20law">fugitive slave law</a>, one of the bills involved in the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a>. Specifically, he asked if the law suspended the writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>". Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.

Questions regarding claims in Florida, some already considered by Crittenden during his first term as attorney general, continued during his second term. Specifically, some of the claimants objected to a legal provision, passed by Congress years after the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a>, that allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to refuse to pay claims awarded by Florida courts that he found not to be "just and equitable". The claimants contended that this allowed an executive officer to overrule a judicial decision in violation of the doctrine of <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a>. Crittenden held that the secretary's ruling was just as much a judicial action as that of the Florida judges. Further, he reiterated his 1841 decision that no interest could be paid on claims arising from damages resulting from Jackson's invasion. Despite this opinion, a Florida judge awarded interest to one of the claimants, and the government appealed the case to the Supreme Court, with Crittenden serving as the government's counsel. The Court upheld Crittenden's entire opinion in its ruling.

Crittenden was awarded an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> degree from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in 1851. Later that year, he acted as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> during the illness of Daniel Webster. In this capacity, he wrote a vigorous warning to both Britain and France about interfering in the question of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n independence. He also encouraged adherence to the United States' traditional policy of non-interference in Europe during the celebrated visit of <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> revolutionary <a href="Louis%20Kossuth">Louis Kossuth</a> to the United States in 1851.

In November 1851, the General Assembly convened to elect a successor to Senator <a href="Joseph%20R.%20Underwood">Joseph R. Underwood</a>. Underwood, whose term would expire in 1853, desired re-election, and Whigs <a href="Charles%20S.%20Morehead">Charles S. Morehead</a> and <a href="George%20Robertson%20%28congressman%29">George Robertson</a> had also announced their respective candidacies. Crittenden, whose term as attorney general also expired in 1853, had publicly announced that he wished to return to the Senate after his service in President Fillmore's cabinet, and upon learning this, Underwood and Morehead both withdrew from the race. Robertson was not expected to seriously challenge Crittenden, but following the withdrawals of the other candidates, Archibald Dixon entered the race. Historically an ally of Crittenden, Dixon's entrance into the race after Crittenden's announcement showed that he had switched his allegiance from Crittenden to Clay. Democrats, desirous to defeat Crittenden and embarrass the Whigs, pledged to vote against him at all costs, even if it meant electing Dixon. Crittenden's friends, therefore, held back his name from nomination to spare him almost certain defeat. Balloting deadlocked for several days, with Clay supporters throwing their support to Dixon, Robertson, and Lieutenant Governor <a href="John%20Burton%20Thompson">John B. Thompson</a>, a compromise candidate. Another compromise was proposed whereby Clay, his health failing, would resign his Senate seat, creating two Senate vacancies and allowing both Dixon and Crittenden to be elected, but Clay refused to cooperate. Finally, on the night of December 11, 1851, the Whigs met in caucus and agreed to withdraw both Dixon and Crittenden and elect Thompson.

A week after the election, Clay resigned, but Crittenden now declined the appointment to fill his unexpired term. Instead, the legislature elected Dixon to the remainder of Clay's term, set to expire in March 1855. Three weeks before Clay's death in 1852, he sent for Crittenden, and the two were reconciled; Critteden delivered a eulogy for Clay in September 1852, publicly dispelling the feud. After Clay's death, Crittenden became the most prominent Whig leader in Kentucky. He encouraged the party to support the nomination of Millard Fillmore for the presidency in 1852, but the nomination ultimately went to Winfield Scott. Crittenden was proposed as the nominee for vice-president, but he declined. Democrats captured the governorship that year; this was harbinger of the demise of the Whig Party in Kentucky.

On February 27, 1853, the twice-widower Crittenden married his third wife, Elizabeth Moss. Moss was twice-widowed, most recently to General <a href="William%20Henry%20Ashley">William Henry Ashley</a>. Moss was Crittenden's wife until his death. Crittenden served as attorney general until the expiration of Fillmore's term in 1853. Following his service as attorney general, he returned to private life. He made a substantial amount of money establishing mining claims for his clients in the former Mexican territory.

In 1853, the legislature was to elect a successor to Senator Dixon. Now satisfied that the feud between Clay and Crittenden had ended, Dixon did not seek re-election, leaving Crittenden with no Whig opposition. On a joint vote of the two houses of the General Assembly, Crittenden was elected 78–59 over governor Lazarus Powell.

In the period between his election and his taking office, Crittenden was the lead defense counsel in the murder trial of Matt F. Ward, the son of one of Crittenden's lifelong friends. Ward's younger brother had been disciplined by the principal at <a href="Louisville%20Male%20High%20School">Louisville Male High School</a> the preceding November, and the elder Ward went to argue with the principal on behalf of his brother. In the ensuing encounter, Ward shot and killed the principal with a pistol. Public sentiment was heavily against Ward, and the trial was <a href="change%20of%20venue">moved</a> to <a href="Hardin%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Hardin County</a>. During the week-long trial, which began in April 1854, Crittenden emphasized inconsistencies in the accounts of eyewitnesses and called prominent character witnesses such as <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville mayor</a> <a href="James%20Stephens%20Speed">James Stephens Speed</a>, Congressman <a href="William%20Preston%20%28Kentucky%29">William Preston</a>, and "Courier-Journal" editor <a href="George%20D.%20Prentice">George D. Prentice</a>. He presented a case that Ward had acted in <a href="self-defense">self-defense</a>. Because the prosecution sought the <a href="capital%20punishment">death penalty</a>, Crittenden asserted that if the jury rendered an erroneous conviction, they would have no peace of mind knowing they had sentenced an innocent man to <a href="Hanging">hang</a>.

There was a tremendous public outcry when Ward was found not guilty. Newspapers across the nation condemned the verdict and Crittenden for his role in securing it. Only Prentice, in the "Courier-Journal", defended Crittenden and the Ward family. Several public meetings passed resolutions calling for Crittenden's resignation from the Senate. After one such meeting, a mob gathered and Crittenden, Prentice, the Wards, and the twelve jurors were <a href="Effigy">burned in effigy</a>.

When he assumed his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest member of that body. The Whig Party had practically dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothing Party</a>. Although he did not agree with all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he had spent much of his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">1856 presidential election</a>.

In the early part of his term, Crittenden was concerned with quelling the <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">violence in Kansas Territory</a>. An opponent of the <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a> of 1854, Crittenden also opposed repealing the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> unless the North agreed to substitute <a href="popular%20sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a> for the exclusion of slavery north of the <a href="Parallel%2036%C2%B030%27%20north">36°30' line</a>. In early 1856, he proposed sending General Winfield Scott to the <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas Territory</a> to ensure that fair elections were held there, but the proposal was blocked by the Pierce administration. He did not agree with all of the act proposed by <a href="Robert%20Toombs">Robert Toombs</a> to allow for a constitutional convention in Kansas Territory, but he supported it as a step to bring peace there. He regarded the ratifications of both the <a href="Topeka%20Constitution">Topeka Constitution</a> and the <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a> as invalid, and made one of the most highly regarded speeches of his career in opposition to the latter. His substitute bill that would have resubmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas for another ratification vote was supported by Republicans, but it was ultimately defeated. So great was Crittenden's influence after his actions on the Kansas question that <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> felt that Crittenden's endorsement of <a href="Stephen%20Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a> cost Lincoln the <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201858">senatorial election in 1858</a>.

From 1858 to 1860, Crittenden sought out moderates from all sections of the country to effect compromise on the territorial and slavery issues, thus averting war. In 1860, he was named chair of the National Union Executive Committee, a group of congressmen and journalists who feared that sectional differences would destroy the Union. His efforts helped form the <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Union Party</a> later that year. Chosen as the <a href="keynote%20speaker">keynote speaker</a> at the party's national convention on May 9, 1860, many urged him to become their nominee for president. At age seventy-three, however, Crittenden was already contemplating retirement and instead orchestrated the nomination of <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>, whom he actively supported in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">1860 presidential race</a>.

Even after the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued to work for the preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through compromise. However, he believed that this compromise must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but amendments to the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a>, which would be much more difficult to change. To that end, he proposed the <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a>—a package of six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern <a href="personal%20liberty%20laws">personal liberty laws</a> and an assertion of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. The amendments would have restored the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> line and extended it to <a href="California">California</a> as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden's other amendments would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> or <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, the amendments denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the <a href="fugitive%20slave%20law">fugitive slave law</a> and <a href="Three-Fifths%20Compromise">Three-Fifths Compromise</a> perpetual in duration.

The compromise proposal was referred to a special committee proposed by Crittenden's fellow Kentucky senator, Lazarus Powell. Though it was believed that Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to the floor for a vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden's plan in committee, Florida, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> followed <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>'s lead and passed ordinances of secession.

On January 3, 1861, Crittenden tried to salvage his plan by recommending to the full Senate that it be submitted to the people in referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden's plan, and Republicans in Congress used a variety of procedures to prevent a vote on allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> Senator <a href="Daniel%20Clark%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">Daniel Clark</a> moved to substitute for Crittenden's plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark's substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden's proposal.

Crittenden remained in Washington for a few weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that <a href="John%20Archibald%20Campbell">John Archibald Campbell</a>, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, and by the time he definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.

Having failed to secure compromise at the federal level, Crittenden returned to Kentucky in early 1861, attempting to persuade his home state to reject the overtures of fellow southern states and remain in the Union. On May 10, 1861, a conference was held to decide Kentucky's course in the war. Crittenden joined Archibald Dixon and <a href="Samuel%20Smith%20Nicholas">S. S. Nicholas</a> as Unionist representatives at the conference; the Southern Rights position was represented by John C. Breckinridge, Governor <a href="Beriah%20Magoffin">Beriah Magoffin</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Hawes">Richard Hawes</a>. The conference failed to produce a united course of action, but adopted the policy of armed neutrality. Unionists in the legislature, however, feared that the state militia and its commander <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a>, had Confederate sympathies. To counter any threat that the militia would seize control of the state for the South, the General Assembly organized the Home Guard, a separate militia controlled by a five-man, pro-Union commission. Crittenden enlisted in the Home Guard as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> and was part of a group styled the "Union Defense Committee" that secured weapons for the Home Guard from the federal government.

In April, the General Assembly called a <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> convention to be held in Frankfort in May. Slates of delegates were nominated by both the Unionists and Southern Rightists, but war broke out before the election of delegates; the Southern Rights delegates withdrew from the election, and the Unionist slate, including Crittenden, was chosen by default. On May 27, 1861, Crittenden was chosen chair of the convention and called it to order. With war having largely precluded any good the meeting could have accomplished, only nine of Kentucky's twelve delegates were present, along with four from <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> (out of seven elected), and one from Tennessee (and his election was questionable); Virginia, Maryland, and <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> sent no delegates. Ultimately, the convention accomplished little beyond calling on the southern states to reconsider their secession and on the northern states to moderate their demands.

Against his father's wishes, Crittenden's son <a href="George%20B.%20Crittenden">George</a> resigned his position as a <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> to join the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> (in which he was promoted brigadier then major general), only to effectively lose his career in the early Confederate defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Mill%20Springs">Mill Springs, Kentucky</a>. George's brother, <a href="Thomas%20Leonidas%20Crittenden">Thomas Leonidas Crittenden</a>, had been a member of Buckner's State Guard, but joined the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> in September 1861 and was advanced to the rank of <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>, serving under <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a>. Another son, Eugene, also served in the Union Army and attained the rank of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>. One of John Crittenden's grandsons, John Crittenden Coleman, enlisted with the <a href="Confederate%20Army">Confederate Army</a>, while another grandson, <a href="John%20Crittenden%20Watson">John Crittenden Watson</a>, graduated from the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">U.S. Naval Academy</a> and participated in <a href="David%20Farragut">David Farragut</a>'s capture of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> during the war.

President Lincoln called a special session of Congress to convene July 4, 1861, and Kentucky held special elections in June to select congressmen for the special session. Crittenden had expressed his desire to retire from public service and initially refused pleas to become a candidate, but he finally consented to run in late May. He was elected over secessionist candidate <a href="William%20E.%20Simms">William E. Simms</a>; in all, nine of Kentucky's ten congressional districts selected Unionist candidates in the special election. Upon taking his seat, he was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs">Committee on Foreign Affairs</a>. On July 10, 1861, he accompanied Simon B. Buckner on a visit to President Lincoln to secure a renewed commitment from Lincoln to respect Kentucky's neutrality; Lincoln agreed only to issue a declaration that he had no present designs on Kentucky but would not commit to restrict his future actions. In order to calm the fears of border state citizens concerned about the Union's objectives in the war, he introduced the <a href="Crittenden%E2%80%93Johnson%20Resolution">Crittenden–Johnson Resolution</a>, which blamed the secessionist states for the war and stated that the object of the war was not the subjugation of those states, but the defense of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union. When those ends were achieved, the resolution stated, the war should cease. Kentucky Representative <a href="Henry%20C.%20Burnett">Henry C. Burnett</a> asked that the <a href="Division%20of%20a%20question">question be divided</a>. Burnett was one of only two votes against the portion of the resolution blaming the Southern states for the war; the only dissent on the remaining portion came from <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>'s <a href="John%20F.%20Potter">John F. Potter</a> and <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>'s <a href="Albert%20G.%20Riddle">Albert G. Riddle</a>. In the Senate, the resolution passed 30–5, with Kentucky senators Breckinridge and Powell voting in the minority. In December 1861 the House refused, by a vote of 76–65, to reaffirm the resolution.

After Congress adjourned in late July 1861, Crittenden returned home to Frankfort, but soon had to flee the city as Confederate generals <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Kirby%20Smith">Edmund Kirby Smith</a> invaded Kentucky, capturing both Frankfort and Lexington. He took up temporary residence at Louisville's <a href="Galt%20House">Galt House</a> hotel and was still residing there when Union General <a href="William%20%26quot%3BBull%26quot%3B%20Nelson">William "Bull" Nelson</a> was killed by Brigadier General <a href="Jefferson%20C.%20Davis">Jefferson C. Davis</a> there in 1862. He returned to his home in Frankfort shortly after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Perryville">Battle of Perryville</a> drove the Confederates from the state on October 8, 1862. Returning for the regular congressional session, he became the conduit through which many reports of unconstitutional military arrests in Kentucky were channeled. He spoke against the admission of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> to the Union on the grounds that Virginia had not consented to the creation of the state from its territory. He also opposed the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and the use of slaves as soldiers in the war.

When he returned to Kentucky following the <a href="37th%20United%20States%20Congress">37th Congress</a>, Crittenden's health was failing, and he frequently complained of <a href="Dyspnea">shortness of breath</a> and <a href="chest%20pain">chest pain</a>. He had determined to retire from Congress, but once again, friends persuaded him to stand for re-election. Shortly after his nomination, Crittenden and his wife were "en route" to an <a href="alum">alum</a> spring in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> to seek treatment to alleviate the symptoms of his failing health when he collapsed in Louisville. After remaining bedfast at the home of a local doctor, he returned home to Frankfort, where he died on July 26, 1863. He was interred at the State Cemetery in Frankfort. Among his other notable kinsmen were nephews <a href="Thomas%20Theodore%20Crittenden">Thomas Theodore Crittenden</a>, congressman from Missouri, and <a href="Thomas%20Turpin%20Crittenden">Thomas Turpin Crittenden</a>, a general in the Union Army. In Kentucky, <a href="Crittenden%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Crittenden County</a> and the town of <a href="Crittenden%2C%20Kentucky">Crittenden</a> are named for him.

Smiley Smile

Smiley Smile is the 12th <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="the%20Beach%20Boys">the Beach Boys</a>, released on September 18, 1967. The album reached number 9 on UK <a href="record%20chart">record chart</a>s, but sold poorly in the US, peaking at number 41—the band's lowest chart placement to that point. Critics and fans generally received the album with confusion and disappointment. Only one single was issued from "Smiley Smile": "<a href="Heroes%20and%20Villains">Heroes and Villains</a>". "<a href="Good%20Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a>" and "<a href="Gettin%27%20Hungry">Gettin' Hungry</a>" were also released, but the former was issued a year earlier, while the latter was not credited to the band.

Devised as a simplified version of their then-forthcoming "<a href="Smile%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Smile</a>"—a different, much more elaborately constructed <a href="Long-playing%20record">LP</a>—"Smiley Smile" contrasts significantly with its <a href="minimal%20music">minimalist</a> approach and <a href="lo-fi">lo-fi</a> production. Following principal songwriter <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian Wilson</a>'s declaration that most of the original "Smile" tapes were off-limits, the majority of recording sessions lasted for only six weeks at <a href="Beach%20Boys%20Studio">his makeshift home studio</a> using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, a <a href="honky-tonk%20piano">detuned piano</a>, <a href="bass%20%28instrument%29">electronic bass</a>, and a <a href="Baldwin%20Piano%20Company">Baldwin</a> <a href="theater%20organ">theater organ</a>. The unconventional recording process juxtaposed an experimental party-like atmosphere with short pieces of music edited together in a disjointed manner, combining the engineering methods of "Good Vibrations" with the loose feeling of their 1965 album "<a href="Beach%20Boys%27%20Party%21">Beach Boys' Party!</a>". <a href="Carl%20Wilson">Carl Wilson</a> famously compared the end result to "a <a href="bunt%20%28baseball%29">bunt</a> instead of a <a href="grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29">grand slam</a>".

From 1966 to 1967, "Smile" was repeatedly delayed as the Beach Boys were subject to a considerable level of media hype amid press coverage that <a href="Brian%20Wilson%20is%20a%20genius">proclaimed Brian as a "genius"</a>. When the group dropped out of headlining the <a href="Monterey%20Pop%20Festival">Monterey Pop Festival</a> in June 1967, they began to be derided by a contingent of the rock press as the archetypal "pop music cop-outs". After settling payment disputes with <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>, "Smiley Smile" was distributed in collaboration with <a href="Brother%20Records">Brother Records</a>, a new record label and <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a> founded by the band. Its production was unusually credited to "the Beach Boys" rather than Brian alone, marking the point where he began relinquishing his hold as the group's creative leader. "Smile" was ultimately <a href="collapse%20of%20Smile">left unfinished</a> as the group <a href="Lei%27d%20in%20Hawaii">embarked on a brief tour of Hawaii</a>, and then, the recording of their next album, "<a href="Wild%20Honey%20%28album%29">Wild Honey</a>", released only three months later.

"Smiley Smile" opened a seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums, but has since grown in stature to become a cult and critical favorite in the Beach Boys' oeuvre. Its music is often cited for having positive effects during an <a href="LSD">LSD</a> <a href="comedown%20%28drugs%29">comedown</a>, and was used by at least one <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation">drug clinic</a> to help relieve users from <a href="bad%20trip">bad trip</a>s. Regarded as a forerunner to certain <a href="bedroom%20pop">bedroom pop</a> acts, in 1974, it was voted the 64th greatest album of all time by "<a href="NME">NME</a>" writers and, in 2000, it was one of 100 albums featured in the book "The Ambient Century" as a landmark in the development of <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a>. Some session highlights from the album are featured on the compilations "<a href="The%20Smile%20Sessions">The Smile Sessions</a>" (2011) and "<a href="1967%20%E2%80%93%20Sunshine%20Tomorrow">1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow</a>" (2017).

The Beach Boys' album "<a href="Pet%20Sounds">Pet Sounds</a>", issued on May 16, 1966, was massively influential upon its release, containing lush and sophisticated orchestral arrangements that raised the band's prestige to the top level of rock innovators. Early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive, but the reception from music journalists in the UK was very favorable. The group had recently employed <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' former press officer <a href="Derek%20Taylor">Derek Taylor</a> as their publicist. Bothered by the popular view of the Beach Boys as outdated <a href="surfer">surfer</a>s, leader and songwriter <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian Wilson</a> requested that Taylor establish a new image for the band as fashionable counterculture icons, and so a promotional campaign with the tagline "<a href="Brian%20Wilson%20is%20a%20genius">Brian Wilson is a genius</a>" was created and coordinated by Taylor.

In October 1966, the group followed up "Pet Sounds" with "<a href="Good%20Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a>", a laboriously produced single that achieved major international success. By then, an album titled "Smile" had been conceived as an extension of that song's recording approach, with Wilson composing music in collaboration with lyricist <a href="Van%20Dyke%20Parks">Van Dyke Parks</a>. Wilson envisioned "Smile" as an outlet for all of his intellectual occupations, such as his fascination with <a href="spirituality">spirituality</a> and its relationship to <a href="humor">humor</a> and <a href="laughter">laughter</a>. He told "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>": "Our new album will be better than "Pet Sounds". It will be as much an improvement over "Sounds" as that was over [our 1965 album] "<a href="Summer%20Days%20%28And%20Summer%20Nights%21%21%29">Summer Days</a>"."

After months of recording and media hype, the original "Smile" project was shelved due to corporate pressures, technical problems, internal power struggles, and legal stalling. Business partner <a href="David%20Anderle">David Anderle</a> attempted to form <a href="Brother%20Records">Brother Records</a>, an <a href="independent%20label">independent label</a>, with the intention of giving "entirely new concepts to the recording industry, and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product." A February 1967 lawsuit seeking $255,000 (equivalent to $ in ) was launched against <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> over neglected royalty payments. Within the lawsuit, there was also an attempt to terminate the band's contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry. Wilson decided to construct <a href="Beach%20Boys%20Studio">his own personal home recording studio</a> as a measure against suspected tape leaks and to eliminate the inconvenience of booking studio time.

Band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967, with Anderle following suit weeks later. <a href="Dennis%20Wilson">Dennis Wilson</a> explained that the group had become "very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public. ... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically." Brian said that "Smile" leftovers like "<a href="Surf%27s%20Up%20%28song%29">Surf's Up</a>" were left unreleased because he lacked a "<a href="commercialism">commercial</a> feeling" for those songs, surmising that "Maybe some people like to hang on to certain songs as their own little songs that they've written, almost for themselves. You know, what they've written is nice for them ... but a lot of people just don't like it." <a href="Carl%20Wilson">Carl Wilson</a> reflected on the period: "To get that album ["Smile"] out, someone would have needed willingness and perseverance to corral all of us. Everybody was so loaded on pot and hash all of the time that it's no wonder the project didn't get done."

On May 6, 1967, Taylor announced that "Smile" had been "scrapped". The Beach Boys were still under pressure and a contractual obligation to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates that most of the material recorded for "Smile" was now off-limits. According to Carl, "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was "Smiley Smile"." In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas "in a conventional sense", and that he was "about ready to die". He says: "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we had so much fun. The "Smiley Smile" era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings."

Since the recording of "Good Vibrations" in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or "modules"). Through the method of <a href="tape%20splicing">tape splicing</a>, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. "Smiley Smile" continued this approach. The album also continued Brian's exploration of "party tracks"—a form of music which includes the sounds of people shouting and making noises, as if at a party. Brian had enacted this approach with "<a href="Beach%20Boys%27%20Party%21">Beach Boys' Party!</a>" in 1965, thereby mixing that record's style with the modular composition method he devised for "Good Vibrations".

Most of "Smiley Smile" was recorded at Brian's improvised home studio in <a href="Bel%20Air%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Bel Air</a> from June 3 to July 14, 1967. The core instrumentation consisted of <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a>, <a href="honky-tonk%20piano">honky-tonk piano</a>, and <a href="bass%20%28instrument%29">electronic bass</a> played by the Beach Boys themselves, rather than the <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a>s employed in much of their previous work. Brian became obsessed with a three-tiered <a href="Baldwin%20Piano%20Company">Baldwin organ</a> during the album's recording, resulting in a more minimalist approach to the new arrangements. The organ gave the album its central timbre. Tape manipulation was another prominent feature, with <a href="varispeed">varispeed</a> being applied to a few miscellaneous vocals. On "<a href="She%27s%20Goin%27%20Bald">She's Goin' Bald</a>", a new device called the <a href="Eltro%20Information%20Rate%20Changer">Eltro Information Rate Changer</a> was used to raise the pitch of the group's vocals without affecting the tempo.

It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys. When asked if Brian was "still the producer of "Smiley Smile"", Carl answered, "Most definitely." Brian acknowledged: "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular kind of things that were on the album." Author <a href="Domenic%20Priore">Domenic Priore</a> notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared". <a href="Mike%20Love">Mike Love</a>, recalling how "She's Goin' Bald" was a song about <a href="fellatio">fellatio</a>, commented: "We were stoned out of our heads. We were laughing our asses off when we recorded that stuff."

In his book about <a href="psychedelic%20music">psychedelic music</a>, author <a href="Jim%20DeRogatis">Jim DeRogatis</a> referred to "Smiley Smile" as a work of the "ultimate <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a> library". Conversely, "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>"s Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album "embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed <a href="psychedelia">psychedelia</a> of that era. It is for this reason "Smiley Smile" flows so well with the more <a href="experimental%20pop">experimental pop</a> of today". According to music theorist <a href="Daniel%20Harrison%20%28music%20theorist%29">Daniel Harrison</a>, "Smiley Smile" is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album "can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music". He continues:

The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an <a href="echo%20chamber">echo chamber</a>. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs." Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in "<a href="With%20Me%20Tonight">With Me Tonight</a>", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying "good", as in "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert spoke about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower:
Carl Wilson famously compared "Smiley Smile" to "a <a href="bunt%20%28baseball%29">bunt</a> instead of a <a href="grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29">grand slam</a>". From the vast sum of material Brian had recorded for "Smile", only portions of the backing track for "<a href="Heroes%20and%20Villains">Heroes and Villains</a>" (recorded October 1966) and the coda for "<a href="Vegetables%20%28song%29">Vegetables</a>" (recorded April 1967) were used for "Smiley Smile". "Heroes and Villains" was modified substantially during the "Smiley Smile" sessions before being issued as a single preceding the album's release. Comparing Brian's original "Smile" mixes with the single version, <a href="Al%20Jardine">Al Jardine</a> called it "a pale facsimile ... Brian re-invented the song for this record ... He purposefully under-produced the song." "Good Vibrations", which was recorded sporadically from February to September 1966, appears with no differences from the original single. Brian reportedly objected to the placement of "Good Vibrations" on "Smiley Smile", but for the first time, he was outvoted by his bandmates, who insisted on its inclusion.

"<a href="Wind%20Chimes%20%28song%29">Wind Chimes</a>", "<a href="Wonderful%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">Wonderful</a>", and most parts of "Vegetables" were completely rerecorded with dramatically scaled-down arrangements. "Vegetables" was reworked as a kind of <a href="folk%20song">campfire song</a>, "Wonderful" traded its <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, strings, and horns with a haphazardly-played organ, high-pitched backing vocals, and a <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> sing-along section, and the <a href="marimba">marimba</a>s in "Wind Chimes" were replaced by organ and dissonant noise. Other tracks took elements of "Smile" era compositions to make something slightly different; "She's Goin' Bald" borrows the verse melody from a "Smile" fragment known as "<a href="He%20Gives%20Speeches">He Gives Speeches</a>", "With Me Tonight" is a variation on "Vegetables", and "<a href="Fall%20Breaks%20and%20Back%20to%20Winter%20%28W.%20Woodpecker%20Symphony%29">Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)</a>" lifts a recurring melodic hook from "". David Anderle thought that "what Brian tried to do with "Smiley Smile" is he tried to salvage as much of "Smile" as he could and at the same time immediately go into his [long-discussed] humor album." Jardine felt that "there are some pretty cool songs on that album but I didn't like rehashing some of the "Smile" songs. That didn't work for me."
"Smiley Smile" was produced without any direct involvement from Van Dyke Parks. The only songs that appeared to have no connection to the original "Smile" album were "<a href="Little%20Pad">Little Pad</a>" and "<a href="Gettin%27%20Hungry">Gettin' Hungry</a>". In addition, while the Beatles' <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> was present at an April 1967 session for "Vegetables", the recording where he allegedly provides celery biting sounds was not used on "Smiley Smile".

Before the album's commercial release, the Beach Boys were involved in the conception of the <a href="Monterey%20Pop%20Festival">Monterey Pop Festival</a>, which was held in June 1967. At the last minute, the band declined to appear at the event. Biographer <a href="David%20Leaf">David Leaf</a> explained: "Monterey was a gathering place for the 'far out' sounds of the 'new' rock, and the Beach Boys in concert really had no exotic sounds (excepting "Good Vibrations") to display. The net result of all this internal and external turmoil was that the Beach Boys didn't go to Monterey, and it is thought that this non-appearance was what really turned the 'underground' tide against them." Publicly, the band said that they couldn't play for reasons pertaining to Carl's <a href="conscription">military draft</a>, but many of the people involved with the festival thought that the group was simply too scared to compete with the "new music". As author <a href="Steven%20Gaines">Steven Gaines</a> writes, the decision "had a snowballing effect" that came to represent "a damning admission that [the Beach Boys] were washed up".

Rock critic <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28Crawdaddy%21%20creator%29">Paul Williams</a> saw that Anderle's idea to form Brother Records was reasonable, "but the time it takes to put this type of thing through the courts was not conducive to the production race that was important during this period of radical change in pop." In the months leading up to "Smiley Smile"s release, a multitude of revolutionary rock albums were received by an anxious and maturing youth market as Wilson's image was reduced to that of an "eccentric" figure. From February to May 1967, this included <a href="Jefferson%20Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>'s "<a href="Surrealistic%20Pillow">Surrealistic Pillow</a>", <a href="the%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">the Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>'s "<a href="Are%20You%20Experienced">Are You Experienced</a>", <a href="the%20Velvet%20Underground">the Velvet Underground</a>'s "<a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground%20and%20Nico">The Velvet Underground and Nico</a>", and the Beatles' "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>". Up until this point, the Beatles were the only act that posed a competitive threat to the Beach Boys, and Wilson was concerned that if "Smile" followed in the wake of another critically successful release by the Beatles, that his album would be received with unjust comparisons. Once they released "Sgt. Pepper", Wilson's race was effectively lost.

The Capitol lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, the band receiving their $200,000 in exchange for Brother Records to distribute through Capitol Records, along with a guarantee that the band produce at least one million dollars profit. Capitol A&R director <a href="Karl%20Engemann">Karl Engemann</a> began circulating a memo, dated July 25, 1967, in which "Smiley Smile" was referred to as a "<a href="cartoon">cartoon</a>" stopgap for "Smile". The memo also discussed conversations between him and Wilson pertaining to the release of a 10-track "Smile" album, which would not have included the songs "Heroes and Villains" or "Vegetables". This never came to fruition and, instead, the group embarked on a tour of Hawaii in August. <a href="Bruce%20Johnston">Bruce Johnston</a>, who was absent for most of the recording sessions, did not accompany the group, although Brian did. Their performances were limited to two shows at an auditorium in Honolulu, which were filmed and recorded with the intention of releasing a live album, "<a href="Lei%27d%20in%20Hawaii">Lei'd in Hawaii</a>". On stage, the band continued to exhibit a more minimal sound.

In July, two singles were issued on the Brother imprint: "Heroes and Villains" and "Gettin' Hungry". The former peaked at number 12 on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">Hot 100</a>. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love. On September 18, 1967, "Smiley Smile" was released in the US. The LP peaked at number 41 on the <a href="Billboard%20charts">"Billboard" charts</a>, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. 

Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in "<a href="Hit%20Parader">Hit Parader</a>" praised the album for "probably [having] more <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s", but that they "still like "Pet Sounds" better". "NME" wrote of the album: "By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing." "Hi Fidelity" said: "... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu ... their work can only receive partial approval." "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" referred to it as a "disaster" and an "abortive attempt to match the talents of <a href="Lennon%E2%80%93McCartney">Lennon and McCartney</a>." On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder <a href="Jann%20Wenner">Jann Wenner</a> printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's "genius" label, which he called a "promotional shuck", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called "one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles". He wrote that "for some reason, ["Smiley Smile"] just doesn't make it ... [the songs] just don't move you. Other than displaying Brian Wilson's virtuosity for production, they are pointless."

The "<a href="Milwaukee%20Journal%20Sentinel">Milwaukee Sentinel</a>" praised the LP as "probably the most valuable contribution to rock since the Beatles "<a href="Revolver%20%28Beatles%20album%29">Revolver</a>"" and for being unlike anything the Beatles had done. The magazine "<a href="Cheetah%20%28magazine%29">Cheetah</a>" gave the album a rave review, observing that "the mood is rather childlike (not childish)—the kind of innocence that shows on the album cover, with its <a href="Henri%20Rousseau">Rousseau</a>-like animals and forest, and the smoke from the cabin chimney spelling out the title. ... The expression that emerges from this music is very strange: it's a very personal mood." Journalist <a href="Richard%20Goldstein%20%28writer%20born%201944%29">Richard Goldstein</a> remembered his review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>": "I was struck by its fragile melodies and their relationship to sacred music; those familiar ride-the-curl voices, now 'hushed with wonder,' reminded me of the <a href="Faur%C3%A9">Fauré</a> "<a href="Requiem%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Requiem</a>", but they were utterly American."

Priore reflected: "Actually, the [only] reason most people didn't care for "Smiley Smile" is that it came out in place of "Smile"." <a href="Richie%20Unterberger">Richie Unterberger</a> concurred, rating the album four out of five stars, and suggesting that media-hype of the collapsed "Smile" project was to blame for "Smiley Smile"s lackluster reception in the United States. He called it a "rather nifty, if rather slight, effort that's plenty weird". In a 2007 issue of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> and <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> named it one of the 40 essential albums of 1967; Christgau declared: "Towering it's not; some kind of hit it is." In 2001, Spencer Owen of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" awarded the album a 9.5/10 score, and wrote ""Smiley Smile" is a near-masterpiece. Without any awareness of "Smile"'s existence, this album could have been a contemporary classic ... and although the album isn't anywhere close to the sonic revolution that "Sgt. Pepper" had already brought, Wilson's innovative production and arrangements still bring out the best in every single track." Daniel Harrison compared Wilson to classical composers such as Schoenberg, with a key difference being that Wilson "required the services of a record company to mass produce and distribute his work", and lamented that the album was incompatible with the commercial demands of the music industry. Bruce Johnston called the album "a thousand times better than the [original "Smile"] ... It's just the most underrated album in the whole catalog for me."

Journalist <a href="Nick%20Kent">Nick Kent</a> maintained that the album "undersold the worth" of "Smile" with "dumb pot-head skits, so-called healing chants and even some weird 'loony tunes' items straight out of a cut-rate <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> soundtrack". "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s <a href="Geoffrey%20Cannon">Geoffrey Cannon</a> viewed Parks' lyrics as "pretentious", believing that Parks "messed Brian up" during "Smiley Smile". "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>"s Bryan Rolli ranked it at number 2 in a list of the "10 Most Disappointing Follow-Up Albums", calling it a "disjointed collection of minimalist recordings and a capella bits that are not so much songs as fragments of a shattered psyche". In the 2004 edition of "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>", the reviewer described "Smiley Smile" as "inconsistent" and said that, given the context of its release in September 1967, "the album was like a strange throwback – it highlighted how out of touch these suburban California surfers had become with the psychedelic times."

"Smiley Smile" became the first in a three-part series of <a href="lo-fi%20music">lo-fi</a> Beach Boys albums (preceding "<a href="Wild%20Honey%20%28album%29">Wild Honey</a>" and "<a href="Friends%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Friends</a>") and the first in a seven-year string of under-performing Beach Boys albums (ending with the 1974 compilation "<a href="Endless%20Summer%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Endless Summer</a>"). The "Smile" era is generally viewed as the ending of the Beach Boys' most artistically creative period, and the point after which Brian began relinquishing his hold as the group's creative leader. After "Smiley Smile", Carl took Brian's place as the most musically dominant member, and Brian would not be credited as producer for another Beach Boys album until 1976's "<a href="15%20Big%20Ones">15 Big Ones</a>". Journalist Brian Chidester designed the nominal "<a href="Bedroom%20Tapes">Bedroom Tapes</a>" label as a catch-all term for the work produced by Wilson in between his "full retreat as leader of the Beach Boys [in mid 1968] ... following a brief stint in a mental institution" and his admittance under <a href="Eugene%20Landy">Eugene Landy</a>'s 24-hour therapy in late 1975. By 1969, Wilson was increasingly known for his reclusiveness, and could be found managing a health food store in West Hollywood called the <a href="Radiant%20Radish">Radiant Radish</a>.

Much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 continued the pattern of sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality. Harrison opined that this experimental songwriting and production phase lasted until "<a href="Sunflower%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Sunflower</a>" (1970), after which their albums "contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead".

After "Smile" was cancelled, some of its tracks continued to trickle out in later releases, often as <a href="filler%20%28media%29">filler songs</a> to offset Brian's unwillingness to contribute. "<a href="Cool%2C%20Cool%20Water">Cool, Cool Water</a>", an outtake from "Smiley Smile" and "Wild Honey" sessions, was partially rerecorded and issued as the closing track for "Sunflower". When "<a href="The%20Smile%20Sessions">The Smile Sessions</a>" box set was released in 2011, co-producer <a href="Mark%20Linett">Mark Linett</a> acknowledged that "there's things that some people think – should "Smiley Smile" sessions be there – [with tracks such as] '<a href="Can%27t%20Wait%20Too%20Long">Can't Wait Too Long</a>', we get into a very fuzzy area". In 2017, additional session highlights from the album were released on the rarities compilation "<a href="1967%20%E2%80%93%20Sunshine%20Tomorrow">1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow</a>". The compilation was followed several months later with two more digital-exclusive releases: "1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow 2: The Studio Sessions" and "1967 – Live Sunshine".

"Smiley Smile" has since grown in stature to become a cult and critical favorite in the band's oeuvre. At least one <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation">drug treatment center</a> played the LP for patients to help relieve their use of drugs, as Carl told the NME in 1970: "In <a href="Fort%20Worth">Fort Worth</a>, Texas, there is a drug clinic which takes people off the streets and helps them get over bad LSD trips. They don't use any traditional medical treatment whatsoever. All they do is play the patient our "Smiley Smile" album and apparently this acts as a soothing remedy which relaxes them and helps them to recover completely from their trip."

After a 1974 reissue, the negative response to the album mellowed, the same year that "NME" writers voted it as the 62th greatest album of all time. According to Matjas-Mecca, following the mid 1970s, the album "began to acquire a fan base that heard magic in Brian's lo-fi production ... In the 2000s, it began to appear on various lists of must-hear albums, and is now considered an important work in Brian's catalog. In a world that embraces lo-fi art, the album is considered a masterpiece." In 2017, "Pitchfork" ranked it the 118th greatest album of the 1960s, with Mark Richardson writing: "it basically invented the kind of lo-fi <a href="bedroom%20pop">bedroom pop</a> that would later propel <a href="Sebadoh">Sebadoh</a>, <a href="Animal%20Collective">Animal Collective</a>, and other characters."

Dedicated <a href="tribute%20album">tribute album</a>s include "<a href="Smiling%20Pets">Smiling Pets</a>" (1998) and "Portland Sings The Beach Boys "Smiley Smile"" (2013). <a href="Pete%20Townshend">Pete Townshend</a> of <a href="the%20Who">the Who</a> is a known admirer of the record, as is <a href="Robbie%20Robertson">Robbie Robertson</a> of <a href="the%20Band">the Band</a>. <a href="XTC">XTC</a>'s <a href="Andy%20Partridge">Andy Partridge</a> considered it one of "the most influential records for me" and it was a direct inspiration for his song "Season Cycle" ("<a href="Skylarking">Skylarking</a>", 1986). In an interview with "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", <a href="Steven%20Tyler">Steven Tyler</a> of <a href="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a> stated that his "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">island</a>" music picks include "Smiley Smile", "Just for the melodic fuck all." In 2000, it was one of 100 albums featured in the book "The Ambient Century" as a landmark in the development of <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a>. <a href="Keiichi%20Suzuki">Keiichi Suzuki</a> and <a href="Hirokazu%20Tanaka">Hirokazu Tanaka</a>, who composed music for the Japanese <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> series "<a href="EarthBound%20%28series%29">EarthBound</a>", cited "Smiley Smile" among influences on the games' soundtracks. The "<a href="New%20York%20Observer">New York Observer</a>"s Ron Hart believes that "Smiley Smile" contains sounds that foreshadow the work of <a href="Harry%20Nilsson">Harry Nilsson</a>, <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a>, <a href="Stereolab">Stereolab</a>, <a href="the%20High%20Llamas">the High Llamas</a>, <a href="the%20Olivia%20Tremor%20Control">the Olivia Tremor Control</a>, and <a href="Father%20John%20Misty">Father John Misty</a>.

Dover Athletic F.C.

Dover Athletic Football Club is an <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in the town of <a href="Dover">Dover</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, England. The club currently competes in the <a href="National%20League%20%28division%29">National League</a>, the fifth tier of English football. The club was formed in <a href="1983%20in%20association%20football">1983</a> after the dissolution of the town's previous club, <a href="Dover%20F.C.">Dover F.C.</a>, whose place in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> was taken by the new club. In the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20in%20English%20football">1989–90</a> season Dover Athletic won the Southern League championship, but failed to gain promotion to the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a> as the club's ground did not meet the required standard. Three seasons later the team won the title again and this time gained promotion to the Conference, where they spent nine seasons before being relegated at the end of the 2001–02 season. The club was transferred from the Southern League to the <a href="Isthmian%20League">Isthmian League</a> in 2004, competing in that league's Premier Division for one season before mounting financial problems led the club to a further relegation. In the 2007–08 season, Dover won Division One South of the league, before winning the Premier Division in 2008–09 and thus gaining promotion to the <a href="Conference%20South">Conference South</a>. They spent five seasons in this division, reaching the play-offs three times, before defeating <a href="Ebbsfleet%20United%20F.C.">Ebbsfleet United</a> in the 2013–14 play-off final to finally return to the <a href="Conference%20Premier">Conference Premier</a> after a twelve-year absence.

The team usually wear white shirts and are consequently nicknamed the Whites. They have played at the <a href="Crabble%20Athletic%20Ground">Crabble Athletic Ground</a> since the club's formation. The club's best performance in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> was reaching the third round proper in both the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20FA%20Cup">2010–11</a> and <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20FA%20Cup">2014–15</a> seasons, while the best performance registered in the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a>, the national competition for higher-level <a href="Non-league%20football">non-league</a> clubs, was a run to the semi-finals in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20FA%20Trophy">1997–98</a> season.

Dover Athletic F.C. was formed in 1983 after the town's previous club, <a href="Dover%20F.C.">Dover</a>, folded due to its debts. The new club took Dover's place in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> Southern Division, with former Dover player Alan Jones as manager and a team consisting mainly of reserve players from the old club. Initially Athletic struggled, finishing second from bottom of the table in the <a href="1984-85%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a> season. In November 1985 Steve McRae, who had succeeded Jones a year earlier, was sacked and replaced by Chris Kinnear.
Under Kinnear the club's fortunes turned round, with two top-five finishes followed by the Southern Division championship, and with it promotion, in the <a href="1987-88%20in%20English%20football">1987–88</a> season. The team started strongly in the <a href="Southern%20League%20Premier%20Division">Premier Division</a>, finishing in sixth place at the first attempt, and then winning the championship in the <a href="1989-90%20in%20English%20football">1989–90</a> season. The club was denied promotion to the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a>, however, as the Crabble Athletic Ground did not meet the standard required for that league. After finishing fourth and second in the subsequent two seasons, Dover won the title again in the <a href="1992-93%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a> season and this time were admitted to the Conference.

Although Dover finished in eighth place in their first season in the Conference, the following season saw the club struggling against relegation, and Kinnear was dismissed due to a combination of the team's poor performances and his own personal problems. <a href="John%20Ryan%20%28footballer%20born%201947%29">John Ryan</a> was appointed as the club's new manager, but his reign was a short one and he was dismissed when the club lost seven of its first eight matches in the <a href="1995-96%20in%20English%20football">1995–96</a> season. The club then appointed former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> international <a href="Peter%20Taylor%20%28footballer%20born%201953%29">Peter Taylor</a> as manager, but he was unable to steer the team away from the foot of the table, and Dover held onto their place in the Conference only because <a href="Northern%20Premier%20League">Northern Premier League</a> runners-up <a href="Boston%20United%20F.C.">Boston United</a> failed to submit their application for promotion before the required deadline.

<a href="Bill%20Williams%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201942%29">Bill Williams</a> took over as manager in 1997 and led the club to the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a> semi-finals in the <a href="1997-98%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> season and a best league finish to date of sixth place in the <a href="1999-00%20in%20English%20football">1999–2000</a> season. Williams left the club to take a senior position with Conference rivals <a href="Kingstonian%20F.C.">Kingstonian</a> in May 2001. By now the club was in severe financial difficulties, with a number of directors resigning and debts exceeding £100,000. Amid the crisis the entire board of directors resigned, forcing the club's Supporters' Trust to take over the running of the club, and manager <a href="Gary%20Bellamy">Gary Bellamy</a> was sacked after just six months in the job. Former <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="Neville%20Southall">Neville Southall</a> took over but was dismissed just three months later, with <a href="Clive%20Walker%20%28footballer%20born%201945%29">Clive Walker</a> taking over in March 2002 with the club rooted to the foot of the table. The club finished the season bottom of the Conference and was relegated back to the <a href="Southern%20League%20Premier%20Division">Southern League Premier Division</a>. The club's ongoing financial problems led to it entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), a process by which <a href="Insolvency">insolvent</a> companies offset their debts against future profits, due to debts that were now estimated at £400,000.
In Dover's first season back in the Southern League Premier Division the Whites finished in third place, albeit 17 points adrift of <a href="Tamworth%20F.C.">Tamworth</a>, who claimed the one promotion place available that season. A poor start to the following season saw Walker replaced by Richard Langley. Dover finished the season in 19th place, before being switched to the <a href="Isthmian%20League%20Premier%20Division">Isthmian League Premier Division</a> in the summer of 2004 following a re-organisation of the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a>. The new season started with six successive defeats, which saw Langley sacked, and the financial problems continued, with the club coming within two months of being closed down. Dover were relegated to the <a href="Isthmian%20League%20Division%20One">Isthmian League Division One</a> at the end of the season, but were saved from possible extinction in January 2005 when former director Jim Parmenter returned to head up a consortium that took over the club. Parmenter quickly sacked manager Steve Browne and convinced Clive Walker to return to the club to replace him, and also arranged for the club's outstanding CVA debts to be cleared, putting the club on a firm financial footing for the first time in many years.

Dover Athletic narrowly missed out on an immediate return to the Premier Division in the <a href="2005-06%20in%20English%20football">2005–06</a> season, reaching the play-offs for promotion but losing out to <a href="Tonbridge%20Angels%20F.C.">Tonbridge Angels</a>. The following season Dover again reached the play-offs but lost in the semi-final to <a href="Hastings%20United%20F.C.">Hastings United</a>, after which Walker did not have his contract renewed and was replaced by former <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> manager <a href="Andy%20Hessenthaler">Andy Hessenthaler</a>. In his first season in charge he led the club to the Division One South championship and promotion to the <a href="Isthmian%20League%20Premier%20Division">Isthmian League Premier Division</a>. The following season Dover won a second consecutive championship and thus gained promotion to <a href="Conference%20South">Conference South</a>. In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10</a> season, Dover reached the play-offs for promotion to the <a href="Conference%20National">Conference National</a>, but lost at the semi-final stage to <a href="Woking%20F.C.">Woking</a>. The following season the club reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time after wins over Kent rivals <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> in the first round and another <a href="Football%20League%20Two">League Two</a> club, <a href="Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.">Aldershot Town</a>, in the second round. In the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20in%20English%20football">2012–13</a> season the club again reached the play-offs, but this time lost in the final to <a href="Salisbury%20City%20F.C.">Salisbury City</a>. The following season the team reached the second round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, losing 1–0 to <a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Dons%20F.C.">Milton Keynes Dons</a>, The last 16 of the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a>, narrowly losing 3–2 to <a href="Eastleigh%20F.C.">Eastleigh</a> and made the play-offs once more. A 4–1 aggregate victory over <a href="Sutton%20United%20F.C.">Sutton United</a> in the semi-final set up a match with fellow Kent team <a href="Ebbsfleet%20United%20F.C.">Ebbsfleet United</a> in the final. On 10 May 2014, Dover beat Ebbsfleet 1–0 at Stonebridge Road with a goal from <a href="Nathan%20Elder">Nathan Elder</a> enough to seal the club's return to the top flight of non-league football for the first time since 2002. In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">2014–15</a> season Dover went on another <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> run, beating <a href="Morecambe%20F.C.">Morecambe</a> 1–0 in the first round, then <a href="Cheltenham%20Town%20F.C.">Cheltenham Town</a> 1–0 in the second round to reach the third round proper for only the second time ever, but lost 4–0 at home to <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> side <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a>. The following season the team qualified for the play-offs for promotion to <a href="Football%20League%20Two">League Two</a>.

Dover Athletic's traditional colours are white and black, which were also the colours worn by the earlier Dover club. Away colours worn by the club have included red, yellow & green, pink and blue. The club's crest contains a stylised representation of the town's two most famous landmarks, <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover Castle</a> and the <a href="White%20cliffs%20of%20Dover">white cliffs</a>, enclosed in a circle bearing the club's name. The club's shirts have been sponsored by companies including Criccieth Homes, Paul Brown of Dover, Jenkins and Pain, cross-channel ferry operators <a href="Hoverspeed">Hoverspeed</a> and <a href="SeaFrance">SeaFrance</a>, local car dealership Perry's and are now sponsored by produce suppliers Gomez, the company owned by Dover Athletic chairman Jim Parmenter.

Dover Athletic's home ground since the club's foundation has been the Crabble Athletic Ground, which was also the home of the former Dover club. The word "Crabble", which is also found in the name of a local <a href="Crabble%20Corn%20Mill">corn mill</a>, may derive from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "crabba hol", meaning a hole in which crabs are found. The stadium, commonly known simply as "Crabble" or, imprecisely, as "The Crabble", forms part of a larger council-owned complex, and the earlier Dover club originally shared the lower pitch with a rugby club, but moved to the upper pitch in the 1950s, adding a grandstand in 1951, followed soon after by terracing and floodlights.

Dover Athletic continued to make improvements to the ground, although not in time to allow the club to take its place in the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a> in 1990. Subsequently, new turnstiles were installed and two new terraces and a second grandstand added. These improvements meant that the club was able to gain promotion after its second Southern League title in 1993. The stadium's modern capacity is 5,745 with 1,010 seats and 3,642 spectators under cover.

In 2007 the club announced that under the new sponsorship deal with <a href="SeaFrance">SeaFrance</a> the stadium would be known officially as the SeaFrance Crabble Stadium, but a year later it was announced that the deal would not be renewed due to the ferry operator's financial constraints. On 1 July 2008 local car dealership Perry's was announced as the club's new main sponsor and the stadium rebranded as the Perry's Crabble Stadium, an arrangement which lasted until 2012. Between 2003 and 2004 it was known as the <a href="Hoverspeed">Hoverspeed</a> Stadium under the terms of another such agreement. <a href="Margate%20F.C.">Margate</a> played their home matches at Crabble for two seasons from 2002 until 2004, while their own <a href="Hartsdown%20Park">Hartsdown Park</a> ground was being redeveloped.

In the club's early days Athletic struggled to attract crowds of over 150, but by the time the club reached the Conference, crowds at Crabble were averaging around 1,000. After the club's relegation to the Isthmian League Division One South, the average attendance fell to just over 800, but when the club returned to the Premier Division for the <a href="2008-09%20in%20English%20football">2008–09</a> season, the average attendance at Crabble was 1,293, the highest in the division. The highest home attendance in the club's history was 5,645 for the match against <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20F.C.">Crystal Palace</a> in the third round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> on 4 January 2015. Although Athletic's improved monetary position means that the Supporters' Trust is no longer required to financially support the club, it remains active as a fundraising organisation.

Dover Athletic's highest finish in the <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">English football league system</a> was in the <a href="2015-16%20in%20English%20football">2015–16</a> season, in which the team finished in fifth place in the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a>, the highest level of <a href="non-league%20football">non-league football</a> and the fifth level overall. The Whites have made 13 appearances in the final qualifying round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, but have only progressed to the first round proper three times. In the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20in%20English%20football">2010–11</a> season, Dover reached the third round for the first time, defeating <a href="Football%20League%20Two">Football League Two</a> teams <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a> and <a href="Aldershot%20Town%20F.C.">Aldershot Town</a> in the first two rounds before losing to <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> of <a href="Football%20League%20One">Football League One</a>. In the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20in%20English%20football">1997–98</a> season the Whites reached the semi-finals of the <a href="FA%20Trophy">FA Trophy</a> but missed out on an appearance at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley</a>, losing to <a href="Cheltenham%20Town%20F.C.">Cheltenham Town</a>. The largest number of points the team has accrued is 104 in the <a href="2008-09%20in%20English%20football">2008-09</a> season, and the highest total number of goals scored in a season is 89, scored in 40 matches in the <a href="1985-86%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a> season. The team's biggest ever win was an 8–0 defeat of <a href="East%20Preston%20F.C.">East Preston</a> in September 2009, and the heaviest defeat was a 7–1 loss to <a href="Poole%20Town%20F.C.">Poole Town</a> in April 1984.

The holder of the record for most appearances for Dover Athletic is Jason Bartlett, who played in 539 matches, and the all-time top goalscorer is Lennie Lee, with 160 goals. The club's record signing is <a href="Dave%20Leworthy">Dave Leworthy</a>, who joined the club from <a href="Farnborough%20Town%20F.C.">Farnborough Town</a> in 1993 for <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>50,000, which at the time was the highest transfer fee ever paid between non-league clubs. The highest confirmed fee received by the club was also £50,000, paid by <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> in 1997 for <a href="Ricky%20Reina">Ricky Reina</a>.

Dover Athletic have had 19 permanent managers (excluding caretaker managers) in the club's 25-year history, with Chris Kinnear's first stint being the longest. The shortest stay was Ian Hendon who was announced as manager on 28 May 2010 and resigned only 18 days later to join Andy Hessenthaler at <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>.


Dover Athletic's main rivalry is with nearby <a href="Folkestone%20Invicta%20F.C.">Folkestone Invicta</a>. A meeting between the two teams in 2004 was watched by a crowd of 2,278, a record attendance for a league match at Invicta's ground. The club also has a rivalry with <a href="Margate%20F.C.">Margate</a>. In the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Football%20Conference">2001–02</a> season, when both teams were in the <a href="Football%20Conference">Football Conference</a>, the two games between Margate and Dover were watched by a combined total of more than 6,000 spectators. The game played at Margate's <a href="Hartsdown%20Park">Hartsdown Park</a> stadium drew a crowd of 3,676, and 2,325 were in attendance for the game at Dover.

Len Hutton

Sir Leonard Hutton (23 June 1916 – 6 September 1990) was an English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played as an <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opening batsman</a> for <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> from 1934 to 1955 and for <a href="England%20national%20cricket%20team">England</a> in 79 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> between 1937 and 1955. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" described him as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of <a href="cricket">cricket</a>. He set a record in 1938 for the highest individual innings in a Test match in only his sixth Test appearance, scoring 364 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> against <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a>, a milestone that stood for nearly 20 years (and remains an England Test record). In 1952, he became the first professional cricketer of the 20th Century to captain England in Tests; under his captaincy England won <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> the following year for the first time in 19 years. Following the Second World War, he was the mainstay of England's batting, and the team depended greatly on his success.

Marked out as a potential star from his teenage years, Hutton made his debut for Yorkshire in 1934 and quickly established himself at county level. By 1937, he was playing for England and when the war interrupted his career in 1939, critics regarded him as one of the leading batsmen in the country, and even the world. During the war, he received a serious injury to his arm while taking part in a commando training course. His arm never fully recovered, forcing him to alter his batting style. When cricket restarted, Hutton resumed his role as one of England's leading batsmen; by the time of England's <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201950%E2%80%9351">tour to Australia in 1950–51</a>, the team relied heavily on his batting and did so for the remainder of his career. As a batsman, Hutton was cautious and built his style on a sound defence. Although capable of attacking strokeplay, both Yorkshire and England depended on him, and awareness of this affected his style. Hutton remains statistically among the best batsmen to have played Test cricket.

Hutton <a href="Len%20Hutton%20as%20England%20captain">captained the England Test team</a> between 1952 and 1955, although his leadership was at times controversial. His cautious approach led critics to accuse him of negativity. Never comfortable in the role, Hutton felt that the <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">former amateur players</a> who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knighted</a> for his contributions to cricket in 1956, he went on to be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring from the job in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became president of <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire County Cricket Club</a> in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.

Hutton was born on 23 June 1916 in the <a href="Moravian%20Church">Moravian</a> community of <a href="Fulneck">Fulneck</a>, <a href="Pudsey">Pudsey</a>, the youngest of five children to Henry Hutton and his wife Lily (née Swithenbank). Many of his family were local cricketers and Hutton soon became immersed in the sport, which he both played and read about with enthusiasm. He practised in the playground of Littlemoor Council School, which he attended from 1921 until 1930, and at <a href="Pudsey%20St%20Lawrence%20Cricket%20Club">Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club</a>, which he joined as a junior. At the age of 12, he made his first appearance for Pudsey St Lawrence's second eleven and by 1929 had reached the first team. Locals encouraged him to meet the <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> and England cricketer <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a>, a neighbour, from whom Hutton received coaching in Sutcliffe's garden. Sutcliffe was impressed by the young batsman, and commended him to Yorkshire as a good prospect.

Following this endorsement, Hutton went to the county's indoor practice shed at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> in February 1930. <a href="George%20Hirst">George Hirst</a>, a former Yorkshire cricketer responsible for assessing and coaching young players, believed that Hutton's batting technique was essentially already complete. <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a>, the Yorkshire pace bowler, was equally impressed, and helped Hutton to correct a minor flaw in his technique. Hutton was sufficiently encouraged to decide to attempt a career in professional cricket, but at the prompting of his parents decided to learn a trade as well. During 1930, he watched the Australian <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> hit 334 at Headingley in a Test match, then a record individual score in Tests—which he himself would surpass eight years later. Later that year, Hutton enrolled at Pudsey Grammar School where he spent a year studying technical drawing and quantitative work before joining his father at a local building firm, Joseph Verity. After becoming a professional cricketer, Hutton continued to work for the company during winter months until 1939.

By 1933, Hutton was regularly opening the batting for the Pudsey St Lawrence first team in the <a href="Bradford%20Cricket%20League">Bradford Cricket League</a>. By close observation of his opening partner, the former Yorkshire county batsman <a href="Edgar%20Oldroyd">Edgar Oldroyd</a>, Hutton further developed his batting technique, especially in defence. The local press soon identified Hutton as a player of promise, particularly after he scored a match-winning 108 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> in the <a href="Priestley%20Cup">Priestley Cup</a>. Senior figures within Yorkshire cricket identified him as a potential successor to <a href="Percy%20Holmes">Percy Holmes</a> as an opening partner to Sutcliffe; at this stage in his career, Hutton was also considered a promising <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> bowler. In the 1933 season Hutton was selected for the Yorkshire Second Eleven. Although he failed to score a run in either of his first two innings, over the season he scored 699 <a href="Run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> at an <a href="Batting%20average%20%28cricket%29">average</a> of 69.90. Yorkshire appointed <a href="Cyril%20Turner%20%28cricketer%29">Cyril Turner</a> as Hutton's mentor; <a href="Hedley%20Verity">Hedley Verity</a> and Bowes also offered Hutton guidance in his early career.

Hutton made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 1934, at the age of 17 the youngest Yorkshire player since Hirst, 45 years earlier. In his first match, against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a>, he was <a href="run%20out">run out</a> for <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">a duck</a> but scored an unbeaten 50 runs in his second match; he followed this with another half-century against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> on his <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> debut. He played regularly for the rest of the season but to prevent his overexposure to Championship cricket, Yorkshire limited his appearances and returned him periodically to the second eleven. In matches for the first team, Hutton shared large first-wicket <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnerships</a> with <a href="Wilf%20Barber">Wilf Barber</a> and with <a href="Arthur%20Mitchell%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Mitchell</a>, before scoring his maiden first-class century in an innings of 196 against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. At the time, he was the youngest Yorkshire batsman to score a first-class century. He finished the season with a total of 863 runs at an average of 33.19;

An operation on his nose before the 1935 season delayed Hutton's appearance on the cricket field that year. Attempting to return too quickly, he endured poor health which limited his subsequent appearances and effectiveness; by the middle of August he had scored a total of just 73 runs. A century against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> led to run of bigger scores, and his contribution to Yorkshire's County Championship victory that season was 577 runs at an average in first-class matches of 28.85. In the winter of 1935–36 Hutton went on his first overseas tour, as Yorkshire visited Jamaica. In the 1936 season he reached 1,000 runs in a season for the first time—1,282 runs at an average of 29.81—and was awarded his <a href="county%20cap">county cap</a> in July. He took part in several large partnerships through the season, including one of 230 with Sutcliffe, although he experienced a sequence of low scores in May and June.

Throughout his first seasons, Hutton faced press criticism for his caution and reluctance to play attacking shots. Although regarding him a certain England selection in the future, critics thought Hutton slightly dull and pedestrian. Yorkshire remained unconcerned; cricket writer Alan Hill believes Hutton's subsequent success was built on this initial establishment of a defensive technique. His achievements brought limited recognition, owing to the high level of expectation surrounding him. This sense of frustration was heightened by comments from Sutcliffe in 1935, when he wrote that Hutton was "a certainty for a place as England's opening batsman. He is a marvel – the discovery of a generation ... His technique is that of a maestro." Such praise was rare from Sutcliffe, but Hutton found the comments a burden, while others found them embarrassing.

After Hutton began 1937 with a series of high scores—including an innings of 271 against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a>, the reigning County Champions, and 153 against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a> two days later when he and Sutcliffe shared a 315-run opening partnership—he was chosen to play for England against New Zealand in the first Test match of the season. On 26 June, he made his Test debut at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a>, scoring 0 and 1. Retaining his place in the England team after scoring centuries for Yorkshire in the following games, he scored his maiden Test hundred on 24 July in the second Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford, Manchester</a>. He batted for three-and-a-half hours to score exactly 100 runs and shared a century opening partnership with <a href="Charlie%20Barnett%20%28cricketer%29">Charlie Barnett</a>. Hutton's remaining two innings in the Test series yielded 14 and 12, giving him 127 runs at an average of 25.40. Also in 1937, Hutton made his first appearance for <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">the Players against the Gentlemen</a> at Lord's. In total that year he scored 2,888 runs, more than double his previous seasonal best, at an average of 56.62 and including ten centuries. He also recorded the best bowling performance of his career, six wickets for 76 against Leicestershire, altogether taking ten wickets in the match—the only time he achieved this. His performances that year earned him selection as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. The citation praised his attitude, technique, fielding and bowling, noting however that some commentators continued to criticise his overcaution.

In early matches of the 1938 season, with an <a href="the%20Ashes">Ashes</a> series against Australia pending, Hutton made three centuries and scored 93 not out. Selected for a Test trial, he shared a century opening partnership with <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>, and was selected for the first Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a> in Nottingham beginning on 28 June. In just over three hours, Hutton scored 100 from 221 <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">deliveries</a> on his Ashes debut, adding 219 with <a href="Charlie%20Barnett%20%28cricketer%29">Charlie Barnett</a> for the first wicket. England, in <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a>'s first match as Test captain, posted a total of 658 for eight wickets, but the match was drawn. Hutton failed in the second Test, with two single figure scores in another drawn game. He was generally unsuccessful with the bat in the following weeks, during which the third Test was entirely rained off. Following a sequence of low scores for Yorkshire, Hutton's finger was broken in a match against Middlesex played on a dangerous pitch at Lord's. Consequently, he could not play in the fourth Test, played at his home ground, Headingley, in which England were soundly beaten. After missing a month of cricket, Hutton played just two games before his selection for the final Test of the series.

The last Test was played at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> and began on 20 August 1938. Hammond won the toss on a very good pitch for batting, and after an early wicket fell, Hutton and <a href="Maurice%20Leyland">Maurice Leyland</a>, his Yorkshire teammate, took the score to 347 for one wicket after the first day. Hutton was unbeaten on 160 although Australia missed a chance to dismiss him, <a href="Stumping">stumped</a>, when he had scored 40. After a rest day, the Yorkshire batsmen took their partnership to 382 before Leyland was out. Hutton then shared substantial partnerships with Hammond and <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20junior">Joe Hardstaff junior</a>, taking his personal score to 300 at the end of the second day, out of a total of 634 for five. In the process he surpassed the previous highest Test score by an England batsman in a home match. Hutton maintained caution throughout; "Wisden" commented that his dominance of the bowling had become slightly monotonous after two days, although it recognised his skill. On the third day (23 August), the Australians made a concerted effort to dismiss Hutton before he broke Bradman's 1930 record Ashes score of 334— the record score in a Test match was Hammond's 336 not out against New Zealand, but it was compiled against what was perceived as inferior bowling, and Bradman's total was more prestigious. Although showing nerves as he approached the record, Hutton passed Bradman's score with a <a href="Late%20cut">cut</a> off <a href="Chuck%20Fleetwood-Smith">Chuck Fleetwood-Smith</a>, and extended his score to 364 before he was out, caught. Lasting for more than 13 hours, with 847 <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">balls</a> faced, Hutton's innings was the longest in first-class cricket at the time. It was only the sixth Test of his career. The innings was the highest individual score in a Test until <a href="Garfield%20Sobers">Garfield Sobers</a> scored 365 in 1958; in 2016 it remains the 6th highest in Tests and is the most runs scored in an innings by an English player. England eventually scored 903, the highest team total in a Test at that time, before Hammond declared the innings closed. Australia were bowled out twice and England won by an innings and 579 runs to draw the series with one victory apiece.

Commentators mainly praised Hutton's concentration and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly when compared to Bradman's innings of 334, was excused on the grounds that the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible. Among views expressed by Test cricketers, <a href="Les%20Ames">Les Ames</a> believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a> described the innings as one of the greatest feats of concentration and endurance in the history of the game. Some critics expressed distaste at England's approach, but this opinion was not widely shared. In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous, in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of the worst things that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted. When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45.

From October 1938, Hutton toured South Africa with the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC)—the name by which England teams toured at the time—under the captaincy of Hammond; England won the series 1–0, with the other four games drawn. He scored centuries in two early matches but in a match against <a href="Gauteng%20cricket%20team">Transvaal</a>, a <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">delivery</a> from <a href="Eric%20Davies">Eric Davies</a> knocked him unconscious and forced him to miss the first Test. Unsuccessful on his return in the second Test, Hutton scored a double century in the following tour match, but had another low score in the third Test, which England won. He was more successful in the final Tests. In the fourth, on a difficult pitch for batting, he scored 92. The final Test was drawn after ten days of play in a supposedly "timeless" Test. In a match which set a record aggregate of runs, Hutton scored 38 and 55 but his contributions were overshadowed by the heavy scoring of others. Although Hutton scored 265 runs in the Test series, at an average of 44.16, critics were disappointed, expecting more after his record innings of 1938. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs at an average of 64.88, the highest aggregate among the tourists, and accumulated five centuries. Spectators found his batting attractive and the "Wisden" correspondent regarded him the most accomplished batsman on the tour.

In its summary of the 1939 season, "Wisden" noted the development of Hutton into a more exciting batsman to watch, observing that he "gave further evidence of being one of the world's greatest batsmen". He began to dominate opening partnerships with Sutcliffe, in contrast to prior seasons when he was the junior partner. In total, he scored 2,883 runs, over 400 more than any other batsman and his average of 62.27 placed him second in the national averages behind Hammond. Among his twelve centuries, Hutton scored his highest total for Yorkshire, 280 not out in six hours against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>, sharing an opening partnership of 315 with Sutcliffe. His contributions helped Yorkshire to their third successive Championship. He was also successful in representative matches, scoring 86 for the Players against the Gentlemen, and compiling 480 runs (averaging 96.00) in the Test matches against West Indies. England won the series, after recording victory in the first match and drawing the others. Hutton scored 196 in the first Test, hitting his last 96 runs in 95 minutes; he and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> scored 248 runs together in 133 minutes. After low scores in the second Test, Hutton scored 73 and 165 not out in the final game at the Oval. Facing a West Indian lead of 146, he batted five hours in the second innings, sharing a partnership of 264 with Hammond. He ended his season with a century against Sussex in Yorkshire's final match before the war; two days after its conclusion, the Second World War began.

At the beginning of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was recruited to the <a href="Army%20Physical%20Training%20Corps">Army Physical Training Corps</a> as a sergeant-instructor. Although no first-class cricket was played during the war, league and charity cricket matches continued and Hutton played several high-profile matches in 1940. But in March 1941, his future in cricket was threatened by a serious injury. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated his <a href="ulna">ulna</a> at the wrist. By the summer, surgery and rest initially looked to have repaired the injury; Hutton returned to his unit and resumed cricket, scoring a century in one game. However, he began to suffer increasing pain and underwent more surgery to graft bone from his legs onto the injured arm. A first operation failed, but the second attempt at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful. The surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right. He was discharged from the army in the summer of 1942 and, after a period of recovery, began work as a civilian for the <a href="Corps%20of%20Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>, inspecting the condition of government-owned properties. Hutton's recovery and return to cricket was closely followed by the wartime press, which kept track of many pre-war cricketers.

Hutton resumed professional cricket with Pudsey St Lawrence in 1943, briefly captaining the team before poor results and a disagreement with the committee led him to resign the captaincy. He played for Pudsey until 1945, batting successfully and helping the team to the Priestley Cup, but his relationship with the club remained strained and he did not play for them again after 1945. When the war ended in 1945, a programme of first-class matches was organised, involving counties and other teams. A series of matches was played between England and an <a href="Australian%20Services%20cricket%20team">Australian Services cricket team</a>, called <a href="Victory%20Tests">Victory Tests</a> although they were not official Test matches. Hutton played in all three games with mixed success. He scored 46 in the second match, but was struck painfully on his weak arm by a short ball from <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>, whom he encountered for the first time. After scoring 81 for Yorkshire against the Australian team, Hutton scored 104 and 69 in the final "Test". Another century followed for Yorkshire against the Australians, taking his first-class run aggregate to 782 runs at an average of 48.87 in nine games. Commentators were satisfied that his batting technique remained effective and that he could still succeed at the highest level. The showpiece match of the season was England against the Dominions at Lord's, but Hutton was prevented from appearing by his commitments to Pudsey.

County cricket fully resumed in 1946. Hutton was troubled by his injury; his wrists no longer rotated fully and he abandoned the <a href="hook%20shot">hook shot</a>. Nevertheless, he scored 1,552 runs at an average of 48.50, and was recognised by "Wisden" as Yorkshire's most effective batsman as the county won their fourth consecutive championship title. His four centuries included 183 not out against the touring Indian team, but he was less successful in the three Tests, scoring 123 runs at an average of 30.75. England won the series 1–0 but Hutton's only fifty was a defensive innings in the second Test, when he was troubled by a bad back. He was omitted from the Gentlemen and Players match, but was part of the <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201946%E2%80%9347">MCC team touring party</a> for the 1946–47 tour of Australia.

The MCC were reluctant to tour so soon after the war, but the Australian authorities were insistent. The tourists, led once more by Wally Hammond, were beaten 3–0 in the Test series, finding their opponents much stronger than expected. Hutton began the tour well, scoring two early centuries, the latter of which was described by "Wisden" as the best English innings of the tour. A string of other good performances drew praise from press and former players; one such report named him the best batsman in the world. However, Hutton failed to reach a score of 50 runs in the first three Tests; in the first, he was out for a first ball <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>, and in the second, a short ball from Keith Miller struck him on his injured arm. In the second innings of the latter game, he quickly scored 37, frequently <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">driving</a> the bowling of Miller and <a href="Fred%20Freer">Fred Freer</a> before the bat slipped from his hand and hit the wicket, ending the innings. Even so, the display was praised by critics.

In the final two Tests, Hutton shared three consecutive century opening partnerships with <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a>. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> and Miller targeted him. Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced the impression that he was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with <a href="tonsillitis">tonsillitis</a>, missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. "Wisden" noted that it took him time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.

Hutton's <a href="Tonsillectomy">tonsils were removed</a> before the start of the 1947 season but his poor health continued, forcing him to miss some games at the start of the season. Nevertheless, his form remained good and he scored four centuries in early matches. Yorkshire dropped to equal seventh in the County Championship, affected by the retirement of key players and the frequent loss of Hutton to representative cricket. In the Test matches Hutton did not initially score heavily. His highest innings after three Tests was only 24 runs, and critics called his place into question. He returned to form during the fourth Test, his first at Headingley, with a four-and-a-half-hour century on a difficult pitch for batting. Hutton scored 83 and 36 in the drawn final Test, and England won the series 3–0 with the other two games drawn. Hutton hit 344 runs in the Test series at an average of 44.00; in all first-class matches, he scored eleven centuries and totalled 2,585 runs at an average 64.62, although his achievements that season were overshadowed by those of <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> and Bill Edrich, who both broke the previous record for most runs scored in a season.

After 16 months of continuous cricket, Hutton chose to miss the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20West%20Indies%20in%201947-48">1947–48 winter MCC tour of the West Indies</a>. However, injuries severely affected that team, and its captain <a href="Gubby%20Allen">Gubby Allen</a> requested reinforcements. Subsequently, Hutton flew out to join the tour;<ref name="mcc47/48"></ref> Immediately after he arrived, having travelled for four days, Hutton played against <a href="Guyana%20national%20cricket%20team">British Guiana</a>, scoring 138 and 62 not out, before appearing in the third Test. After a century against Jamaica, Hutton played innings of 56 and 60 in the fourth and final Test, giving him 171 runs at an average of 42.75 in the series. He came top of the first-class averages for the tourists, with 578 runs at an average of 64.22, and was judged by "Wisden" as one of the few batting successes in a team which lost the four-Test series 2–0 and failed to win a single match on tour.

During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing more than half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs at a better average than anyone else in the side. In county matches, Hutton averaged 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen. Hutton's main challenge that season came from the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian side</a> which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In the early part of the tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton's confidence by targeting him. Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire's match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them when he appeared for MCC shortly after.

Hutton was selected for the first Test, but England were overwhelmed by the Australian fast bowlers and lost the match. After a failure in the first innings, Hutton scored 74 in the second, and briefly established dominance over Miller, who responded with a series of bouncers, one of which struck Hutton on the shoulder and provoked an angry reaction from the crowd. Miller him in very poor light at the start of the fourth day's play. At Lord's in the second Test, also lost by England, Hutton scored 20 and 13, but of more concern to critics was the manner in which he batted. In the second innings, England had to bat for a long time to save the game, "Wisden" noted that Hutton, in contrast to his opening partner Washbrook, looked "plainly uncomfortable". He was nearly dismissed several times before he was out for 13, and returned to the pavilion to an uncomfortable silence from the crowd. The former Australian batsman <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, covering the tour as a journalist, described it as Hutton's worst effort in a Test. <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a>, another former Australian player working as a journalist, said Hutton seemed to be struggling with concentration and was a shadow of his former self.

Following his struggles at Lord's, Hutton was omitted from the team for the third Test. Observers had noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers, which the English selectors saw as a poor example from a leading batsman. The decision generated considerable acrimony, but surprised and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat. Press and critics generally judged the omission a mistake, although the "Wisden" correspondent believed the decision to be correct as Hutton benefited from a break. In later years, <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a>, the England captain, agreed that the choice was a poor one. Hutton, who escaped most of the debate by playing in Scotland for Yorkshire, found the situation unsettling and Patrick Murphy, a sports journalist, writes that it "served to drive a reserved man further in on himself." Meanwhile, Hutton was chosen to captain the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's; he scored 59 and 132 not out.

Recalled to the England team for the fourth Test at Headingley, Hutton scored 81 and 57. Given an excellent reception by his home crowd, he shared a century opening partnership with Washbrook in both innings, the second time they had accomplished this feat. Critics considered Hutton to be a better batsmen when he returned and that these innings repaired his damaged reputation. Australia needed 404 to win on a pitch favouring spin, but the poor performances of the main bowlers allowed Australia to record a seven wicket win described by "Wisden" as "astonishing". Hutton's contribution to the second Australian innings was to bowl four overs and concede 30 runs. Australia's dominance in the series was sealed by a crushing win in the fifth Test. England were bowled out for 52 runs in the first innings, of which Hutton scored 30 before being last out to an exceptional catch down the leg side from wicketkeeper <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a>. "Wisden" described Hutton as "the one exception to complete failure", while other critics noted he always looked comfortable. Facing a huge deficit in their second innings, England were bowled out for 188. Hutton scored 64, playing a similar defensive role to his first innings. In the Test series, Hutton scored 342 runs at an average of 42.75. In all first-class matches, he reached 2,654 runs at an average of 64.73.

Hutton toured South Africa in the winter of 1948–49 with the MCC under the captaincy of <a href="George%20Mann%20%28cricketer%29">George Mann</a>. "Wisden" described Hutton's tour as a succession of triumphs until he tired at the end: "Hutton's driving aroused the greatest admiration, but all his strokes were stamped with the hallmark of class." Before the Test matches began, Hutton scored three centuries and then contributed 83 as England won the first Test. The next three Tests were drawn. In the second match, Hutton and Washbrook set a new Test match record opening partnership. In easy batting conditions, they shared 359 runs on the first day before Hutton was out for 158 after almost five hours batting. In more favourable bowling conditions in the third Test, Hutton scored 41 and 87, followed by 123 in the fourth game which settled England's second innings at a dangerous time. England won the final game to take the series 2–0, and Hutton finished the Test series with 577 runs at an average of 64.11, while in all first-class matches he recorded 1,477 runs at an average of 73.85.

The most successful season of Hutton's career in terms of runs scored was 1949; he scored 3,429 runs at an average of 68.58, the fourth highest aggregate of runs in an English season. In both June and August he scored over 1,000 runs; his 1,294 runs in June was a record for a single month and only Herbert Sutcliffe had previously passed 1,000 runs for a calendar month twice in a season. He scored a double century against Lancashire, only the second for a Yorkshire batsman in the fixture. With Hutton available for more matches than in the previous few seasons, Yorkshire shared the County Championship with Middlesex, their last success until 1959. In the four Test matches against the touring New Zealanders, all of which were drawn, Hutton scored 469 runs at an average of 78.16. He scored 101 in the first Test, and fifties in the second and third matches, before ending the series with an innings of 206 in the fourth Test, in which the second hundred runs took only 85 minutes.

Hutton scored 2,049 runs at an average of 56.91 in the 1950 season. Batting effectively on a succession of early season <a href="Sticky%20wicket">rain-affected wickets</a>, Hutton frequently top-scored for Yorkshire. Hutton's <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit match</a> against Middlesex was affected by rain, but other events, collections and insurance for loss of play gave Hutton £9,713, a record at that point for a Yorkshire cricketer. Two-thirds of the amount was invested on Hutton's behalf by the Yorkshire committee, following their usual practice; Hutton resented this paternalism from the committee, particularly as he did not receive the full amount until 1972. Hutton played in three of the four Tests against West Indies. In the first Test, hampered by a finger injury, he scored 39 and 45 as England recorded their only victory of the series. The West Indies won the second Test, their first Test victory in England, and won the final two Tests to take the series 3–1; Hutton missed the third Test with <a href="Low%20back%20pain">lumbago</a> but in the fourth Test scored 202 not out, <a href="Carry%20the%20bat">carrying his bat</a> through England's first innings. The West Indian spinners <a href="Sonny%20Ramadhin">Sonny Ramadhin</a> and <a href="Alf%20Valentine">Alf Valentine</a> caused difficulties for all the batsmen except Hutton, who always appeared comfortable. "Wisden" praised his effort as unforgettable.

Hutton was chosen to go on the <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201950-51">MCC tour of Australia in 1950–51</a>, under the captaincy of the <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a> <a href="Freddie%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Freddie Brown</a>. The latter was an unexpected choice as captain, after a struggle to find a suitable amateur for the role. As a compromise aimed at critics who favoured the appointment of a professional captain, the professional Denis Compton was made vice-captain, but Brown came to rely more on Hutton than on Compton for advice. The tour selectors, in an attempt to strengthen the batting line-up, asked Hutton to bat in the <a href="middle%20order">middle order</a> rather than his usual position as opener. He batted well in the early games but the team struggled. In the first Test, England dismissed Australia for 228 before rain made the pitch difficult for batting. In reply, England collapsed to 68 for seven before Brown <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture%23Declaration">declared</a> to make Australia bat again while the pitch was still treacherous. Australia in turn struggled to 32 for seven, before declaring to leave England needing 193 to win. By the end of the third day's play, victory seemed unlikely as England were 30 for six. Next morning on a slightly easier pitch, Hutton scored 62 not out, an innings which was widely acclaimed in the press. "Wisden" observed that he had "given yet another exhibition of his wonderful batsmanship on tricky turf ... Hutton thrashed the fast bowlers majestically and played the turning or lifting ball with the ease of a master craftsman." However, the team were bowled out for 122 and Australia won by 70 runs.

Hutton remained in the middle order for the second Test, which England lost by 28 runs, but resumed his role as opener for the rest of the tour and scored a century in the following state game. Hutton scored 62 in the third Test, but the Australian spinner <a href="Jack%20Iverson">Jack Iverson</a>, who caused the touring batsmen huge problems all series, bowled Australia to victory. Hutton's form continued in the fourth Test as he carried his bat for the second time in six months. "Wisden" observed: "Against Hutton the bowling looked almost mediocre, but most of the other batsmen made it appear lethal." He scored 156 not out and added 45 more runs in the second innings, but Australian won by 274 runs. With the series lost, England won the final game, their first victory over Australia since the war and Australia's first defeat in 26 matches; Hutton contributed scores of 79 and 60 not out and struck the winning run. Hutton scored 553 Test runs at an average of 88.83, and in all first-class matches accumulated 1,199 runs with five centuries and an average of 70.52. In contrast to his previous Australian tour, Hutton played the short ball comfortably. Reviewing the tour, "Wisden" stated, "With Hutton, figures did not lie. He stood head and shoulders above every other batsman and, taking all factors into consideration, worthily earned the description of the finest present-day batsman in the world."

Hutton scored 2,145 runs in 1951 with nine centuries, including his 100th in first-class cricket. The South Africans toured England, losing the Test series 3–1. After Hutton scored fifty in the first Test, which was won by South Africa, his 100th century almost came during the third Test, when he scored an unbeaten 98 in the second innings to take England to victory. But the innings provoked controversy when Hutton's teammates seemed to decline easy runs to allow Hutton the opportunity to reach his hundred before the end of the match, thereby jeopardising England's chances of victory in unsettled weather. The 100th century came a week later, against Surrey, when Hutton became the thirteenth player to achieve the landmark. He followed this immediately with 194 not out against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> and 100, in the drawn fourth Test at Headlingley. In the final Test, which England won to take the series, Hutton became the first man in Tests, and only the fourth in all first-class cricket, to be given out <a href="obstructing%20the%20field">obstructing the field</a>: he edged a ball in the air and legitimately knocked it away from his wickets with his bat; in doing so, he prevented a catch being taken and was given out. This remains the only such instance in Tests. Hutton ended the Test series with 378 runs at an average of 54.00. Late in the season, he scored a century against Gloucestershire to become the second Yorkshire player after Sutcliffe to complete centuries against the other 16 first-class counties.

Brown's resignation from the captaincy of England at the end of 1951 left no obvious replacement candidate. Traditionally, captains in county or Test cricket were amateurs, who usually came from privileged backgrounds, in contrast to professionals, who often came from the <a href="working%20class">working class</a>es. Consequently, class distinction pervaded cricket which was organised and administered by former and current amateurs, many of whom reasoned that professionals would not make good captains owing to their worries over safeguarding their contracts or concerns about affecting the livelihoods of other professionals. In 1952, the selectors judged that none of the serving amateur county captains possessed the required ability or experience to fill the role of England captain. Consequently, the selectors decided to radically depart from tradition and appoint a professional captain. All previous England captains in home Test matches had been amateurs, and no professional had captained England in any match in the 20th century. But, as widely anticipated by the press, Hutton was appointed to captain England in the first Test of a four-match series against the 1952 Indian tourists. He harboured private doubts whether the cricket establishment would accept a professional captain, but declined to turn amateur, as Wally Hammond had done in 1938. The decision met with broad approval from the press, and the editor of "Wisden" wrote: "In breaking with tradition and choosing a professional as captain the Selection Committee made a vital decision in the interests of England, because it should mean that in future no man will be picked as leader unless he is worth a place in the side." Hutton had not expected to be asked and had thought an amateur would have been appointed as usual. He presumed his appointment was an interim measure until a more suitable candidate could be found.

Before his home crowd at Headingley, Hutton's first match as captain was a success, although his tactics were cautious. The "Wisden" correspondent wrote: "For Hutton the match was a personal triumph. Tradition had been broken ... and he must have known that the eyes of the world were upon him. He did not falter and his astute leadership earned him many admirers". England won comfortably, although Hutton failed with the bat. In the second Test, Hutton scored 150 out of a total of 537, and although cautious once more, the "Wisden" editor believed his captaincy helped to secure a win. Following this match, the selectors appointed Hutton captain for the rest of the series. In the final two Tests, Hutton scored 104 and 86 and his bowlers dominated the Indian batsmen. The drawn final Test was ruined by weather, but England won the four match series 3–0, and Hutton scored 399 runs at an average of 79.80; in the whole summer he scored 2,567 first-class runs at an average of 61.11 with eleven centuries.

During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having held the Ashes since 1934 but critics considered England to have a good chance of winning the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by <a href="Fibromyalgia">fibrositis</a> which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed early in the second innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.

The fourth Test, in front of Hutton's home crowd, was his least successful of the series. He was bowled second ball by a <a href="yorker">yorker</a> from Lindwall and England struggled to remain competitive throughout the match. In the fourth innings of the game, Australia needed 177 runs to win, with 115 minutes of play remaining. Hutton used <a href="Trevor%20Bailey">Trevor Bailey</a> to bowl negatively and slow Australia down; his tactics, including time-wasting and the use of <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>, meant Australia could not score the runs in the available time and the match was drawn. It is possible that the idea came from Bailey himself, but the Australian press criticised Hutton for his negativity. In contrast, English critics believed the tactics were justified. Amid great public interest for the deciding fifth Test, Hutton lost his fifth successive toss but replying to Australia's first innings of 275, England established a narrow first-innings lead. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82. In reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners and England scored the necessary 132 runs to win their first series against Australia since 1932–33 and their first such home series win since 1926. "Wisden" praised Hutton's strategy and tactical sense, and he was widely acclaimed in the press, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett, the Australian captain, maintained. Hutton scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37 in the Tests, but found it mentally tiring to lead England. Meanwhile, some Yorkshire observers felt he should do more to improve discipline at the county. In the whole summer, he scored 2,458 runs at an average of 63.02.

In the winter of 1953–54, Hutton led the MCC on a tour of West Indies. Before the team left England, critics queried his appointment, arguing that a professional captain was unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton's authority was also compromised by the MCC, who did not give him the tour manager he requested; instead, they appointed the inexperienced <a href="Charles%20Palmer%20%28cricketer%29">Charles Palmer</a>, the Leicestershire captain, who had already been selected as a player on the tour. Palmer's dual role as player and manager blurred the lines of command. Hutton also found some of the professionals in the team to be difficult to lead, particularly <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a>, and <a href="Fred%20Trueman">Fred Trueman</a>. Off-field events often overshadowed the cricket. Amid growing independence movements in the region, Hutton believed his team was used as a political instrument to support colonial rule. The situation was further inflamed as journalists and English residents in the Caribbean placed great emphasis on an English victory, and the perception was that the series would establish the unofficial world champions. The standards of local umpiring were a further source of controversy. The crowds often made noisy protests about on-field events, often related to umpiring. The climax came in the third Test when missiles were thrown onto the outfield when the umpire judged <a href="Cliff%20McWatt">Cliff McWatt</a> was out; Hutton kept his team and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation. The attitude of some English players inflamed feelings, either through a perceived lack of courtesy, or their negative reactions to events on the field. Some critics held Hutton responsible for this, but the editor of "Wisden" later wrote: "[Hutton] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling—an experience all of them wish to forget. A few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless."

Hutton wanted to exploit what he saw as a West Indian weakness against pace, picking four fast bowlers for the first Test. In doing so, he misjudged the pitch; West Indies made a large score and won by 140 runs. Both captains employed time-wasting tactics in the match, and used negative <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a> bowling, outside <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29">leg stump</a>. In the second Test, Hutton scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another defeat after losing his seventh consecutive toss in Tests. England batted slowly throughout; Hutton was himself barracked for his slow, defensive batting during the match. England won the third Test by nine wickets, their first victory in the Caribbean since 1935. Hutton, who finally won the toss, scored 169 in seven hours and West Indies were bowled out twice. After a drawn fourth Test, England had to win the final Test to draw the series. Hutton lost the toss but his bowlers dismissed West Indies cheaply in good batting conditions. Hutton then batted for almost nine hours to score 205, his nineteenth and final Test century. "Wisden" observed that "For concentration and control, Hutton's innings ... scarcely could have been excelled." The innings ended amid another controversy when local officials and journalists accused Hutton of snubbing the congratulations of the Chief Minister <a href="Alexander%20Bustamante">Alexander Bustamante</a> during a tea interval. Hutton apologised, not having noticed Bustamante speaking to him, but was dismissed immediately when play resumed; the incident was prominently reported the following day. England's bowlers bowled out West Indies a second time and England scored the required runs to record a series-levelling victory, West Indies' first defeat in Jamaica in a Test. In its summary of the tour, "Wisden" said that Hutton showed mastery over every bowler. The correspondent wrote, "From first to last no batsman compared with Hutton ... Considering the weight of his many responsibilities and worries, Hutton played magnificent cricket". The press were generally supportive despite reservations over his caution. Swanton and Alan Gibson later credited England's recovery in the series to Hutton's batting and leadership. In five Tests, he scored 677 runs—his largest aggregate in a series—at an average of 96.71, the highest on either side. In all first-class matches, he made 780 runs at an average of 78.00.

Hutton missed large parts of the 1954 season on medical advice, suffering from mental and physical exhaustion brought about by the West Indian tour. He played in the first Test against Pakistan, on their first tour of England, scored a duck and missed the next two matches. In Hutton's absence, the selectors appointed the amateur <a href="David%20Sheppard">David Sheppard</a>, a theology student at the time; Sheppard achieved little batting success, but England won the two Tests in which he was captain. According to "Wisden" editor <a href="Norman%20Preston">Norman Preston</a>, influential figures within the cricket hierarchy blamed Hutton for the previous winter's events and attempted to replace him as captain. Two former England cricketers, <a href="Errol%20Holmes">Errol Holmes</a> and <a href="Walter%20Robins">Walter Robins</a>, the latter also a selector that year, favoured Sheppard over Hutton and persuaded him to offer his candidacy to captain the MCC in Australia that winter. Sheppard indicated he would accept the post and take a leave of absence from his studies if required. The press speculated that Hutton would step aside, but most newspapers favoured his continued leadership and ran stories alleging MCC prejudice against professional cricketers. Neither Hutton nor Sheppard publicly expressed an opinion, although Hutton informed the MCC he would tour Australia as captain or player as required, and both men remained on good personal terms throughout. Robins, seeing the strength of opinion, backed down. When Hutton returned to cricket in July, scoring two centuries, he was appointed captain of the MCC for the winter tour. Returning to captain a slightly weakened team for the fourth and final Test, Hutton failed with the bat, and Pakistan recorded their first Test victory. In his three Test innings of the season, Hutton scored just 19 runs. Owing to his reduced appearances, Hutton failed to reach 1,000 first-class runs for the first time since 1936, reaching 912 runs at an average of 35.07.

Expectations before the Australian tour were low after the confusion of the 1954 summer and some controversial selections. Trueman, <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> and <a href="Tony%20Lock">Tony Lock</a>, part of the winning 1953 team, were omitted; <a href="Colin%20Cowdrey">Colin Cowdrey</a> and <a href="Vic%20Wilson%20%28cricketer%29">Vic Wilson</a> were included. Hutton further downplayed his team's chances through exaggerating its inexperience to the Australian press; newspapers were already sympathetic to Hutton as a professional captain of a class-driven country. The team began the tour well. Hutton made a series of good scores in the opening games. But for the first Test, Hutton did not include a spinner in the team and chose to bowl on winning the toss, an unusual strategy in Australia. The home side scored 601, England dropped 12 catches and, with the key players Evans and Compton injured, lost by an innings; the press blamed Hutton for choosing to bowl. Despite the result, Hutton saw potential in <a href="Frank%20Tyson">Frank Tyson</a>'s bowling and arranged for <a href="Alf%20Gover">Alf Gover</a>, a respected coach who was in Australia as a journalist, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket. For the second Test, Hutton left out the unfit Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, to include two spinners, but in a low-scoring game, Tyson made the difference and England won by 38 runs. Hutton was unwell before the third Test, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold, and had to be persuaded out of bed by members of his team. He decided to play at the last minute and unexpectedly left out Bedser again, although he was fit to play. Hutton neglected to inform Bedser, who only learned of his omission when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match. Hutton contributed few runs, but Cowdrey and <a href="Peter%20May%20%28cricketer%29">Peter May</a> made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128-run victory. The fourth Test was crucial, and Hutton's innings of 80 runs in four-and-a-half hours was the highest of the game. "Wisden" believed Hutton's tactics were instrumental in giving his team the upper hand, and in the final innings, England needed 94 to win and retain the Ashes. Early wickets, including Hutton's, fell to Miller, and when the captain returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had "done us again." Compton, the next man in, replied "I haven't been in yet", and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton. England went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out. This ended the series, which England won 3–1.

Hutton's tactical approach in the series was praised by Australian and English commentators; they noted how Hutton observed his opponents carefully to spot weaknesses. His caution was criticised, but the main complaint was that he deliberately slowed the speed of play, reducing the number of overs bowled, allowing the fast bowlers to rest and restricting the rate at which Australia scored. With the bat, Hutton scored 220 runs in Tests at an average of 24.44. In all first-class matches in Australia, he scored 959 runs at 50.47. The tour ended with two Tests in New Zealand; England won the first by eight wickets, and the second by an innings and 20 runs. New Zealand were bowled out for 26 in their second innings, which, in 2018, remains the lowest Test score. In the latter match, Hutton scored 53 batting at number five in his final Test innings. He had played in 79 Test matches, scoring 6,971 runs at an average of 56.67 with 19 hundreds. As England captain in 23 matches, he won eight Tests and lost four, and along with <a href="Percy%20Chapman">Percy Chapman</a> was the only England captain to win consecutive series against Australia.

On Hutton's return to England, he was made an honorary member of the MCC, which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, a rare indication of confidence. After a poor start to the season, Hutton captained MCC against the tourists, but withdrew from the final day of the match with lumbago. His uncertain health led him to resign the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector. Hutton played for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours, his final first-class century. His last 100 runs came in an hour. After the following match, his back was too painful to continue and he did not play again that season. In eleven first-class matches, he scored 537 runs at an average of 29.83. In June, he was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> for services to cricket. Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. He was 39, an early retirement age for the period. He played one further match in 1957 for MCC against Lancashire, and two matches in 1960 for MCC and L. C. Stevens' XI. In all first-class cricket, he scored 40,140 runs at an average of 55.51 with 129 hundreds.

"Wisden" viewed Hutton, with <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a>, as "one of the two most accomplished professional batsmen to have played for his country", and following the Second World War, critics regarded him as the best batsman in the world. In October 2010, he was chosen as part of the ESPNCricinfo All-time World XI, a team selected by a panel of respected commentators and cricket writers to represent the greatest cricketers of all time. As part of the same process, he was also chosen in England's greatest team. The official Yorkshire history describes him as "technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire". E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next. Hutton was more cautious than these others. Following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded. Cricket historian <a href="David%20Frith">David Frith</a> believes that "there was an apparent touch of genius about his batsmanship", and Alan Gibson described Hutton's <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">off drive</a> as "the glory of the game." He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches. Of the next generation of England batsmen, Peter May tried to adopt Hutton's mental approach to both batting and captaincy, while Colin Cowdrey later said "I had tried to model myself on Len Hutton ever since I started playing serious cricket." Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. When he retired, only two men had scored more than his 6,971 Test runs; his average of 56.67 is seventh highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, as of 2016, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 of his 138 innings.

Hutton's batting technique was orthodox and conventional. John Woodcock writes that he seemed to possess great intuition, for example playing mystery spinners Ramadhin and Iverson with ease. His batting stance was relaxed and still, his first movement being to slide his right foot back and across towards middle stump. He often played the ball off the <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23B">back foot</a>, getting right back onto his stumps, but never played as far forward, preferring to let the ball come to him and play it late. Occasionally, he left a slight gap between his bat and pads, meaning he was sometimes bowled through it when out of form. This arose mainly through the wartime injury to his arm and by 1950 he had adjusted his technique to compensate and had fewer problems. Immediately before the war, Hutton batted in a more attacking style and several of his contemporaries remembered his attractive strokeplay. By his own admission, Hutton was not the same player after the war. A combination of the effects of his injury and the responsibility of opening the batting in generally weak Yorkshire and England teams, whose success often depended on Hutton, meant that he batted cautiously. Hutton only played attacking shots when they presented no risk, and he rarely lifted the ball in the air; he hit just seven sixes in Test matches. However, Patrick Murphy writes: "Just now and again he would play an innings of genius, when bowlers could not contain him." One such innings was his score of 37 in the second Test of 1946–47 in which the attacking shots he played reminded older spectators of <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>, regarded as the ultimate Australian strokeplayer. In all his innings, he was expert at hitting the ball just out of the reach of fieldsmen to allow runs to be taken. Several of his contemporaries believed he did not get enough credit for surviving the short-pitched attacks of the Australian bowlers following the war.

As captain, Hutton believed that the key to success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his selection of several promising fast bowlers. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down the game to allow the fast bowlers to rest, which set a precedent for other captains. Tactically, Norman Yardley found him "sound rather than venturesome". Run saving was his main priority, but during matches, he quickly adjusted his approach to attack the weakness of particular batsmen. Jim Kilburn believed that Hutton pursued a serious approach to all matches, to the point where he missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the "outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; he lit no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience."

Some of his selections as captain were widely debated. Following incidents in the Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both <a href="Jim%20McConnon">Jim McConnon</a>, Laker's replacement, and <a href="Vic%20Wilson%20%28cricketer%29">Vic Wilson</a> were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton found it hard to talk to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton played a key role in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and <a href="Brian%20Statham">Brian Statham</a>. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.

Cricket followers from the south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him with the result that Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.

Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, except in the absence of the official captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an excuse not to play. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the Yorkshire dressing room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. <a href="Ray%20Illingworth">Ray Illingworth</a>, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but "he didn't do anything about it". Illingworth recalled that he was a "distant hero", saying: "He was a funny man was Len—slightly sarcastic all the time. He'd hear an argument in the dressing room and he'd throw a bit of wood on the fire to keep it going. He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner."
Hutton married Dorothy Mary Dennis, the sister of former Yorkshire cricketer <a href="Frank%20Dennis">Frank Dennis</a>, on 16 September 1939 at <a href="Wykeham%2C%20Scarborough">Wykeham near Scarborough</a>; they met at an end-of-season dance which Dorothy had attended with her brother. They had two sons: <a href="Richard%20Hutton%20%28cricketer%29">Richard</a>, who later played cricket for Yorkshire and England, in 1942, and John in 1947.

During and after the war, Hutton worked for a paper manufacturer, but writing and journalism provided a more permanent career. Hutton worked with <a href="Thomas%20Moult">Thomas Moult</a>, a journalist and writer, to produce a book of memoirs, "Cricket is My Life" in 1949, and he wrote for the "<a href="News%20of%20the%20World">News of the World</a>" while still playing. Following his cricketing retirement, Hutton worked in broadcasting until 1961, and after 1955, he wrote for the London <a href="The%20Evening%20News%20%28London%20newspaper%29">"Evening News"</a> until 1963. A second book, "Just my story", followed in 1956 in collaboration with journalist, R. J. Hayter. In 1958–59, Hutton travelled to Australia to cover the MCC tour as correspondent for the "Evening News", again assisted by a professional journalist, while between 1963 and 1986, he wrote for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>". He wrote a third book, "Thirty Years in Cricket", in 1984. Hutton's increasing commitments in the south of England meant he moved to North London in 1959. In 1960, Hutton was invited to join the engineering firm of J. H. Fenner, mainly working in a <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> capacity. Later, he moved into marketing and overseas promotion of products, became a director of the firm in 1973, and retired in 1984.

Although he disliked committees, Hutton served as an England Test selector in 1975 and 1976, but business commitments limited his availability so he resigned in 1977. Hutton became involved with Surrey cricket in later years but maintained links with Yorkshire, and became president of Yorkshire county cricket in January 1990. In his final years, Hutton suffered from ill health and became increasingly frail. In September 1990, he suffered a <a href="Traumatic%20aortic%20rupture">ruptured aorta</a> shortly after watching a cricket match at the Oval. After an unsuccessful operation, he died on 6 September.

Lion-class battlecruiser

The "Lion" class were a pair of <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Nicknamed the "Splendid Cats", the ships were a significant improvement over their predecessors of the in terms of speed, armament and armour. These improvements were in response to the German battlecruisers of the , which were in turn larger and more powerful than the first British battlecruisers of the .

The <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>; they provided distant cover during <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> in 1917. In 1920 they were put into <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a> and were then sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> a few years later in accordance with the terms of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922.

The acceleration of the German naval building programme in 1907–1908 forced <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>'s <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Government</a> to yield to public pressure and authorise more ships for the 1909–1910 Construction Programme. Only a single <a href="battleship">battleship</a> and a battlecruiser had been authorised in 1908–1909, but three battleships and a battlecruiser were authorised in 1909–1910 with another three battleships and a battlecruiser planned as contingency ships to placate the public and the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>. Continuing pressure forced the Government to announce in July 1909 that the contingency ships would also be built. This pressure also allowed the Admiralty to gain approval to improve the size and power of its new ships so as to maintain qualitative superiority over the new German dreadnoughts then under construction.

The "Lion"-class battlecruisers were designed to be as superior to the new German battlecruisers of the "Moltke" class as the German ships were to the "Invincible" class. The increase in speed, armour and gun size forced a 40% increase in size over the "Indefatigable" class and made them the largest warships in the world. Their layout was adapted from the design of the first "super-dreadnought" class, the s of 1910, with 13.5-inch (343 mm) guns. The ships were the first battlecruisers to be armed with the new <a href="BL%2013.5%20inch%20/45%20naval%20gun">13.5-inch Mk V gun</a>. The design of the "Lions" remedied some of the shortcomings of the preceding battlecruisers, which suffered from an inability of the "en echelon" <a href="amidships">amidships</a> turrets to safely fire across deck, limiting them to a three-turret <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. This was done because the greater size and weight of the new guns rendered <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s impracticable. As such, all four turrets in the "Lion"s were arranged on the centreline; 'Q' turret was located amidships and could only fire on the broadside. The <a href="Director%20of%20Naval%20Construction">Director of Naval Construction</a>, Sir <a href="Philip%20Watts%20%28naval%20architect%29">Philip Watts</a>, suggested that a fifth turret, <a href="superfiring">superfiring</a> over the rear turret, could be added if the ship was lengthened by three frames, in total, and that this would add very little cost other than the £175,000 for the additional turret, but add 25% more firepower to the ship. This was not approved, possibly because of doubts about its feasibility.

The "Lion"s were significantly larger than their predecessors of the . They had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. They <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at normal load and at deep load, over more than the earlier ships. They had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of at deep load.

The "Lion"-class ships had two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="Direct%20drive%20mechanism">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each of which was housed in a separate <a href="engine%20room">engine room</a>. The outer <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s were coupled to the high-pressure turbines and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines which drove the inner shafts. A cruising stage was built into the casing of each high-pressure ahead turbine. Their three-bladed <a href="propeller">propeller</a>s were in diameter on the inner shafts and the outer propellers were in diameter. The turbines used steam provided by forty-two <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s in seven boiler rooms. They were designed to produce a total of , but achieved more than during trials. "Lion" did not reach her designed speed of , but "Princess Royal" achieved . They carried of coal and an additional of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, they could steam for at a speed of .

The "Lion"-class ships mounted eight <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23BL">BL</a> 13.5-inch Mark V guns in four twin hydraulically powered <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'Y'. Unlike the two previous classes of battlecruiser in the Royal Navy, which had turrets fore, aft and on each side of the ship, the "Lion"-class ships had their main armament mounted in a single line from front to rear, with 'B' turret superfiring over 'A' turret, 'Q' turret mounted amidships, and 'Y' turret aft. The guns had an <a href="elevation%20%28ballistics%29">elevation</a> range from −3° to +20°; their <a href="gunsight">gunsight</a>s were limited to +15° until super-elevating <a href="prism">prism</a>s were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; at +20° elevation, they had a range of . Their rate of fire was two <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">rounds</a> per minute. The ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.

The <a href="Battleship%20secondary%20armament">secondary armament</a> of the "Lion" class consisted of sixteen <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL 4-inch Mark VII guns</a>, most of which were mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s in single mounts. The guns had a maximum elevation of +15° which gave them a range of . They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. The ships were fitted with two submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each broadside.

The main guns were controlled from the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>. Data from a Argo <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> located on top of the conning tower was input into a Mk I <a href="Frederic%20Charles%20Dreyer%23Dreyer%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Dreyer Fire-Control Table</a> located in the <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23T">transmitting station</a> (TS) below the conning tower where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. 'B' and 'X' turrets were provided with nine-foot rangefinders and were fitted as secondary control positions.

Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the <a href="director%20%28military%29">director</a> firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via a pointer on a <a href="dial%20%28measurement%29">dial</a>, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the <a href="ship%20motions">roll</a> on the dispersion of the shells. "Lion" received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> and "Princess Royal" got hers in early 1916. A second director was added to each ship in 1918.

The armour protection given to the "Lion"s was heavier than that of the "Indefatigable"s; their waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> of <a href="Krupp%20armour">Krupp Cemented Armour</a> measured thick amidships in contrast to the belt of their predecessors. It thinned to 4 inches towards the ships' ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. They were also given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of 6 inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast the end turrets. The ends of the <a href="armoured%20citadel">armoured citadel</a> were closed off by 4-inch transverse <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>. Nickel-steel plating was used for the protective decks. The lower armoured deck was generally only thick except outside the citadel where it was . The upper armoured deck was situated at the top of the upper armour belt and was also only 1 inch thick. The forecastle deck armour ranged from .

The gun turrets had 9-inch fronts and sides and their roofs were thick. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were protected by 9 inches of armour above the deck, thinning to above the upper armour deck and below it. The sides of the conning tower were thick and it had a three-inch roof and communication tube. Nickel-steel <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>s thick were fitted abreast the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and shell rooms. Their <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a> uptakes were protected by nickel-steel splinter armour thick on the sides and 1 inch on the ends between the upper and forecastle decks. After the Battle of Jutland revealed their vulnerability to plunging shellfire, 1 inch of additional armour, weighing approximately , was added to the magazine crowns and turret roofs.

Only "Lion" was completed to the original design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a> and the tripod <a href="foremast">foremast</a>. This meant that hot <a href="Clinker%20%28waste%29">clinkers</a> and <a href="flue">flue</a> gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and <a href="halyard">halyard</a>s were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, "Lion" before being <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a>, and "Princess Royal" as she was <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a>, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower at the rear of the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.

The "Lion"-class ships were built without <a href="Anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft (AA) guns</a>, but a variety of weapons were fitted over the course of the war. These included the <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="QF%206%20pounder%20Hotchkiss">6-pounder (57 mm) Hotchkiss</a> gun on a High Angle (HA) Mk Ic mounting. Each ship was fitted with one in October 1914, but "Lion"s gun was removed in July 1915, and "Princess Royal"s was removed in December 1916. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3-inch (76 mm) 20 cwt</a> AA guns on high-angle Mk II mounts were also used that had an elevation range between -10° and +90°. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The guns had a maximum ceiling of . "Lion" received a pair of these weapons in 1915 and retained them for the rest of the war. "Princess Royal" was fitted with one gun in January 1915 and it was removed in April 1917. She received two 4-inch Mark VII guns on HA Mk II mounts capable of 60° of elevation in April 1917 and a pair of single <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun%23QF%202-pounder%20Mark%20II">2-pounder Mk II "pom-poms"</a> were added in April 1919. They fired shells weighing at a muzzle velocity of to a maximum range of . Their <a href="cyclic%20rate">cyclic rate</a> of fire was 200 rounds per minute; the actual rate was significantly less.

The pole foremast was modified to a tripod after 1916. This was due to the increased weight of masthead fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 "Lion" and "Princess Royal" received <a href="searchlight">searchlight</a> towers on the aft funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from the aft battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on 'Q' and 'X' turrets for <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> and <a href="Sopwith%201%C2%BD%20Strutter">Sopwith 1½ Strutter</a> aircraft, and "Lion" was fitted with a torpedo control station at the aft end of her aft superstructure.

Upon commissioning, both "Lion" and "Princess Royal" were assigned to the <a href="1st%20Cruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Cruiser Squadron</a>, which was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in January 1913, of which "Lion" became the flagship. <a href="Rear-Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a> assumed command of the 1st BCS on 1 March 1913. The sisters, along with the rest of the 1st BCS, made a port visit to <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> in February 1914 and the squadron visited Russia in June.

The first action for "Lion" and "Princess Royal" was during the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. Beatty's ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case the large ships of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the <a href="sand%20bar">sand bar</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Jade%20Estuary">Jade Estuary</a>. The brand-new <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when the battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. "Strassburg" was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but "Cöln" remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly to his front. He turned in pursuit and reduced her to a flaming hulk. The battlecruisers encountered the crippled "Cöln" shortly after turning north and she was sunk by "Lion" after a few <a href="salvo">salvo</a>es.

"Princess Royal" was detached in November to reinforce the <a href="North%20America%20and%20West%20Indies%20Station">North Atlantic and Caribbean Squadrons</a> in the search for Admiral <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Graf Spee</a>'s East Asia Squadron after it destroyed the West Indies Squadron of Rear-Admiral <a href="Christopher%20Cradock">Christopher Cradock</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronel">Battle of Coronel</a>. She returned home the next month after the German ships had been sunk at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a>.

The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier <a href="Raid%20on%20Yarmouth">Raid on Yarmouth</a> on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a> afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a> to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. The Germans did not know that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey; they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including "Lion", as well as the <a href="2nd%20Battle%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battle Squadron</a> with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.

Hipper set sail on 15 December for another raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet in the early morning and fought an inconclusive action with them. Communications failures meant that Beatty was not notified of this encounter for several hours afterwards, but he turned in pursuit of the German ships once he learned of their presence. The lead British ships were closing in on the Germans when Beatty learned that <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> was being shelled later that morning and he turned west to intercept the other German force.
The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty's ships passed to the north while the 2nd Battle Squadron passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. They spotted a German cruiser a few minutes later and Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships, thinking that they were the advance screen for Hipper's ships. Those were 50 km (31 mi) behind. Another British communications failure allowed the German light cruisers to escape and they alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and escaped.

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Hipper <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. The British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers. Contact was initiated the following morning when "Arethusa" spotted the German light cruiser and the Germans had spotted Beatty's force a few minutes later. Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to "Blücher"s maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, "Lion", "Princess Royal" and , were doing in pursuit and "Lion" opened fire at very long range. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves about 20 minutes later and concentrated their fire on "Lion". and combined their fire to cripple "Lion" over the next hour even though "Princess Royal" engaged "Derfflinger" during this period. Another <a href="Maritime%20flag%20signalling">signalling</a> failure caused the British ships to focus on sinking "Blücher" when Beatty intended most of his ships to continue the pursuit of the battlecruisers. During this time "Princess Royal" hit "Blücher" at least twice, including the hit that crippled her and allowed the other British ships to engage. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze. He then transferred to a destroyer and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before "Blücher" sank and boarded "Princess Royal". Beatty ordered the pursuit resumed of the German battlecruisers, but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking "Blücher" and that Hipper's ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. "Lion" was headed home at when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her. Later that afternoon, the battlecruiser was ordered to take "Lion" under tow. It took almost two days to reach port. The ship was under repair for the next three months and did not rejoin the fleet until 7 April. "Princess Royal" was not damaged during the battle.

On 31 May 1916, "Princess Royal" was the flagship of the 1st BCS, under the command of <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Osmond%20Brock">Osmond Brock</a>. The squadron had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet, led by Beatty in "Lion", to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the British ships to their west by mid-afternoon and turned about to fall back on the German battleships, then about behind him. Beatty turned to cut him off, but was out of position to do that and had to settle for a pursuit. This began what was to be called the "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course. The Germans opened fire first, three minutes later, followed almost immediately afterward by the British. The sisters were in the lead and were engaged by their opposite numbers, the battlecruisers, and "Derfflinger". Fire from both German ships was very accurate, and both "Lion" and "Princess Royal" were hit twice within three minutes of the Germans' opening fire. "Lion" scored her first hit on "Lützow" two minutes later, but one of "Lützow"s 305 mm (12 in) shells hit 'Q' turret at 16:00. It blew the front roof and the centre face plates off the turret, killed or wounded everyone inside, and started a fire that continued to smoulder despite efforts to put it out. Accounts of subsequent events differ, but the magazine doors had been closed and the magazine flooded when the smouldering fire ignited the propellant charges in the turret working room at 4:28. They burnt violently, with the flames reaching as high as the masthead, and killed most of the magazine and shell room crews still in the lower part of the mounting. The gas pressure severely buckled the magazine doors, and it is probable that the magazine would have exploded, sinking the ship, if it had not already been flooded. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. After confirming the sighting himself, Beatty ordered his ships to turn around and fall back upon the oncoming Grand Fleet. During the Run to the South "Princess Royal" was hit a total of six times by "Derfflinger", but none of them were serious.
"Lion" was hit twice more, during what came to be called the Run to the North, after the German battlecruisers made their own turn north. Beatty's ships slowly moved out of range and rendezvoused with the main body of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre. By 18:35 Beatty was following the <a href="3rd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Battlecruiser Squadron</a> as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Beatty then turned his ships southeast and to the south-southeast to search for Hipper's ships.
Scheer finally disengaged around 19:15 and the British lost sight of the Germans until 20:05 when the light cruiser spotted smoke bearing west-northwest. Ten minutes later she closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. "Inflexible" opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty's battlecruisers. Shortly after 20:30 the <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of Rear Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans were able to fire only a few rounds in reply because of the poor visibility and turned away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 20:40. After this Beatty changed course to south-southeast and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 02:55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course.
"Lion", "Princess Royal" and the rest of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth on the morning of 2 June where "Lion" began repairs that lasted until 19 July. The remains of 'Q' turret were removed during this period and not replaced until a visit to <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> at <a href="Elswick%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Elswick</a> that lasted from 6 to 23 September. "Princess Royal" began repairs that lasted until 10 June. She sailed later that day for Devonport Royal Dockyard where more permanent repairs were made and was back at Rosyth by 21 July.

"Lion" rejoined the Battlecruiser Fleet, again as Beatty's flagship, on 19July. On the evening of 18August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">Squadron</a>, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> the following day, with extensive reconnaissance provided by <a href="airship">airship</a>s and <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29dreadnoughts and 6battlecruisers. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore <a href="Reginald%20Tyrwhitt">Tyrwhitt</a>. Having realised their mistake the Germans then turned for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home, the British having lost two cruisers to submarine attacks and the Germans having a dreadnought battleship damaged by a torpedo.
"Lion" became the flagship of Vice-Admiral <a href="William%20Christopher%20Pakenham">W. C. Pakenham</a> in December 1916 when he assumed command of the Battlecruiser Fleet upon Beatty's promotion to command of the Grand Fleet. "Lion" had an uneventful time for the rest of the war conducting patrols of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> as the High Seas Fleet was forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces. "Lion" and "Princess Royal", along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. When the High Seas Fleet sailed for <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> on 21 November 1918 to be interned, "Lion" was among the escorting ships. Along with the rest of the 1st BCS, "Lion" and "Princess Royal" guarded the interned ships until both ships were assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919.

"Lion" was placed in reserve in March 1920, <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> on 30 March 1922, and sold for scrap on 31January 1924 for £77,000. "Princess Royal" was placed in reserve in 1920 and an attempt to sell her to <a href="Chile">Chile</a> in mid-1920 was unsuccessful. She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief Scottish Coast on 22February 1922, but was sold for <a href="scrap">scrap</a> in December 1922. Both ships were scrapped to meet the tonnage limitations of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>.

Tintin in the Congo

Tintin in the Congo (; ) is the second volume of "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a>", the comics series by Belgian cartoonist <a href="Herg%C3%A9">Hergé</a>. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children's supplement , it was <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serialised</a> weekly from May 1930 to June 1931 before being published in a collected volume by Éditions de Petit Vingtième in 1931. The story tells of young Belgian reporter <a href="Tintin%20%28character%29">Tintin</a> and his dog <a href="Snowy%20%28character%29">Snowy</a>, who are sent to the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a> to report on events in the country. Amid various encounters with the native Congolese people and wild animals, Tintin unearths a criminal diamond <a href="smuggling">smuggling</a> operation run by the American gangster <a href="Al%20Capone">Al Capone</a>.

Following on from "<a href="Tintin%20in%20the%20Land%20of%20the%20Soviets">Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</a>" and bolstered by publicity stunts, "Tintin in the Congo" was a commercial success within Belgium and was also serialised in France. Hergé continued "The Adventures of Tintin" with "<a href="Tintin%20in%20America">Tintin in America</a>" in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the <a href="Franco-Belgian%20comics">Franco-Belgian comics tradition</a>. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured "Tintin in the Congo" in his distinctive "<a href="Ligne%20claire">ligne-claire</a>" style for republication by <a href="Casterman">Casterman</a>, with further alterations made at the request of his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.

In the late 20th century, "Tintin in the Congo" became increasingly controversial for both its perceived <a href="racism">racist</a> colonial attitude toward the Congolese and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on "The Adventures of Tintin" describing it as one of Hergé's lesser works.

Belgian reporter <a href="Tintin%20%28character%29">Tintin</a> and his dog <a href="Snowy%20%28character%29">Snowy</a> travel to the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a>, where a cheering crowd of native Congolese greet them. Tintin hires a native boy, <a href="Coco%20%28comics%29">Coco</a>, to assist him in his travels, and soon thereafter Tintin rescues Snowy from a <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>. A criminal stowaway attempts to kill Tintin, but monkeys throw coconuts at the stowaway that knock him unconscious. A monkey kidnaps Snowy, but Tintin saves him by disguising himself as another monkey.

The next morning, Tintin, Snowy, and Coco crash their car into a train, which the reporter fixes and tows to the village of the Babaorum tribe. He meets the king, who accompanies him on a hunt the next day. A lion knocks Tintin unconscious, but Snowy rescues him by biting off its tail. Tintin gains the admiration of the natives, making the Babaorum witch-doctor Muganga jealous. When he cures a man using <a href="quinine">quinine</a>, he is hailed as a "Boula Matari" ("Breaker of rocks"). With the help of the criminal stowaway, Muganga accuses Tintin of destroying the tribe's sacred idol. The enraged villagers imprison Tintin, but then turn against Muganga when Coco shows them footage Tintin had made of the witch-doctor and the stowaway conspiring to destroy the idol. Tintin becomes a hero in the village, and a local woman bows down to him, saying, "White man very great! Has good spirits ... White mister is big <a href="juju">juju</a> man!"

Angered, Muganga starts a war between the Babaorum and their neighbours, the M'Hatuvu, whose king leads an attack on the Babaorum village. Tintin outwits them, and the M'Hatuvu cease hostilities and come to idolise Tintin. Muganga and the stowaway plot to kill Tintin and make it look like a <a href="leopard">leopard</a> attack, but Tintin survives and saves Muganga from a <a href="boa%20constrictor">boa constrictor</a>; Muganga pleads mercy and ends his hostilities. The stowaway attempts to capture Tintin again and eventually succeeds disguised as a Catholic missionary. They fight across a waterfall, and the stowaway is eaten by crocodiles. After reading a letter from the stowaway's pocket, Tintin finds that someone called "A.C." has ordered his elimination. Tintin captures a criminal who tried to rendezvous with the stowaway and learns that "A.C." is the American gangster <a href="Al%20Capone">Al Capone</a>, who is trying to gain control of African diamond production. Tintin and the colonial police arrest the rest of the diamond smuggling gang and Tintin and Snowy return to Belgium.

Georges Remi—best known under the pen name <a href="Herg%C3%A9">Hergé</a>—was employed as editor and illustrator of (""The Little Twentieth""), a children's supplement to (""The Twentieth Century""), a staunchly Roman Catholic, <a href="social%20conservatism">conservative</a> Belgian newspaper based in Hergé's native <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Run by the <a href="Abb%C3%A9">Abbé</a> <a href="Norbert%20Wallez">Norbert Wallez</a>, the paper described itself as a "Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information" and disseminated a far-right, fascist viewpoint. According to <a href="Harry%20Thompson">Harry Thompson</a>, such political ideas were common in Belgium at the time, and Hergé's milieu was permeated with conservative ideas revolving around "patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline, and naivety".

In 1929, Hergé began "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a>" comic strip for , a series about the exploits of a fictional Belgian reporter named Tintin. Following the success of "<a href="Tintin%20in%20the%20Land%20of%20the%20Soviets">Tintin in the Land of the Soviets</a>", <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serialised</a> weekly in "Le Petit Vingtième" from January 1929 to May 1930, Hergé wanted to send Tintin to the United States. Wallez insisted he write a story set in the Belgian Congo, then a <a href="Belgian%20colonial%20empire">Belgian colony</a> and today the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>. Belgian children learned about the Congo in school, and Wallez hoped to encourage colonialist and missionary zeal in his readership. He believed that the Belgian colonial administration needed promotion at a time when memories "were still fairly fresh" of the 1928 visit to the colony by the Belgian <a href="Albert%20I%20of%20Belgium">King Albert</a> and <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Bavaria%20%281876%E2%80%931965%29">Queen Elisabeth</a>. He also hoped that some of his readers would be inspired to work in the Congo.

Hergé characterised Wallez's instructions in a sarcastic manner, saying Wallez referred to the Congo as "our beautiful colony which has great need of us, tarantara, tarantaraboom". He already had some experience in illustrating Congolese scenes; three years previously, Hergé had provided two illustrations for the newspaper that appeared in an article celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of <a href="Henry%20Morton%20Stanley">Henry Morton Stanley</a>'s expedition to the Congo. In one of these, Hergé depicted a native Congolese bowing before a European, a scene that he repeated in "Tintin in the Congo".

As in "Land of the Soviets", where Hergé had based his information about the Soviet Union almost entirely on a single source, in "Tintin in the Congo" he used limited source material to learn about the country and its people. He based the story largely on literature written by missionaries, with the only added element being that of the diamond <a href="smuggling">smugglers</a>, possibly adopted from the ""<a href="Jungle%20Jim">Jungle Jim</a>"-type serials". Hergé visited the <a href="Royal%20Museum%20for%20Central%20Africa">Colonial Museum</a> of <a href="Tervuren">Tervuren</a>, examining their ethnographic collections of Congolese artefacts, including costumes of the <a href="Leopard%20Society">Leopard Men</a>. He adopted hunting scenes from <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Maurois">André Maurois</a>'s novel "The Silence of Colonel Bramble", while his animal drawings were inspired by <a href="Benjamin%20Rabier">Benjamin Rabier</a>'s prints. He also listened to tales of the colony from some of his colleagues who had been there, but disliked their stories, later claiming: "I didn't like the colonists, who came back bragging about their exploits. But I couldn't prevent myself from seeing the Blacks as big children, either."

"Tintin in the Congo" was serialised under the French title of "Tintin au Congo" in "Le Petit Vingtième" from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was <a href="print%20syndication">syndicated</a> to the French Catholic newspaper "<a href="C%C5%93urs%20Vaillants">Cœurs Vaillants</a>". Drawn in black and white, it followed the same formula employed in "Land of the Soviets", remaining "essentially plotless" according to Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week. Hergé later commented on the process of writing these early adventures, stating, "The came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week." The strip's visual style was similar to that of "Land of the Soviets". In the first instalment of "Tintin in the Congo", Hergé featured <a href="Quick%20and%20Flupke">Quick and Flupke</a>, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another "Le Petit Vingtième" comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.

Like "Land of the Soviets", "Tintin in the Congo" was popular in Belgium. On the afternoon of 9 July 1931, Wallez repeated the publicity stunt he had used when "Soviets" ended by having a young actor, Henry de Doncker, dress up as Tintin in colonial gear and appear in Brussels and then <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a>, accompanied by 10 African bearers and an assortment of exotic animals hired from a zoo. Co-organised with the <a href="Bon%20March%C3%A9">Bon Marché</a> department store, the event attracted 5,000 spectators in Brussels. In 1931, Brussels-based Éditions de Petit Vingtième collected the story together into a single volume, and <a href="Casterman">Casterman</a> published a second edition in 1937. By 1944 the book had been reprinted seven times, and had outsold each of the other seven books in the series. The series' success led Wallez to renegotiate Hergé's contract, giving him a higher salary and the right to work from home.

In the 1940s, after Hergé's popularity increased, he redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin stories in colour using the ("clear line") drawing style he had developed, so that they fitted in visually with the newer "Adventures of Tintin" that he had produced. Hergé first made some changes in this direction in 1940, when the story was serialised in the Dutch-language "<a href="Het%20Laatste%20Nieuws">Het Laatste Nieuws</a>".

At Casterman's prompting, "Tintin in the Congo" was subsequently fully re-drawn, and the new version was published in 1946. As a part of this modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and <a href="Colonialism">colonial rule</a>. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about <a href="geography">geography</a>, he states in the 1930–31 version, "My dear friends, today I'm going to talk to you about your country: Belgium!" whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white "supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe."

In the 1946 colour version, Hergé added a cameo appearance from <a href="Thomson%20and%20Thompson">Thomson and Thompson</a>, the two detectives that he had introduced in the fourth Tintin story, "<a href="Cigars%20of%20the%20Pharaoh">Cigars of the Pharaoh</a>" (1932–34), which was chronologically set after the Congolese adventure. Adding them to the first page, Hergé featured them in the backdrop, watching a crowd surrounding Tintin as he boards a train and commenting that it "Seems to be a young reporter going to Africa ..." In the same frame, Hergé inserted depictions of himself and his friend <a href="Edgar%20P.%20Jacobs">Edgar P. Jacobs</a> (the book's colourist) into the crowd seeing Tintin off.

When "Tintin in the Congo" was first released by the series' Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin's gun.

Although publishers worldwide had made it available for many years, English publishers refused to publish "Tintin in the Congo" because of its racist content. In the late 1980s, Nick Rodwell, then agent of <a href="Studios%20Herg%C3%A9">Studios Hergé</a> in the United Kingdom, told reporters of his intention to finally publish it in English and stated his belief that publishing the original 1931 black and white edition would cause less controversy than releasing the 1946 colour version. After more delay, in 1991—sixty years after its original 1931 publication—it was the last of "The Adventures of Tintin" to see publication in English. The 1946 colour version appeared in English in 2005, published by <a href="Egmont%20Publishing">Egmont</a>.

Hergé biographer <a href="Pierre%20Assouline">Pierre Assouline</a> believed that Hergé's drawing became more assured throughout the first version of the story without losing any of its spontaneity. He thought that the story began in "the most inoffensive way", and that throughout the story Tintin was portrayed as a <a href="Scout%20%28Scouting%29">Boy Scout</a>, something he argued reflected Hergé's "moral debt" to Wallez. Biographer <a href="Beno%C3%AEt%20Peeters">Benoît Peeters</a> opined that "Tintin in the Congo" was "nothing spectacular", with some "incredibly cumbersome" monologues, but he thought the illustrations "a bit more polished" than those in "Land of the Soviets". Believing the plot to be "extremely simple", he thought that Tintin's character was like a child manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines.
Michael Farr felt that, unlike the previous Tintin adventure, some sense of a plot emerges at the end of the story with the introduction of the American diamond-smuggling racket. <a href="Philippe%20Goddin">Philippe Goddin</a> thought the work to be "more exciting" than "Land of the Soviets" and argued that Hergé's depiction of the native Congolese was not mocking but a parody of past European militaries.
By contrast, Harry Thompson believed that ""Congo" is almost a regression from "Soviets"", in his opinion having no plot or characterisation; he described it as "probably the most childish of all the Tintin books." Simon Kuper of the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" criticised both "Land of the Soviets" and "Tintin in the Congo" as the "worst" of the "Adventures", opining that they were "poorly drawn" and "largely plot-free".

Farr saw the 1946 colour version as poorer than the black and white original; he said it had lost its "vibrancy" and "atmosphere", and that the new depiction of the Congolese landscape was unconvincing and more like a European zoo than the "parched, dusty expanses of reality". Peeters took a more positive attitude towards the 1946 version, commenting that it contained "aesthetic improvements" and "clarity of composition" because of Hergé's personal development in draughtsmanship, as well as an enhancement in the dialogue, which had become "more lively and fluid."

In his <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalytical</a> study of the series, <a href="Jean-Marie%20Apostolid%C3%A8s">Jean-Marie Apostolidès</a> highlighted that in the Congolese adventure, Tintin represented progress and the Belgian state was depicted as a model for the natives to imitate. In doing so, he argued, they could become more European and thus civilised from the perspective of Belgian society, but that instead they ended up appearing as parodies. Opining that Tintin was imposing his own view of Africa onto the Congolese, Apostolidès remarked that Tintin appeared as a god-figure, with evangelical overtones in the final scene. Literary critic <a href="Tom%20McCarthy%20%28novelist%29">Tom McCarthy</a> concurred that Tintin represented the Belgian state, but also suggested that he acted as a Christian missionary, even being "a kind of god" akin to the character of <a href="Kurtz%20%28Heart%20of%20Darkness%29">Kurtz</a> in <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>'s "<a href="Heart%20of%20Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a>" (1899). McCarthy compared the scene where Tintin exposes Muganga as a fraud to that in which the character of <a href="Prospero">Prospero</a> exposes the magician in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>".

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised "Tintin in the Congo" as <a href="racism">racist</a> due to its portrayal of the <a href="Stereotypes%20of%20Africans">Congolese as infantile and stupid</a>. According to Tom McCarthy, Hergé depicted the Congolese as "good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery." There had been no such controversy when originally published, because it was only following the <a href="decolonization%20of%20Africa">decolonization of Africa</a>, which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, that Western attitudes towards indigenous Africans shifted. Harry Thompson argued that one must view "Tintin in the Congo" in the context of European society in the 1930s and 1940s, and that Hergé had not written the book to be "deliberately racist". He argued that it reflected the average Belgian view of Congolese people at the time, one that was more "patronising" than malevolent. Jean-Marie Apostolidès supported this idea, as did biographer Benoît Peeters, who asserted, "Hergé was no more racist than the next man." After meeting Hergé in the 1980s, Farr commented, "You couldn't have met someone who was more open and less racist."

Contrastingly, biographer Pierre Assouline stated that in 1930s Belgium, Hergé would have had access to literature by the likes of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gide">André Gide</a> and <a href="Albert%20Londres">Albert Londres</a> that was critical of the colonial regime. Assouline claimed that Hergé instead chose not to read such reports because they conflicted with the views of his conservative milieu. Laurence Grove—President of the International "Bande Dessinée" Society and an academic at the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a>—concurred, remarking that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that "[w]hen it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that's what he was." Comic book historian Mark McKinney noted that other Franco-Belgian comic artists of the same period had chosen to depict the native Africans in a more favourable light, citing the examples of <a href="Jij%C3%A9">Jijé</a>'s 1939 work "<a href="Blondin%20et%20Cirage">Blondin et Cirage</a>" ("Blondy and Shoe-Black"), in which the protagonists are adopted brothers, one white, the other black, and "Tif et Tondu", which was serialised in "<a href="Spirou%20%28magazine%29">Spirou</a>" from 1939 to 1940 and in which the Congolese aid the Belgians against their American antagonists.

Farr and McCarthy stated that "Tintin in the Congo" was the most popular Tintin adventure in Francophone Africa. According to Thompson, the book remained hugely popular in the Congo even after the country achieved independence in 1960. Nevertheless, government figures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have criticised the book. In 2004, after the Belgian <a href="Minister%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Belgium%29">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> <a href="Karel%20De%20Gucht">Karel De Gucht</a> described President <a href="Joseph%20Kabila">Joseph Kabila</a>'s provisional DRC government as incompetent, Congolese Information Minister Henri Mova Sakanyi accused him of "racism and nostalgia for colonialism", remarking that it was like ""Tintin in the Congo" all over again." De Gucht refused to retract his statement.
In July 2007, British human rights lawyer David Enright complained to the United Kingdom's <a href="Commission%20for%20Racial%20Equality">Commission for Racial Equality</a> (CRE) that he came across the book in the children's section of <a href="Borders%20Group">Borders</a> bookshop while shopping with his wife and two sons. The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic, stating that it contained "hideous racial prejudice" by depicting Congolese who "look like monkeys and talk like imbeciles." Responding that it was committed to letting its "customers make the choice", Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels. UK bookseller <a href="Waterstones">Waterstone's</a> followed suit. Another British retailer, <a href="WHSmith">WHSmith</a>, said that the book was sold on its website, but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over. The CRE's attempt to ban the book was criticised by <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> politician <a href="Ann%20Widdecombe">Ann Widdecombe</a>, who remarked that the organisation had more important things to do than regulate the availability of historical children's books. The media controversy increased interest in the book, and Borders reported that its sales of "Tintin in the Congo" had been boosted 4,000%, while it also rose to eighth on the <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> bestseller list. Publisher Egmont UK also responded to racism concerns by placing a protective band around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context.

"Tintin in the Congo" also came under criticism in the United States; in October 2007, in response to a complaint by a patron, the <a href="Brooklyn%20Public%20Library">Brooklyn Public Library</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> placed the graphic novel in a locked back room, only permitting access by appointment. "Tintin in the Congo" became part of a drawn-out media debate in Sweden after national newspaper "<a href="Dagens%20Nyheter">Dagens Nyheter</a>" reported on the book's removal from a children's library in <a href="Kulturhuset">Kulturhuset</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> in September 2011. The incident, nicknamed "Tintin-gate", led to heated discussions in mainstream and social media concerning accusations of racism and censorship.

In August 2007, Congolese student Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo filed a complaint in Brussels, claiming that the book was an insult to the Congolese people and required banning. Public prosecutors investigated and initiated a criminal case. The matter was eventually transferred to a civil court in April 2010. Mondondo's lawyers argued that "Tintin in the Congo" amounted to "a justification of colonisation and of white supremacy", and Mondondo called it "racist and xenophobic". Alain Berenboom, lawyer for both <a href="Herg%C3%A9%20Foundation">Moulinsart</a>, the company which controls Hergé's estate, and Casterman, the book's publisher, argued that the cartoonist's depiction of the Congolese "wasn't racism but kind paternalism". He said that banning it would set a dangerous precedent for the availability of works by other historical authors, such as <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> or <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>, which contain similar stereotypes of non-white ethnicities. The court ruled in February 2012 that the book would not be banned, deciding that it was "clear that neither the story, nor the fact that it has been put on sale, has a goal to ... create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, or humiliating environment", and that it therefore did not break Belgian law. Belgium's <a href="Centre%20for%20Equal%20Opportunities%20and%20Opposition%20to%20Racism">Centre for Equal Opportunities</a> warned against "over-reaction and hyper <a href="political%20correctness">political correctness</a>".

Shortly after, Swedish-Belgian Jean-Dadaou Monyas filed a similar complaint, which was supported by Afrosvenskarna, an interest group for Swedes of African descent. The complaint to the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Justice%20%28Sweden%29">Chancellor of Justice</a> was turned down as violations of <a href="hate%20speech">hate speech</a> restrictions in the Swedish <a href="Constitution%20of%20Sweden">Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression</a> must be filed within one year of publication, and the latest Swedish edition of "Tintin in the Congo" appeared in 2005.

The South African comics writer <a href="Anton%20Kannemeyer">Anton Kannemeyer</a> has parodied the perceived racist nature of the book to highlight what he sees as the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his "Pappa in Afrika" (2010), a satire of "Tintin in the Congo", he portrays Tintin as an <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> with racist views of indigenous Africans.

"Tintin in the Congo" shows Tintin taking part in what <a href="Michael%20Farr">Michael Farr</a> described as "the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter" of animals; over the course of the "Adventure", Tintin shoots several <a href="antelope">antelope</a>, kills an ape to wear its skin, rams a rifle vertically into a crocodile's open mouth, injures an elephant for ivory, stones a buffalo, and (in earlier editions) drills a hole into a rhinoceros before planting dynamite in its body, blowing it up from the inside. Such scenes reflect the popularity of big-game hunting among whites and affluent visitors in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1930s. Hergé later felt guilty about his portrayal of animals in "Tintin in the Congo" and became an opponent of <a href="blood%20sport">blood sport</a>s; when he wrote "Cigars of the Pharaoh" (1934), he had Tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the Indian jungle.

Philippe Goddin stated that the scene in which Tintin shoots a herd of antelope was "enough to upset even the least ecological reader" in the 21st century. When <a href="India%20Book%20House">India Book House</a> first published the book in India in 2006, that nation's branch of the <a href="People%20for%20the%20Ethical%20Treatment%20of%20Animals">People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals</a> issued a public criticism, and chief functionary Anuradha Sawhney stated that the book was "replete with instances that send a message to young minds that it is acceptable to be cruel to animals."

Boys Don't Cry (film)

Boys Don't Cry is a 1999 American <a href="biographical%20film">biographical film</a> directed by <a href="Kimberly%20Peirce">Kimberly Peirce</a> and co-written by Peirce and Andy Bienen. The film is a dramatization of the real-life story of <a href="Brandon%20Teena">Brandon Teena</a>, an American <a href="trans%20man">trans man</a> played in the film by <a href="Hilary%20Swank">Hilary Swank</a>, who adopts a male identity and attempts to find himself and love in Nebraska but falls victim to a brutal <a href="hate%20crime">hate crime</a> perpetrated by two male acquaintances. The film co-stars <a href="Chlo%C3%AB%20Sevigny">Chloë Sevigny</a> as Teena's girlfriend, Lana. 

After reading about the case while in college, Peirce conducted extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses on the relationship between Brandon and his girlfriend <a href="Lana%20Tisdel">Lana Tisdel</a>. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary "<a href="The%20Brandon%20Teena%20Story">The Brandon Teena Story</a>". Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Teena's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were <a href="composite%20character">composites</a>.

Filming occurred during October and November 1998 in the <a href="Dallas%2C%20Texas">Dallas, Texas</a> area. The producers initially wanted to film in <a href="Falls%20City%2C%20Nebraska">Falls City, Nebraska</a>, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> had to occur in Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced by a variety of styles, including <a href="Neorealism%20%28art%29">neorealism</a> and the films of <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of <a href="country%20music">country</a>, <a href="blues%20music">blues</a>, and <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> music from the film. The film's themes, which have been explored by many scholars, include the nature of <a href="Romance%20%28love%29">romantic</a> and <a href="Platonic%20love">platonic</a> relationships, the causes of <a href="violence%20against%20LGBT%20people">violence against LGBT people</a>, <a href="transgender">transgender</a> people and the <a href="gender%20binary">gender binary</a>, and the relationship among <a href="social%20class">social class</a>, <a href="race%20%28human%20categorization%29">race</a>, and gender.

The film premiered at the <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Festival">New York Film Festival</a> on October 8, 1999, before appearing at various other film festivals. Distributed by <a href="Fox%20Searchlight%20Pictures">Fox Searchlight Pictures</a>, the film received a <a href="limited%20release">limited release</a> in the United States on October 22, 1999, and it performed well at the North American box office, gaining three times its production budget by May 2000. The film was acclaimed by critics, with many ranking it as one of the best films of the year; praise focused on the lead performances by Swank and Sevigny as well as the film's depiction of its subject matter. However, some people who had been involved with Brandon in real life criticized the film for not portraying the events accurately.

"Boys Don't Cry" was nominated for multiple awards; at the <a href="72nd%20Academy%20Awards">72nd Academy Awards</a> in 2000, Swank was awarded the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> and Sevigny was nominated for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>. The pair were also nominated at the <a href="57th%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">57th Golden Globe Awards</a>, with Swank winning the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Best Actress – Drama</a> award. "Boys Don't Cry", which dealt with controversial issues, was initially assigned an <a href="NC-17">NC-17</a> <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system%23MPAA%20film%20ratings">rating</a> but was later reclassified to an R rating. It was released on <a href="home%20video">home video</a> in September 2000.

<a href="Brandon%20Teena">Brandon Teena</a> (<a href="Hilary%20Swank">Hilary Swank</a>) is a young <a href="trans%20man">trans man</a> whose birth name was Teena Renae Brandon. When Brandon is discovered to be <a href="transgender">transgender</a> by a former girlfriend's brother, he receives death threats. Soon after, he is involved in a <a href="street%20fighting">bar fight</a> and is evicted from his cousin's trailer. Brandon moves to <a href="Falls%20City%2C%20Nebraska">Falls City, Nebraska</a>, where he befriends ex-convicts John Lotter (<a href="Peter%20Sarsgaard">Peter Sarsgaard</a>) and Tom Nissen (<a href="Brendan%20Sexton%20III">Brendan Sexton III</a>), and their friends Candace (<a href="Lecy%20Goranson">Alicia Goranson</a>) and Lana Tisdel (<a href="Chlo%C3%AB%20Sevigny">Chloë Sevigny</a>). Brandon becomes romantically involved with Lana, who is initially unaware of his troubled past. The two make plans to move to <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a>, where Brandon will manage Lana's karaoke singing career. Eventually, during a date night which ends with them having sex, Lana discovers that Brandon is trans, but continues to be intimate with him.

The police detain Brandon on charges that arose prior to his relocation; they place him in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails Brandon out and asks why he was placed in a women's prison. Brandon attempts to lie to her, saying he was born a <a href="hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> and will soon receive genital reconstruction surgery, but Lana stops him, declaring her love for Brandon regardless of his gender. However, while Brandon is in prison, Candace finds a number of documents listing Brandon's birth name, Teena Brandon, and she and her friends react to this news with shock and disgust. They enter Brandon's room, search among Brandon's things, and discover some transgender literature that confirms their suspicions. Tom and John violently confront Brandon, forcing him to remove his pants and reveal his genitals. They try to make Lana look, but she shields her eyes and turns away. After this confrontation, Tom and John drag Brandon into John's car and drive to an isolated location, where they brutally beat and gang rape him. Afterwards, they take Brandon to Tom's house. Though injured, Brandon escapes through a bathroom window. Although his assailants threaten Brandon and warn him not to report the attack to the police, Lana persuades him to do so. However, the police chief proves to be less concerned with the crime than with Brandon's 'sexual identity crisis'.

Later, John and Tom get drunk and decide to kill Brandon. Lana attempts to stop them, but the pair drive to Candace's remote house where they find Brandon, who has been hiding in a nearby shed. John shoots Brandon under the chin, killing him instantly. Tom shoots Candace in the head as Lana fights with them, begging them to stop. Tom stabs Brandon's lifeless body and tries to shoot Lana but John stops him. John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana lies with Brandon's body. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon's corpse. Her mother arrives and takes her away from the scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter Brandon wrote to her is heard in a voiceover.

Brandon Teena was a trans man who was gang raped and murdered by a group of male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, at the time a <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> film student, became interested in the case after reading a 1994 "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" article by <a href="Donna%20Minkowitz">Donna Minkowitz</a>. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, "the minute I read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, the fact that he did it with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me." The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.

Peirce wanted to tell the story from Brandon's perspective. She was familiar with Brandon's desire to wear men's clothing: "I started looking at all the other coverage and a great deal of it was sensational. People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title "Take It Like a Man".

The project drew interest from various production companies. <a href="Diane%20Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>'s production company, Blue Relief, showed interest in the screenplay in the mid-1990s. Initially, the film was to be largely based on <a href="Aphrodite%20Jones">Aphrodite Jones</a>' 1996 <a href="true%20crime">true crime</a> book "All She Wanted", which told the story of Brandon's final few weeks. Earlier drafts of the script incorporated scenes featuring Brandon's family background, including his sister Tammy and mother Joann, as well as some of Teena's ex-girlfriends. However, Peirce modified the script to fit her vision to focus on the relationship between Brandon and his 19-year-old girlfriend Lana Tisdel, which Peirce termed a "great love story", in contrast to "All She Wanted", which did not place an emphasis on the relationship.

To fund the writing and development of the project, Peirce worked as a <a href="paralegal">paralegal</a> on a midnight shift and as a <a href="35mm%20film">35mm film</a> projectionist; she also received a grant from the <a href="New%20York%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Arts">New York Foundation for the Arts</a>. The project attracted the attention of producer <a href="Christine%20Vachon">Christine Vachon</a>, who had seen a short film Peirce had made for her thesis in 1995 about the case. <a href="IFC%20Films">IFC Films</a>, Hart Sharp Entertainment, and Killer Films, Vachon and <a href="Eva%20Kolodner">Eva Kolodner</a>'s production company, provided financing for the project. IFC contributed roughly $1 million, but the film's eventual budget remained under $2 million. Peirce co-wrote the screenplay with Andy Bienen. They worked together for 18 months on the final drafts and were careful not to "mythologize" Brandon; the aim was to keep him as human as possible. In the editing stage of the script, Peirce sent the draft to <a href="Fox%20Searchlight%20Pictures">Fox Searchlight Pictures</a>, which agreed to produce and distribute the film while giving Peirce <a href="artistic%20license">artistic license</a>.

Prior to filming, Peirce researched the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case. She immersed herself in the information available about the murder, including trial transcripts. She met Lana Tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at Tisdel's home. Tisdel, who began dating Brandon just two weeks before he was murdered, was 19 years old at the time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother. Peirce also interviewed Tisdel's mother and Brandon's acquaintances. However, she was unable to interview Brandon's mother or any of his biological family. Much factual information, including Nissen being a convicted arsonist, was incorporated into "Boys Don't Cry".

The filmmakers retained the names of most of the case's real-life protagonists, but the names of several supporting characters were altered. For example, the character of Candace was named Lisa Lambert in real life. The casting process for "Boys Don't Cry" lasted almost four years. <a href="Drew%20Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a> was an early candidate to star in the film. Peirce scouted the <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> community, looking mainly for masculine, lesbian women for the role of Brandon Teena. Peirce said the LGBT community was very interested in the project because of the publicity surrounding the murder. High-profile actors avoided Peirce's auditions at the request of their agents because of the stigma associated with the role.

At one point, the project was nearly abandoned because Peirce was not satisfied with most of the people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully <a href="Passing%20%28gender%29">passed</a> as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, "But that's what Brandon would do". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a "known actor" to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was "the first time I saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and loved being Brandon."

Peirce required that Swank "make a full transformation" into a male. Immediately after being cast, Peirce took Swank to a hairdresser, where her lower-back length hair was cut and dyed chestnut brown. When she saw her then-husband, <a href="Chad%20Lowe">Chad Lowe</a>, again, he barely recognized her. Swank prepared for the role by dressing and living as a man for at least a month, including <a href="breast%20binding">wrapping her chest in tension bandages</a> and putting socks down the front of her trousers as Brandon Teena had done. Her masquerade was convincing; Swank's neighbors believed the "young man" coming and going from her home was Swank's visiting brother. She reduced her body fat to seven percent to accentuate her facial structure and refused to let the cast and crew see her out of costume. Swank earned $75 per day for her work on "Boys Don't Cry", totaling $3,000. Her earnings were so low that she did not qualify for health insurance.
For the role of Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, Peirce had envisioned a young <a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a>. The role was also offered to <a href="Reese%20Witherspoon">Reese Witherspoon</a> and <a href="Sarah%20Polley">Sarah Polley</a>. Peirce ultimately decided to cast Chloë Sevigny based on her performance in "<a href="The%20Last%20Days%20of%20Disco">The Last Days of Disco</a>" (1998). Sevigny had auditioned for the role of Brandon, but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana because she could not picture Sevigny as a man.
Sevigny dyed her hair red for the role to match Lana's strawberry blonde hair. Peirce later said, "Chloë just surrendered to the part. She watched videos of Lana. She just became her very naturally."

Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who raped and murdered Teena. Sarsgaard was one of the first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his character to be "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience "to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt "empowered" by playing Lotter. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", Sarsgaard said, "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast <a href="Alicia%20Goranson">Alicia Goranson</a>, known for playing Becky on the sitcom "<a href="Roseanne%20%28TV%20series%29">Roseanne</a>", as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.

Initially, "Boys Don't Cry" was scheduled to film for thirty days. However, principal photography for the film lasted from October 19 to November 24, 1998. The small budget dictated some of the filming decisions, including the omission of some incidents to speed up the overall pacing. Timing constraints and Peirce's visions relating to the plot limited what could be achieved with the narrative. For example, the film portrays a double murder when in actuality a third person, Phillip DeVine—a black disabled man—was also killed at the scene. At the time, he had been dating Lana Tisdel's sister, Leslie, who was omitted from the story. "Boys Don't Cry" was primarily filmed in <a href="Greenville%2C%20Texas">Greenville, Texas</a>, a small town about northeast of <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>. Most of the incidents in the case took place in <a href="Falls%20City%2C%20Nebraska">Falls City, Nebraska</a>, but budget constraints led the filmmakers to choose locations in Texas.

Peirce initially wanted to shoot in Falls City, but Vachon told her that filming there would not be possible. Afterwards, the film was going to be shot in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, but Peirce felt that "none of [the places] looked right." In addition, Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas. One of Peirce's main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon. On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, "The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it. I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon's own mind and would not think he was crazy, would not think he was lying, but would see him as more deeply human".

Some scenes in "Boys Don't Cry" required emotional and physical intensity; these were allocated extended periods of filming. The scene in which Brandon, at the wishes of his friends, bumper-skis on the back of a pickup truck, was delayed when a police officer, just arriving at a shift change, required a large lighting crane to be moved from one side of the road to the other. The scenes took six hours to shoot and were filmed at sunrise, resulting in a blue sky being seen in the background. There were some technical complications: some of the filming equipment got stuck in mud, and radio wires in some of the scenes conflicted with the sound production. Swank required a stunt double for a scene in which she falls off the back of a truck. Teena's rape scene was given an extended filming time; Sexton, who portrayed one of the attackers, walked away in tears afterward. Swank found portraying her character daunting and felt the need to "keep a distance" from the reality of the actual event. When scenes became difficult, Swank requested the company of her husband on set. At times, Peirce worked for seventeen hours a day in order to complete more work, but the other crew members told her that this was taking up potential nighttime filming hours.

Peirce, who had originally sought a career in photography before moving into filmmaking, applied techniques she had learned into the film. She described the film's mood as "artificial night". Director of Photography Jim Denault showed her the work of photographer <a href="Jan%20Staller">Jan Staller</a>, whose long-exposure night photography under artificial lighting inspired Denault to avoid using "moonlight" effects for most of the film. As a way to further incorporate the sense of artificial night, John Pirozzi, who had been experimenting with <a href="time-lapse%20photography">time-lapse photography</a> using a non-motion-controlled moving camera, was invited to create the transition shots seen throughout the film.

The film's visual style depicts the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a> in a "withdrawn", dark and understated light to give a "surreal" effect. Denault shot "Boys Don't Cry" in flat, spherical format on <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm film</a> using <a href="List%20of%20motion%20picture%20film%20stocks">Kodak Vision</a> film stock. The film was shot with a <a href="Moviecam%20Compact">Moviecam Compact</a> camera fitted with <a href="Carl%20Zeiss%20AG">Carl Zeiss</a> super speed lenses. For the scene in which Brandon is stripped, a hand-held camera was used to give a sense of subjectivity and intimacy.

The use of low natural light and heavy artificial light is illustrated early in the film in the opening roller rink scene in which Brandon pursues his first relationship with a young woman. For this scene, Peirce used a three-shot method similar to that used in a scene in "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>" (1939) in which Dorothy leaves her house and enters Oz. The scene consists of a three-shot sequence meant to symbolize Brandon's metaphorical "entrance to manhood", or Brandon's social transition from a woman to a man. Some scenes were given a prolonged shooting sequence to induce a feeling of hallucination. An example is the sequence in which Brandon and Lana first have sex, followed by a shot of her, Brandon, Candace, and Kate driving in a car against a city skyline backdrop. The scene in which John and Tom strip Brandon was filmed with three cameras due to time constraints, even though Peirce wanted six cameras to film it. The scene took an hour and a half to film in total.

Peirce drew inspiration from the filming style of <a href="John%20Cassavetes">John Cassavetes</a> and the early work of <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, and she incorporated <a href="Neorealism%20%28art%29">neo-realist</a> techniques into the film. She was also influenced by a second style of work—the "magical" films of <a href="Michael%20Powell">Michael Powell</a> and <a href="Kenji%20Mizoguchi">Kenji Mizoguchi</a>. The former style is used when Brandon joins the social circle of John, Tom, Lana and her mother, while the latter is used when Brandon and Lana begin to depart from that life. The film was also influenced by "<a href="Bonnie%20and%20Clyde%20%28film%29">Bonnie and Clyde</a>" (1967). Peirce incorporated influences from "<a href="Raging%20Bull">Raging Bull</a>" (1980) by opening the film with a shot of Brandon traveling along a highway, as seen from the character's imaginative or dream perspective, similar to the beginning of "Raging Bull". When a character expresses a dream or hopeful assertion, Peirce cuts to an "eerily lit" dream landscape. "<a href="The%20Pawnbroker%20%28film%29">The Pawnbroker</a>" (1964) inspired the cinematography and editing of Brandon's rape scene, particularly in its use of <a href="fast%20cutting">fast cutting</a>.

Because the film is set in the rural Midwestern United States, the "Boys Don't Cry" soundtrack album features a compilation of country, blues and rock music. <a href="Nathan%20Larson">Nathan Larson</a> and <a href="Nina%20Persson">Nina Persson</a> of <a href="The%20Cardigans">The Cardigans</a> composed an instrumental version of <a href="Restless%20Heart">Restless Heart</a>'s 1988 country-pop song "<a href="The%20Bluest%20Eyes%20in%20Texas">The Bluest Eyes in Texas</a>", a variation of which was used as the film's love theme and score. The song itself is heard during a <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> scene, sung by Sevigny's character, and at the end of the film. The title of the film is taken from <a href="Boys%20Don%27t%20Cry%20%28The%20Cure%20song%29">the song of the same name</a> by British rock band <a href="The%20Cure">The Cure</a>. An American cover of the song, sung by Nathan Larson, plays in the background in the scene in which Lana bails Brandon out of jail and during one of their sex scenes. However, the song is not included on the released soundtrack. Songs by <a href="Lynyrd%20Skynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> ("<a href="Tuesday%27s%20Gone">Tuesday's Gone</a>"), <a href="Paisley%20Underground">Paisley Underground</a> band <a href="Opal%20%28band%29">Opal</a> ("She's a Diamond") and <a href="The%20Charlatans%20%28American%20band%29">The Charlatans</a> ("Codine Blues") also appear in the film, as do cover versions of other songs. The soundtrack was released on November 23, 1999, by <a href="Koch%20Records">Koch Records</a>. "The Bluest Eyes in Texas" was played when Hilary Swank went onstage to receive her <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> in 2000. The song also plays over the film's end credits.

"Boys Don't Cry" has been widely discussed and analyzed by scholars and others. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> described the film as a "romantic tragedy" embedded in a working class American setting, calling it ""Romeo and Juliet" set in a Nebraska trailer park". Philosopher Rebecca Hanrahan argued that the question of identity—particularly Brandon's—is alluded to frequently in "Boys Don't Cry" and that Peirce poses the nature of <a href="Personal%20identity">identification</a> and <a href="self">self</a> as the film's main question. Journalist <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> said the film is about accepting identity, which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for that identity. Paula Nechak called the film a "bold cautionary tale"; she regarded the film as a negative, dismal depiction of Midwestern America, writing that "[Peirce's film has] captured the mystique and eerie loneliness" and "isolation of the Midwest, with its dusty desolation and nowhere-to-go frustration that propels people to violence and despair".

Christine Vachon, the film's executive producer, said, "It's not just about two stupid thugs who killed somebody. It's about these guys whose world is so tenuous and so fragile that they can't stand to have any of their beliefs shattered", referring to John and Tom's views of their lives, Brandon's aspirations and his biological sex. Along with other turn-of-the-millennium films such as "<a href="In%20the%20Company%20of%20Men">In the Company of Men</a>" (1997), "<a href="American%20Beauty%20%281999%20film%29">American Beauty</a>" (1999), "<a href="Fight%20Club%20%28film%29">Fight Club</a>" (1999), and "<a href="American%20Psycho%20%28film%29">American Psycho</a>" (2000), Vincent Hausmann said "Boys Don't Cry" "raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis". Jason Wood said the film, together with <a href="Patty%20Jenkins">Patty Jenkins</a>'s "<a href="Monster%20%282003%20film%29">Monster</a>" (2003), is an exploration of "social problems".

Several scholars commented on the relationship between Brandon and Lana as well as Brandon's relationship to John and Tom. Carol Siegel regarded the film as a thematically rich love story between two ill-fated lovers, similarly to "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>". <a href="Jack%20Halberstam">Jack Halberstam</a> attributed "Boys Don't Cry"'s success to its ostensible argument for tolerance of <a href="sexual%20diversity">sexual diversity</a> by depicting a relationship between two unlikely people.

This tragic aspect of the love story led Halberstam to compare Brandon and Lana's relationship and subsequent drama to classic and modern romances including "Romeo and Juliet", often using the term <a href="star-crossed%20lovers">star-crossed lovers</a>. In the "Journal for Creativity in Mental Health", Jinnelle Veronique Aguilar discussed Brandon's ability to create <a href="interpersonal%20relationships">interpersonal relationships</a> in the film. She opined that Brandon wanted to create close relationships, but he could not due to his transgender status until he became close with Lana. "Although Brandon is able to make a brief but authentic connection with Lana, he continues to experience a sense of aloneness in the world. He consistently faces a sense of fear related to the power-over dynamics that he and others who are transsexual face…Brandon experiences the central relational paradox, in which he yearns for connection; however, due to the real threat he faces, he is unable to make that connection."

Myra Hird, in the "<a href="International%20Feminist%20Journal%20of%20Politics">International Feminist Journal of Politics</a>", argued that John and Brandon exemplify two different and contrasting types of masculinity, and that Brandon's version is preferred by the film's female characters, comparing them to <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Stewart">Jimmy Stewart</a>, respectively. "Throughout the film, John offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity. […] Against this <a href="hegemonic%20masculinity">hegemonic masculinity</a>, Brandon offers a masculinity reminiscent of a by-gone era of chivalry." Furthermore, she contended that John was threatened by Brandon's version of masculinity. "Gender boundaries are taken extremely seriously in Western society, and "Boys Don't Cry" depicts how intensely threatened John and Tom are by Brandon's superior portrayal of a masculinity 'schedule'. John cannot abide Brandon's desire, and clear ability, to access <a href="male%20privilege">male privilege</a>, and his reaction is to force Brandon to "be" female through the act of rape."

Other commentators discussed the more complex psychological causes of Brandon's murder. Halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder, and whether it was due to <a href="transphobia">transphobia</a> or <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a>: "Ultimately in "Boys" ["Don't Cry"], the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism, the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage." Ebert called the film a "sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame".

In the same journal, Julianne Pidduck commented on the film's rape and murder scenes, "Effectively, the viewer is asked to experience the rape from the victim's point of view. The film invites political, emotional and corporeal allegiances linked to known and imagined risk, especially for female and/or queer viewers. An allegiance with Brandon's outsider status aligns the viewer with Brandon's initial exhilaration at his transgressive success as a boy, drawing us through to the film's disturbing finale."

Many scholars addressed the various performances of gender by the characters in the film; Moss and Lynne Zeavin offered a <a href="psychoanalytic">psychoanalytic</a> analysis, calling the film a "case report" that "presents [Brandon's] transsexual inclinations as a series of euphoric conquests" and "focuses on a range of anxious reactions to her transsexuality. […] or a case not for what they might reveal about female hysteria, but for what they might reveal about misogyny". Elaborating on the themes of the film, they wrote:

In her film, Pierce ["sic"] inserts the unconventional problems of transsexuality into a conventional narrative structure. Throughout the film Brandon is presented as a doomed, though beguiling and beautiful rascal, recognizably located in the lineage of well-known cinematic bad-boys like James Dean, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman. Like these predecessors, Brandon's heroic stature derives from her ["sic"] unwillingness to compromise her ["sic"] identity … Pierce ["sic"] presents Brandon's struggles against biological determinism as the struggles of a dignified renegade.
Brenda Cooper, in "Critical Studies in Media Communication", argued that the film "can be read as a liberatory narrative that queers the centers of heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity by privileging female masculinity and celebrating its differences from heterosexual norms." She argued that the film challenged heteronormativity by criticizing the concept of the <a href="Heartland%20%28United%20States%29">American Heartland</a>, by presenting problems with <a href="Heterosexuality">heterosexual</a> masculinity and its internalised aggression, by "centering female masculinity", and blurring gender boundaries.

Later on in the same essay, she commented that Brandon both embodied and rejected traditional masculinity, providing a new outlook on what it means to be a man which excited and thrilled the women in the film: "Brandon’s performance of masculinity, however, can be interpreted as operating on two levels in the narratives: When Brandon tries to establish his male identity with his new buddies, he imitates the kind of overly aggressive macho machismo that John and Tom represent. But Lana falls for Brandon because of his version of masculinity, which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what it takes to be a man and to please a woman. Brandon’s articulation of manhood effectively mocks sexist masculine ideals and appropriates the codes of normative masculinity." Michele Aaron, in "<a href="Screen%20%28journal%29">Screen</a>", claimed that the film was primarily centered on "the spectacle of <a href="transvestism">transvestism</a>" and that the film as a whole was "a tale of passing".

Jennifer Esposito wrote that "We watch onscreen as Brandon binds his breasts, packs a <a href="dildo">dildo</a>, fixes his hair in a mirror. His masculinity is carefully scripted. John and Tom…are never shown preparing for masculinity. They are already masculine." Melissa Rigney argued that the film defied traditional portrayals of transgender characters by not confining Brandon to certain <a href="stereotypes">stereotypes</a>. "On the surface, "Boys Don't Cry" appears to hold the potential of rendering gender in excess: the figure of Brandon Teena can be read variously as butch, male, lesbian, transgender, transsexual, and heterosexual. […] Although female masculinity comes to the forefront in this film, I argue that the film attempts to subsume the transgressive potential of the gender outlaw within a lesbian framework and narrative, one that reduces and, ultimately, nullifies Brandon's gender and sexual excess."

In contrast, Annabelle Wilcox opined that the film primarily reinforced the gender binary by showing that "Brandon's body is branded by such rhetoric and representation, and is assumed to be a site of 'truth' that closes the question that being transgender poses for subjectivity, gender, and sexuality." She also went on to note that many film critics either disregarded Brandon's male identity or used female pronouns when referring to him. Rachel Swan, writing for "<a href="Film%20Quarterly">Film Quarterly</a>", wrote that Brandon's masculinity was often contrasted with Lana's femininity as a means of illustrating the two sides of the gender binary. In addition, she regarded John and Tom's rape of Brandon as an attempt to psychologically <a href="Castration">castrate</a> him.

In another piece, Halberstam compared the media portrayal of Brandon to that of <a href="Billy%20Tipton">Billy Tipton</a>, a jazz musician who no one knew was transgender until the post-mortem discovery that he was assigned female at birth. She wrote, "On some level Brandon's story, while cleaving to its own specificity, needs to remain an open narrative—not a stable narrative of FTM transsexual identity nor a singular tale of queer bashing, not a cautionary fable about the violence of rural America nor an advertisement for urban organizations of queer community; like the narrative of Billy Tipton, Brandon's story permits a dream of transformation." Christine Dando argued that "masculinity is associated with outside and femininity with interior spaces."

Lisa Henderson commented on the intersection between <a href="social%20class">social class</a> and gender in the film, particularly Brandon's <a href="working-class">working-class</a> status: "My reading of "Boys" ["Don't Cry"] through the lens of class representation is not born of a univocal search for so-called positive images, but I do recoil at what appears to me to be a new instalment in a long history of popular images of working-class pathology. […] But that is not the whole story. Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night-time light, characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love, acceptance and a better life."

Jennifer Devere Brody commented on the film's exclusion of Philip DeVine, a <a href="disability">disabled</a> <a href="African-American">African-American</a> man who was another victim of the shooting. "Perhaps one can only speculate about the motivations behind this decision. But the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations. The erasure of DeVine from the narrative places the white female bodies as the only true victims of crime; and the film's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates the myth of the black man as always already a perpetrator of crime." Regarding DeVine, Halberstam wrote, "Peirce perhaps thought that her film, already running close to two hours, could not handle another subplot, but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender, race, sexuality, and class that was enacted in the heartland. Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white, Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine's story from "Boys Don't Cry", Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race, consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion."

Several authors commented on the possible impact that the film's setting of Falls City, Nebraska, located in the Midwestern United States, could have had on the film's plot. Maslin called "Boys Don't Cry" a tale of a trapped, small town character's search for life beyond the rural existence and the high price he pays for his view of the "American dream". Regarding the film's portrayal of Nebraska, Halberstam wrote, "The landscape of Nebraska then serves as a contested site upon which multiple narratives unfold, narratives indeed which refuse to collapse into simply one story. Some of these narratives are narratives of hate, some of desire; others tell of ignorance and brutality; still others of isolation and fear; some allow violence and ignorant prejudices to become the essence of white poor rural identity; still others provoke questions about the deployment of whiteness and the regulation of violence."

Christina Dando wrote that the typical portrayal of the Midwest as a "frontier" area did not come through in the film until the setting switched from Lincoln to Falls City: "The flat landscape, the spacious sky, the home, evoke two different Plains time periods familiar to many Americans through historic photographs: the early settlement process…and 1930s <a href="Farm%20Security%20Administration">Farm Security Administration</a> photographs. It is virtually timeless. There is also a sense of both place and placelessness. While the landscape is distinctively Plains, it could be described as nowhere."

She went on to argue that the setting is not only conveyed visually, but also through the characters' homes. "While there is no trailer park in Falls City, Brandon's community there occupies the margin: Candace and Lana's homes appear to be on the outskirts of town, or even outside of town. There are no complete families, only the family that that has been created. The men appear to have no homes, relationally or physically: none are shown to have family. Speaking about the film's cinematography and the relation to its themes:
Dando compared the film to other tragic books and films that have been set on the Great Plains, including "<a href="My%20%C3%81ntonia">My Ántonia</a>", "<a href="Giants%20in%20the%20Earth%20%28novel%29">Giants in the Earth</a>", "<a href="The%20Grapes%20of%20Wrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a>", "<a href="In%20Cold%20Blood">In Cold Blood</a>", and "<a href="Badlands%20%28film%29">Badlands</a>", writing that unlike the other works, "Brandon is [a] character who truly crosses frontiers."

"Boys Don't Cry" aired in Canada at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> (TIFF) in September 1999. It premiered in the U.S. at the <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Festival">New York Film Festival</a> on October 8, 1999, to critical acclaim. It was shown at the Reel Affirmations International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in early October, where it won further praise and appeared at the <a href="Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">Venice International Film Festival</a>. "Boys Don't Cry" was given a special screening in snippets at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. At that time, the film was still called "Take It Like a Man". The film received a limited release theatrically on October 22, 1999, in the U.S., where it was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a> that specializes in independent films. Initially, many viewers complained via email to Peirce that the film was not being shown near them, as the film was only being shown on 25 screens across the country. However, this number increased to nearly 200 by March 2000. The film grossed $73,720 in its opening week. By December 5, the film had grossed in excess of $2 million. By May 2000, it had a U.S. total gross of $11,540,607—more than three times its production budget. Internationally, the film was released on March 2, 2000, in Australia and on April 9, 2000, in the United Kingdom.

Critics lauded "Boys Don't Cry" upon its release, with many calling it one of the best films of the year. Review aggregator <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reports 88% of 76 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.9/10; the site's consensus states, "Hilary Swank's acclaimed performance pays fitting tribute to the tragic life of Brandon Teena". Another review aggregator, <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, gave the film an 86 of 100, indicating "universal acclaim". One reviewer said the film was a "critical knockout".

Critics often praised the performances by Swank and Sevigny; <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> said the pair "give performances that burn in the memory", and The Film Stage termed Swank's performance "one of the greatest" Best Actress Oscar-winning performances. Peter Stack of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" lauded the lead acting performances of Swank, Sevigny, Saarsgard, and Sexton III, writing, "It may be the best-acted film of the year". Online film reviewer <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> gave the film three and a half stars out of four; he highlighted the performances of Swank and Sevigny as the film's greatest success and likened the film's intensity to that of a train wreck. Berardinelli wrote that Swank "gives the performance of her career" and that "Sevigny's performance is more conventional than Swank's, but no less effective. She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film." <a href="Emanuel%20Levy">Emanuel Levy</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" called the acting "flawless" and concluded that the "stunningly accomplished" and "candid" film could be "seen as a "Rebel Without a Cause" for these culturally diverse and complex times, with the two misfits enacting a version of the James Dean—Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction, searching, like their '50s counterparts, for love, self-worth and a place to call home". <a href="Stephen%20Hunter">Stephen Hunter</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" said the performances are of such "luminous humanity that they break your heart". "Premiere" listed Swank's performance as one of the "100 Greatest Performances of All Time". Owen Gleiberman of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" called Swank a "revelation" and wrote, "by the end, her Brandon/Teena is beyond male or female. It's as if we were simply glimpsing the character's soul, in all its yearning and conflicted beauty."

Other reviewers were positive towards the way "Boys Don't Cry" portrayed its subject matter. and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" listed "Boys Don't Cry" as one of the five best films of 1999, saying, "this could have been a clinical movie of the week, but instead it's a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame". Janet Maslin of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said the film was "stunning" and gave it four stars out of four stars. Maslin said, "unlike most films about mind-numbing tragedy, this one manages to be full of hope". <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of "<a href="The%20Los%20Angeles%20Times">The Los Angeles Times</a>" praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters, and wrote, "Peirce and Bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless, hopeless, stoned-out lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them" and that ""Boys Don't Cry" is an exceptional—and exceptionally disturbing film". Mike Clarke of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" commended Peirce's depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter, writing, "Peirce seems to have researched her subject with grad-school-thesis intensity".

Jay Carr of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote, ""Boys Don't Cry" not only revisits the crime, but convinces us we're being taken inside it". <a href="Stephanie%20Zacharek">Stephanie Zacharek</a> of "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" gave a positive review, singling out the directing and acting. She wrote, "Peirce ... covers an extraordinary amount of territory, not just in terms of dealing with Brandon’s sexual-identity and self-fulfillment issues, but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him". Zacharek described Swank's performance as "a continual revelation" and Sevigny's performance as "transformative". She said, "When Brandon dies, "Boys Don’t Cry" reaches an emotional intensity that’s almost operatic. The saddest thing, though, is seeing Sevigny’s Lana crumpled over his corpse—the way she plays it, you know that when Brandon went, he took a part of her with him, too". <a href="David%20Edelstein">David Edelstein</a> of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" was also very positive towards the film, calling it "a meditation on the irrelevance of gender." He went on to praise Swank, Sevigny, and Sarsgaard in their roles, especially Sevigny, writing that she "keeps the movie tantalizing".

The film was not without detractors, who focused on the film's portrayal of Brandon and his actions. <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine was one of the film's negative reviewers; he wrote, "the film lets down the material. It's too cool: all attitude, no sizzle". Peter Rainer of "<a href="New%20York%20Magazine">New York Magazine</a>" compared the film unfavorably with "Rebel Without a Cause" (1954), calling it a "transgendered" version, elaborating that the film "could have used a tougher and more exploratory spirit; for Peirce, there was no cruelty, no derangement in Brandon's impostures toward the unsuspecting." In 2007, "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>" ranked the film on its list of "The 25 Most Dangerous Movies".

The film was generally well-received by the <a href="LGBT%20community">LGBT community</a>. "Boys Don't Cry"s release came a year after the murder of a homosexual teenager, <a href="Matthew%20Shepard">Matthew Shepard</a>, which occurred October 12, 1998. The murder sparked additional public interest in <a href="hate%20crime">hate crime</a> legislation in America and in Brandon Teena, and increased public interest in "Boys Don't Cry". Cooper wrote that "Boys Don't Cry" "is perhaps the only film addressing the issue of female masculinity by a self-described queer filmmaker to reach mainstream audiences and to receive critical acclaim and prestigious awards." However, Noelle Howey, writing for "<a href="Mother%20Jones%20%28magazine%29">Mother Jones</a>", wrote that despite the critical acclaim, relatively few critics understood what she perceived as the main point of the film—Brandon being a victim of <a href="trans%20bashing">trans bashing</a>. Howey said, "Even a cursory glance at reviews of "Boys Don't Cry" reveals that while most critics admired the film, few absorbed its main point: that Brandon Teena was a biological girl who felt innately that she was a man. Most of the media instead cast Teena as a <a href="Yentl">Yentl</a> for the new millennium, rather than a victim of anti-transgender bigotry."

The accuracy of "Boys Don't Cry" was disputed by real-life people involved in the murder. The real Lana Tisdel declared her dislike for the film; she said Brandon never proposed to her and that when she discovered the truth about Brandon's sex, she ended the relationship. Tisdel disliked the way she was portrayed in the film, and called the film the "second murder of Brandon Teena". Before the film's theatrical release, Lana Tisdel sued the film's producers, claiming that the film depicted her as "lazy, white trash and a skanky snake" and that her family and friends had come to see her as "a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder". Tisdel settled her lawsuit against Fox Searchlight for an undisclosed sum. Sarah Nissen, cousin of perpetrator Marvin Nissen, was also critical of the film, saying, "There's none of it that's right. It was just weird." Leslie Tisdel, Lana's sister, called the film "a lie of a movie". Leslie was not included in the film, and her ties with the third victim, Phillip DeVine, were omitted due to storyline constraints.

Lana Tisdel's potential involvement in the rape and murder of Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present at the time of the murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the presiding judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, "Boys Don't Cry" took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.

The film won a variety of awards, most of which went to Swank for her performance. Swank won a <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress Oscar</a> while Sevigny received a nomination in the category of <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>. From the <a href="Hollywood%20Foreign%20Press">Hollywood Foreign Press</a>, the film received two <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> nominations in the same two categories (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress) for Swank and Sevigny, winning Best Actress. Swank and Sevigny both received Best Actress Awards from the <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Circle">New York Film Critics Circle</a>, the <a href="Chicago%20Film%20Critics%20Association%20Awards">Chicago Film Critics Association Awards</a> and an <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award">Independent Spirit Award</a>. The film won three awards at the <a href="Boston%20Society%20of%20Film%20Critics%20Awards">Boston Society of Film Critics Awards</a>: Best Actress (Swank), Best Supporting Actress (Sevigny) and Best Director (Peirce). Swank and Sevigny won <a href="Satellite%20Award">Satellite Award</a>s for their performances, and the film was nominated in two categories; Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director. It was named one of the best films of the year by the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20of%20Motion%20Pictures">National Board of Review of Motion Pictures</a>.

The family of Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her repeated use of the male gender pronoun "he" in her Oscar acceptance speech. Teena's mother JoAnn Brandon said her child's transgenderism was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse, rather than being an expression of Teena's gendered sense of self. She said, "She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her". Despite the criticism, Kevin Okeefe, writing for "<a href="Out%20%28magazine%29">Out</a>", defended Swank's acceptance speech; he said, "Swank deserves a place in the great acceptance speech canon for being bold, not only as an actress, but as an award winner".

"Boys Don't Cry" garnered significant attention for its graphic rape scene. The film was initially assigned an <a href="NC-17">NC-17</a> rating from the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Association of America</a> (MPAA); the content was toned down for the U.S. release, where it was <a href="MPAA%20rating%20system%23Ratings">rated R</a>. Peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled "<a href="This%20Film%20Is%20Not%20Yet%20Rated">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a>", which discussed the film's problems with the MPAA, particularly the censoring of the sex scenes. The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA and had to be trimmed to avoid the NC-17 rating. Both the Australian and European version are more explicit, particularly the first rape. Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene. She also claimed that one objection from the MPAA was that one scene featured an orgasm that was "too long", and rhetorically asked if anyone had ever been hurt by an orgasm that was too long.

"Boys Don't Cry" was first released on <a href="home%20video">home video</a> by <a href="Fox%20Entertainment%20Group">Fox Searchlight Pictures</a> in September 2000 apart of a "Premiere Series", preceded by a DVD release in April 2000 in the United States and Canada. The DVD's special features included a commentary by Kimberly Peirce and a behind-the-scenes featurette containing interviews with Peirce, Swank and Sevigny; there was also a theatrical trailer and three television trailers. This same edition was re-released in 2009 with different cover art. The film was released on <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> on February 16, 2011, by 20th Century Fox Entertainment in conjunction with Fox Pathé Europa.

Battle of Tassafaronga

The Battle of Tassafaronga, sometimes referred to as the Fourth Battle of Savo Island or, in Japanese sources, as the , was a nighttime naval battle that took place on November 30, 1942, between <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> warships during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>. The battle took place in <a href="Ironbottom%20Sound">Ironbottom Sound</a> near the <a href="Tassafaronga%20Point">Tassafaronga</a> area on <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>.

In the battle, a US force of five <a href="cruisers">cruisers</a> and four <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Carleton%20H.%20Wright">Carleton H. Wright</a> engaged eight Japanese destroyers attempting to deliver food to their forces on Guadalcanal. Using <a href="radar">radar</a>, the US warships gained surprise, opened fire, and sank one destroyer. Under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Raiz%C5%8D%20Tanaka">Raizō Tanaka</a>, the other Japanese ships quickly returned fire with Type 93 "<a href="Long%20Lance">Long Lance</a>" torpedoes, sinking one US cruiser and heavily damaging three others. The rest of Tanaka's force escaped undamaged but failed to complete the intended supply mission.

On August 7, 1942, <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> forces landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and the <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings were meant to deny the Japanese access to <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> that they could use to threaten <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the US and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of neutralizing the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings began the six-month Guadalcanal campaign.

The nearly 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese personnel on the islands were taken by surprise, and by nightfall on August 8th, the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Alexander%20Vandegrift">Alexander Vandegrift</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal, later renamed "<a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a>" by the Allies. Allied aircraft operating from Henderson were called the "<a href="Cactus%20Air%20Force">Cactus Air Force</a>" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the US Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of US troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20,000.

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>'s <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">17th Army</a>, a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>, the task of retaking the island. The first units of the 17th Army began to arrive there on August 19.

Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were rarely able to use large, slow transport ships or barges to deliver troops and supplies to the island; instead, they used warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a> to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s from the <a href="IJN%208th%20Fleet">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>, were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by Allied forces and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.

The Japanese attempted several times between August and November 1942 to recapture Henderson Field and drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal, to no avail. The last attempt by the Japanese to deliver significant additional forces to the island failed during the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> of November 12–15.

On November 26, Japanese Lieutenant General <a href="Hitoshi%20Imamura">Hitoshi Imamura</a> took command of the new <a href="Japanese%20Eighth%20Area%20Army">Eighth Area Army</a> at Rabaul. The new command encompassed both Hyakutake's 17th Army in the Solomons and the <a href="Eighteenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">18th Army</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. One of Imamura's first priorities upon assuming command was the continuation of the attempts to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal. However, the Allied <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna-Gona">attempt to take Buna</a> in New Guinea changed Imamura's priorities; it was considered a more severe threat to Rabaul, and Imamura postponed further major reinforcement efforts to Guadalcanal to concentrate on the situation in New Guinea.

Due to a combination of the threat from CAF aircraft, US Navy <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s stationed at Tulagi, and a cycle of bright moonlight, the Japanese had switched to using submarines to deliver provisions to their forces on Guadalcanal. Beginning on November 16, 1942, and continuing for the next three weeks, 16 submarines made nocturnal deliveries of foodstuffs to the island, with one submarine making the trip each night. Each submarine could deliver 20 to 30 tons of supplies, about one day's worth of food, for the 17th Army, but the difficult task of transporting the supplies by hand through the jungle to the frontline units limited their value to sustain the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal. At the same time, the Japanese tried to establish a chain of three bases in the central Solomons to allow small boats to use them as staging sites for making supply deliveries to Guadalcanal, but damaging Allied airstrikes on the bases forced the abandonment of this plan.

On November 26, the 17th Army notified Imamura that it faced a critical food crisis. Some front-line units had not been resupplied for six days and even the rear-area troops were on one-third rations. The situation forced the Japanese to return to using destroyers to deliver the necessary supplies.

Eighth Fleet personnel devised a plan to help reduce the exposure of destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal. Large oil or gas drums were cleaned and filled with medical supplies and food, with enough air space to provide buoyancy, and strung together with rope. When the destroyers arrived at Guadalcanal they would make a sharp turn, the drums would be cut loose, and a swimmer or boat from the shore could pick up the buoyed end of the rope and return it to the beach, where the soldiers could haul in the supplies.

The Eighth Fleet's Guadalcanal Reinforcement Unit, based in the Shortland Islands and under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Raiz%C5%8D%20Tanaka">Raizō Tanaka</a>, was tasked by Mikawa with making the first of five scheduled runs using the drum method on the night of November 30. Tanaka's unit was centered on the eight ships of Destroyer Squadron (Desron) 2, with six destroyers assigned to carry from 200 to 240 drums of supplies apiece, to <a href="Tassafaronga">Tassafaronga</a> at Guadalcanal. Tanaka's <a href="flagship">flagship</a> along with acted as escorts. The six drum-carrying destroyers were , , , , , and . To save weight, the drum-carrying destroyers left their reloads of <a href="Type%2093%20torpedo">Type 93 torpedo</a>es (Long Lances) at the Shortlands, leaving each ship with eight torpedoes, one for each tube.

After the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, US <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="William%20Halsey">William Halsey</a>, commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific, had reorganized US naval forces under his command, including, on November 24, the formation of Task Force 67 (TF67) at <a href="Espiritu%20Santo">Espiritu Santo</a>, comprising the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s , , , and , the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , and four destroyers (, , , and ). US Rear Admiral <a href="Carleton%20H.%20Wright">Carleton H. Wright</a> replaced <a href="Thomas%20Kinkaid">Thomas Kinkaid</a> as commander of TF67 on November 28.

Upon taking command, Wright briefed his ship commanders on his plan for engaging the Japanese in future; he expected night battles around Guadalcanal. The plan, which he had drafted with Kinkaid, stated that radar-equipped destroyers were to scout in front of the cruisers and deliver a surprise torpedo attack upon sighting Japanese warships, then vacate the area to give the cruisers a clear field of fire. The cruisers were then to engage with gunfire at a range of . The cruisers' <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s would scout and drop flares during the battle.

On November 29, Allied intelligence personnel intercepted and decoded a Japanese message transmitted to the 17th Army on Guadalcanal alerting them to Tanaka's supply run. Informed of the message, Halsey ordered Wright to take TF67 to intercept Tanaka off Guadalcanal. TF67, with Wright flying his flag on "Minneapolis", departed Espiritu Santo at just before midnight on November 29 for the run to Guadalcanal. En route, destroyers and , returning from a convoy escort assignment to Guadalcanal, were ordered to join up with TF67. Lacking the time to brief the commanding officers of the joining destroyers of his battle plan, Wright assigned them a position behind the cruisers. At 17:00 on November 30, Wright's cruisers launched one floatplane each for Tulagi to drop flares during the expected battle that night. At 20:00, Wright sent his crews to battle stations.

Tanaka's force departed the Shortlands just after midnight on November 30 for the run to Guadalcanal. Tanaka attempted to evade Allied aerial reconnaissance aircraft by first heading northeast through Bougainville Strait before turning southeast and then south to pass through Indispensable Strait. Paul Mason, an Australian <a href="coastwatchers">coastwatcher</a> stationed in southern Bougainville, reported by radio the departure of Tanaka's ships from Shortland, and this message was passed to Wright. At the same time, a Japanese search aircraft spotted an Allied convoy near Guadalcanal and communicated the sighting to Tanaka who told his destroyer commanders to expect action that night and that, "In such an event, utmost efforts will be made to destroy the enemy without regard for the unloading of supplies."

At <a href="24-hour%20clock">21:40</a> on November 30, Tanaka's ships sighted <a href="Savo%20Island">Savo Island</a> from Indispensable Strait. The Japanese ships were in line ahead formation, interval , in the order of "Takanami", "Oyashio", "Kuroshio", "Kagerō", "Makinami", "Naganami", "Kawakaze", and "Suzukaze". At this same time, TF67 entered Lengo Channel en route to Ironbottom Sound. Wright's ships were in column in the order "Fletcher", "Perkins", "Maury", "Drayton", "Minneapolis", "New Orleans", "Pensacola", "Honolulu", "Northampton", "Lamson", and "Lardner". The four van destroyers led the cruisers by and the cruisers steamed apart.

At 22:40, Tanaka's ships passed south of Savo about offshore from Guadalcanal and slowed to as they approached the unloading area. "Takanami" took station about seaward to screen the column. At the same time, TF67 exited Lengo Channel into the sound and headed at towards Savo Island. Wright's van destroyers moved to a position slightly inshore of the cruisers. The night sky was moonless with between and of visibility. Because of extremely calm seas which created a suction effect on their pontoons, Wright's cruiser floatplanes were delayed in lifting off from Tulagi harbor, and would not be a factor in the battle.

At 23:06, Wright's force began to detect Tanaka's ships on radar near Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal about away. Wright's destroyers rejoined the column as it continued to head towards Savo. At the same time, Tanaka's ships, which were not equipped with radar, split into two groups and prepared to shove the drums overboard. "Naganami", "Kawakaze", and "Suzukaze" headed for their drop-off point near Doma Reef while "Makinami", "Kagerō", "Oyashio", and "Kuroshio" aimed for nearby Tassafaronga. At 23:12, "Takanami's" crew visually sighted Wright's column, quickly confirmed by lookouts on Tanaka's other ships. At 23:16, Tanaka ordered unloading preparations halted and "All ships attack."

At 23:14, operators on "Fletcher" established firm radar contact with "Takanami" and the lead group of four drum-carrying destroyers. At 23:15, with the range , Commander William M. Cole, commander of Wright's destroyer group and captain of "Fletcher", radioed Wright for permission to fire torpedoes. Wright waited two minutes and then responded with, "Range on bogies [Tanaka's ships on radar] excessive at present." Cole responded that the range was fine. Another two minutes passed before Wright responded with permission to fire. In the meantime, the US destroyers' targets escaped from an optimum firing setup ahead to a marginal position passing abeam, giving the American torpedoes a long overtaking run near the limit of their range. At 23:20, "Fletcher", "Perkins", and "Drayton" fired a total of 20 <a href="Mark%2015%20torpedo">Mark 15 torpedo</a>es towards Tanaka's ships. "Maury", lacking SG radar and thus having no contacts, withheld fire.

At the same time, Wright ordered his force to open fire. At 23:21, "Minneapolis" complied with her first salvo, quickly followed by the other American cruisers. Cole's four destroyers fired <a href="star%20shell">star shell</a>s to illuminate the targets as previously directed then increased speed to clear the area for the cruisers to operate.

Because of her closer proximity to Wright's column, "Takanami" was the target of most of the Americans' initial gunfire. "Takanami" returned fire and launched her full load of eight torpedoes, but was quickly hit by American gunfire and, within four minutes, was set afire and incapacitated. As "Takanami" was destroyed, the rest of Tanaka's ships, almost unnoticed by the Americans, were increasing speed, maneuvering, and preparing to respond to the American attack. All of the American torpedoes missed. Historian Russell S. Crenshaw, Jr. postulates that had the twenty-four <a href="Mark%2015%20torpedo">Mark 15 torpedo</a>es fired by US Navy destroyers during the battle not been fatally flawed, the outcome of the battle might have been different.
Tanaka's flagship, "Naganami", reversed course to <a href="starboard">starboard</a>, opened fire and began laying a smoke screen. The next two ships astern, "Kawakaze" and "Suzukaze", reversed course to <a href="Port%20%28nautical%29">port</a>. At 23:23, "Suzukaze" fired eight torpedoes in the direction of the gunflashes from Wright's cruisers, followed by "Naganami" and "Kawakaze" which fired their full loads of eight torpedoes at 23:32 and 23:33 respectively.

Meanwhile, the four destroyers at the head of the Japanese column maintained their heading down the Guadalcanal coast, allowing Wright's cruisers to pass on the opposite course. Once clear of "Takanami" at 23:28, "Kuroshio" fired four and "Oyashio" fired eight torpedoes in the direction of Wright's column and then reversed course and increased speed. Wright's cruisers maintained the same course and speed as the 44 Japanese torpedoes headed in their direction.

At 23:27, as "Minneapolis" fired her ninth salvo and Wright prepared to order a course change for his column, two torpedoes, from either "Suzukaze" or "Takanami", struck her forward half. One warhead exploded the aviation fuel storage tanks forward of turret one and the other knocked out three of the ship's four firerooms. The bow forward of turret one folded down at a 70-degree angle and the ship lost power and steering control. Thirty-seven men were killed.
Less than a minute later a torpedo hit "New Orleans" abreast of turret one and exploded the ship's forward ammunition magazines and aviation gasoline storage. The blast severed the ship's entire bow forward of turret two. The bow twisted to port, damaging the ship's hull as it was wrenched free by the ship's momentum, and sank immediately off the aft port quarter. Everyone in turrets one and two perished. "New Orleans" was forced into a reverse course to starboard and lost steering and communications. A total of 183 men were killed. Herbert Brown, a seaman in the ship's plotting room, described the scene after the torpedo hit: 

"Pensacola" followed next astern in the cruiser column. Observing "Minneapolis" and "New Orleans" taking hits and slowing, "Pensacola" steered to pass them on the port side and then, once past, returned to the same base course. At 23:39, "Pensacola" took a torpedo abreast the mainmast. The explosion spread flaming oil throughout the interior and across the main deck of the ship, killing 125 of the ship's crew. The hit ripped away the port outer driveshaft and the ship took a 13-degree list and lost power, communications, and steering.

Astern of "Pensacola", "Honolulu's" captain chose to pass "Minneapolis" and "New Orleans" on the starboard side. At the same time, the ship increased speed to , maneuvered radically, and successfully transited the battle area without taking any damage while maintaining main battery fire at the rapidly disappearing Japanese destroyers.

The last cruiser in the American column, "Northampton", followed "Honolulu" to pass the damaged cruisers ahead to starboard. Unlike "Honolulu", "Northampton" did not increase speed or attempt any radical maneuvers. At 23:48, after returning to the base course, "Northampton" was hit by two of "Kawakaze's" torpedoes. One hit below the waterline abreast the after engine room, and four seconds later, the second hit further aft. The after engine room flooded, three of four shafts ceased turning, and the ship listed 10 degrees to port and caught fire. Fifty men were killed.

The last ships in Wright's column, "Lamson" and "Lardner", failed to locate any targets and exited the battle area to the east after being mistakenly fired on by machine guns from "New Orleans". Cole's four destroyers circled completely around Savo Island at maximum speed and reentered the battle area, but the engagement had already ended.

Meanwhile, at 23:44 Tanaka ordered his ships to break contact and retire from the battle area. As they proceeded up Guadalcanal's coast, "Kuroshio" and "Kagerō" fired eight more torpedoes towards the American ships, which all missed. When "Takanami" failed to respond to radio calls, Tanaka directed "Oyashio" and "Kuroshio" to go to her assistance. The two destroyers located the burning ship at 01:00 on December 1 but abandoned rescue efforts after detecting American warships in the area. "Oyashio" and "Kuroshio" quickly departed the sound to rejoin the rest of Tanaka's ships for the return journey to the Shortlands, which they reached 10 hours later. "Takanami" was the only Japanese warship hit by American gunfire and seriously damaged during the battle.

"Takanami"'s surviving crew abandoned ship at 01:30, but a large explosion killed many more of them in the water, including the destroyer division commander, Toshio Shimizu, and the ship's captain, Masami Ogura. Of her crew of 244, 48 survived to reach shore on Guadalcanal and 19 of them were captured by the Americans.

"Northampton"'s crew was unable to contain the ship's fires and list and began to abandon ship at 01:30. The ship sank at 03:04 about from Doma Cove on Guadalcanal (). "Fletcher" and "Drayton" rescued the ship's 773 survivors.

"Minneapolis", "New Orleans", and "Pensacola" were able to sail the to Tulagi by the morning of December 1, where they were berthed for emergency repairs. The fires on "Pensacola" burned for 12 hours before being extinguished. "Pensacola" departed Tulagi for rear area ports and further repair on December 6. After construction of temporary bows from coconut logs, "Minneapolis" and "New Orleans" departed Tulagi for Espiritu Santo or <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Australia on December 12. All three cruisers required lengthy and extensive repairs. "New Orleans" returned to action in August, "Minneapolis" in September, and "Pensacola" in October 1943.

The battle was one of the worst defeats suffered by the US Navy in World War II, third only to the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Savo%20Island">Battle of Savo Island</a>. The battle, along with the losses suffered during the Battle of Savo Island, <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Esperance">Cape Esperance</a> and the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battles of Guadalcanal</a> temporarily left the US Navy with only 4 operational <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and 9 <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s in the entire Pacific Ocean. In spite of his defeat in the battle, Wright was awarded the <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a>, one of the highest American military decorations for bravery, for his actions during the engagement. Mitigating to some degree the destruction of his task force, Wright, in his after-action report, claimed that his force sank four Japanese destroyers and damaged two others. Halsey, in his comments on Wright's report, placed much of the blame for the defeat on Cole, saying that the destroyer squadron commander fired his torpedoes from too great a distance to be effective and should have "helped" the cruisers instead of circling around Savo Island. The recriminations did not affect Cole's career; he had won a Navy Cross of his own for actions during the Naval battles of Guadalcanal, and continued to lead destroyer squadrons in the Pacific, later being promoted to rear admiral.

Tanaka claimed to have sunk a battleship and two cruisers in the battle.

The results of the battle led to further discussion in the <a href="U.S.%20Pacific%20Fleet">US Pacific Fleet</a> about changes in tactical doctrine and the need for technical improvements, such as <a href="Smokeless%20powder%23Flashless%20powder">flashless powder</a>. It was not until eight months later that the naval high command recognized there were serious problems with the functioning of the torpedoes. The Americans were still unaware of the range and power of Japanese torpedoes and the effectiveness of Japanese night battle tactics. In fact, Wright claimed that his ships must have been fired on by submarines since the observed position of Tanaka's ships "make it improbable that torpedoes with speed-distance characteristics similar to our own" could have caused such damage, though Tanaka states that his torpedoes were fired at a range as short as three miles. The Americans did not recognize the true capabilities of their Pacific adversary's torpedoes (particularly the surface-ship-fired <a href="Type%2093%20torpedo">Type 93</a> "Long Lance") and night tactics until well into 1943. After the war, Tanaka said of his victory at Tassafaronga, "I have heard that US naval experts praised my command in that action. I am not deserving of such honors. It was the superb proficiency and devotion of the men who served me that produced the tactical victory for us."
In spite of their defeat in the battle, the Americans had prevented Tanaka from landing the desperately needed food supplies on Guadalcanal, albeit at high cost. A second Japanese supply delivery attempt by 10 destroyers led by Tanaka on December 3 successfully dumped 1,500 drums of provisions off Tassafaronga, but strafing American aircraft sank all but 310 of them the next day before they could be pulled ashore. On December 7, a third attempt by 12 destroyers was turned back by US PT boats off Cape Esperance. The next night, two US PT boats torpedoed and sank the Japanese submarine as it attempted to deliver supplies to Guadalcanal. Based on the difficulties experienced trying to deliver food to the island, the Japanese Navy informed Imamura on December 8 that they intended to stop all destroyer transportation runs to Guadalcanal immediately. After Imamura protested, the navy agreed to one more run to the island.

The last attempt to deliver food to Guadalcanal by destroyers in 1942 was led by Tanaka on the night of December 11 and consisted of 11 destroyers. Five US PT boats met Tanaka off Guadalcanal and torpedoed his flagship , severely damaging the destroyer and injuring Tanaka. After Tanaka transferred to "Naganami", "Teruzuki" was scuttled. Only 220 of the 1,200 drums released that night were recovered by Japanese army personnel on shore. Tanaka was subsequently relieved of command and transferred to Japan on December 29, 1942.

On December 12, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, on December 31, 1942 Japan's <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a>, with approval from <a href="Hirohito">the Emperor</a>, agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and the establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on <a href="New%20Georgia">New Georgia</a>. The <a href="Operation%20Ke">Japanese evacuated</a> their remaining forces from Guadalcanal over three nights between February 2 and February 7, 1943, conceding the hard-fought campaign to the Allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World War II.

John Sherman Cooper

John Sherman Cooper (August 23, 1901 – February 21, 1991) was an American politician, jurist, and diplomat from the U.S. state of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He served three non-consecutive, partial terms in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> before being elected to two full terms in 1960 and 1966. He also served as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20India">U.S. Ambassador to India</a> from 1955 to 1956 and <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20East%20Germany">U.S. Ambassador to East Germany</a> from 1974 to 1976. He was the first <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> to be <a href="Direct%20election">popularly elected</a> to more than one term as a senator from Kentucky and, in both 1960 and 1966, he set records for the largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate from either party.

Cooper's first political service was as a member of the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> from 1927 to 1929. In 1930, he was elected <a href="County%20Judge/Executive">county judge</a> of <a href="Pulaski%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Pulaski County</a>. After a failed gubernatorial bid in 1939, he joined the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> in 1942. During World War II, he earned the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star Medal</a> for reorganizing the <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>n judicial system after the <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">allied victory in Europe</a>. While still in Germany, he was elected <a href="Kentucky%20Circuit%20Courts">circuit judge</a> for Kentucky's 28th district. He returned home to accept the judgeship, which he held for less than a year before resigning to seek election to <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a>'s vacated seat in the U.S. Senate. He won the seat by 41,823 votes, the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time.

During his first term in the Senate, Cooper voted with the majority of his party just 51% of the time. He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1948, after which he accepted an appointment by President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> as a delegate to the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations General Assembly</a> and served as a special assistant to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Dean%20Acheson">Dean Acheson</a> during the formation of the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO). Cooper was again elected to a partial term in the Senate in 1952. The popular Cooper appeared likely to be re-elected in 1954 until the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> nominated former Vice-President <a href="Alben%20W.%20Barkley">Alben W. Barkley</a>. Cooper lost the general election and was appointed Ambassador to India by President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> in 1955. Cooper gained the confidence of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20India">Indian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and dramatically improved relations between the U.S. and the recently independent state of India, helping rebuff <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> hopes of expanding <a href="communism">communism</a> in Asia. Barkley died in 1956, and Eisenhower requested that Cooper seek Barkley's open seat. Cooper reluctantly acquiesced and was elected to serve the rest of Barkley's term.

In 1960, Cooper was re-elected, securing his first full, six-year term in the Senate. Newly elected President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> – Cooper's former Senate colleague – chose Cooper to conduct a secret fact-finding mission to Moscow and <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>. Following <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">Kennedy's assassination</a> in November 1963, President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> appointed Cooper to the <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a> to investigate the assassination. Cooper soon became an outspoken opponent of Johnson's decision to escalate U.S. military involvement in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, consistently advocating negotiation with the <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>ese instead. After Cooper's re-election in 1966, he worked with <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> Democrat <a href="Frank%20Church">Frank Church</a> on <a href="Cooper-Church%20Amendment">a series of amendments</a> designed to de-fund further U.S. military operations in the region. These amendments were hailed as the first serious attempt by <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to curb presidential authority over military operations during an ongoing war. Aging and increasingly deaf, Cooper did not seek re-election in 1972. His last acts of public service were as Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976 and as an alternate delegate to the United Nations in 1981. He died in a Washington, D.C., retirement home on February 21, 1991, and was buried in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>.

John Sherman Cooper was born August 23, 1901, in <a href="Somerset%2C%20Kentucky">Somerset, Kentucky</a>. He was the second child and first son of seven children born to John Sherman and Helen Gertrude (Tartar) Cooper. The Cooper family had been prominent in the Somerset area since brothers Malachi and Edward Cooper migrated from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> along the <a href="Wilderness%20Trail">Wilderness Trail</a> and through the <a href="Cumberland%20Gap">Cumberland Gap</a> around 1790, shortly after <a href="Daniel%20Boone">Daniel Boone</a>. His father's parents – staunch <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>s – were active in the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-slavery movement</a> in the nineteenth century, and the elder John Sherman Cooper (called "Sherman") was named after the <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">Apostle John</a> and <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>, a hero of the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. The family was very active in local politics; six of Cooper's ancestors, including his father, were elected <a href="county%20judge">county judge</a>s in <a href="Pulaski%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Pulaski County</a>, and two had been <a href="Kentucky%20Circuit%20Courts">circuit judges</a>. Sherman Cooper engaged in numerous successful business ventures and was known as the wealthiest man in Somerset. At the time of John Sherman Cooper's birth, his father was serving as collector of internal revenue in <a href="Kentucky%27s%208th%20congressional%20district">Kentucky's 8th congressional district</a>, a position to which he had been appointed by President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>.

During his youth, Cooper worked delivering newspapers, in railroad yards, and in his father's coal mines in <a href="Harlan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harlan County</a>. Despite having formerly served as county school superintendent, Cooper's father had a low opinion of the <a href="State%20school">public schools</a>, and until he was in the <a href="fifth%20grade">fifth grade</a>, Cooper was privately tutored by a neighbor. While his father was away on business in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, his mother sent him to sixth grade at the public school, which he attended thereafter. At <a href="Somerset%20High%20School%20%28Kentucky%29">Somerset High School</a>, he played both basketball and football. After the outbreak of World War I, Cooper joined an informal military training unit at the high school. Two of the school's instructors organized the boys into two <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">companies</a>, but Cooper, who was given the rank of captain, later recalled that "they taught us how to march and that's about all." During his senior year, Cooper served as class president and class poet. In 1918, he graduated second in his high school class and was chosen to give the <a href="commencement%20speech">commencement speech</a>.

After graduation, Cooper matriculated at <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a> in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>. While at Centre, Cooper was accepted into the <a href="Beta%20Theta%20Pi">Beta Theta Pi</a> fraternity. He also played <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> on the <a href="Centre%20Praying%20Colonels%20football">Praying Colonels' football team</a>. Cooper was a <a href="Letterman%20%28sports%29">letterman</a> on the team, playing alongside football notables <a href="Bo%20McMillan">Bo McMillan</a>, <a href="Red%20Roberts">Red Roberts</a>, <a href="Matty%20Bell">Matty Bell</a>, and <a href="Red%20Weaver">Red Weaver</a>. Another member of the team, <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Sr.">John Y. Brown, Sr.</a>, would later become one of Cooper's political rivals. Coached by <a href="Charley%20Moran">Charley Moran</a>, the team was undefeated in four games in the 1918 season, which was shortened by <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">an outbreak of the Spanish flu</a>.

Although Centre was known as one of Kentucky's foremost colleges, Cooper's father wanted him to broaden his education and, after one year at Centre, Cooper transferred to <a href="Yale%20College">Yale College</a> in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>. At Yale, he was a classmate of his future U.S. Senate colleague, <a href="Stuart%20Symington">Stuart Symington</a>. Cooper was active in many extracurricular activities at Yale, including the Sophomore German Committee, the Junior <a href="Prom">Prom</a>enade Committee, the <a href="Student%20council">Student Council</a>, the Class Day Committee, the Southern Club, the University Club, and Beta Theta Pi. A member of the Undergraduate Athletic Association, he played football and basketball, becoming the first person in Yale history to be named <a href="Captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a> of the basketball team in his junior and senior years. In his senior year, he was accepted into the elite <a href="Skull%20and%20Bones">Skull and Bones</a> society but regretted not being accepted into <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. Upon graduation, he was voted most popular and most likely to succeed in his class.

Cooper earned a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree from Yale in 1923 and enrolled at <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> later that year. During the summer break of 1924, he returned to Kentucky, where his father, dying of <a href="Bright%27s%20disease">Bright's disease</a>, told him that he would soon become the head of the family, and that most of the family's resources had been lost in the <a href="Depression%20of%201920%E2%80%9321">economic recession of the early 1920s</a>. Cooper returned to Harvard after his father's death, but soon discovered that he could not simultaneously pursue a law degree and manage his family's affairs. He was <a href="Admission%20to%20the%20bar%20in%20the%20United%20States">admitted to the bar</a> by examination in 1928 and opened a legal practice in Somerset. Over the next 20 years, he sold his father's remaining assets, paid off the family debts, and financed a college education for his six siblings.

After being urged into politics by his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed for a seat in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> as a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> in 1927. As a member of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor</a> <a href="Flem%20D.%20Sampson">Flem D. Sampson</a>'s unsuccessful attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing <a href="injunction">injunction</a>s to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.

In 1929, Cooper declared his candidacy for county judge of Pulaski County. His opponent, the incumbent, was the president of Somerset Bank and the former law partner of Cooper's father. Cooper won the election, however, beginning the first of his eight years as county judge. During his service, he was required by law to enforce <a href="eviction">eviction</a> notices, but often helped those he evicted find other housing or gave them money himself, earning him the nickname "the poor man's judge". He reportedly became so depressed by the poverty and suffering of his constituents during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> that he had a <a href="nervous%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> and took a leave of absence to seek psychiatric treatment.

Cooper served on the board of trustees for the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a> from 1935 to 1946. In 1939, he sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination. As a result of a mandatory <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a> law passed in 1935, the Republican nominee would not be chosen by a <a href="political%20convention">nominating convention</a>, as was typical for the party. Cooper garnered only 36% of the vote in the primary, losing the nomination to <a href="King%20Swope">King Swope</a>, a <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a> circuit court judge and former <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">congressman</a>.

Although well above <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">the draft age</a> at 41 years old, Cooper enlisted for service in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in World War II in 1942. Immediately offered an officer's commission, he chose instead to enlist as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a>. After basic training, he enrolled in <a href="Officer%20Candidate%20School%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">Officer Candidate School</a> at the <a href="Fort%20Custer%20Training%20Center">Fort Custer Training Center</a> in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. He studied military government and graduated second in his class of 111 students. In 1943, he was commissioned a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> and assigned to the <a href="XV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XV Corps</a> of General <a href="George%20Patton">George Patton</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Central">Third Army</a> as a courier in the military police. Cooper served in France, Luxembourg, and Germany. After liberating the <a href="Buchenwald%20concentration%20camp">Buchenwald concentration camp</a>, Patton ordered the entire population of the nearby city of <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> to go through it and observe the conditions; Cooper also viewed the camp at that time.

Following the cessation of hostilities, Cooper served as a legal advisor for the 300,000 <a href="displaced%20persons">displaced persons</a> in his unit's occupation zone seeking repatriation after being brought to Germany as slaves by the Nazis. Under the terms of the agreement reached at the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Conference</a>, all displaced Russian nationals were to be returned to the Soviet Union, but Soviet negotiators decided that the agreement did not apply to non-Russian spouses and children of the nationals. Cooper brought this to the attention of General Patton, who rescinded the repatriation order in the Third Army's occupation zone. Cooper received a citation from the Third Army's military government section for his action. Cooper also oversaw the reorganization of the 239 courts in the German state of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> in an attempt to replace all the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> officials, for which he was awarded the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star Medal</a>. Among the judges installed by Cooper were <a href="Wilhelm%20Hoegner">Wilhelm Hoegner</a>, future <a href="Minister-President">Minister-President</a> of Bavaria, and <a href="Ludwig%20Erhard">Ludwig Erhard</a>, the future <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor of Germany</a>.

In 1943 or 1944, while he was still in the Army, Cooper married a nurse named Evelyn Pfaff. Cooper was elected without opposition as circuit judge of Kentucky's twenty-eighth judicial district in 1945, despite still being in Germany and not campaigning for the office. He was discharged from the Army with the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a> in February 1946 and returned to Kentucky to assume the judgeship.

Cooper's judicial district included his native Pulaski County, as well as <a href="Rockcastle%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Rockcastle</a>, <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Wayne</a> and <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Clinton</a> counties. During his tenure, <a href="African-American">blacks</a> were allowed to serve on trial juries in the district for the first time. Of the first 16 <a href="judicial%20opinion">opinions</a> he issued during his time on the bench, 15 were upheld by the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, Kentucky's <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">court of last resort</a> at the time.
Cooper resigned his judgeship in November 1946 to seek the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> seat vacated when <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a> resigned to accept the position of <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a>. Cooper's opponent, former Congressman and <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives</a> John Y. Brown, Sr., was better known and widely believed to be the favorite in the race. However, Brown had alienated Chandler's supporters in the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> during a hotly contested senatorial primary between Brown and Chandler in 1942, and this group worked against his election in 1946. Further, the "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" opposed Brown because of his attacks on former Senator <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a> and Judge <a href="Robert%20Worth%20Bingham">Robert Worth Bingham</a>, who were heads of a powerful <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a> in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>. With these two factors working against Brown, Cooper won the election to fill Chandler's unexpired term by 41,823 votes, the largest victory margin by any Republican for any office in Kentucky up to that time. His victory marked only the third time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been <a href="Direct%20election">popularly elected</a> to the Senate. The move to Washington, D.C. proved to be too much for Cooper's already strained marriage. In 1947, he filed for divorce, charging abandonment.

Cooper described himself as "a truly terrible public speaker" and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during his career in the Senate. In the first <a href="Recorded%20vote">roll-call vote</a> of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican <a href="Owen%20Brewster">Owen Brewster</a>'s special <a href="Senate%20War%20Investigating%20Committee">War Investigating Committee</a>. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of <a href="Military%20surplus">war surplus</a> materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> Republican <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a> to ask him "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?" Cooper responded, "If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best."

A few days after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education. The bill passed the Senate, but not the House. Cooper was made chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900 million in federal funds to states for highway construction. In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide <a href="price%20support">price support</a> for <a href="burley%20tobacco">burley tobacco</a> at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on an amendment to the <a href="War%20Claims%20Act%20of%201948">War Claims Act of 1948</a> that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally. He opposed bans on industrywide <a href="collective%20bargaining">collective bargaining</a> for <a href="organized%20labor">organized labor</a> and on the establishment of <a href="closed%20shop">closed shop</a>s. He voted against putting <a href="trade%20union">union</a> welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.

Cooper continued his independence from his party throughout his term, vocally opposing Republican plans to cut taxes despite record national budget deficits and resisting the party's efforts to reduce funding for the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a> to rebuild Europe in the aftermath of the war. He worked with fellow Kentuckian <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a> and <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> Senator <a href="Wayne%20Morse">Wayne Morse</a> to undermine <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a> enacted by the states and remove obstacles to <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> for minorities. He also co-sponsored a bill to create the <a href="Medicare%20%28United%20States%29">Medicare</a> system, although it was defeated at the time. Although he had voted with the Republicans just 51% of the time during his partial term – the lowest average of any member of the party – Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the <a href="1948%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1948 Republican National Convention</a>. He supported <a href="Arthur%20Vandenberg">Arthur Vandenberg</a> for president, but <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a> ultimately received the party's nomination. Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice-president, but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re-election to his Senate seat instead. Also in 1948, Centre College awarded Cooper an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> degree.

Cooper was opposed in his re-election bid by Democratic Congressman <a href="Virgil%20M.%20Chapman">Virgil M. Chapman</a>, an ally of <a href="Earle%20C.%20Clements">Earle C. Clements</a>, who had been elected governor in 1947. As one of only a few Democrats who had voted in favor of the <a href="Taft%E2%80%93Hartley%20Act">Taft–Hartley Act</a>, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning "<a href="The%20Louisville%20Times">Louisville Times</a>" endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's favorite son, Alben Barkley, on the ballot as <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>'s running mate in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201948">1948 presidential election</a> ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.

Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the practice of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly</a>. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Dean%20Acheson">Dean Acheson</a> chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.

Cooper's supporters believed he would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be appointed to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Chapman was killed in an automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Underwood">Thomas R. Underwood</a>, Governor <a href="Lawrence%20Wetherby">Lawrence Wetherby</a>'s appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the "Louisville Times" and the "Louisville Courier-Journal" recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been elected to the Senate more than once.

Cooper was named to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Health%2C%20Education%2C%20Labor%2C%20and%20Pensions">Senate Committee on Labor, Education and Public Welfare</a> and chaired its education and labor subcommittees. He sponsored a bill authorizing public works projects along the <a href="Big%20Sandy%20River%20%28Ohio%20River%29">Big Sandy River</a>, including the <a href="Tug%20Fork">Tug</a> and <a href="Levisa%20Fork">Levisa</a> forks. He also supported the reconstruction of the <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">locks and dams</a> along the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> and the construction of locks, dams, and reservoirs in the <a href="Green%20River%20%28Kentucky%29">Green River</a> Valley. He opposed the <a href="Dixon-Yates%20contract">Dixon-Yates contract</a>, which would have paid a private company to construct a new power station to generate power for the city of <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, calling instead for authorization for the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> to issue bonds to finance the construction of new power stations. He supported a comprehensive program benefiting the coal industry and cosponsored a bill to extending public library services to rural areas.

Cooper continued to be an independent voice in the Senate. During the <a href="Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a>, he was critical of attempts to permit illegal <a href="telephone%20tapping">wiretap</a> evidence in federal courts and attempts to reduce the protections against self-incrimination granted by the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a>. Nevertheless, he refused to strip <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, the leading figure in the Red Scare, of his major Senate committee chairmanships, cautioning that "many of those who bitterly oppose Senator McCarthy call for the same tactics that they charge him with." He was the only Republican to oppose the <a href="Bricker%20Amendment">Bricker Amendment</a>, which would have limited the president's treaty-making power. He concluded that the issues addressed by the amendment were not sufficient to warrant a change to the <a href="US%20Constitution">Constitution</a>. He also opposed the <a href="Submerged%20Lands%20Act">Submerged Lands Act</a> and the Mexican Farm Labor bill, both of which were supported by the Eisenhower administration. He denounced Eisenhower's appointment of <a href="Albert%20M.%20Cole">Albert M. Cole</a>, an open opponent of <a href="public%20housing">public housing</a>, as <a href="Federal%20Housing%20Administration">Federal Housing Administrator</a> and opposed many of the agricultural reforms proposed by Eisenhower's Agriculture Secretary, <a href="Ezra%20Taft%20Benson">Ezra Taft Benson</a>. Again, his independence did little to diminish his stature in the party. In 1954, he was named to the <a href="Senate%20Republican%20Policy%20Committee">Senate Republican Policy Committee</a>.

Cooper again sought re-election in 1954. Democrats first considered Governor Wetherby as his opponent, but Wetherby's candidacy would have drawn a primary challenger from the Happy Chandler faction of the Democratic Party, possibly leading to a party split and Cooper's re-election. Instead, party leaders convinced former Vice President Barkley, now 77 years old, to run for the seat in order to ensure party unity. There were few policy differences between Barkley and Cooper, who had been deemed the most liberal Republican in the Senate by <a href="Americans%20for%20Democratic%20Action">Americans for Democratic Action</a>. During the campaign, Cooper was featured on the cover of "Time" on July 5, 1954. Cooper appealed to women voters, who were concerned about the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a> and to black voters, for his stands in favor of civil rights. He also claimed that he would be a less partisan senator than Barkley. Barkley's personal popularity carried him to a 71,000-vote victory, however. Glenn Finch opined that "Barkley was unbeatable in his own state, and it is probable that no other candidate could have defeated Cooper."

In 1955, President Dwight Eisenhower nominated Cooper as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20India">U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal</a>. During his time as a delegate for the United Nations, Cooper had met <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20India">Indian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and established a cordial working relationship with the Indian delegation, including Nehru's sister <a href="Vijaya%20Lakshmi%20Pandit">Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit</a>. The Indians had been impressed with Cooper and the Indian government had expressed their desire that Cooper serve as their ambassador from the U.S. Cooper initially rejected the offer of the Indian ambassadorship from Secretary of State <a href="John%20Foster%20Dulles">John Foster Dulles</a> but was convinced to accept it by a personal request from President Eisenhower. The Senate confirmed Cooper's nomination on February 4, 1955.

India had only become an independent nation in 1948, and it was considered a potential bulwark against Communism in Asia. U.S.–India relations were strained, however, because of India's recognition of <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">Communist China</a>, its opposition to the <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO), and its resistance to foreign interference in <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>. "<a href="U.S.%20News%20and%20World%20Report">U.S. News and World Report</a>" described the ambassadorship as "one of the most difficult and delicate in all the diplomatic world".

Cooper married Lorraine Rowan Shevlin on March 17, 1955, in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>, just ten days before leaving for India. Twice divorced, Shevlin was the daughter of a wealthy California real estate developer, step-daughter of <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican</a> official Prince Domenico Orsini, and a well-known socialite. She was fluent in three languages and understood Russian. The two had dated for much of the 1950s, but Cooper was hesitant to marry because he had doubts about moving into Shevlin's elaborate <a href="Georgetown%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Georgetown</a> home. (While in Washington, the unmarried Cooper permanently resided in the Dodge House Hotel.) The move to India removed this barrier, and Secretary of State Dulles encouraged Cooper to marry her before leaving so that the U.S. embassy in New Delhi might have a proper hostess. On April 4, 1955, the couple stopped in England on their way to India to visit with <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Louis Mountbatten</a>, the last <a href="Governor-General%20of%20India">Governor-General of India</a> prior to India's achieving its independence. Their discussions about the situation of the Indian people were part of the scant preparation Cooper received before arriving there.
Cooper began his service as ambassador by developing a close friendship with Prime Minister Nehru. Nehru's respect and admiration for Cooper soon became widely known. Cooper labored to help officials in Washington, D.C. understand that India's reluctance to align with either the West or the Communists in China and the Soviet Union was their way of exercising their newly won independence. At the same time, he defended the U.S. military buildup after World War II, its involvement in the Korean War, and its membership in mutual security pacts like NATO and SEATO as self-defense measures, not aggressive actions by the U.S. government, as the Indians widely perceived them. Cooper condemned the Eisenhower administration's decision to sell weapons to Pakistan, which was resented by the Indians, but also felt that the Indian government took some political positions without regard to their moral implications. By late 1955, the "<a href="Chicago%20Daily%20News">Chicago Daily News</a>" reported that Indo-American relations had "improved to a degree not thought possible six months ago".

In a joint communiqué dated December 2, 1955, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> Foreign Minister Paulo Cunha condemned statements made by <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Premier</a> <a href="Nikolai%20Bulganin">Nikolai Bulganin</a> and Soviet Party Chairman <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> during an eighteen-day tour of India. Of particular interest was the communiqué's reference to "Portuguese provinces in the Far East". This phrase referred to <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, a Portuguese colony in western India. Although most European nations with holdings near India had granted them to the new independent nation in 1947, Portugal refused to surrender Goa, and the region had become a source of conflict between the two nations. The joint communiqué seemed to indicate U.S. recognition of Portuguese sovereignty in Goa, which undercut Cooper's assurances to the Indians of U.S. neutrality in the matter. Cooper himself did not know about the communiqué until he read an account of it in the Indian media and was therefore unprepared to offer an explanation for it when asked by the Indian Foreign Secretary. Cooper's cable to Washington, D.C. about the matter was reported to have been "bitter", although the contents of the cable have not been released.

The Dulles–Cuhna communiqué touched off anti-American demonstrations in many parts of India. On December 6, Dulles held a news conference during which he reaffirmed U.S. neutrality on the Goa issue, but did not recant claims of Portuguese sovereignty over the region. Prime Minister Nehru announced his intent to file a formal protest with the United States over the communiqué and to address the <a href="Parliament%20of%20India">Indian Parliament</a> about the matter. In the interim, Cooper secured a meeting with Nehru and forestalled both actions. Cooper became even more upset with Dulles when Dulles authorized withholding $10 million of a $50 million aid package to India; Cooper protested the withholding, and Dulles decided to pay the full amount.

Throughout the early part of 1956, Cooper strongly advocated that the U.S. respect Indian nonalignment and increase economic aid to the country. In August 1956, Congress approved a financial aid package for India that included the largest sale up to that point of surplus agricultural products by the United States to any country. Cooper's persistence in requesting such aid was critical in getting the package approved, as it was opposed by many administration officials, including <a href="Under%20Secretary%20of%20State">Under Secretary of State</a> <a href="Herbert%20Hoover%2C%20Jr.">Herbert Hoover, Jr.</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="George%20M.%20Humphrey">George M. Humphrey</a>, and <a href="International%20Cooperation%20Administration">International Cooperation Administration</a> Director <a href="John%20B.%20Hollister">John B. Hollister</a>.

Senator Barkley died in office on April 30, 1956. Republican leaders encouraged Cooper to return from India and seek the seat, but Cooper was reluctant to give up his ambassadorship. After a personal appeal from President Eisenhower, however, Cooper acquiesced and declared his candidacy in July 1956. Even after leaving India, he maintained close ties with the country's leaders and was the official U.S. representative at the funerals of Prime Minister Nehru in 1964, Prime Minister <a href="Lal%20Bahadur%20Shastri">Lal Bahadur Shastri</a> in 1966, and Prime Minister <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> in 1984.

Because Barkley's death occurred after the filing deadline for the November elections, the Democratic State Central Committee had to choose a nominee for the now-open seat. After unsuccessfully attempting to find a compromise candidate that both the Clements and Chandler factions could support, they chose Lawrence Wetherby, whose term as governor had recently expired. Chandler, now serving his second term as governor, was angered by the choice of Wetherby, and most members of his faction either gave Wetherby lukewarm support or outright supported Cooper instead. This, combined with Cooper's personal popularity, led to his victory over Wetherby by 65,000 votes.

Upon his return to the Senate in 1957, Cooper was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a>. In 1959, he challenged <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> Senator <a href="Everett%20Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a> to become the Republican <a href="floor%20leader">floor leader</a> in the Senate, but lost by four votes. In a 1960 poll of fifty journalists conducted by "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" magazine, Cooper was named the ablest Republican member of the Senate. He helped author and co-sponsored the <a href="National%20Defense%20Education%20Act">National Defense Education Act</a>. Together with Senator <a href="Jennings%20Randolph">Jennings Randolph</a>, he sponsored the <a href="Appalachian%20Regional%20Development%20Act">Appalachian Regional Development Act</a>, designed to address the prevalent poverty in <a href="Appalachia">Appalachia</a>. He succeeded in gaining more state and local control over the anti-poverty group <a href="Volunteers%20in%20Service%20to%20America">Volunteers in Service to America</a>. He was a vigorous opponent of measures designed to weaken the Tennessee Valley Authority.

In 1960, Democrats nominated former governor <a href="Keen%20Johnson">Keen Johnson</a>, then an executive with <a href="Reynolds%20Metals">Reynolds Metals</a>, to oppose Cooper's re-election bid. Cooper had the support of organized labor and benefitted from a large segment of Kentuckians who voted for Republican <a href="Richard%20M.%20Nixon">Richard M. Nixon</a> over Democrat <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> as a reaction against Kennedy's <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201960">1960 presidential election</a>. Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by 199,257 votes, a record victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate.

Shortly after his election as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper to conduct a then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess the attitudes of the Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.

President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> appointed Cooper to the <a href="Warren%20Commission">Warren Commission</a>, which was charged with investigating <a href="assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">Kennedy's assassination</a> in 1963. Cooper attended 50 of the 94 hearings and rejected the <a href="single-bullet%20theory">single-bullet theory</a> stating that "there was no evidence to show that [Kennedy and <a href="Governor%20of%20Texas">Texas Governor</a> <a href="John%20Connally">John Connally</a>] were hit by the same bullet."

As one of three Republicans on the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Rules%20and%20Administration">Senate Rules and Administration Committee</a>, Cooper was involved with the investigation of Johnson aide <a href="Bobby%20Baker">Bobby Baker</a> in 1964, which he decried as "a <a href="Whitewash%20%28censorship%29">whitewash</a>" after the committee blocked further investigation. He proposed the establishment of a <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Ethics">Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct</a> in July 1964 and was named to that committee in July 1965. Also in 1965, he was chosen advisor to the United States delegation to the <a href="Manila">Manila</a> Conference that established the <a href="Asian%20Development%20Bank">Asian Development Bank</a>.

An advocate for small businesses and agricultural interests, Cooper opposed an April 1965 bill that expanded the powers of the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> to regulate cigarette advertising. In March 1966, he proposed an amendment to a mine safety bill supported by the <a href="United%20Mine%20Workers%20of%20America">United Mine Workers of America</a> that would have nullified provisions of the bill if they were not shown to contribute to the safety of small mines, but his amendment was defeated.

Although Cooper voted in favor of the 1964 <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tonkin%20Resolution">Gulf of Tonkin Resolution</a>, he opposed escalating U.S. involvement in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. As early as April 1964, Cooper was urging President Johnson to negotiate a peaceful settlement to the tensions in Southeast Asia. He questioned Southeast Asia's strategic importance to the U.S. and expressed concerns about the feasibility of deploying the U.S. military on a global scale. On March 25, 1965, he joined New York Senator <a href="Jacob%20Javits">Jacob Javits</a> in a call for President Johnson to begin negotiations for a settlement between <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> and <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> without imposing preconditions on the negotiations. Later in the day, he introduced resolutions calling for Secretary of State <a href="Dean%20Rusk">Dean Rusk</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Robert%20McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> to brief the full Senate on recent developments in Vietnam.

In January 1966, Cooper accompanied Secretary of State Rusk and Ambassador <a href="W.%20Averell%20Harriman">W. Averell Harriman</a> on an official visit to <a href="President%20of%20the%20Philippines">Philippine President</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20Marcos">Ferdinand Marcos</a> as part of a widely publicized "peace drive". This visit, along with visits to South Vietnam in December 1965 and January 1966, reinforced Cooper's opposition to military operations in Southeast Asia. In a meeting with President Johnson on January 26, 1966, he again urged the president to forgo his announced intentions to resume bombing missions in North Vietnam and negotiate a settlement instead. Johnson was noncommittal, and that afternoon, Cooper returned to the Senate floor, urgently trying to convince the legislators that negotiation was preferable to escalation, even when it meant negotiating with the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> fighters in South Vietnam, which he believed was necessary to achieve peace. Cooper advocated a three-to-five-year cease fire, enforced by the United Nations, followed by national elections as prescribed by the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">1954 Geneva Convention</a>. Ultimately, Johnson did not heed Cooper's plea and resumed U.S. bombing missions in North Vietnam.

In 1966, Cooper again won re-election over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, breaking his own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying the vote of 110 of <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kentucky">Kentucky's 120 counties</a>. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed New York Governor <a href="Nelson%20A.%20Rockefeller">Nelson A. Rockefeller</a>, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator <a href="Thruston%20B.%20Morton">Thruston B. Morton</a>, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The nomination – and eventually, the presidency – went to Republican Richard Nixon.

As a delegate to the U.N. General Assembly in 1968, Cooper strongly denounced the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia">Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia</a>. He also supported <a href="Montana">Montana</a> Senator <a href="Mike%20Mansfield">Mike Mansfield</a>'s proposal to bring the matter of the Vietnam War before the United Nations. Returning to the Senate in 1969, he joined Alaska Senator <a href="Ernest%20Gruening">Ernest Gruening</a> and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse in protesting restrictions on orderly protests at the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a>.

In the Senate, Cooper helped lead the opposition to the development and deployment of <a href="anti-ballistic%20missile">anti-ballistic missile</a>s (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide <a href="nuclear%20arms%20race">nuclear arms race</a>. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice-President <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator <a href="Philip%20Hart">Philip Hart</a> co-sponsored the <a href="Cooper%E2%80%93Hart%20Amendment">Cooper–Hart Amendment</a> that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system. The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Defense Department</a> budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening <a href="Strategic%20Arms%20Limitation%20Talks">Strategic Arms Limitation Talks</a> with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.
Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator <a href="Frank%20Church">Frank Church</a> co-sponsored the <a href="Cooper%E2%80%93Church%20Amendment">Cooper–Church Amendment</a>s, aimed at curbing further escalation of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval of one of these amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in <a href="Laos">Laos</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince <a href="Norodom%20Sihanouk">Norodom Sihanouk</a>, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was <a href="Cambodian%20coup%20of%201970">deposed in 1970</a>, Cambodia's new leader, <a href="Lon%20Nol">Lon Nol</a>, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" as "the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and <a href="George%20Aiken">George Aiken</a> convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.

Seventy-one years of age and becoming increasingly deaf, Cooper announced to the Kentucky Press Association on January 21, 1972, that he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, having served longer in that body than any other Kentuckian except Alben Barkley. The <a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame duck</a> Cooper decided to make one more attempt to end the war, after an aggressive North Vietnamese offensive against the South in March 1972 intensified fighting in the region once again. Without advance notice, Cooper addressed a nearly empty Senate chamber on July 27, 1972, proposing an amendment to a military assistance bill that would unconditionally end funding for all U.S. military operations in Indochina in four months. The measure, which had no co-sponsors, stunned Nixon and Secretary of State <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> and provoked heated debate in the Senate. <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Senator <a href="Edward%20Brooke">Edward Brooke</a> saved the amendment from almost certain demise by adding a provision that all American prisoners of war be returned prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces. The revised amendment passed 62–33, whereupon Nixon decided to sacrifice the entire military assistance bill. At Nixon's insistence, the Senate defeated the amended bill 48–42. Disappointed, Cooper nevertheless proclaimed, "I feel purged inside. I've felt strongly about this for a long time. Now it's in the hands of the President. He's the only person who can do anything about ending the war now."

After the expiration of his term, Cooper took over the "Dean Acheson chair" at the prestigious Washington law firm of <a href="Covington%20%26amp%3B%20Burling">Covington & Burling</a>. In 1972, he was chosen as the commencement speaker at Centre College, where he had served as a trustee since 1961. At the ceremony, he became the first recipient of the Isaac Shelby Award, named for two-time Kentucky governor <a href="Isaac%20Shelby">Isaac Shelby</a>, the chair of the college's first board of trustees. In 1973, Cooper resisted an attempt to name a federal building in his honor. Upon the completion of the dam that formed <a href="Laurel%20River%20Lake">Laurel River Lake</a> in 1977, Congress proposed naming the dam and lake after Cooper, but again, he declined. He was pleased, however, that the Somerset school system chose to name a program to teach and reinforce leadership skills the John Sherman Cooper Leadership Institute.

In April 1974, Nixon announced that he would appoint Cooper to be the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20East%20Germany">US Ambassador to East Germany</a>, but during the final negotiations between the countries for the US to establish an embassy in the country, Nixon resigned. His successor, <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, officially appointed Cooper to the ambassadorship, and Cooper took leave from Covington & Burling to accept it. He arrived in East Germany in December 1974 and served as ambassador until October 1976. After returning to the US, he resumed his work at Covington & Burling. In his last act of public service, he again served as an alternate delegate to the UN General Assembly in 1981.
Kentucky Governor <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Jr.">John Y. Brown, Jr.</a>, the son of Cooper's former opponent in the senatorial elections of 1946 and 1966, awarded Cooper the Governor's Distinguished Service Medallion in 1983. Later that year, Senators <a href="Walter%20Huddleston">Walter Huddleston</a> of Kentucky and <a href="Howard%20Baker">Howard Baker</a> of <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> introduced a bill to honor Cooper by renaming the <a href="Big%20South%20Fork%20National%20River%20and%20Recreation%20Area">Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area</a> to the Cooper National Recreation Area; Kentucky Congressman <a href="Hal%20Rogers">Hal Rogers</a> sponsored a parallel measure in the House. As a senator, Cooper had been instrumental in securing congressional approval for the creation of Big South Fork. Opponents of the measure in both Kentucky and Tennessee (the recreation area spans the two states) cited a variety of reasons to retain the old name, and the proposal was eventually dropped at Cooper's request.

In 1985, Cooper became the third-ever recipient of the <a href="Oxford%20Cup">Oxford Cup</a>, an award recognizing outstanding past members of Beta Theta Pi. Also in 1985, he was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Cumberland College (now the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Cumberlands">University of the Cumberlands</a>) in <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Williamsburg, Kentucky</a>. He was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Centre College in 1987. A non-partisan group co-chaired by former Kentucky gubernatorial candidate <a href="Larry%20Forgy">Larry Forgy</a> raised $60,000 to commission two sculptures of Cooper. A life-sized bronze <a href="Bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a> of Cooper sculpted by <a href="John%20Tuska">John Tuska</a> was installed at the <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Capitol">Kentucky State Capitol</a> in 1987. The other sculpture, a life-sized bronze statue crafted by <a href="Barney%20Bright">Barney Bright</a>, was placed in Fountain Square in Somerset.

Cooper retired from the practice of law in 1989. In June 1990, Cooper was honored with a gala screening of "Gentleman From Kentucky", a <a href="Kentucky%20Educational%20Television">Kentucky Educational Television</a> documentary about his life, at the <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a> in Washington. On February 21, 1991, Cooper died of heart failure in a retirement home in Washington. He had been preceded in death by his second wife, Lorraine, on February 3, 1985. On February 26, 1991, Kentucky's two senators, <a href="Wendell%20H.%20Ford">Wendell H. Ford</a> and <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a>, gave speeches on the Senate floor praising Cooper, and the Senate adjourned in Cooper's memory. Cooper was buried in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Virginia">Arlington, Virginia</a>.

Because of his extensive support of rural electrification as a senator, the East Kentucky RECC was renamed the <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper%20Power%20Station">John Sherman Cooper Power Station</a> in his honor. In 1999, the "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>" named Cooper one of the most influential Kentuckians of the 20th century. In 2000, <a href="Eastern%20Kentucky%20University">Eastern Kentucky University</a>'s Center for Kentucky History and Politics established the annual John Sherman Cooper Award for Outstanding Public Service in Kentucky.

Despite his patrician background, Cooper was known for being "affable, frequently self-deprecating and approachable."

Don Dunstan

Donald Allan Dunstan, <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">AC</a>, <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a> (21 September 1926 – 6 February 1999) was a <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n <a href="politician">politician</a>. He entered politics as the <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Norwood">Member for Norwood</a> in 1953, became leader of the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28South%20Australian%20Branch%29">South Australian Branch of the Australian Labor Party</a> in 1967, and was <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">Premier of South Australia</a> between June 1967 and April 1968, and again between June 1970 and February 1979.

Dunstan's father was a shop manager for the Morris Hedstrom chain in Fiji. However, from an early age Don was educated in Australia, and grew up as part of the <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> establishment. He excelled academically before experiencing his progressive political awakening while training in law and arts at the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>. His upper-class background and scholarly bearing made him unusual for the Labor Party at the time, but he rose quickly and entered parliament at the age of 26. Dunstan quickly achieved prominence as Labor's standout performer, a charismatic and aggressive debater in an era of sedate political conduct. The dominant political figure at the time was Premier <a href="Thomas%20Playford%20IV">Thomas Playford IV</a>, then leading the <a href="Liberal%20and%20Country%20League">Liberal and Country League</a> (LCL) through a 27-year hold on power, aided by a system of <a href="apportionment%20%28politics%29">electoral malapportionment</a> dubbed the <a href="Playmander">Playmander</a>, which gave undue weight to the LCL's rural base since its introduction by the LCL in 1936. Dunstan stridently pursued the LCL over the Playmander.

In the late 1950s, Dunstan became well known for his campaign against the <a href="death%20penalty">death penalty</a> being imposed on <a href="Max%20Stuart">Max Stuart</a>, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an unfair process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as a turning point in the LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in <a href="Aboriginal%20rights">Aboriginal rights</a>, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the <a href="White%20Australia%20Policy">White Australia Policy</a>.

Labor conducted an extensive campaign in marginal LCL seats at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201965">1965 election</a>, resulting in 21 of 39 seats, with <a href="Frank%20Walsh">Frank Walsh</a> and the Labor Party taking power. As <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20South%20Australia">Attorney-General</a> and the number-two-man in the government, the youthful and charismatic Dunstan made his older peers look lethargic as television became increasingly ubiquitous. The LCL opposition changed leaders and installed the young <a href="Steele%20Hall">Steele Hall</a>, worrying Labor as the elderly Walsh appeared bumbling in contrast. This resulted in Labor replacing Walsh with Dunstan. Despite maintaining a much larger vote over the LCL, Labor lost two seats at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201968">1968 election</a>, with the LCL forming government with support of an independent. Dunstan responded by increasing his attacks on the Playmander and was able to convincingly sustain Playmander attacks with the effect of convincing the LCL into watering down the malapportionment. Again with little change in Labor's vote but with the Playmander removed, Labor won 27 of 47 seats at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201970">1970 election</a>. With a fairer seat and boundary system in place, Dunstan won three more elections, in <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201973">1973</a>, <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201975">1975</a> and <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201977">1977</a>.

A <a href="reformist">reformist</a>, Dunstan brought profound change to South Australian society. His <a href="Social%20Progressivism">socially progressive</a> administration saw <a href="Native%20title">Aboriginal land rights</a> recognised, <a href="Gay%20rights%20in%20Australia%23LGBT%20history%20and%20activism">homosexuality decriminalised</a>, the <a href="Dame%20Roma%20Mitchell">first female judge</a> appointed, the first non-British <a href="governor%20of%20South%20Australia">governor</a>, Sir <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, and later, the first indigenous governor Sir <a href="Douglas%20Nicholls">Douglas Nicholls</a>. He enacted <a href="consumer%20protection">consumer protection</a> laws, reformed and expanded the <a href="public%20education">public education</a> and <a href="health%20system">health system</a>s, abolished the <a href="death%20penalty">death penalty</a>, relaxed <a href="censorship">censorship</a> and <a href="Alcohol">drinking</a> laws, created a ministry for the <a href="Natural%20environment">environment</a>, enacted <a href="anti-discrimination%20law">anti-discrimination law</a>, and implemented <a href="electoral%20reform">electoral reform</a>s such as the overhaul of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Legislative%20Council">Legislative Council</a> of <a href="Parliament%20of%20South%20Australia">parliament</a>, lowered the <a href="voting%20age">voting age</a> to 18, enacted <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>, and completely abolished <a href="malapportionment">malapportionment</a>, changes which gave him a less hostile parliament and allowed him to enact his reforms. He established <a href="Rundle%20Mall">Rundle Mall</a>, enacted measures to protect buildings of <a href="Heritage-listed">historical heritage</a>, and encouraged a flourishing of <a href="the%20arts">the arts</a>, with support for the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20Centre">Adelaide Festival Centre</a>, the <a href="State%20Theatre%20Company%20of%20South%20Australia">State Theatre Company</a>, and the establishment of the <a href="South%20Australian%20Film%20Corporation">South Australian Film Corporation</a>. He encouraged cultural exchanges with <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> and an increase in the state's <a href="culinary">culinary</a> awareness and sophistication. He is recognised for his role in reinvigorating the social, artistic and cultural life of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> during his nine years in office, remembered as the "Dunstan Decade". However, there were also problems; the economy began to stagnate, and the large increases to burgeoning <a href="public%20service">public service</a> generated claims of waste. One of Dunstan's pet projects, a plan to build a new city at <a href="Monarto%2C%20South%20Australia">Monarto</a> to alleviate urban pressures in Adelaide, was abandoned when economic and population growth stalled, with much money and planning already invested. After four consecutive election wins, Dunstan's administration began to falter in 1978 following his dismissal of Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury, as controversy broke out over whether he had improperly interfered with a judicial investigation. In addition, policy problems and unemployment began to mount, as well as unsubstantiated rumours of corruption and personal impropriety. Dunstan became increasingly short-tempered, and the strain was increased by the death of his second wife. His resignation from the premiership and politics in 1979 was abrupt after collapsing due to ill health, but he would live for another 20 years, remaining a vocal and outspoken campaigner for <a href="Social%20progressive">progressive social</a> policy.

Dunstan was born on 21 September 1926 in <a href="Suva">Suva</a>, Fiji to Francis Vivian Dunstan and Ida May Dunstan (née Hill) (Australian parents of <a href="Cornish%20people">Cornish</a> descent). His parents had moved to Fiji in 1916 after his father took up a position as manager of the <a href="Adelaide%20Steamship%20Company">Adelaide Steamship Company</a>. He spent the first seven years of his life in Fiji, starting his schooling there. Dunstan was beset by illness, and his parents sent him to South Australia hoping that the drier climate would assist his recovery. He lived in <a href="Murray%20Bridge%2C%20South%20Australia">Murray Bridge</a> for three years with his mother's parents before returning to Suva for a short period during his secondary education. During his time in Fiji, Dunstan mixed easily with the <a href="Indians%20in%20Fiji">Indian settlers</a> and <a href="Fijians">indigenous people</a>, something that was frowned upon by the <a href="white%20people">whites</a> on the island.

He won a <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a> in <a href="Classics">classical studies</a> and attended <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20College%2C%20Adelaide">St Peter's College</a>, a traditional private school for the sons of the Adelaide establishment. He developed public speaking and acting skills, winning the College's public speaking prize for two consecutive years. In 1943, he portrayed the title role in a production of <a href="John%20Drinkwater%20%28playwright%29">John Drinkwater</a>'s play "<a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20%28play%29">Abraham Lincoln</a>", and according to the school magazine, he "was the chief contributor to the success of the occasion." His academic strengths were in classical history and languages, and he disliked mathematics. He gained a reputation as a maverick, and said that his headmaster called him a "congenital rebel" multiple times. During this time, Dunstan did not board and lived in the seaside suburb of <a href="Glenelg%2C%20South%20Australia">Glenelg</a> with relatives. Dunstan completed his secondary schooling in 1943, ranking in the top 30 overall in the statewide matriculation examinations.

In his youth, influenced by his uncle, former Liberal <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20and%20lord%20mayors%20of%20Adelaide">Lord Mayor of Adelaide</a> Sir Jonathan Cain, Dunstan was a supporter of the <a href="Liberal%20conservatism">conservative</a> <a href="Liberal%20and%20Country%20League">Liberal and Country League</a> (LCL) and handed out how-to-vote cards for the party at state elections. Dunstan later said of his involvement with the Liberals: "I do not call it snobbery to deride the Establishment in South Australia, I admit that I was brought up into it, and I admit that it gave me a pain." When asked of his roots, he said "I'm a refugee from it and thank God for somewhere honest to flee to!"

His political awakening happened during his university years. Studying law and arts at the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>, he became very active in political organisations, joining the University Socialist Club, <a href="Australian%20Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a>, the Student Representative Council and the Theatre Group. A two-week stint in the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Communist Party</a> was followed by membership in the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>. Dunstan was markedly different from the general membership of the Labor Party of the time; upon applying for membership at <a href="Trades%20Hall">Trades Hall</a>, a Labor veteran supposedly muttered "how could that long-haired prick be a Labor man?" His peculiarities, such as his upper-class accent, were a target of derision by the working-class Labor old guard throughout his early political involvement. Dunstan funded his education by working in theatre and radio during his university years. He eventually graduated with a double degree, with arts majors in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="comparative%20philology">comparative philology</a>, history and politics, and he came first in political science.

After Dunstan graduated, he moved with his wife to Fiji where he was admitted to the bar and began his career as a lawyer. They returned to Adelaide in 1951 and settled in George Street, <a href="Norwood%2C%20South%20Australia">Norwood</a>, taking in boarders as a source of extra income.

Dunstan was nominated as the Labor candidate for the <a href="electoral%20district%20of%20Norwood">electoral district of Norwood</a> at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201953">1953 election</a>. His campaign was noted for his colourful methods to sway voters: posters of his face were placed on every <a href="stobie%20pole">pole</a> in the district, and Labor supporters walked the streets advocating Dunstan. He targeted in particular the large <a href="Italian%20Australian">Italian</a> migrant population of the district, distributing translated copies of a statement the sitting LCL member <a href="Roy%20Moir">Roy Moir</a> had made about immigrants. Moir had commented that "these immigrants are of no use to us – a few of them are tradesmen but most of them have no skills at all. And when they intermarry we'll have all the colours of the rainbow". Dunstan won the seat and was elected to the <a href="South%20Australian%20House%20of%20Assembly">South Australian House of Assembly</a>. His son Andrew was born nine months after the win.

Dunstan was to become the most vocal opponent of the LCL Government of <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Playford">Sir Thomas Playford</a>, strongly criticising its practice of <a href="apportionment%20%28politics%29">electoral malapportionment</a>, known as the <a href="Playmander">Playmander</a>, a pun on the term <a href="Gerrymandering">gerrymander</a>. This system gave a disproportionate electoral weight to the LCL's rural base, with votes worth as much as ten times others − at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201968">1968 election</a> the rural seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Frome">Frome</a> had 4,500 formal votes, while the metropolitan seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Enfield">Enfield</a> had 42,000 formal votes. He added colour and flair to debate in South Australian politics, changing the existing "gentlemanly" method of conducting parliamentary proceedings. He did not fear direct confrontation with the incumbent government and attacked it with vigour—up to this point most of his Labor colleagues had become dispirited by the Playmander, and were resigned to the ongoing dominance of Playford and LCL, so they were sought to influence policy through collaborative legislating. In 1954, the LCL introduced the Government Electoral Bill, which was designed to further accentuate the undue weight on rural voters. During the debate, Dunstan decried this "immoral Bill ... I cannot separate it from the motives of those who put it forward. Since it is immoral, so are they." Such language, unusually aggressive by the prevailing standards, resulted in Dunstan's removal from the parliamentary chambers after he refused a request from the Speaker to retract his remark. The first parliamentarian to be expelled in years, Dunstan found himself on the front pages of newspapers for the first time. Nevertheless, he was not able to build up much of a profile in his first few years as "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">The Advertiser</a>", the dominant newspaper in the city, had a policy of ignoring the young politician's activities—its editor Lloyd Dumas was the father of one of Dunstan's first girlfriends.

In December 1958 there occurred an event that initially had nothing to do with Playford, but eventually intensified into a debacle that was regarded as a turning point in his premiership and marked the end of his rule. Dunstan was prominent in pressuring Playford during this time.

A young girl was found raped and murdered, and <a href="Max%20Stuart">Max Stuart</a>, an <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Aborigine</a>, was convicted and sentenced to be executed. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Australia">Supreme</a> and <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Courts</a> were dismissed. Amid objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, "The News" brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign.

When Playford and the Executive Council decided not to reprieve Stuart, an appeal to the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> was made to stall the execution. Spearheaded by Dunstan, Labor then tried to introduce legislation to stall the hanging. Amid hue and cry, Playford started a Royal Commission to review the case. However, two of the commissioners had already been involved in the trial and one of the appeals. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias from Dunstan and Labor, who also attacked Playford for what they regarded as a too-restrictive scope of inquiry.

The Royal Commission began its work and the proceedings were followed closely and eagerly debated by the public. As Playford did not commute Stuart's sentence, Dunstan introduced a bill to abolish <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>. The vote was split along party lines and was thus defeated, but Dunstan used the opportunity to attack the Playmander with much effect in the media, portraying the failed legislation as an unjust triumph of a malapportioned minority who had a vengeance mentality over an electorally repressed majority who wanted a humane outcome.

Amid the continuing uproar, Playford decided to grant clemency. The Royal Commission concluded that the guilty verdict was sound. Although a majority of those who spoke out against the handling of the matter—including Dunstan—thought that Stuart was probably guilty, the events provoked heated and bitter debate in South Australian society and destabilised Playford's administration, while bringing much publicity to Dunstan.

From 1959 onwards, the LCL government clung to power with the support of two independents, as Labor gained momentum. Always at the forefront, Dunstan lambasted the government for perceived underspending on social welfare, education, health and the arts. Dunstan heavily promoted himself as a reformer.

In 1960, Dunstan became president of the State Labor Party. The year also saw the death of Opposition Leader <a href="Mick%20O%27Halloran">Mick O'Halloran</a> and his replacement by <a href="Frank%20Walsh">Frank Walsh</a>. Dunstan attempted to win both the position of Opposition Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor <a href="caucus">caucus</a> was sceptical of his age and inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, albeit narrowly.

Federally, Dunstan, together with fellow <a href="Australian%20Fabian%20Society">Australian Fabian Society</a> member <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>, set about removing the <a href="White%20Australia%20policy">White Australia policy</a> from the Labor platform. The older trade-unionist-based members of the Labor Party vehemently opposed changing the status quo. However, the "New Guard" of the party, of which Dunstan was a part, were determined to bring about its end. Attempts in 1959 and 1961 failed, with Labor leader <a href="Arthur%20Calwell">Arthur Calwell</a> stating, "It would ruin the Party if we altered the immigration policy ... it was only cranks, long hairs, academics and do-gooders who wanted the change". However, Dunstan persisted in his efforts, and in 1965 it was removed from the Labor platform at their national conference; Dunstan personally took credit for the change. Whitlam would later bring about the comprehensive end of the White Australia policy in 1973 as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a>.

Dunstan pursued similar reforms with respect to Indigenous Australians. In 1962, the Aboriginal Affairs Bill was introduced to liberalise constraints that had been placed on Indigenous Australians in the past and had effectively resulted in segregation. The initial proposal still retained some restrictions, placing more controls over full-blooded Aborigines. Dunstan was prominent in Labor's opposition to the double standards, and called for abolition of race-based restrictions, saying that social objectives could be achieved without explicit colour-based schemes. He was successful in forcing amendments to liberalise controls on property and the confinement of Indigenous Australians to reserves. However, his attempt to remove the different standards required of part and full-blooded Aborigines failed, as did his proposal to ensure that at least half of the members of the Aboriginal Affairs Board be Indigenous Australians. Despite the passage of the bill, restrictions remained in place and Dunstan questioned the policy of assimilation of Aborigines, which he saw as the diluting of their distinctive cultures.

Labor won the seats of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Glenelg%20%28South%20Australia%29">Glenelg</a> and <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Barossa">Barossa</a> at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201965">1965 election</a>, after winning the seats of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Chaffey">Chaffey</a> and <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Unley">Unley</a> at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201962">1962 election</a>. Labor thus finally overcame the Playmander and formed government for the first time in 32 years, with <a href="Frank%20Walsh">Frank Walsh</a> as <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">Premier of South Australia</a>. Despite winning 55 percent of the primary vote, the Playmander was still strong enough that Labor won only 21 of 39 seats, a two-seat majority. Dunstan became <a href="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> and Minister of Community Welfare and Aboriginal Affairs. He was far and away the youngest member of the cabinet; he was the only minister under 50, and only one of three under 60. Dunstan had a major impact on Government policy as Attorney-General. Having only narrowly lost out on the leadership in 1960, Dunstan became the obvious successor to the 67-year-old Walsh, who was due to retire in 1967 under Labor rules of the time.
The Walsh Government implemented significant reform in its term of office. Liquor, gambling and entertainment laws were overhauled and liberalised, social welfare was gradually expanded and Aboriginal reserves were created. Strong restrictions on Aboriginal access to liquor were lifted. Women's working rights were granted under the mantra of "equal pay for work of equal value", and racial discrimination legislation was enacted. Town planning was codified in law, and the State Planning Authority was created to oversee development. Workers were given more rights and the bureaucracy of the education department was liberalised. Much of the reform was not necessarily radical and was primarily to "fill the gaps" that the previous LCL government had left. Despite a consistently higher statewide vote, Labor were consistently outnumbered 16–4 in the <a href="South%20Australian%20Legislative%20Council">Legislative Council</a>, so some desired legislation did not make it through. In 1965, the legislature convened for 65 days, the most for 34 years, but many bills were still yet to be debated.

Many bills were watered down, but due to lack of public interest, outcry was minimal. In particular, the council blocked electoral reform legislation, paving the way for a probable LCL win at the next election. Such was Dunstan's pre-eminence during his term as Attorney-General that the cabinet was often called the "Dunstan Ministry".

An economic depression had begun in South Australia after the Labor government gained office in 1965; unemployment went from the lowest in the country to the second highest, while immigration levels dropped. Labor was not responsible for the depression, although it initially did little to alleviate it. The Liberals seized on this opportunity, blaming it on "twelve months of Socialist administration in South Australia" and branding it the "Dunstan Depression".

In the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201966">1966 federal election</a>, Labor suffered a swing against it of 11.8% in South Australia, double the national average. If this was replicated at a state election, it was projected that Labor would only hold 10 of the 39 seats. The Liberals dropped Playford as the state leader, and the younger and more progressive <a href="Steele%20Hall">Steele Hall</a> took his place. In a dire situation with the next state election looming, Labor changed leaders with Walsh, a "neanderthal figure in the television age", standing down in May 1967. Much of the <a href="Labor%20Right">Labor Right</a> faction, as well as Walsh, was opposed to Dunstan taking the leadership, but no other MPs had the same charisma or eloquence. Eventually, Dunstan won the leadership over <a href="Des%20Corcoran">Des Corcoran</a>, winning fourteen votes to eleven on the strength of rural and marginal Laborites, having trailed by one vote on the first count before less popular candidates were eliminated.

Dunstan's first Premiership was eventful, with a steady stream of reform and attempts to end the depression. The latter half of 1967 saw the beginnings of a slight recovery, with unemployment dipping and industrial capacity steadying. The 1967–68 budget ran into deficit, allocating funds to energise the economic engine whilst Dunstan lambasted the Federal Government for neglecting the South Australian economy, demanding it take a degree of responsibility for its ills.

In preparation for the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201968">1968 election</a>, Labor campaigned heavily around its leader, and this resonated with voters; in surveys conducted in parts of the metropolitan area, 84% of respondents declared their approval of Dunstan. In a presidential-style election campaign, Hall and Dunstan journeyed across the state advocating their platforms, and the major issues were the leaders, the Playmander and the economy. Television saw its first major use in the election, and Dunstan, an astute public speaker, successfully mastered it. With his upbeat style, Dunstan also made an impact in the print media, which had long been a bastion of the LCL. Despite winning a 52% majority of the primary vote, and 54% of the two-party preferred count, Labor lost two seats, resulting in a hung parliament: the LCL and Labor each had 19 seats. Had 21 votes in the rural seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Murray">Murray</a> gone the other way, Labor would have retained power. The balance of power rested with the chamber's lone independent, <a href="Tom%20Stott">Tom Stott</a>, who was offered the speakership by the LCL in return for his support on the Assembly floor. Stott, a conservative, agreed to support the LCL.
There was a degree of speculation in the press that Dunstan would call for a new election because of the adverse outcome. However, Dunstan realised the futility of such a move and instead sought to humiliate the LCL into bringing an end to malapportionment. Although Stott's decision to support the LCL ended any realistic chance of Dunstan remaining premier, Dunstan did not immediately resign his commission, intending to force Hall and the LCL to demonstrate that they had support on the floor of the Assembly when it reconvened. He used the six weeks before the start of the new legislature to draw attention to malapportionment. Protests were held on 15 March in <a href="Light%20Square%2C%20Adelaide">Light Square</a>. There, Dunstan spoke to a crowd of more than 10,000: "We need to show that the people of SA feel that at last the watershed has been reached in this, and that they will not continue to put up with a system which is as undemocratic as the present one in SA." On 16 April, the first day of the new House's sitting, Dunstan lost a confidence vote. With it now clear that the LCL had control of the House, Dunstan tendered his resignation to <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Australia">Governor</a> <a href="Edric%20Bastyan">Edric Bastyan</a>. Hall was then sworn in as premier. However, the six weeks of protesting had brought nationwide criticism of the unfairness of the electoral system and put more pressure on the LCL to relent to reforms; it has been seen as one of the most important political events of its time.

With the end of Playford's tenure, the LCL had brought younger, more progressive members into its ranks. The Hall Government continued many of the social reforms that the Walsh/Dunstan governments had initiated; most of these at the instigation of Hall or his Attorney-General, <a href="Robin%20Millhouse">Robin Millhouse</a>. <a href="Abortion">Abortion</a> was partially legalised, and planning for the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20Centre">Festival Centre</a> began. The conservative and rural factions of the League, notably in the Legislative Council dominated by the landed gentry, were bitterly opposed to some reforms, and more than once Hall was forced to rely on Labor support to see bills passed. The LCL began to break apart; what had once been a united party was now factionalised—four distinct groups across the political spectrum appeared within the party. The economy of South Australia began to pick up under Hall, returning to full employment. During the term in opposition, <a href="Des%20Corcoran">Des Corcoran</a> became Dunstan's deputy, and the pair worked together well despite any rift that may have been caused by the struggle to succeed Walsh.

Hall also enacted a complete reform of the electoral system. He was embarrassed that the LCL was in a position to win government despite having clearly lost the first-preference vote, and was committed to a fairer electoral system. The reforms were significant, but did not go as far as the change to "<a href="one%20vote%20one%20value">one vote one value</a>" that Labor and Dunstan had demanded. The lower house formerly had 39 seats—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Now, 47 seats were to be contested: 28 in Adelaide and 19 in the country. While there was still a slight rural weighting (since Adelaide accounted for two-thirds of the state's population), with Adelaide now electing a majority of the legislature, historical results made a Labor win at the next election likely. Under the Playmander, Labor usually dominated Adelaide. Even at the height of Playford's power in the 1950s, the LCL won almost no seats in the capital outside of the wealthy eastern crescent and around <a href="Holdfast%20Bay">Holdfast Bay</a>. Under the circumstances, conventional wisdom was that Hall undertook electoral reform knowing he was effectively handing the premiership to Dunstan at the next election.

Stott withdrew support in 1970 over the <a href="Chowilla%20Dam">Chowilla Dam</a>, a dispute over the location of a dam on the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a>, and South Australia went to the polls. The dam controversy was not much of an election issue, and attempts by the <a href="Democratic%20Labour%20Party%20%28Australia%29">Democratic Labor Party</a> to portray Dunstan as a communist over his opposition to ongoing Australian support for <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> had little effect. The LCL campaigned heavily on Hall, while Dunstan promised sweeping social reform, artistic transformation and more community services. He said "We'll set a new standard of social advancement that the whole of Australia will envy. We believe South Australia can set the pace. It can happen here. We can do it." Dunstan won the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201970">1970 election</a> easily, taking 27 seats compared with the LCL's 20. Although the share of the votes had been similar to 1968, the dilution of the Playmander had changed the share of the seats. As Labor had attained a majority of the popular vote for a long period, and because malapportionment had been largely ended, the political scientists <a href="Neal%20Blewett">Neal Blewett</a> and <a href="Dean%20Jaensch">Dean Jaensch</a> said "a Dunstan decade seems assured".

Dunstan wasted no time in organising his new ministry. He served as his own <a href="Treasurer%20of%20South%20Australia">Treasurer</a>, and took several other portfolios for himself. Deputy Premier <a href="Des%20Corcoran">Des Corcoran</a> took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the <a href="Flinders%20Medical%20Centre">Flinders Medical Centre</a> and <a href="Modbury%20Hospital">Modbury Hospital</a>. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. <a href="Geoff%20Virgo">Geoff Virgo</a>, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the <a href="Metropolitan%20Adelaide%20Transport%20Study">Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study</a> (MATS) plans. <a href="Len%20King">Len King</a> was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being a new member of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.

Soon after the election, Dunstan travelled to <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> for the annual <a href="Council%20of%20Australian%20Governments">Premiers' Conference</a> as the sole Labor premier. His Government, on a mandate to dramatically increase funding in key areas, sought to appropriate further finances from the Federal Government. This brought Dunstan into conflict with Prime Minister <a href="John%20Gorton">John Gorton</a>, and federal funding to SA was not increased. An appeal was made to the Federal Grants Commission, and Dunstan was awarded more than he had hoped for. In addition to the money received from the Grants Commission, funds were diverted from water-storage schemes in the <a href="Adelaide%20Hills">Adelaide Hills</a> over the advice of engineers, and cash reserves were withdrawn from the two government-owned banks. The monies were subsequently used to finance health, education and arts schemes.

On the death in office of <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Australia">Governor</a> <a href="James%20Harrison%20%28Australian%20governor%29">Sir James Harrison</a> in 1971, Dunstan finally had the chance to appoint the governor of his choosing: Sir <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, a physicist who had worked on the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> ex-servicemen; it was a personal goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role. Although the post was ceremonial, Oliphant brought energy to the role, and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution. Oliphant's tenure was successful and held in high regard, although he did come into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.
In 1972, the first major developments in regard to the state's population growth occurred. Adelaide's population was set to increase to 1.3 million and the MATS plan and water-storage schemes were in planning to accommodate this. These were summarily rejected by the Dunstan Government, which planned to build a new city 83 kilometres from Adelaide, near <a href="Murray%20Bridge%2C%20South%20Australia">Murray Bridge</a>. The city, to be known as <a href="Monarto%2C%20South%20Australia">Monarto</a>, was to be built on farmland to the west of the existing town. Dunstan was very much against allowing Adelaide's suburbs to further sprawl, and thus Monarto was a major focus of his government. He argued that the new <a href="South%20Eastern%20Freeway">South Eastern Freeway</a> would allow a drive of only 45 minutes from Adelaide, that the city was not far from current industry, and that water could be readily supplied from the <a href="River%20Murray">River Murray</a>. The government hoped that Adelaide would not sprawl into the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> to the east and that the bureaucracy would be dispersed from the capital. In contrast, public servants feared being forced into the rural settlement. Critics—of which there were many—derided the project as "Dunstan's Versailles in the bush". Environmental activists aired fears of the effects of Monarto on the River Murray, which was already suffering from pollution and salinity problems. Later on, it was noticed that there was hard bedrock underneath the ground, raising drainage problems.

From 1970 to 1973, much legislation passed through the South Australian Parliament. Workers saw increases in welfare, drinking laws were further liberalised, an <a href="Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> was created, censorship was liberalised, <a href="seat%20belts">seat belts</a> were made mandatory, the education system was overhauled, and the public service was gradually increased (doubling in size during the Dunstan era). Adelaide's water supply was <a href="fluoridation">fluoridated</a> in 1971 and the age of majority was lowered from 21 to 18. A Commissioner of Consumer Affairs was created, a demerit point system was introduced to penalise poor driving practices in an attempt to cut the road toll, and compensation for workers was improved. Police autonomy and powers were restricted following a rally in opposition to the Vietnam War, which was broken up by police, although Dunstan had wanted the demonstrators to be able to close off the street. A royal commission was called into the police commissioner's disregard for Dunstan's orders, and resulted in legislation giving the government more control over the police; the commissioner then retired. The dress code for the <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Adelaide">Parliament</a> was relaxed during this period, the suit and tie was no longer seen as obligatory, and Dunstan himself caused media frenzy when he arrived at Parliament House in 1972 wearing pink shorts that ended above his knees. After his departure from public life he admitted that his sartorial statement may have gone beyond the limits. Nevertheless, his fashion sense resulted in his being voted "the sexiest political leader in Australia" by <a href="Woman%27s%20Day%20%28Australian%20magazine%29">"Woman's Day"</a> in 1975, and the image of Dunstan in the shorts remains iconic.

Having played a part in Labor's abandonment of the White Australia Policy at national level, Dunstan was also prominent in promoting <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>. He was well known for his attendance at and patronage of <a href="Kernewek%20Lowender">Cornish</a>, <a href="Italian%20Australian">Italian</a> and <a href="Greek%20Australian">Greek Australian</a> cultural festivals and his appreciation of Asian art, and sought to build on cultural respect to create trade links with Asia. Dunstan's involvement in such cultural exchanges was also credited with generating strong support for Labor from ethnic and non-Anglo-Saxon immigrant communities, although it was viewed with suspicion by some in the Anglo-Saxon establishment. Dunstan himself later recalled: "When I proposed the establishment of a Cornish Festival, in Australia's "Little Cornwall", people of Cornish descent came flocking."

Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing heritage to the march of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at <a href="Semaphore%2C%20South%20Australia">Semaphore</a> was purchased to save it from demolition. His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic <a href="Ayers%20House%20%28Adelaide%2C%20South%20Australia%29">Ayers House</a> on North Terrace, having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky <a href="Hallett%20Cove%2C%20South%20Australia">Hallett Cove</a> on <a href="Gulf%20St%20Vincent">Gulf St Vincent</a> in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in <a href="Morphettville%2C%20South%20Australia">Morphettville</a>, <a href="Tea%20Tree%20Gully%2C%20South%20Australia">Tea Tree Gully</a>, <a href="Modbury%2C%20South%20Australia">Modbury</a>, and <a href="Reynella%2C%20South%20Australia">Reynella</a>. This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and <a href="enotourism">enotourism</a>.

In pursuit of economic links with the nations of <a href="South-East%20Asia">South-East Asia</a>, Dunstan came into contact with the leaders of the <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>n state of <a href="Penang">Penang</a> in 1973. Striking a note with <a href="Lim%20Chong%20Eu">Chong Eu Lim</a>, the <a href="Chief%20Minister%20of%20Penang">Chief Minister</a>, Dunstan set about organising cultural and economic engagement between the two states. "Penang Week" was held in Adelaide in July, and in return, "South Australia Week" was held in Penang's capital, <a href="George%20Town%2C%20Penang">George Town</a>. In the same year, the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20Centre">Adelaide Festival Centre</a> was opened—Australia's first multifunction performing arts complex.

Over a six-year period, government funding for the arts was increased by a factor of seven and in 1978, the <a href="South%20Australian%20Film%20Corporation">South Australian Film Corporation</a> commenced work. During Dunstan's time in charge, acclaimed films such as "<a href="Breaker%20Morant">Breaker Morant</a>", "<a href="Picnic%20at%20Hanging%20Rock%20%28film%29">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a>" and "<a href="Storm%20Boy%20%281976%20film%29">Storm Boy</a>" were made in the state. Dunstan's support of the arts and fine dining was credited by commentators with attracting artists, craftspeople and writers into the state, helping to change its atmosphere.

The <a href="South%20Australian%20Legislative%20Council">South Australian Legislative Council</a>, the Upper House in the Parliament, was, due to its limited <a href="electoral%20roll">electoral roll</a>, overwhelmingly non-Labor. Unlike the Lower House, its members were elected only by voters who met certain property and wealth requirements. Combined with the remains of the "<a href="Playmander">Playmander</a>" malapportionment, it was difficult for the Labor Party to achieve the representation it wished. The Legislative Council either watered down or outright rejected a considerable amount of Labor legislation; bills to legalise homosexuality, abolish <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal</a> and <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a> and allow gambling and casinos were rejected. A referendum had indicated support for Friday night shopping, but Labor legislation was blocked in the upper house by the LCL.

Dunstan called an <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201973">election for March 1973</a>, hoping to gain a mandate to seek changes to the Council. The LCL were badly disunited; the more liberal wing of the party under Hall joined Dunstan in wanting to introduce universal suffrage for the upper house, while the more conservative members of the LCL did not. The conservatives then decided to limit Hall's powers, resulting in his resignation and creation of the breakaway <a href="Liberal%20Movement%20%28Australia%29">Liberal Movement</a> (LM), which overtly branded itself as a semi-autonomous component within the LCL. Labor capitalised on the opposition divisions to secure an easy victory. They campaigned under the slogan "South Australia's Doing Well with Labor", while the LCL was hampered by infighting; many LCL candidates were claiming different leaders in their electoral material depending on their factional allegiance. The Labor Party won with 51.5% of the primary vote and secured a second consecutive majority government with 26 seats. It was only the second time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a second term, the first being the early <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28South%20Australia%20politician%29">Thomas Price</a> Labor government. It would be the first five-year-incumbent Labor government however. They also gained two more seats in the Legislative Council to have six of the twenty members. Labor entered the new term with momentum when a fortnight after the election, the LCL purged LM members from its ranks, forcing them to either quit the LM or leave the LCL and join the LM as a distinct party.

Dunstan saw reform of the Legislative Council as an important goal, and later a prime achievement, of his Government. Labor, as a matter of party policy, wanted to see the Legislative Council abolished. Dunstan, seeing this as unfeasible in his term, set about to reform it instead. Two bills were prepared for Legislative Council reform; one to lower the voting age to 18 and introduce <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>, and another to make councillors elected from a single statewide electorate under a system of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>. The LCL initially blocked both bills, stating that it would only accept them if modifications were made to the second one. Changes were conceded; unlike the House of Assembly, voting would not be compulsory and the preference system was to be slightly altered. Once the amendments were made, the legislation was passed.

During his second term, Dunstan started efforts to build a petrochemical complex at Redcliff, near <a href="Port%20Augusta%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Augusta</a>. Negotiations were held with several multinational companies, but nothing eventuated. Legislation was passed to create a Land Commission and introduce urban land price controls. However, a bill to create "a right to privacy" was defeated in the upper house after protests from journalists, as was legislation to mandate refunds to consumers for returning beverage containers and therefore promote recycling. In 1975, Dunstan declared Australia's first legal nude bathing reserve.

Prior to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201975">1975 federal</a> and <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201975">state</a> elections, Australia, and South Australia in particular, had been hit by a series of economic problems. The <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a> had massively increased the cost of living, domestic industry began to erode due to a lack of cost-competitiveness, and government funds were waning. In response, the Dunstan Government sold loss-making railways to the Commonwealth and brought in new taxes to allow wage rises. The changes had unexpected consequences: inflation, already high, increased markedly, and workers were still displeased with wages. The LCL, now known as the Liberal Party, had rebuilt after internal schism and had modernised to make themselves more appealing to the public. Having called an early election, Dunstan appealed to the electorate and pushed blame onto the <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Whitlam Government</a> for South Australia's problems. In a television address just days before the election, he said: "My Government is being smeared and it hurts. They want you to think we are to blame for Canberra's mistakes. The vote on Saturday is not for Canberra, not for Australia, but for South Australia."

Labor remained the largest party in Parliament, but lost the two-party preferred vote at 49.2% and saw its numbers decrease from 26 to 23. The LCL held 20 seats, the <a href="Liberal%20Movement%20%28Australia%29">Liberal Movement</a> two, the <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28SA%29">Country Party</a> one, and the last remaining with an independent, the nominally Labor Mayor of <a href="Port%20Pirie%2C%20South%20Australia">Port Pirie</a>, <a href="Ted%20Connelly">Ted Connelly</a>. Dunstan appealed to Connelly and offered him the role of <a href="Speaker%20%28politics%29">Speaker</a>. However, the reforms to the Legislative Council's election bore fruit. Of the 11 seats up for election, Labor won six with 47.3% of the vote, and the LM two, allowing Labor a total of 10 seats. This meant they could now, with the help of the LM, push through reforms opposed by the Liberals.

It was the first time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a third term, and would be the first seven-year-incumbent Labor government.

Dunstan continued to try to push through further legislation; he sought to expand on the Hall Government's electoral-boundaries reform, to bring it closer to <a href="one%20vote%20one%20value">one vote one value</a>. The legislation sought to establish 47 electoral districts containing roughly equal numbers of voters (with a 10% tolerance). Redistributions were to be presided over by an independent boundaries commission. The bill passed with the support of the breakaway LM in the upper house—former Premier Steele Hall and his former Attorney-General <a href="Robin%20Millhouse">Robin Millhouse</a>.

One famous demonstration of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which he saw as sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised to stand on the seashore at <a href="Glenelg%2C%20South%20Australia">Glenelg</a> and wait for the imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.

In 1976, the Dunstan Government stepped up its legislative efforts. Some bills, such as the one to remove the <a href="sodomy%20law">sodomy law</a> and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a> passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. <a href="Rape">Rape</a> law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage for the first time in Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: <a href="birth%20rate">birth rate</a>s started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at <a href="Whyalla%2C%20South%20Australia">Whyalla</a>, forcing the operations to be scaled down.

After Oliphant's term had expired, Dunstan appointed the first <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australian</a> Governor, Sir <a href="Douglas%20Nicholls">Douglas Nicholls</a>, a former football player and clergyman. Following Nicholls' resignation due to ill health in 1977, a second consecutive clergyman took the post, <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> <a href="Keith%20Seaman">Keith Seaman</a>. However, this appointment was not successful; Seaman became involved in an unspecified scandal and made a statement admitting to a "grave impropriety", without elaborating further. He did not resign and kept a low profile from then on. Dunstan also appointed Dame <a href="Roma%20Mitchell">Roma Mitchell</a> to become the nation's first female Supreme Court judge. She later said "I doubt anybody else in those days would have pushed for a woman", and that Dunstan enjoyed creating a legacy of equality among social groups.

Dunstan broke new ground in Australian politics with his policies on <a href="native%20title">native title</a> for Aborigines. The North West Aboriginal Reserve (NWAR) covered more than 7% of the state's land, and was inhabited by the <a href="Pitjantjatjara%20people">Pitjantjatjara people</a>. In 1977, when the NWAR was about to be transferred to the Aboriginal Lands Trust, a tribal delegation asked for the lands to be given to the traditional owners. Dunstan agreed to an investigation, and subsequently introduced the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill. This bill proposed for a tribal body, the Anangu Pitjantjatjaraku, to take control of the NWAR and further lands after the claims were cleared by an independent tribunal. It also proposed to allow the body to decide mining proposals on the land and receive royalties. This aroused discontent among mining interests, but a bipartisan parliamentary committee endorsed the bill and it was tabled. However, Labor lost power before the bill was passed and although the new Liberal government said they would remove the mining restrictions, mass public rallies forced them to relent, and a <a href="Pitjantjatjara%20Land%20Rights%20Act">bill similar to Dunstan's</a> was passed. The legislation, the bedrock of which was laid by Dunstan, was the most reformist in Australia, and in the 1980s, more than 20% of the land was returned to its traditional owners.

Dunstan called another snap election in September at the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201977">1977 election</a>; he hoped to recover from the previous election, the outcome of which had been affected by the <a href="Australian%20constitutional%20crisis%20of%201975">dismissal of the Federal Labor Government</a>. As the remnants of the Playmander had been abolished, conditions were more favourable for Labor and they wanted to end their reliance on the casting vote of the speaker. The campaign proceeded smoothly and exploited the unpopularity of the federal Liberal government, using the jingle "Thank the Lord for South Australia". Labor won an absolute majority with 51.6% of the primary vote and 27 seats.

It was the first time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a fourth term, and would be the first nine-year-incumbent Labor government.

The <a href="South%20Australia%20Police">South Australian Police</a> had since 1949 a "Special Branch" in its forces for the purposes of surveillance and espionage. Conceived earlier as an "intelligence branch" in 1939 for the purposes of spying on the large <a href="German%20Australian">German Australian</a> community in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it had amassed information on tens of thousands of individuals and organisations. While such an operation was of concern to Dunstan and his government for civil liberty reasons, its apparent party-political bias was even more concerning to them. In particular, the branch held information files on Labor parliamentarians, communists, church leaders, trade unionists and so-called "pink files" on gay community activists dating from the time before homosexuality was decriminalised. Only two Labor MPs, from both federal and state parliaments, did not have files, whereas the branch held significantly fewer files relating to Liberal figures. Dunstan had known of the existence of the branch since 1970, but said that he had been assured by the police commissioner that its files were not systematically focused on left-wing political figures.

However, Peter Ward, a journalist and former Dunstan staffer published a story about the files. An inquiry was conducted into the branch by Justice White of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20South%20Australia">Supreme Court of South Australia</a>, and the report was placed in Dunstan's hands on 21 December 1977. It said that the dossiers did exist and that they were "scandalously inaccurate, irrelevant to security purposes and outrageously unfair to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of loyal and worthy citizens". It also noted that the reports overwhelmingly focused on left-wing politicians and activists, and that Dunstan had been misled by the police commissioner. After reviewing the report, Dunstan sacked Police Commissioner Harold Salisbury in January and threatened to release the report to the public. However, Salisbury had a reputation as a man of integrity, and controversy erupted regarding the inquiry and Dunstan's actions, and whether he had already known about the true contents of the files for several years, as claimed by Ward. A <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> under Justice Mitchell, set up at the instigation of the Liberals, investigated the matter. The inquiry cleared the Dunstan Government of any error, as it had not known about the Special Branch's activities earlier. Dunstan sacked Salisbury for misleading Parliament about the existence of the "pink files" and many of the Special Branch files were burnt. Salisbury retired to the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> with a $160,000 payout; a book, "The Salisbury Affair" by Stewart Cockburn, was written about the debacle.

There were initially no other major controversies for Dunstan, although the economy remained poor and the Redcliff complex was still in limbo as an agreement with Dow was still to be finalised. The financial difficulties forced a freeze on public sector expansion and hospital developments, and there were claims of theft and mismanagement in the health system, but the Liberals were in a disorganised state and unpopular, so they were not able to pressure Dunstan effectively.

Towards the end of the year, political and media scrutiny began to grow on Dunstan, who began to grow uneasy in his dealings with the press. Soon after the Salisbury dismissal, he walked out of a stormy media conference after refusing to be drawn on the rumoured sacking of Seaman from the gubernatorial role. Increasing innuendo about Dunstan's private life and allegations of corruption and economic mismanagement were worsened by Dunstan's self-righteous tendencies. The premier angrily denied claims that he was using government funds to build an opulent residence in Malaysia as well as claims about his sexual lifestyle. He pre-emptively called a press conference on one occasion to denounce what he called "idiot rumours" and he further claimed that "reactionary forces" and "right wing journalists" were engaged in a witchhunt against his "decent and responsible government".

Dunstan also faced difficulties on policy issues. Factional cracks began to appear in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of <a href="Roxby%20Downs">Roxby Downs</a> put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named "It's Grossly Improper" would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.

Together with <a href="Mike%20Rann">Mike Rann</a>, his Press Secretary, speechwriter and eventually Premier, who had worked with him in 1978 on a series of speeches on Aboriginal Land Rights, industrial democracy and women's rights, Dunstan made a uranium fact-finding trip to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> to study safe methods of <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> and waste disposal. By the summer that followed, Dunstan fell extremely ill. When Parliament resumed, he collapsed on the floor of the House and was forced to use a walking stick; his doctor advised him that he required six months of rest to recover. The Liberal Opposition seized on the state of affairs and charged that the Labor Party was "as ailing as the man who led it". In a stage-managed press conference on 15 February 1979, Dunstan announced his retirement as premier from his room in <a href="Calvary%20North%20Adelaide%20Hospital">Calvary Hospital</a> while shaking and wearing a dressing gown.

The political scientist Andrew Parkin said that one of Dunstan's main achievements was to debunk the notion that state governments and parliaments lacked the ability to make significant reforms with profound impacts. He cited Dunstan's sweeping social reforms and the fact that many other state governments followed South Australia's lead as evidence of this.

After Dunstan's resignation from parliament, deputy <a href="Des%20Corcoran">Des Corcoran</a> took his place as party leader and Premier. At the subsequent <a href="Norwood%20state%20by-election%2C%201979">Norwood by-election</a>, Dunstan's seat was retained by Labor. Corcoran soon called the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%201979">1979 election</a>. Corcoran's lack of media savvy, the "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">Advertiser</a>"'s bias towards the Liberals at this election, and the public's widespread dissatisfaction with the economy and bus strikes, brought about an 8.4 percent two-party swing against Labor, leaving the party with only 19 seats against the Liberals on 25 seats. The <a href="David%20Tonkin">Tonkin Liberal Government</a> came to power and began reducing the size of the public service and abandoned the Monarto project. Dunstan took a trip to Europe after being released from hospital, staying in <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a> for five months and pursuing Italian studies. He subsequently returned home and lived quietly in Adelaide for three years without finding work that appealed to him, such as that related to the shaping of public policy.

During this time he became increasingly disillusioned with South Australian political affairs. A book by two Adelaide journalists, "It's Grossly Improper", was released in November and sold out within a week. It alleged inappropriate use of government funds and a homosexual affair with a restaurateur, John Ceruto, in return for political favours. There was initial fanfare and speculation as to the authenticity of its claims; Dunstan dismissed the book as a "farrago of lies" in his 1981 memoirs, entitled "Felicia".

From May 1980 to early 1981 he acted as editor for the magazine <a href="POL%20Magazine">POL</a>. In 1982, he moved to the neighbouring state of <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, and was appointed the Director of Tourism. This sparked an outcry in South Australia due to the two states' traditional rivalry. For his part, Dunstan said that he had yearned to be given a role in shaping and building the future of his native state, but that he had been snubbed for three years. He said that public figures in South Australia had told him that his high profile and ability to overshadow others could have caused a loss of face to them, and thus his departure would be seen favourably by them, while Victoria's offer gave him an opportunity to be constructive. Dunstan was appointed to the Victorian Economic Development Corporation on 12 July 1983, resigning on 23 June 1986. Dunstan stayed in the Director of Tourism role until 1986, when he returned to Adelaide after falling out with the government of <a href="John%20Cain%20II">John Cain</a>. His retirement from these positions followed the provocative publication of a photograph of him with Monsignor Porcamadonna, member of the gay community Order of Perpetual Indulgence, taken after he had launched a collection of coming out stories by gay historian Gary Wotherspoon.

He was the national president of the "Freedom from Hunger Campaign" (1982–87), president of the "Movement for Democracy in Fiji" (from 1987), and national chairman of <a href="Community%20Aid%20Abroad">Community Aid Abroad</a> (1992–93). Dunstan was an <a href="adjunct%20professor">adjunct professor</a> at the University of Adelaide from 1997 to 1999 and portrayed himself in the 1989 Australian independent film "Against the Innocent".

In his retirement, Dunstan continued to be a passionate critic of <a href="economic%20rationalism">economic rationalism</a> (<a href="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a>) and <a href="Privatization">privatisation</a>, particularly of South Australia's water, gas and <a href="Electricity%20Trust%20of%20South%20Australia">electricity</a> supplies. During the 1990s he wrote essays for the "Adelaide Review" magazine strongly criticising both the Federal Labor Governments of <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a> and <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a>, the Federal Liberal Government of <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> and the State Liberal Governments of <a href="Dean%20Brown">Dean Brown</a> and <a href="John%20Olsen">John Olsen</a>. He remained an advocate for <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> and cultural diversity, often writing about the dangers of <a href="racism">racism</a>. A year before his death, the ailing Dunstan decried Labor's economic rationalism in front of 5,000 at the Gough Whitlam Lecture. In his last interview, he decried economic rationalism as the "nonsense of the Chicago school with which we've been beset". Regardless of the acclaim in which he was held during his decade in power, Dunstan was largely overlooked for honours after leaving office and largely ignored by the state's elite. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Companion of the Order of Australia</a> in June 1979, but no national parks, gardens, buildings or performance venues were named after him.

Whilst living in Norwood and studying at university, Dunstan met his first wife, Gretel Elsasser, whose Jewish family had fled <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> to Australia. They married in 1949, and moved to Fiji. They returned to Adelaide in 1951 and settled in George Street, Norwood, with their young daughter, Bronwen. The family was forced to live in squalor for a number of years while Dunstan established his legal practice; during this time, they took in boarders as a source of extra income. Gretel later gave birth to two sons, Andrew and Paul.

In 1972 Dunstan separated from his wife and moved into a small flat in <a href="Kent%20Town%2C%20South%20Australia">Kent Town</a>, adjacent to Norwood. The family home was sold as two of the children were already studying in university. In 1974 the couple were finally divorced. Dunstan notes this period as being initially a "very bleak and lonely" time for him. In absence of his family, he made new friends and acquaintances. Friends living nearby would come to his apartment for conversation and good food—cooking was Dunstan's hobby. Dunstan bought another house in 1974, partially financed from a then-unpublished cookbook. In 1976, "Don Dunstan's Cookbook" was published—the first cookbook released by a serving Australian leader. More generally, Dunstan promoted a revolution in fine dining in the state. Encouraged by Dunstan's enthusiasm for multiculturalism, many new restaurants were opened by proprietors and the diversity of cuisine increased. He also promoted the <a href="viticulture">viticulture</a> industry through his patronage of wine festivals.

In 1973 Adele Koh, a Malaysian journalist formerly living in Singapore, was appointed to work for Dunstan. She had been expelled by the Singaporean Government of <a href="Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a> for criticising its policies. The newspaper she had been working for, the "Singapore Herald", was shut down by the government and she then moved to Australia. The two began a relationship in 1974, and married in 1976 in a small ceremony at Dunstan's residence. Dunstan was much older than Adele, who was in her 30s. She was diagnosed with advanced <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> in May 1978, and died in October after Dunstan had cared for her at her bedside for months. Her death seriously affected him and his own health began to suffer.

Although Dunstan never publicly commented on his sexuality, it has been said that he "lived as a sexually liberated bisexual man." In 1986 he met his future partner, Stephen Cheng, a post-graduate science student then in his twenties. Together they opened a restaurant called "Don's Table" in 1994. He lived with Cheng in their Norwood home for the rest of his life. Cheng nursed Dunstan through lung cancer until his death, and Dunstan bequeathed their home to Cheng for life.

Dunstan was afflicted by illness in his final years. He was diagnosed with <a href="throat%20cancer">throat cancer</a> in 1993 before contracting an inoperable lung cancer, which led to his death on 6 February 1999. A public memorial service was held on 9 February at the <a href="Adelaide%20Festival%20Centre">Adelaide Festival Centre</a> as a tribute to Dunstan's love of the arts. In attendance were former Labor Prime Ministers <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> and <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>, Federal Opposition Leader <a href="Kim%20Beazley">Kim Beazley</a>, Premier <a href="John%20Olsen">John Olsen</a>, and State Opposition Leader <a href="Mike%20Rann">Mike Rann</a>. Thousands more gathered outside the centre in <a href="Elder%20Park%2C%20Adelaide">Elder Park</a> along the banks of the <a href="River%20Torrens">River Torrens</a>. State flags were flown at half-mast and the memorial service was televised live.

The Don Dunstan Foundation was established at the University of Adelaide shortly before his death to push for progressive change and to honour Dunstan's memory. Dunstan had spent his last months helping to lay the platform for its establishment. At the inauguration of the body, Dunstan had said "What we need is a concentration on the kind of agenda which I followed and I hope that my death will be useful in this". The foundation's primary work is the giving of scholarships; an additional aim is to promote causes championed by Dunstan such as human rights, social equality, multiculturalism and aboriginal rights.

A theatre in the Festival Centre was renamed the Dunstan Playhouse.

The <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20of%20South%20Australia">Electoral Commission of South Australia</a>'s 2012 redistribution included renaming the seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Norwood">Norwood</a> to <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Dunstan">Dunstan</a> which came into existence as of the <a href="South%20Australian%20state%20election%2C%202014">2014 election</a>. In 2014 a biography "Don Dunstan Intimacy & Liberty" by Dino Hodge, written with the co-operation of Dunstan's family and former lovers, was published.

In 1988 Dunstan donated a collection of files pertaining to his political, professional and personal life, photographs, press clippings, speeches and press releases, audiovisual material, books from his library, some items of clothing and other memorabilia to <a href="Flinders%20University">Flinders University</a> Library, where it can be viewed and accessed for research purposes (see External links).

Since its commencement in 2003, the <a href="Adelaide%20Film%20Festival">Adelaide Film Festival</a> has presented The Don Dunstan Award in recognition of outstanding contribution by an individual to the Australian film industry. Deemed by the Adelaide Film Festival's Board to have "enriched Australian screen culture through their work", its recipients include <a href="David%20Gulpilil">David Gulpilil</a>, <a href="Rolf%20de%20Heer">Rolf de Heer</a>, and <a href="Scott%20Hicks">Scott Hicks</a>. After receiving the award in 2013, Hicks acknowledged Dunstan's vision for the creation of a film industry in South Australia as being instrumental to his professional development.

Anna of East Anglia

Anna (or Onna; killed 653 or 654) was <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20East%20Anglia">king of East Anglia</a> from the early 640s until his death. He was a member of the <a href="Wuffingas">Wuffingas</a> family, the ruling dynasty of the East Angles. He was one of the three sons of <a href="Eni%20of%20East%20Anglia">Eni</a> who ruled the <a href="kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">kingdom of East Anglia</a>, succeeding some time after <a href="Ecgric%20of%20East%20Anglia">Ecgric</a> was killed in battle by <a href="Penda%20of%20Mercia">Penda of Mercia</a>. Anna was praised by <a href="Bede">Bede</a> for his devotion to Christianity and was renowned for the saintliness of his family: his son <a href="Jurmin">Jurmin</a> and all his daughters – <a href="Seaxburh%20of%20Ely">Seaxburh</a>, <a href="%C3%86thelthryth">Æthelthryth</a>, <a href="%C3%86thelburh%20of%20Faremoutiers">Æthelburh</a> and possibly a fourth, <a href="Wihtburh">Wihtburh</a> – were canonised.

Little is known of Anna's life or his reign, as few records have survived from this period. In 631 he may have been at <a href="Exning">Exning</a>, close to the <a href="Devil%27s%20Dyke%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Devil's Dyke</a>. In 645 <a href="Cenwalh%20of%20Wessex">Cenwalh of Wessex</a> was driven from his kingdom by Penda and, due to Anna's influence, he was converted to Christianity while living as an exile at the East Anglian court. Upon his return from exile, Cenwalh re-established Christianity in his own kingdom and the people of Wessex then remained firmly Christian.

Around 651 the land around <a href="Isle%20of%20Ely">Ely</a> was absorbed into East Anglia, following the marriage of Anna's daughter Æthelthryth. Anna richly endowed the coastal monastery at <a href="Cnobheresburg">Cnobheresburg</a>. In 651, in the aftermath of an attack by Penda on Cnobheresburg, Anna was forced to flee into exile, perhaps to the western kingdom of the <a href="Magons%C3%A6te">Magonsæte</a>. He returned to East Anglia in about 653, but soon afterwards the kingdom was attacked again by Penda and at the Battle of Bulcamp the East Anglian army, led by Anna, was defeated by the Mercians, and both Anna and his son Jurmin were killed. Anna was succeeded by his brother, <a href="%C3%86thelhere%20of%20East%20Anglia">Æthelhere</a>. <a href="Botwulf%20of%20Thorney">Botolph</a>'s monastery at <a href="Iken">Iken</a> may have been built in commemoration of the king. After Anna's reign, East Anglia seems to have been eclipsed by its more powerful neighbour, <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>.

The kingdom of East Anglia () was a small independent <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> and <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> and perhaps the eastern part of the Cambridgeshire <a href="Fens">Fens</a>.

In contrast to the kingdoms of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, Mercia and <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, little reliable evidence about the kingdom of the East Angles has survived, because of the destruction of its monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> that occurred as the result of <a href="Viking">Viking</a> raids and settlement. The main primary sources for information about Anna's life and reign are the "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>" ("Ecclesiastical History of the English People"), completed in Northumbria by Bede in 731, and the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", initially written in the ninth century, which mentions Anna's death. The mediaeval work known as the "<a href="Liber%20Eliensis">Liber Eliensis</a>", written in <a href="Ely%20Cathedral">Ely</a> in the twelfth century, is a source of information about Anna's daughters Æthelthryth and Seaxburh, and also describes Anna's death and burial.

Anna was the son of Eni, a member of the ruling Wuffingas family, and nephew of <a href="R%C3%A6dwald%20of%20East%20Anglia">Rædwald</a>, king of the East Angles from 600 to 625. <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> was an early and long-lived <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon</a> kingdom in which a duality of a northern and a southern part existed, corresponding with the modern English counties of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> and <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>.

Anna was married: Bede refers to the saint <a href="S%C3%A6thryth">Sæthryth</a> as "daughter of the wife of Anna, king of the East Angles". In <a href="Folcard">Abbott Folcard</a>'s "Life of St Botolph", written in the 11th century, Botolph is described as having been at one time the chaplain to the sisters of a king, Æthelmund, whose mother was named Sæwara. Folcard names two of Sæwara's kinsmen as Æthelhere and Æthelwold. Since these are the names of two of Anna's brothers, Steven Plunkett suggests that it is "tempting" to consider that Sæwara was married to Anna, and that Æthelmund might either be Anna's full name, or the name of an otherwise unknown East Anglian sub-king. The "Liber Eliensis" names <a href="Hereswith">Hereswith</a>, the sister of <a href="Hilda%20of%20Whitby">Hild, abbess of Whitby</a>, as Anna's wife and the mother of Sæthryth, Seaxburh of Ely and Æthelthryth. However, the "Liber Eliensis" is regarded with caution by historians: Rosalind Love says that the mediaeval writers who interpreted Bede's information about Hereswith made an "erroneous assumption" regarding her connection with Anna and his family. Historians now believe that Hereswith was Anna's sister-in-law and that around the time that she married into the East Anglian royal family, Anna had already been king for a decade.

In 631 Anna was probably at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, according to the "Liber Eliensis", the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth is said to have been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the <a href="Fen">Fen</a> edge and the headwaters of the <a href="River%20Stour%2C%20Suffolk">River Stour</a>, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.

During 632 or 633 <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a>, with his centre of Christian power north of the River <a href="Humber">Humber</a>, was overthrown. Edwin was slain and Northumbria was ravaged by <a href="Cadwallon%20ap%20Cadfan">Cadwallon ap Cadfan</a>, supported by the Mercian king, <a href="Penda%20of%20Mercia">Penda</a>. The Mercians then turned on the kingdom of the East Angles and their king, <a href="Ecgric%20of%20East%20Anglia">Ecgric</a>. At an unknown date (possibly in the early 640s), they routed the East Anglian army and Ecgric and his predecessor <a href="Sigeberht%20of%20East%20Anglia">Sigeberht</a> were both slain. D. P. Kirby has suggested that as Sigeberht was alive when the Irish monk <a href="Saint%20Fursey">Fursey</a> left for Gaul and found <a href="Erchinoald">Erchinoald</a>, (which happened after Erchinoald became <a href="Mayor%20of%20the%20Palace">Mayor of the Neustrian palace</a> in 641), Sigeberht was probably killed around 640 or 641. Penda's victory marked the end of the line of kings of the East Angles who were directly descended from Rædwald. Some time after Penda's victory, Anna became king of the East Angles, though the date of his accession is quite uncertain. The "Liber Eliensis" says that Anna died in the nineteenth year of his reign, and since he died in the mid-650s this would indicate a date around 635. However, the "Liber Eliensis" is regarded by some historians as unreliable on this point, and <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a> suggests a possible date in the early 640s for Anna's accession, noting that it could not have been after 645 as Anna is recorded as giving refuge to Cenwalh of Wessex in that year. It is probable that Anna became king with the assistance of the northern Angles. Throughout his reign he was the victim of Mercian aggression under Penda, but he also seems to have challenged the rise of Penda's power. The British medievalist <a href="David%20Dumville">David Dumville</a> has written that due to their rivalry for control over the <a href="Middle%20Angles">Middle Anglian</a> people, Mercia and East Anglia probably became hereditary enemies and Penda repeatedly attacked the East Angles from the mid-630s to 654.

Anna arranged an important diplomatic marriage between his daughter Seaxburh and <a href="Eorcenberht%20of%20Kent">Eorcenberht of Kent</a>, cementing an alliance between the two kingdoms. It was by means of marriages such as this that the <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Kent">kings of Kent</a> could become well-connected to other royal dynasties. Not all of Anna's daughters were married into other royal families. During the 640s Anna's daughter Æthelburg and his stepdaughter Sæthryth entered <a href="Faremoutiers%20Abbey">Faremoutiers Abbey</a> in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> to live religious lives under abbess <a href="Saint%20Fara">Fara</a>. They were the first royal Anglo-Saxons to become nuns, making religious seclusion "an acceptable and desirable vocation for ex-queens and royal princesses", according to Barbara Yorke.

D. P. Kirby uses the presence of East Anglian princesses living under the veil in Gaul as evidence of the Frankish orientation of Anna's kingdom at this time, continued since the reign of his predecessor Rædwald. The Wuffingas dynasty may have been connected with monastic foundations in the area around Faramoutiers through Anna's predecessor Sigeberht, who had spent several years as an exile in Gaul and had become a devout and learned Christian due to his experiences of monastic life.
In 641 <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a> of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> was slain in battle by Penda (probably at <a href="Oswestry">Oswestry</a> in Shropshire). Due to his death, Northumbria was split into two. The northern part, <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a>, accepted Oswald's brother <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">Oswiu</a> as their new king, but the southern <a href="Deira">Deira</a>ns refused to accept him and were ruled instead by a king of the original Deiran house, <a href="Oswine%20of%20Deira">Oswine</a>. Soon afterwards <a href="Cenwalh%20of%20Wessex">Cenwalh of Wessex</a>, the brother of Oswald's widow and himself married to Penda's sister, renounced his wife. In 645, according to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Penda drove Cenwalh from his kingdom and into exile. During the following year, while a refugee at Anna's court, he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to his throne.

Anna's hold on the western limits of his kingdom, which bordered on the Fen lands that surrounded the Isle of Ely, was strengthened by the marriage in 651 (or slightly later) of his daughter Æthelthryth to Tondberht, a prince of the South <a href="Gyrwas">Gyrwe</a>, a people living in the fens who may have been settled in the area around Ely. Æthelthryth, accompanied by her minister Owine, travelled from Ely to Northumbria when she married for the second time, to <a href="Ecgfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Ecgfrith</a>.

During his reign Anna endowed the monastery at <a href="Burgh%20Castle">Cnobheresburg</a> with rich buildings and objects. The monastery was built in about 633 by Fursey after he arrived in East Anglia. In time, weary of attacks on the kingdom, Fursey left East Anglia for good, leaving the monastery to his brother <a href="Foillan">Foillan</a>. When in 651 Penda attacked the monastery, Anna and his men arrived and held the Mercians back. This gave Foillan and his monks enough time to escape with their books and valuables, but Penda defeated Anna and drove him into exile, possibly to the kingdom of <a href="Merewalh">Merewalh</a> of the <a href="Magons%C3%A6te">Magonsætan</a>, in western <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>. He returned to East Anglia in about 654.

Soon after 653, when Penda made his son <a href="Peada%20of%20Mercia">Peada</a> the ruler of the Middle Angles (but still continued to rule his own country), the Mercian assault on East Anglia was repeated. The opposing armies of Penda and Anna met at Bulcamp, near <a href="Blythburgh">Blythburgh</a> in Suffolk. The East Anglians were defeated and many were slain, including King Anna and his son <a href="Jurmin">Jurmin</a>. Anna's death is mentioned in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" in the entry for 653 or 654, " "Her Anna cining werð ofslagen ..." " – 'Here Anna was killed' – but no other details of the battle in which he died are given.

Blythburgh, a mile from Bulcamp and situated near the fordable headwaters of the <a href="River%20Blyth%2C%20Suffolk">Blyth</a> estuary, was afterwards believed to be the location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone <a href="diptych">diptych</a> or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.

Saint Botolph began to build his monastery at Icanho, now conclusively identified as <a href="Iken">Iken</a>, Suffolk, in the year that Anna was killed, possibly to commemorate the king. Anna was succeeded in turn by his two brothers Æthelhere and <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20East%20Anglia">Æthelwold</a>, who may have ruled jointly. It is possible that Æthelhere was set up as a puppet ruler by Penda or was his ally, as he was one of the 30 "duces" that accompanied Penda when he attacked Oswiu of Northumbria at an unidentified location called the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Winw%C3%A6d">Winwæd</a> in 655 or 656. Penda himself was killed at the Winwæd, after having steadily increased his power over a period of 13 years. Æthelhere (who was also slain at the Battle of the Winwæd) and Æthelwold were succeeded by the descendants of Anna's youngest brother, Æthelric.

Bede praised Anna's piety in his "Ecclesiastical History of the English People", and modern historians have since regarded Anna as a devout king, but his reputation as a devoted Christian is mainly because he produced a son and four daughters who were all made into <a href="List%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20saints">Anglo-Saxon saints</a>. Five hundred years after his death, his tomb at Blythburgh was (according to the "Liber Eliensis") still "venerated by the pious devotion of faithful people".

Anna's children were all canonised. The eldest, Seaxburh, was the wife of Eorcenberht of Kent. She ruled Kent from 664 until her son <a href="Ecgberht%20of%20Kent">Ecgberht</a> came of age. <a href="%C3%86thelthryth">Æthelthryth</a>, according to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", founded the <a href="Ely%20Cathedral">monastery at Ely</a> in 673. Another daughter, <a href="%C3%86thelburh%20of%20Faremoutiers">Æthelburh</a>, spent her life at the nunnery of Faremoutiers. Anna's son, <a href="Jurmin">Jurmin</a>, was of warrior age in 653 when he was killed in battle.

By tradition, Anna is said to have had a fourth daughter, <a href="Wihtburh">Wihtburh</a>, an abbess at <a href="Dereham">Dereham</a> (or possibly <a href="West%20Dereham">West Dereham</a>), where there was a royal <a href="double%20monastery">double monastery</a>. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century "Bosworth Psalter". She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.

The Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 was an American single-seat, <a href="twinjet">twin-engine</a> <a href="Stealth%20aircraft">stealth</a> <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> technology demonstrator designed for the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF). The design was a finalist in the USAF's <a href="Advanced%20Tactical%20Fighter">Advanced Tactical Fighter</a> (ATF) competition, battling the <a href="Lockheed%20YF-22">Lockheed YF-22</a> for a production contract. Two YF-23 prototypes were built, nicknamed "Black Widow II" and "Gray Ghost".

In the 1980s, the USAF began looking for a replacement for its fighter aircraft, especially to counter the USSR's advanced <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-27">Sukhoi Su-27</a> and <a href="Mikoyan%20MiG-29">Mikoyan MiG-29</a>. Several companies submitted design proposals; the USAF selected proposals from <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a>. Northrop teamed with <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas">McDonnell Douglas</a> to develop the YF-23, while Lockheed, <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> and <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a> developed the YF-22.

The YF-23 was stealthier and faster, but less agile than its competitor. After a four-year development and evaluation process, the YF-22 was announced the winner in 1991 and entered production as the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-22%20Raptor">Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor</a>. The U.S. Navy considered using the production version of the ATF as the basis for a replacement to the <a href="Grumman%20F-14%20Tomcat">F-14</a>, but these plans were later canceled. The two YF-23 prototypes were museum exhibits as of 2010.

American reconnaissance satellites first spotted the advanced Soviet <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-27">Su-27</a> and <a href="Mikoyan%20MiG-29">MiG-29</a> fighter prototypes in 1978, which caused concern in the U.S. Both Soviet models were expected to reduce the maneuverability advantage of contemporary US fighter aircraft. In 1981, the USAF requested information from several aerospace companies on possible features for an <a href="Advanced%20Tactical%20Fighter">Advanced Tactical Fighter</a> (ATF) to replace the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15%20Eagle">F-15 Eagle</a>. After discussions with aerospace companies, the USAF made <a href="air%20superiority%20fighter">air-to-air combat</a> the primary role for the ATF. The ATF was to take advantage of emerging technologies, including <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a>s, lightweight <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and <a href="stealth%20technology">stealth technology</a>. In October 1985, the USAF issued a <a href="request%20for%20proposal">request for proposal</a> (RFP) to several aircraft manufacturers. The RFP was modified in May 1986 to include evaluation of prototype air vehicles from the two finalists. At the same time, the U.S. Navy, under the Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) program, announced that it would use a derivative of the ATF winner to replace its <a href="Grumman%20F-14%20Tomcat">F-14 Tomcat</a>. The NATF program called for procurement of 546 aircraft along with the USAF's planned procurement of 750 aircraft.
In July 1986, proposals were submitted by <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a>, <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>, <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a>, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop, <a href="Grumman%20Corporation">Grumman</a> and <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell</a>. The latter two dropped out of competition shortly thereafter. Following proposal submissions, Lockheed, Boeing, and General Dynamics formed a team to develop whichever of their proposed designs was selected, if any. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas formed a team with a similar agreement. The Lockheed and Northrop proposals were selected as finalists on 31 October 1986. Both teams were given 50 months to build and flight-test their prototypes, and they were successful, producing the Lockheed YF-22 and the Northrop YF-23.

The YF-23 was designed to meet USAF requirements for <a href="Survivability%20%28military%29">survivability</a>, <a href="supercruise">supercruise</a>, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight without the use of <a href="afterburner">afterburner</a>s. Northrop drew on its experience with the <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20B-2%20Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and <a href="infrared">infrared</a> detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of <a href="thrust%20reversal">thrust reversers</a> on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine <a href="nacelle">nacelle</a> housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.

The first YF-23 (<a href="United%20States%20military%20aircraft%20serials">serial number</a> "87-0800"), Prototype Air Vehicle 1 (PAV-1), was rolled out on 22 June 1990; PAV-1 took its 50-minute <a href="maiden%20flight">maiden flight</a> on 27 August with Alfred "Paul" Metz at the controls. The second YF-23 (serial number "87-0801", PAV-2) made its first flight on 26 October, piloted by Jim Sandberg. The first YF-23 was painted charcoal gray and was nicknamed "Black Widow II", after the <a href="Northrop%20P-61%20Black%20Widow">Northrop P-61 Black Widow</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It briefly had a red hourglass marking resembling the marking on the underside of the <a href="Latrodectus">black widow spider</a> before Northrop management had it removed. The second prototype was painted in two shades of gray and nicknamed "Spider" and "Gray Ghost".
The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with diamond-shaped wings, a profile with substantial <a href="area%20rule">area-ruling</a> to reduce <a href="aerodynamic%20drag">aerodynamic drag</a> at <a href="transonic">transonic</a> speeds, and an <a href="Stabilator">all-moving</a> <a href="V-tail">V-tail</a>. The <a href="cockpit">cockpit</a> was placed high, near the nose of the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a <a href="Tricycle%20gear">tricycle landing gear</a> configuration with a nose <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed on the underside of the fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.

It was powered by two turbofan engines with each in a separate engine <a href="nacelle">nacelle</a> with <a href="S-duct">S-duct</a>s, to shield engine <a href="axial%20compressor">axial compressor</a>s from radar waves, on either side of the aircraft's spine. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) was fitted with <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20F119">Pratt & Whitney YF119</a> engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by <a href="General%20Electric%20YF120">General Electric YF120</a> engines. The aircraft featured fixed engine nozzles, instead of <a href="thrust%20vectoring">thrust vectoring</a> nozzles as on the YF-22. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23's engines flowed through troughs lined with heat-<a href="ablation">ablating</a> tiles to dissipate heat and shield the engines from <a href="infrared%20homing">infrared homing</a> (IR) missile detection from below.
The <a href="flight%20control%20surfaces">flight control surfaces</a> were controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">wing flaps</a> and <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s on one side and lowering them on the other provided <a href="Flight%20dynamics%20%28aircraft%29">roll</a>. The V-tail fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical. <a href="Flight%20dynamics%20%28aircraft%29">Pitch</a> was mainly provided by rotating these V-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high <a href="angle%20of%20attack">angle of attack</a> (AoA) performance compared to legacy aircraft. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for <a href="Air%20brake%20%28aircraft%29">aerodynamic braking</a>. To keep costs low despite the novel design, a number of "<a href="commercial%20off-the-shelf">commercial off-the-shelf</a>" components were used, including an F-15 nose wheel, F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit components of the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle">F-15E Strike Eagle</a>.

The first YF-23, with Pratt & Whitney engines, supercruised at Mach 1.43 on 18 September 1990, while the second, with General Electric engines, reached Mach 1.6 on 29 November 1990. By comparison, the YF-22 achieved Mach 1.58 in supercruise. The YF-23 was tested to a top speed of Mach 1.8 with afterburners and achieved a maximum angle-of-attack of 25°. The maximum speed is classified, though sources state a maximum speed greater than Mach 2 at altitude and a supercruise speed greater than Mach 1.6. The aircraft's weapons bay was configured for weapons launch, and used for testing weapons bay acoustics, but no missiles were fired; Lockheed fired <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a> and <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a> missiles successfully from its YF-22 demonstration aircraft. PAV-1 performed a fast-paced combat demonstration with six flights over a 10-hour period on 30 November 1990. Flight testing continued into December. The two YF-23s flew 50 times for a total of 65.2 hours. The tests demonstrated Northrop's predicted performance values for the YF-23. The YF-23 was stealthier and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile.

The two contractor teams submitted evaluation results with their proposals in December 1990, and on 23 April 1991, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Air%20Force">Secretary of the Air Force</a> <a href="Donald%20Rice">Donald Rice</a> announced that the YF-22 was the winner. The Air Force selected the YF119 engine to power the F-22 production version. The Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney designs were rated higher on technical aspects, were considered lower risks, and were considered to have more effective program management. It has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more adaptable to the Navy's NATF, but by 1992 the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF.

Following the competition, both YF-23s were transferred to NASA's <a href="Dryden%20Flight%20Research%20Center">Dryden Flight Research Center</a> at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards AFB</a>, California, without their engines. NASA planned to use one of the aircraft to study techniques for the calibration of predicted loads to measured flight results, but this did not take place.

In 2004, <a href="Northrop%20Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a> proposed a YF-23-based bomber to meet a USAF need for an interim bomber, for which the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20FB-22">FB-22</a> and <a href="B-1R">B-1R</a> were also competing. Northrop modified aircraft PAV-2 to serve as a display model for its proposed interim bomber. The possibility of a YF-23-based interim bomber ended with the 2006 <a href="Quadrennial%20Defense%20Review">Quadrennial Defense Review</a>, which favored a long-range bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since moved on to the <a href="Next-Generation%20Bomber">Next-Generation Bomber</a> program.

Japan launched a program to develop a domestic <a href="Fifth-generation%20jet%20fighter">5th</a>/<a href="Sixth-generation%20jet%20fighter">6th generation</a> (F-3) fighter after the US Congress refused in 1998 to export the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-22%20Raptor">F-22</a>. After a great deal of study and the building of static models, the <a href="Mitsubishi%20X-2%20Shinshin">Mitsubishi X-2 Shinshin</a> testbed aircraft flew as a technology demonstrator from 2016. By July 2018, Japan had gleaned sufficient information, and decided that it would need to bring on-board international partners to complete this project. One such company that responded was <a href="Northrop%20Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a> and there is speculation that it could offer a modernized version of the YF-23 to Japan.

Both YF-23 airframes remained in storage until mid-1996, when the aircraft were transferred to museums.

Macaroni penguin

The macaroni penguin ("Eudyptes chrysolophus") is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="penguin">penguin</a> found from the <a href="Subantarctic">Subantarctic</a> to the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>. One of six species of <a href="crested%20penguin">crested penguin</a>, it is very closely related to the <a href="royal%20penguin">royal penguin</a>, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive yellow crest, and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average and are in length. The male and female are similar in appearance; the male is slightly larger and stronger with a relatively larger <a href="beak">bill</a>. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle.

Its diet consists of a variety of <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, mainly <a href="krill">krill</a>, as well as small fish and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s; the species consumes more marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds <a href="moult">moult</a> once a year, spending about three to four weeks ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the macaroni penguin are among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer breeding, penguins disperse into the oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that macaroni penguins from <a href="Kerguelen%20Islands">Kerguelen</a> travelled over in the central <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. With about 18 million individuals, the macaroni penguin is the most numerous penguin species. Widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s and their <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> is classified as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>.

The macaroni penguin was described from the Falkland Islands in 1837 by German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20von%20Brandt">Johann Friedrich von Brandt</a>. It is one of six or so species in the genus "<a href="Crested%20penguin">Eudyptes</a>", collectively known as crested penguins. The genus name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "eu" "good", and "dyptes" "diver". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "chrysolophus" is derived from the Greek words "chryse" "golden", and "lophos" "crest".

The common name was recorded from the early 19th century in the Falkland Islands. English sailors apparently named the species for its conspicuous yellow <a href="Crest%20%28feathers%29">crest</a>; <a href="Maccaroni%20%28fashion%29">Maccaronism</a> was a term for a particular <a href="fashion">style</a> in 18th-century England marked by flamboyant or excessive ornamentation. A person who adopted this fashion was labelled a "maccaroni" or "macaroni", as in the song "<a href="Yankee%20Doodle">Yankee Doodle</a>".

<a href="Molecular%20clock">Molecular clock</a> evidence using DNA suggests the macaroni penguin split from its closest relative, the <a href="royal%20penguin">royal penguin</a> ("Eudyptes schlegeli"), around 1.5 million years ago. The two have generally been considered separate species, but the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some, such as the Australian ornithologists <a href="Les%20Christidis">Les Christidis</a> and Walter Boles, to treat the royal as a <a href="subspecies%20%28biology%29">subspecies</a> of the macaroni. The two species are very similar in appearance; the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni. Interbreeding with the <a href="Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> subspecies of the <a href="southern%20rockhopper%20penguin">southern rockhopper penguin</a> ("E. chrysocome filholi") has been reported at <a href="Heard%20Island%20and%20McDonald%20Islands">Heard</a> and <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Islands">Marion</a> Islands, with three <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a>s recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.

The macaroni penguin is a large, crested penguin, similar in appearance to other members of the genus "Eudyptes". An adult bird has an average length of around ; the weight varies markedly depending on time of year and sex. Males average from after incubating, or after moult to before moult, while females average after to before moult. Among standard measurements, the thick bill (from the <a href="gape">gape</a>) measures , the <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> being around a centimetre less. The wing, from the shoulder to the tip, is around and the tail is long. The head, chin, throat, and upper parts are black and sharply demarcated against the white under parts. The black <a href="plumage">plumage</a> has a bluish sheen when new and brownish when old. The most striking feature is the yellow crest that arises from a patch on the centre of the forehead, and extends horizontally backwards to the <a href="nape">nape</a>. The flippers are blue-black on the upper surface with a white trailing edge, and mainly white underneath with a black tip and leading edge. The large, bulbous <a href="beak">bill</a> is orange-brown. The <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is red and a patch of pinkish bare skin is found from the base of the bill to the eye. The legs and feet are pink. The male and female are similar in appearance; males tend to be slightly larger. Males also bear relatively larger bills, which average around compared to in females; this feature has been used to tell the sexes apart.

Immature birds are distinguished by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just a scattering of yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years, a year or two before breeding age.

Macaroni penguins <a href="moult">moult</a> once a year, a process in which they replace all of their old <a href="feather">feather</a>s. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands">South Georgia Island</a> varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return did not breed the following year.

A 1993 review estimated that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, with a minimum of 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the <a href="Subantarctic">Subantarctic</a> to the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, macaroni penguins are found in southern <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, the Falkland Islands, <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands">South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands</a>, and <a href="South%20Orkney%20Islands">South Orkney Islands</a>. They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern <a href="South%20Shetland%20Islands">South Shetland Islands</a>, <a href="Bouvet%20Island">Bouvet Island</a>, the <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Islands">Prince Edward and Marion island</a>s, the <a href="Crozet%20Islands">Crozet Islands</a>, the <a href="Kerguelen%20Islands">Kerguelen Islands</a>, and the <a href="McDonald%20Islands">Heard and McDonald Islands</a>. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, southern <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Tristan%20da%20Cunha">Tristan da Cunha</a>, and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

The population of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals; a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid-1970s to mid-1990s, and the disappearance of the species from <a href="Isla%20Recalada">Isla Recalada</a> in Southern Chile. This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally <a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a> by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List%20of%20Threatened%20Species">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a>. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies, and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are <a href="World%20Heritage%20Sites">World Heritage Sites</a> for the macaroni penguin. The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and <a href="marine%20pollution">marine pollution</a>. A 2008 study suggests the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by climate- and fishing-induced reductions in krill density.

Like most other penguin species, the macaroni penguin is a <a href="social%20animal">social animal</a> in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; its breeding colonies are among the largest and most densely populated. Scientist Charles Andre Bost found that macaroni penguins nesting at Kerguelen dispersed eastwards over an area exceeding 3×10 km. Fitted with <a href="geolocation">geolocation</a> sensors, the 12 penguins studied travelled over during the six- to seven-month study period and spent their time largely within a zone 47–49°S and 70–110°E in the central Indian Ocean, not coming ashore once. This area, known as the <a href="Antarctic%20Convergence">Polar Frontal Zone</a>, was notable for the absence of krill.

Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. <a href="Agonistic%20behaviour">Agonistic</a> displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in 'bill-jousting'; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent's nape. Submissive displays include the 'slender walk', where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved to the front of the body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.

The macaroni penguin's <a href="predator">predator</a>s consist of birds and aquatic mammals. The <a href="leopard%20seal">leopard seal</a> ("Hydrurga leptonyx"), <a href="Antarctic%20fur%20seal">Antarctic fur seal</a> ("Arctocephalus gazella"), <a href="Subantarctic%20fur%20seal">Subantarctic fur seal</a> ("A. tropicalis"), and <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a> ("Orcinus orca") hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water. Macaroni colonies suffer comparatively low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally only take <a href="bird%20egg">eggs</a> and chicks that have been left unattended or abandoned. <a href="Skua">Skua</a> species, the <a href="snowy%20sheathbill">snowy sheathbill</a> "(Chionis alba"), and <a href="kelp%20gull">kelp gull</a> ("Larus dominicanus") prey on eggs, and skuas and <a href="giant%20petrel">giant petrel</a>s also take chicks and sick or injured adult birds.

Female macaroni penguins can begin breeding at around five years of age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed at a younger age because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.

Adult macaroni penguins typically begin to breed late in October, and lay their <a href="Bird%20egg">eggs</a> in early November. The nest itself is a shallow <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a> in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles, stones, or grass, or nestled in a clump of <a href="tussock%20%28grass%29">tussock grass</a> (on South Georgia Island). Nests are densely packed, ranging from around 66 cm apart in the middle of a colony to 86 cm at the edges. A fertile macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid weighs , 61–64% the size of the second, and is extremely unlikely to survive. The two eggs together weigh 4.8% of the mother's body weight; the composition of an egg is 20% yolk, 66% albumen, and 14% shell. Like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage, and the yolk is large, which is associated with chicks born in an advanced stage of development. Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days.

The fate of the first egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related <a href="royal%20penguin">royal penguin</a> and <a href="erect-crested%20penguin">erect-crested penguin</a> show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubating</a> the egg is divided into three roughly equal sessions of around 12 days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37 days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36 days, and the female fasts for 42 days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period. Both adults lose 36–40% of their body weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34 days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean.

From the moment the egg is hatched, the male macaroni penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since only a few of its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form "<a href="Cr%C3%A8che%20%28zoology%29">crèches</a>" to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70 days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.

The diet of the macaroni penguin consists of a variety of <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="squid">squid</a> and <a href="fish">fish</a>; the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly <a href="Antarctic%20krill">Antarctic krill</a> ("Euphausia superba"), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the <a href="marbled%20rockcod">marbled rockcod</a> ("Notothenia rossii"), <a href="painted%20notie">painted notie</a> ("Lepidonotothen larseni"), "<a href="Champsocephalus%20gunneri">Champsocephalus gunneri</a>", the <a href="lanternfish">lanternfish</a> species "<a href="Krefftichthys%20anderssoni">Krefftichthys anderssoni</a>", "<a href="Protomyctophum%20tenisoni">Protomyctophum tenisoni</a>" and "<a href="Protomyctophum%20normai">P. normani</a>" become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the <a href="exoskeletons">exoskeletons</a> of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet.

Foraging for food is generally conducted on a daily basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track the movement of the birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, with an estimated take of 9.2 million <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.

Foraging distance from colonies has been measured at around at South Georgia, offshore over the continental shelf, and anywhere from at Marion Island. Macaroni penguins normally forage at depths of , but have been recorded diving down to on occasions. Some night foraging does occur, but these dives are much shallower, ranging from only in depth. Dives rarely exceed two minutes in duration. All dives are V-shaped, and no time is spent at the sea bottom; about half the time on a foraging trip is spent diving. Birds have been calculated as catching from 4 to 16 krill or 40 to 50 <a href="amphipod">amphipod</a>s per dive.

Madman Muntz

Earl William "Madman" Muntz (January 3, 1914 – June 21, 1987) was an American <a href="businessman">businessman</a> and <a href="engineer">engineer</a> who sold and promoted cars and <a href="consumer%20electronics">consumer electronics</a> in the United States from the 1930s until his death in 1987. He was a pioneer in <a href="television%20commercial">television commercial</a>s with his oddball "Madman" <a href="persona">persona</a> – an <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a> who generated publicity with his unusual costumes, stunts, and outrageous claims. Muntz also pioneered car stereos by creating the Muntz <a href="Stereo-Pak">Stereo-Pak</a>, better known as the 4-track cartridge, a predecessor to the <a href="Stereo%208">8-track cartridge</a> developed by <a href="Bill%20Lear">Lear Industries</a>.

He invented the practice that came to be known as <a href="Muntzing">Muntzing</a>, which involved simplifying otherwise complicated electronic devices. Muntz produced and marketed the first black-and-white television receivers to sell for less than $100, and created one of the earliest functional <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> <a href="projection%20TV">projection TV</a>s. He was credited with coining the abbreviation "TV" for "television", although the term had earlier been in use in call letters for stations such as <a href="WCBS-TV">WCBS-TV</a>. A high school <a href="Dropping%20out">dropout</a>,
Muntz made fortunes by selling automobiles, TV receivers, and car stereos and tapes. A 1968 "Los Angeles Times" article noted that in one year he sold $72 million worth of cars, that five years later he sold $55 million worth of TV receivers, and that in 1967 he sold $30 million worth of car stereos and tapes.

After his success as a used car salesman and with <a href="Kaiser-Frazer">Kaiser-Frazer</a> dealerships in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, Muntz founded the <a href="Muntz%20Car%20Company">Muntz Car Company</a>, which made the "<a href="Muntz%20Jet">Muntz Jet</a>", a <a href="sports%20car">sports car</a> with jet-like contours. The car was manufactured between 1951 and 1953, although fewer than 400 were produced.

Muntz married seven times. His wives included actress Joan Barton (who appeared in "<a href="Angel%20and%20the%20Badman">Angel and the Badman</a>" with <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a>) and Patricia Stevens of the Patricia Stevens <a href="Finishing%20school">Finishing Schools</a>. <a href="Phyllis%20Diller">Phyllis Diller</a> was among his many girlfriends. He was friends with celebrities such as singer <a href="Rudy%20Vallee">Rudy Vallee</a>, comedian <a href="Jerry%20Colonna%20%28entertainer%29">Jerry Colonna</a>, actor <a href="Bert%20Lahr">Bert Lahr</a>, television presenter <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a>, and cowboy actor <a href="Gene%20Autry">Gene Autry</a>.

Muntz was fascinated by electronics from an early age. He built his first radio at age 8 and built another for his parents' car at age 14. During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, at age 15, he dropped out of <a href="Elgin%20High%20School%20%28Illinois%29">Elgin High School</a> to work in his parents' hardware store in Elgin, Illinois.

In 1934, Muntz opened his first used car lot, in Elgin, with a $500 ($ in ) line of credit. He was only 20 years old, and his mother had to sign the car-sale papers because legally he was too young to close his own deals. During a vacation in <a href="California">California</a>, Muntz discovered that used cars sold there for far higher prices; so he moved to California in 1940 at age 26 to open a used car lot in <a href="Glendale%2C%20California">Glendale</a>. On a hunch, he purchased 13 brand-new right-hand-drive vehicles to resell. These vehicles had been built for customers in Asia, but could not be delivered due to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. One vehicle was a custom-made <a href="Lincoln%20%28automobile%29">Lincoln</a> built for <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>. Local newspapers ran stories about the unusual cars, and Muntz sold them all within two weeks, still in their original shipping crates. Muntz soon opened a second lot in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> and closed his lot in Elgin.

Muntz rejected the then common opinion that used car salesmen should project a staid image. He realized the possibilities of generating publicity with odd stunts, and developed a "Madman" persona as a result. His flamboyant billboards and oddball television and radio commercials soon made him famous. In his used auto commercials, he marketed one model as the "daily special"; Muntz claimed that if the car did not sell that day, he would smash it to pieces on camera with a <a href="sledgehammer">sledgehammer</a>. Another notorious Muntz used-car TV pitch was "I buy 'em retail and sell 'em wholesale ... it's more fun that way!" His commercials generated so much publicity that comedians such as <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>, <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Allen">Steve Allen</a> often tried to outdo each other during television appearances by telling "Madman" Muntz jokes. <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> fans would spell out Muntz's name during halftime as a prank.

During the war, the <a href="Office%20of%20Price%20Administration">Office of Price Administration</a> sought to suspend Muntz' license to sell automobiles subject to price control. On August 1, 1945, Muntz was acquitted of an O.P.A. charge of violating used car regulations by Superior Judge Reuben H. Schmidt in Los Angeles.

Muntz's car lots became tourist attractions due to the widespread publicity from his television commercial appearances. A 1946 survey by "Panner Motor Tours" revealed that they ranked seventh among tourist attractions in Southern California. Muntz was willing to take large risks in his attempts to generate publicity. During the era of <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, he asked one of his advisers, "Do you think I'd make the front pages if I joined the Communist Party?"

In 1948, race car designer and <a href="Kurtis-Kraft">Kurtis-Kraft</a> founder <a href="Frank%20Kurtis">Frank Kurtis</a> attempted to market a new <a href="sports%20car">sports car</a>, the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport. Only 36 units had been sold by 1950. In 1951, for just $200,000 ($ in ) Kurtis sold the cars' manufacturing license to Muntz, who quickly <a href="badge%20engineering">rebadged</a> them as the "Muntz Jet". Initial production of the Jet took place in Glendale, where Muntz extended the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport's body by , making it a four-seater, and exchanged the <a href="Ford%20Flathead%20engine">Ford V8</a> engine for a larger <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a> <a href="V8%20engine">V8</a>. Later, after making just 28 Jets in California, Muntz moved production to a new factory in <a href="Evanston%2C%20Illinois">Evanston</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, extended the body further by , and replaced the Cadillac V8 with a less expensive Lincoln <a href="Flathead%20engine">sidevalve</a> V8.

The Jet was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of "<a href="Popular%20Science">Popular Science</a>" along with a <a href="Jaguar%20Cars">Jaguar</a> and an <a href="MG%20Cars">MG</a>. It featured its own design, with <a href="aluminum">aluminum</a> body panels and a removable <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a> top. Paint schemes were extravagant, with names like "Mars Red", "Stratosphere Blue", and "Lime Mist", and interior options included alligator or Spanish <a href="leatherette">leatherette</a>. The backseat armrests contained a full cocktail bar.

The Jet was capable of a top speed of and acceleration of 0–50 mph (0–80 km/h) in 6 seconds, a significant achievement for a road car at the time. The fastest production car in 1953 was the <a href="Pegaso%20Z-102">Pegaso Z-102 Supercharged</a> sports car at . Jet owners included then-CEO of <a href="CBS">CBS</a> <a href="Frank%20Stanton%20%28executive%29">Frank Stanton</a>, and actors <a href="Mickey%20Rooney">Mickey Rooney</a> and <a href="Lash%20La%20Rue">Lash La Rue</a>.

The labor and materials required to produce the Jet resulted in a high price for the end product and, in 1954, after selling about 400 cars and losing about $1,000 ($ in ) on each, Muntz closed the company. Today, Muntz Jets are prized collector cars and are recognized as predecessors to the <a href="Chevrolet%20Corvette">Chevrolet Corvette</a> and <a href="Ford%20Thunderbird">Ford Thunderbird</a>.

Muntz started plans to sell television receivers in 1946, and sales began in 1947. Muntz played the madman in his unorthodox television commercials, but in fact he was a shrewd businessman and a self-taught <a href="electrical%20engineer">electrical engineer</a>. By trial and error, taking apart and studying <a href="Philco">Philco</a>, <a href="RCA">RCA</a>, and <a href="DuMont%20Laboratories">DuMont</a> televisions, he figured out how to reduce the devices' electrical components to their minimum functional number. This practice became known as "<a href="Muntzing">Muntzing</a>".

In the 1940s and 1950s, most brands of television receivers were complicated pieces of equipment, commonly containing about 30 <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s, as well as <a href="rheostat">rheostat</a>s, <a href="transformer">transformer</a>s, and other heavy components. As a result, they were usually very expensive: the cheapest U.S.-manufactured receiver made before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> used a screen and cost $125 ($ in ); the cheapest model with a screen cost $445 ($ in ). By 1954, although <a href="History%20of%20television%23United%20States">broadcast television in the United States</a> had existed in various forms since 1928, only 55 percent of U.S. households owned a receiver. By contrast, eight years later, 90 percent of U.S. households had one.

Muntz developed a television chassis that produced an acceptable <a href="monochrome">monochrome</a> picture with 17 tubes. He often carried a pair of wire clippers, and when he thought that one of his employees was "<a href="overengineering">overengineering</a>" a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer "Well, I guess you have to put that last part back in" and walk away.

Marketed under the name "Muntz" by his company Muntz TV, Inc., the simplified units were the first black and white TV receivers to retail in the U.S. for less than $100. Muntz was also the first retailer to measure his screens from corner to corner rather than by width. The receivers sold well and were reliable partly because fewer tubes created less heat. The sets worked well in metropolitan areas that were close to television transmission towers where signals were strong. They worked poorly with weaker signals, as most of the components that Muntz had removed were intended to boost performance in fringe areas. This was a calculated decision: Muntz preferred to leave the low-volume, high-performance television receiver market to firms such as RCA and <a href="Zenith%20Electronics">Zenith Electronics</a>, as his intended customers were primarily urban dwellers with limited funds. Additionally, many urban apartment buildings had rules prohibiting external television antennas, and installation of an antenna, even if allowed, cost as much as $150. Muntz solved this problem by adding a built-in antenna to his receivers. In 1952, Muntz TV Inc. grossed $49.9 million ($ in ).

Muntz continued with his "Madman" persona in many of his advertisements. In one TV commercial that normally aired after "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>", Muntz, dressed in red <a href="Long%20underwear">long johns</a> and a <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> hat, promoted his new televisions by saying, "I wanna give 'em away, but Mrs. Muntz won't let me. She's crazy!" Another TV commercial presented a marching-band song with lyrics about Muntz TVs and incorporated animations by <a href="Oskar%20Fischinger">Oskar Fischinger</a>. His radio commercials, which Muntz ran up to 170 times a day, initially followed a classical music theme built around the spelling of Muntz's name. However, he soon convinced radio stations to run ads more in line with his persona. In one spot, Muntz screamed "Stop staring at your radio!" He followed up his radio ads with a direct mail campaign, collecting thousands of TV knobs and mailing them to prospective customers with a note saying, "Call us and we'll show up with the rest of the set!"

Some sources credit Muntz with inventing the abbreviation "TV". Muntz used <a href="skywriting">skywriting</a> as one of his marketing tactics, but, after watching one of his ads being created, he noted that the letters began to blur and dissipate before the pilot could finish spelling out "Muntz Televisions". So Muntz came up with the abbreviation "TV". However, "TV" had earlier been used in the call letters of television stations, such as <a href="WCBS-TV">WCBS-TV</a>, which adopted those call letters in 1946. Muntz also named his daughter "Tee Vee", although she normally went by "Teena" and, later, "Tee".

Despite his early success, sales later declined and Muntz's creditors refused to provide further financing in 1954. Muntz admitted his business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953, and although he tried to reorganize, Muntz TV filed bankruptcy and went out of business in 1959. (The company would be reorganized and last through the 1960s, but without its namesake at the helm.) However, Muntz's success continued in the sales of cars and general consumer electronics.

Attempting to combine his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak <a href="4-track%20cartridge">4-track tape cartridge</a>. 4-track was the direct predecessor of the <a href="Stereo%208">Stereo 8</a> cartridge, also known as the 8-track, later developed by American inventor <a href="Bill%20Lear">Bill Lear</a>. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the <a href="Endless%20tape%20cartridge">endless-loop</a> <a href="Fidelipac">Fidelipac</a> cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor <a href="George%20Eash">George Eash</a>. Muntz chose <a href="Stereophonic">stereo</a> recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the <a href="Highway%20Hi-Fi">Highway Hi-Fi</a> invented by <a href="Peter%20Carl%20Goldmark">Peter Goldmark</a>. These units played special 16 rpm records or <a href="Gramophone%20record">45 rpm</a> records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.

Muntz designed a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars and had it inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver to concentrate on the road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through <a href="Franchising">franchise</a>s in Florida and Texas.

Muntz audio products were so profitable by 1962 that he cancelled his agreements with tape-duplicating companies and founded his own company to manufacture prerecorded Stereo-Pak cartridges. Most record companies did not manufacture Stereo-Pak cartridges themselves; however, the <a href="Muntz%20Electronics%20Corporation">Muntz Electronics Corporation</a> licensed music from all the major record labels and issued hundreds of different tapes in the mid to late 1960s. Muntz exhibited his Autostereo players and Stereo-Pak cartridges under the trade name "Stereo-Pak" at the 1967 <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>.
The Autostereo player, which retailed from $129 in 1963 ($ in ) was a popular <a href="aftermarket%20%28automotive%29">aftermarket</a> addition to cars among the <a href="Beverly%20Hills">Beverly Hills</a> rich and famous. <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> used one in his <a href="Buick%20Riviera">Buick Riviera</a>, <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a> in his Corvette, and <a href="Peter%20Lawford">Peter Lawford</a> in his <a href="Carrozzeria%20Ghia">Ghia</a>. <a href="James%20Garner">James Garner</a>, <a href="Red%20Skelton">Red Skelton</a>, and <a href="Lawrence%20Welk">Lawrence Welk</a> also used Autostereo players in their cars. <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a> purchased one for his son, and <a href="Jerry%20Lewis">Jerry Lewis</a> recorded his scripts onto Stereo-Pak cartridges to learn his lines while driving.

Muntz attempted to establish a modern, trendy image for his players and cartridges. His print advertisements often showed the player installed in an appealing sports car and usually incorporated a young, attractive model with a suggestive tagline. Most of his employees in his California shops were attractive young women dressed in overbright clothing.

Bill Lear distributed the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his <a href="Learjet">Learjet</a> aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, the result of which became the Stereo 8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double the speed of the Stereo 8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo 8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a> began featuring Stereo 8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.

In a 1979 interview in "The Videophile" newsletter, Muntz revealed the biggest problem for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make hundreds of thousands of cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.

In late 1970, Muntz closed his Stereo-Pak audio business after a fire severely damaged his main offices. He then entered the growing home-video market. During the mid-1970s, Muntz thought of taking a <a href="Sony">Sony</a> color <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a> (CRT) television receiver, fitting it with a special lens and reflecting mirror, then projecting the magnified image onto a larger screen. He housed these primitive units in a large wooden <a href="entertainment%20center">console</a>, making it one of the first successful widescreen projection TV receivers marketed for home use.

The receivers were built in Muntz's headquarters in <a href="Van%20Nuys">Van Nuys</a>, California. Sony's U.S. sales division was unaware that Muntz was dealing directly with Sony's Tokyo <a href="original%20equipment%20manufacturer">original equipment manufacturer</a> (OEM) department, which shipped him the TV chassis directly. Thanks to Muntz's talent for mass-market advertising and self-promotion, by 1977 the projection receivers were a multimillion-dollar business. Muntz was quick to feature <a href="Sony">Sony</a>'s <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a> as well as <a href="JVC">JVC</a>'s and <a href="RCA">RCA</a>'s <a href="VHS">VHS</a> recorders in his store, setting up a showroom to demonstrate the potential for a "theater experience in the home".

In 1979, Muntz decided to sell blank tapes and VCRs as <a href="loss%20leader">loss leader</a>s to attract customers to his showroom, where he would then try to sell them his projection TV systems. His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> <a href="Compact%20Video%20Cassette">Compact Video Cassette</a> (CVC), a 1/4 in (0.6 cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the <a href="Super%208%20mm%20film">Super 8</a> film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.

Shortly before dying of <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> in 1987, Muntz centered his retail business on <a href="cellular%20phone">cellular phone</a>s, <a href="satellite%20dish">satellite dish</a>es, a <a href="motorhome">motorhome</a> rental company dubbed "Muntz Motor Mansions", and prefabricated aluminum houses. He made headlines in February 1985 as the first retailer to offer a <a href="Hitachi%2C%20Ltd.">Hitachi</a> cellular phone for less than $1,000 ($ in ), when just two years earlier most cellular phones had cost about $3,000 ($ in ). At the time of his death, he was the leading retailer of cellular phones in Los Angeles. During his final years, Muntz drove a customized <a href="Lincoln%20Continental">Lincoln Continental</a> with a television installed in the dashboard: Muntz claimed it helped him "drive better".

After he died, his children, James and Tee, continued to operate two Muntz stores in <a href="Van%20Nuys%2C%20California">Van Nuys</a> and <a href="Newhall%2C%20Santa%20Clarita%2C%20California">Newhall</a>; the remainder of the stores were <a href="Chain%20store">franchise</a>d businesses. James employed his father's advertising techniques to create splashy ads featuring prices that annoyed his competitors so much that they referred to them as "<a href="cut%20throat%20competition">cutthroat</a>".

The "Madman" method pioneered by Muntz was later copied by other retailers, including California car salesman <a href="Cal%20Worthington">Cal Worthington</a> and New York area electronics chain <a href="Crazy%20Eddie">Crazy Eddie</a>. In Crazy Eddie TV commercials, radio personality <a href="Jerry%20Carroll">Jerry Carroll</a> leapt at the camera and jumped around while jabbering at high speed, always ending with the line, "Crazy Eddie: Our prices are insaaaaaane!" As a result of his Crazy Eddie commercials, Carroll became a significant 80s icon, even appearing in the film "<a href="Splash%20%28film%29">Splash</a>".

Muntz's cultural impact was such that he was mentioned in novels, including <a href="Children%27s%20literature">children's book</a> "The Neddiad: How Neddie Took The Train, Went To Hollywood, And Saved Civilization" by <a href="Daniel%20Manus%20Pinkwater">Daniel Manus Pinkwater</a>, "The Lost Get-Back Boogie" by <a href="James%20Lee%20Burke">James Lee Burke</a>, and Franklin Mason's "Four Roses in Three Acts ".

A production called "Madman Muntz: American Maverick" was screened at film festivals through 2007. Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it was produced by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film documents Muntz's life, paying particular attention to his colorful career, and includes interviews with people who knew him and home movie footage contributed by his children.

The <a href="KCET">KCET</a> 1997 documentary "More Things That Aren't Here Anymore" has a segment on Muntz and is broadcast by the station regularly during pledge periods.

In 2001, Madman Muntz was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame</a>.

During the war, the battlecruiser participated in all three of the major <a href="Naval%20warfare%20of%20World%20War%20I%23North%20Sea">North Sea</a> battles—<a href="Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20%281914%29">Heligoland Bight</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Dogger Bank</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Jutland</a>—and was involved in the response to the inconclusive <a href="Raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">Raid on Scarborough</a>, and the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a>. "New Zealand" contributed to the destruction of two <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s during her wartime service and was hit by enemy fire only once, sustaining no casualties; her status as a "lucky ship" was attributed by the crew to a <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> <a href="M%C4%81ori%20traditional%20textiles%23Piupiu">piupiu</a> (warrior's skirt) and <a href="hei-tiki">hei-tiki</a> (pendant) worn by the captain during battle.

After the war, "New Zealand" was sent on a second world tour, this time to allow Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">John Jellicoe</a> to review the naval defences of the Dominions. In 1920, the battlecruiser was placed in reserve. She was <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up for scrap</a> in 1922 in order to meet Britain's tonnage limit in the <a href="disarmament">disarmament</a> provisions of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>.

The "Indefatigable" class was not a significant improvement on the preceding ; the main difference was the enlargement of the dimensions to give the ships' two wing turrets a wider arc of fire. The ships were smaller and not as well protected as the contemporary German battlecruiser and subsequent German designs. While "Von der Tann"s characteristics were not known when the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of the class, , was laid down in February 1909, the Royal Navy obtained accurate information on the German ship before work began on "New Zealand" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> .

"New Zealand" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall</a> length of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of at deep load. The ship displaced at load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She had a crew of 800 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a>.

The ship was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving two <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s, using steam provided by 31 coal-burning <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox%20boiler">Babcock & Wilcox boiler</a>s. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . However, during <a href="sea%20trial">trials</a> in 1912, the turbines produced over , which allowed "New Zealand" to reach . The ship carried enough coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to give her a range of at a speed of .
The ship carried eight <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20X%20naval%20gun">BL 12-inch Mk X guns</a> in four twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnel</a>, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had a limited ability to fire to the opposite side, but if the ship was full broadside to her target she could bring all eight main guns to bear. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">4-inch BL Mk VII guns</a> positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch</a> submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, one on each side aft of 'X' <a href="barbette">barbette</a>, and twelve torpedoes were carried.

The "Indefatigable"s were protected by a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="armoured%20belt">armoured belt</a> that extended between and covered the end <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s. Their armoured <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.

"New Zealand"s 'A' turret was fitted with a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> at the rear of the turret roof. It was also equipped to control the entire main armament in the event that the normal fire control positions were knocked out or communication between the primary positions and the gun layers was disabled.

The ship was fitted with a single <a href="QF%206%20pounder%20Hotchkiss">QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) gun from October 1914 to the end of 1915. In March 1915, a single <a href="QF%203%20inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3 inch 20 cwt</a> AA gun was added. It was provided with 500 rounds. The battlecruiser's 4-inch guns were enclosed in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and given blast shields during a refit in November to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. Two aft guns were removed at the same time.

"New Zealand" received a <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a> sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. An additional inch of armour was added to the top of the magazines and turret roofs after the Battle of Jutland.

By 1918, "New Zealand" carried two aircraft, a <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> and a <a href="Sopwith%201%C2%BD%20Strutter">Sopwith 1½ Strutter</a>, on <a href="Flight%20deck%23Early%20flight%20decks">flying-off ramps</a> fitted on top of 'P' and 'Q' turrets. The Pup was intended to shoot down <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s while the 1½ Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance. Each platform had a canvas <a href="hangar">hangar</a> to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.

At the start of the 20th century, the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> maintained that naval defence of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, including the <a href="British%20Dominions">Dominions</a>, should be unified under the Royal Navy. Attitudes on this matter softened during the first decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the creation of Fleet Units: forces consisting of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. While Australia and Canada were encouraged to purchase fleet units to serve as the core of new national navies, other fleet units would be operated by the Royal Navy at distant bases, particularly in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>; New Zealand was asked to partially subsidise a fleet unit for the China Station.

To this end, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Prime Minister of New Zealand</a>, Sir <a href="Joseph%20Ward">Joseph Ward</a>, announced on 22 March 1909 that his country would fund a battleship (later changed to an ) as an example to other countries. It is unclear why this design was selected, given that it was known to be inferior to the battlecruisers entering service with the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> (). Historian John Roberts has suggested that the request may have been attributable to the Royal Navy's practice of using small battleships and large cruisers as flagships of stations far from Britain, or it might have reflected the preferences of the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a> and Admiral of the Fleet <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">John Fisher</a>, preferences not widely shared. The <a href="Government%20of%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand Government</a> took out a loan to fund the cost of the ship.

"New Zealand"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid at <a href="Fairfield%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering">Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering</a>'s yard on the <a href="River%20Clyde">Clyde</a> on 20 June 1910. Launched on 1 July 1911, the battlecruiser was commissioned into the Royal Navy four days before she was completed on 23 November 1912.

"New Zealand" was sent on a ten-month <a href="wiktionary%3Ashow%20the%20flag">flag-waving</a> tour of New Zealand via South Africa in 1913. During this tour, the ship was seen by an estimated half-million New Zealanders—almost half the population—and her captain was presented with a <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> <a href="M%C4%81ori%20traditional%20textiles%23Piupiu">piupiu</a> (a warrior's skirt made from rolled <a href="Phormium">flax</a>) and a <a href="Pounamu">greenstone</a> <a href="hei-tiki">hei-tiki</a> (pendant), which were intended to ward off evil.

The Admiralty requested that "New Zealand" return to the United Kingdom when the tour concluded, rather than remain in the Pacific region as originally planned. The New Zealand Government acceded to the request and, upon her arrival on 8 December 1913, "New Zealand" joined the <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (1st BCS) of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. The squadron visited <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> in February 1914, and <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, <a href="Reval">Reval</a> and <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> the following June. On 19 August 1914, shortly after World War I began, "New Zealand" was transferred to the <a href="2nd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (2nd BCS).

"New Zealand"s first wartime action was the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>. Beatty's ships were originally intended to provide distant support for the British <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s closer to the German coast, in case large units of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35 a.m., the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the <a href="sandbar">sandbar</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Jade%20estuary">Jade estuary</a>.

The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37 p.m. By this time, "New Zealand" had fallen behind the three newer and faster battlecruisers and was not in position to significantly participate in the battle. "Strassburg" was able to evade fire by hiding in the mists, but "Cöln" remained visible and was quickly crippled by the British squadron. Before the German ship could be sunk, Beatty was distracted by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser off his starboard bow. He turned to pursue, but "Ariadne" was set afire after only three <a href="salvo">salvo</a>s fired from under . At 1:10, Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Shortly after turning north, the battlecruisers encountered the crippled "Cöln", which was sunk by two salvos from "Lion". During the battle, "New Zealand"s <a href="captain%20%28nautical%29">captain</a>, <a href="Lionel%20Halsey">Lionel Halsey</a>, wore the Māori piupiu over his uniform, setting a tradition followed for the duration of the war. Two days after the battle, "New Zealand" was transferred back to the 1st BCS, when the battlecruiser arrived from the Mediterranean.

The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it <a href="defeat%20in%20detail">in detail</a>. An earlier <a href="raid%20on%20Yarmouth">raid on Yarmouth</a> on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was later devised by Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment, while the rest of the High Seas Fleet stationed itself east of <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a>, so they could cover the battlecruisers' return and destroy any pursuing British vessels. Having broken the German naval codes, the British were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware of the High Seas Fleet's presence. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS (now reduced to four ships, including "New Zealand") and the 2nd Battle Squadron (consisting of six <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s) were detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.

Admiral Hipper's raiders set sail on 15 December 1914, and successfully bombarded several English towns; British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5:15 a.m. and fought an inconclusive action with them. Vice Admiral <a href="George%20Warrender%2C%207th%20Baronet">Sir George Warrender</a>, commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron, had received a signal at 5:40 that the destroyer was engaging enemy destroyers, although Beatty had not. The destroyer spotted the German armoured cruiser and her escorts at about 7:00, but could not transmit the message until 7:25. Admiral Warrender received the signal, as did "New Zealand", but Beatty, aboard "Lion", did not, even though "New Zealand" had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and the flagship. Warrender attempted to pass on Shark's message to Beatty at 7:36, but did not manage to make contact until 7:55. On receiving the message, Beatty reversed course, and dispatched "New Zealand" to search for "Roon". She was being <a href="wikt%3Aoverhaul">overhauled</a> by "New Zealand" when Beatty received messages that <a href="Scarborough%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Scarborough</a> was being shelled at 9:00. Beatty ordered "New Zealand" to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
The British forces, heading west to cover the main route through the minefields protecting the coast of England, split up while passing the shallow Southwest Patch of Dogger Bank; Beatty's ships headed to the north, while Warrender passed to the south. This left a gap between them, through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25 p.m., the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. The light cruiser spotted the light cruiser and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships, which he presumed were the advance screen for Hipper's ships. However, those were some behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the north-east of the British forces and also made good their escape.

"New Zealand" became flagship of the <a href="2nd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (2nd BCS) of the Grand Fleet on 15 January 1915, and saw action the following week in the Battle of Dogger Bank.

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Hipper sortied to clear Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. Alerted by decoded German transmissions, a larger force of British battlecruisers, including "New Zealand", sailed under the command of Admiral Beatty to intercept. Contact was initiated at 7:20 a.m. on the 24th, when "Arethusa" spotted the German light cruiser . By 7:35, the Germans had spotted Beatty's force and Hipper ordered a turn south at , believing that this speed would outdistance any British battleships to the north-west; he planned to increase speed to the armoured cruiser s maximum of if necessary to outrun any battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practical speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. "New Zealand" and "Indomitable" were the slowest of Beatty's ships, and gradually fell behind the newer battlecruisers. Despite this, "New Zealand" was able to open fire on "Blücher" by 9:35, and continued to engage the armoured cruiser after the other British battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers. After about an hour, "New Zealand" had knocked out "Blücher"s forward turret, and "Indomitable" began to fire on her as well at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells pierced the German ship's armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room four minutes later. This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port turrets, while the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed dropped to , and jammed her steering gear. At 10:48, Beatty ordered "Indomitable" to attack her, but the combination of a signalling error by Beatty's flag lieutenant and heavy damage to Beatty's flagship "Lion", which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal <a href="halyard">halyard</a>s, caused the rest of the British battlecruisers, temporarily under the command of Rear Admiral Sir <a href="Gordon%20Moore%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Gordon Moore</a> in "New Zealand", to think that that signal applied to them. In response, they turned away from Hipper's main body and engaged "Blücher". "New Zealand" fired 147 shells at "Blücher" before the German ship capsized and sank at 12:07 after being torpedoed by "Arethusa". Captain Halsey had again worn the piupiu over his uniform during the battle, and the lack of damage to "New Zealand" was once more attributed to its good luck properties.

"New Zealand" was relieved by "Australia" as flagship of the 2nd BCS on 22 February 1915. The squadron joined the Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in response to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and the squadron returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay <a href="Sea%20mine">mines</a> at the <a href="Swarte%20Bank">Swarte Bank</a>, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for what they thought was a British attack. Heavy fog and the need to refuel caused "Australia" and the British vessels to return to port on 17 April, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> while the <a href="1st%20Light%20Cruiser%20Squadron">1st Light Cruiser Squadron</a> swept the strait in an unsuccessful search for a possible <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a>.

On the morning of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the transport of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed to coincide with the Irish <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a>), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point in the middle of the North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the <a href="Long%20Forties">Long Forties</a>. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of <a href="Horn%20Reefs">Horn Reefs</a> when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when "Australia" collided with sister ship "New Zealand" twice in three minutes. "Australia" was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but "New Zealand" returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving "Indefatigable" as flagship.

On 31 May 1916, the 2nd BCS consisted of "New Zealand" (flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="William%20Christopher%20Pakenham">William Christopher Pakenham</a>) and "Indefatigable"; "Australia" was still under repair following her collision with "New Zealand". The squadron was assigned to Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet, which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 3:20 p.m., but Beatty's ships didn't spot the Germans to their east until 3:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east-south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time, Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.

Thus began the so-called "Run to the South" as Beatty changed course to steer east-south-east at 3:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 3:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn, and only the two leading ships, "Lion" and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with "Indefatigable" in the rear and the furthest to the west, and "New Zealand" ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. "Indefatigable" aimed at , while "New Zealand", unengaged herself, targeted . By 3:54, the range was down to and Beatty ordered a course change two <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">points</a> to starboard to open up the range at 3:57. "Indefatigable" was destroyed at about 4:03, when her magazines exploded.

After "Indefatigable"s loss, "New Zealand" shifted her fire to "Von der Tann" in accordance with Beatty's standing instructions. The range had grown too far for accurate shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 4:12 and 4:15. By this time, the 5th Battle Squadron, consisting of four s, had closed up and was engaging "Von der Tann" and "Moltke". At 4:23, a shell from struck near "Von der Tann"s rear turret, starting a fire among the practice targets stowed there that completely obscured the ship and caused "New Zealand" to shift fire to "Moltke". At 4:26, the ship was hit by a shell, fired by "Von der Tann", on 'X' barbette that detonated on contact and knocked loose a piece of armour that briefly jammed 'X' turret and blew a hole in the upper deck. Four minutes later, "Southampton", scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of <a href="Vice-Admiral">Vice-Admiral</a> <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>'s battleships, but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen-point turn to starboard in succession. "New Zealand", the last ship in the line, turned prematurely to stay outside the range of the oncoming battleships.
"New Zealand" was <a href="wikt%3Astraddle">straddled</a> several times by the battleship but was not hit. Beatty's ships maintained full speed in an attempt to increase the distance between them and the High Seas Fleet, and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then north-east to try to rendezvous with the main body of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. At 5:40, they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and as they could not make out the British ships, they turned away to the north-east at 5:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet in battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 6:35, Beatty was following "Indomitable" and of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-south-east, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180° starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of the High Seas Fleet in the haze. Twenty minutes later, Scheer ordered another 180° turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to <a href="Crossing%20the%20T">cross Scheer's T</a>, forming a battle line that cut across his battle line and badly damaging his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180° turn at 7:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.

This was successful, and the British lost sight of the Germans until 8:05, when spotted smoke bearing west-north-west. Ten minutes later, she had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats, and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. "Inflexible" opened fire at 8:20, followed by the rest of Beatty's battlecruisers. "New Zealand" and "Indomitable" concentrated their fire on , and hit her five times before she turned west to disengage. Shortly after 8:30, the <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s of Rear Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans had poor visibility and were able to fire only a few rounds at them before turning away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8:40. After this, Beatty changed course to south-south-east and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 2:55 the next morning, when the order was given to reverse course and head home.

"New Zealand" fired 420 twelve-inch shells during the battle, more than any other ship on either side. Despite this, only four successful hits were credited to the battlecruiser: three on "Seydlitz" and one on the pre-dreadnought . She was hit only once during the battle, confirming for the crew the piupiu and tiki worn by her new captain, <a href="John%20Green%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">J.F.E. (Jimmy) Green</a>, brought good luck.

"New Zealand" was relieved by "Australia" as flagship on 9 June and temporarily attached to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, until relieved her in September. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where the British expected to encounter the High Seas Fleet, they turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore <a href="Reginald%20Tyrwhitt">Tyrwhitt</a>. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed. "New Zealand" underwent a refit at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> in November 1916. She temporarily replaced "Australia" as squadron flagship between 29 November and 7 January 1917.

German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers were attempting to clear British-laid minefields in the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a> in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large operation for 17 November to destroy the ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the <a href="1st%20Cruiser%20Squadron">1st Cruiser Squadron</a> covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the <a href="1st%20Battle%20Squadron">1st Battle Squadron</a> of battleships. "New Zealand" was attached to the 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a>. "New Zealand" did not fire her guns during the battle. As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck.

During 1918, "New Zealand" and the Grand Fleet's other capital ships were used on occasion to escort convoys between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent the period from 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st BCS to support minelayers. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea from 25 June or 26 June to the end of July. During September and October, "New Zealand" and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>. The battlecruiser was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet as part of the 2nd BCS.

Following the war, Admiral <a href="John%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">Jellicoe</a> was tasked with helping to plan and coordinate the naval policies and defences of the British Dominions. "New Zealand" was made available for his transportation, and was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for the tour; the main changes were the removal of her flying-off platforms and the lower forward four-inch guns. The first stop was India, with "New Zealand" arriving in <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a> on 14 March 1919 and departing six weeks later. The battlecruiser arrived at <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a>, on 15 May, where Jellicoe and his staff disembarked to take an overland route across the country. "New Zealand" sailed via <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> to depart from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> for New Zealand on 16 August.
The ship called upon <a href="Christmas%20Island">Christmas Island</a>, southeast of <a href="Fanning%20Island">Fanning Island</a>, on 19 November 1920, thinking it uninhabited. Instead, they were greeted by Joe English, of Medford, Massachusetts, who had been manager of a copra plantation on the island, but had become marooned with two others, when the war had broken out. The men were rescued.
The ship was particularly popular in New Zealand, where crowds flocked to visit her as they had done in 1913. Jellicoe, too, was popular and he later returned to New Zealand to serve as <a href="Governor-General%20of%20New%20Zealand">Governor-General</a> from 1920 to 1924. The ship stopped off at <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> and <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> before arriving on 8 November in Canada, the final country to be assessed. After returning to the United Kingdom, the battlecruiser was <a href="paid%20off">paid off</a> into reserve on 15 March 1920. "New Zealand" was regarded as obsolete by the Royal Navy, because her 12-inch guns were inferior to the guns deployed on the latest generation of battlecruisers. She was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922 to meet the tonnage restrictions set on the British Empire by the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. The New Zealand Government completed paying off the loan used to fund the ship in the 1944/45 financial year.

Many items from the battlecruiser were sent to New Zealand after she was scrapped. Equipment including several 4-inch guns, a range finder and laundry equipment, were used by military units while other artifacts were placed on display in museums. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the 4-inch guns were the main armament of the <a href="Land%20battery">land batteries</a> which protected the entrances to the harbours at Auckland, Wellington and <a href="Lyttelton%2C%20New%20Zealand">Lyttelton</a>. The captain's piupiu was returned to New Zealand in 2005, and is on display at the <a href="Torpedo%20Bay%20Navy%20Museum">Torpedo Bay Navy Museum</a> in Auckland alongside the ship's bell and other artifacts. The <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa</a> in Wellington also holds several items from the ship in its collection.

George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore

George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (; 1580 – 15 April 1632) was an <a href="Politics%20of%20England%23History">English politician</a> and <a href="English%20overseas%20possessions">coloniser</a>. He achieved domestic political success as a member of parliament and later <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28England%29">Secretary of State</a> under <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">King James I</a>. He lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Prince Charles</a> and the Spanish <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">House of Habsburg</a> royal family. Rather than continue in politics, he resigned all of his political offices in 1625 except for his position on the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a> and declared his <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">Catholicism</a> publicly. He was created <a href="Baron%20Baltimore">Baron Baltimore</a> in the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Ireland">Irish peerage</a> upon his resignation. Baltimore Manor was located in <a href="County%20Longford">County Longford</a>, Ireland.

Calvert took an interest in the <a href="British%20colonisation%20of%20the%20Americas">British colonisation of the Americas</a>, at first for commercial reasons and later to create a refuge for <a href="Anti-Catholicism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">persecuted English Catholics</a>. He became the proprietor of <a href="Province%20of%20Avalon">Avalon</a>, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the <a href="Province%20of%20Maryland">Maryland colony</a> to his son <a href="Cecil%20Calvert%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Baltimore">Cecil</a> (1605–1675). His second son <a href="Leonard%20Calvert">Leonard Calvert</a> (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.

Little is known of the ancestry of the <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> branch of the Calverts. At George Calvert's knighting, it was claimed that his family originally came from <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> (a Dutch-speaking area today across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> in modern Belgium). Calvert's father, (an earlier) Leonard, was a country gentleman who had achieved some prominence as a tenant of <a href="Philip%20Wharton%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Wharton">Lord Wharton</a>, and was wealthy enough to marry a "<a href="gentlewoman">gentlewoman</a>" of a noble line, Alicia or Alice Crossland (or sometimes spelled: "Crosland"). He established his family on the estate of the later-built <a href="Kiplin%20Hall">Kiplin Hall</a>, near <a href="Catterick%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Catterick</a> in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. George Calvert was born at Kiplin in late 1579. His mother Alicia/Alice died on 28 November 1587, when he was eight years old. His father then married Grace Crossland (sometimes spelled: "Crosland"), Alicia's first cousin.

In 1569, Sir Thomas Gargrave had described Richmond as a territory where all gentlemen were "evil in religion", by which he meant predominately Roman Catholic; it appears Leonard Calvert was no exception. During the reign of <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, continuing the <a href="English%20Reformation">changes wrought</a> earlier in the century by her father <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a> which made the monarch the supreme authority of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Christian Church in England</a>, continuing the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> from the continent of Europe, with the political, spiritual and temporal separation from the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the Pope/<a href="Papacy">Papacy</a> in Rome, the Royal Government exerted authority over the matters of religious faith, practices and the Church. Acts mandating compulsory religious uniformity were enacted by <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> and enforced through penal laws. The <a href="Acts%20of%20Supremacy">Acts of Supremacy</a> and the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201559">Uniformity Act</a> of 1559 also included an <a href="Oath%20of%20Allegiance%20%281559%29">oath of allegiance</a> to the Queen and an implicit denial of the Pope's (then <a href="Pope%20Paul%20IV">Pope Paul IV</a>) authority over the English Church. This oath was required of any subject who wished to hold high office, attend university, or take advantage of opportunities controlled by the state (king/kingdom).

The Calvert household suffered the intrusion of the Elizabethan-era religious laws. From the year of George's birth onward, his father, Leonard Calvert, was subjected to repeated harassment by the Yorkshire authorities, who in 1580 extracted a promise of <a href="Nonconformist">conformity</a> from him, compelling his attendance at the Church of England services. In 1592, when George was twelve, the authorities denounced one of his tutors for teaching "from a popish primer" and instructed Leonard and Grace to send George and his brother Christopher to a Protestant tutor and, if necessary, to present the children before the commission "once a month to see how they perfect in learning". As a result, the boys were sent to a Protestant tutor called Fowberry at Bilton. The senior Calvert had to give a "bond of conformity"; he was banned from employing any Catholic servants and forced to purchase an English Bible, which was to "lie open in his house for everyone to read".

In 1593, records show that Grace Calvert was committed to the custody of a ""pursuivant"", an official responsible for identifying and persecuting Catholics, and in 1604 she was described as the "wife of Leonard Calvert of Kipling, non-communicant at Easter last".

George Calvert went up to <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Oxford">Trinity College</a> at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>, matriculating in 1593/94, where he studied foreign languages and received a bachelor's degree in 1597. As the oath of allegiance was compulsory after the age of sixteen, he would almost certainly have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> for three years.

In November 1604 he married Anne Mynne (or Mayne) in a Protestant, Church of England ceremony at <a href="St_Peter_upon_Cornhill">St Peter's</a>, Cornhill, Middlesex, where his address was registered as <a href="St%20Martin%20in%20the%20Fields%20%28parish%29">St Martin in the Fields</a>. His children, including his eldest son and heir <a href="Cecil%20Calvert%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Baltimore">Cecil</a>, who was born in the winter of 1605–06, were all baptised in the Church of England. When Anne died on 8 August 1622, she was buried at Calvert's local Protestant parish church, <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>.

Calvert had a total of thirteen children: <a href="Cecil%20Calvert%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Baltimore">Cecil</a>, who succeeded his father as the 2nd Baron Baltimore, <a href="Leonard%20Calvert">Leonard</a>, Anne, Mary, Dorothy, Elizabeth, Grace, Francis, George, Helen, Henry, John, and <a href="Phillip%20Calvert%20%28governor%29">Philip</a>.

Calvert named his son <a href="Cecilius%20Calvert%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Baltimore">"Cecilius"</a> (1605–1675) for <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Sir Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury</a> (1563–1612), spymaster to Queen Elizabeth, whom Calvert had met during an extended trip to the European mainland between 1601 and 1603, after which he became known as a specialist in foreign affairs. Calvert carried a packet for Cecilius from Paris, and so entered the service of the principal engineer of King <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James VI</a> of Scotland's succession to the <a href="British%20monarchy">English throne</a> in 1603 (when he also assumed the title of King James I of England.)

King James rewarded Robert Cecil, whom he made a <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>lor and secretary of state, with the granting of the title of <a href="Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Earl of Salisbury</a> in 1605 and <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">Lord High Treasurer</a> in 1608, making him the most powerful man at the royal court. As Cecil rose, Calvert rose with him. Calvert's foreign languages, legal training, and discretion made him an invaluable aide to Robert Cecil who, no lover of Catholics, seems to have accepted Calvert's conformity as beyond question. Working at the centre of court politics, Calvert exploited his influence by selling favours, an accepted practice for the times. Calvert accumulated a number of small offices, honours, and sinecures. In August 1605, he attended the King at Oxford, and received an honorary master-of-arts degree in an elaborate ceremony at which the <a href="Ludovic%20Stewart%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Lennox">Duke of Lennox (Ludovic Stewart)</a>, the earls of Oxford and Northumberland, and Cecilius received degrees. Given the prestige of the other graduates, Calvert's was the last awarded, but his presence in such company signalled his growing stature.

In 1606 the king made Calvert "clerk of the Crown" and "Assizes in Connaught", <a href="County%20Clare">County Clare</a>, Ireland, his first royal appointment. In 1609, James appointed him a "clerk of the Signet office", a post which required the preparation of documents for the royal signature and brought Calvert into close contact with the king. Calvert also served in James's First Parliament as a member for the borough of <a href="Bossiney">Bossiney</a>, in the county of <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, installed there by Cecil to support his policies. In 1610, Calvert was appointed a "clerk of the Privy Council". Each of these positions would have required an oath of allegiance.

With Robert Cecil's support, George Calvert came into his own as an adviser and supporter of King James. In 1610 and 1611, Calvert undertook missions to the continent on behalf of the King, visiting a number of embassies in Paris, <a href="Holland">Holland</a>, and the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Cleves">Duchy of Cleves</a>, and acting as an ambassador to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">French Royal Court</a> during the coronation of King <a href="Louis%20XIII%20of%20France">Louis XIII</a> (1601–1643) in 1610. A correspondent from France reported that Calvert gave "everyone great contentment with his discreet conversation." In 1615, James sent him to the continental <a href="Electorate%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Electorate of the Palatinate</a> (German) in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, whose impoverished elector, <a href="Frederick%20V%2C%20Elector%20Palatine">Frederick V, Elector Palatine</a> (1596–1632), had married James's daughter <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Bohemia">Elizabeth of Bohemia</a> (1596–1662) in 1613. Calvert had to convey the King's disapproval that Elizabeth, for lack of money, had given away expensive jewels to a gentlewoman leaving her employ. Elector Frederick's decision in 1619 to accept the throne of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">Bohemia</a> triggered a war with the powerful neighbouring <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg dynasty of Austria</a> to the southwest in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, which James attempted to end through a proposed alliance with the <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Kingdom of Spain</a>.

In 1611, James employed Calvert to research and transcribe his tract against the <a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church">Dutch Protestant</a> theologian <a href="Conrad%20Vorstius">Conrad Vorstius</a> (1569–1622). The following year, Cecil died, and Calvert acted as one of the four executors of his will. The king's favourite, <a href="Robert%20Carr%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Somerset">Sir Robert Carr, first Earl of Somerset</a> (1587–1645), Viscount Rochester, assumed the duties of secretary of state and recruited Calvert to assist with foreign policy, in particular the Latin and Spanish correspondence. Carr, soon raised to the earldom of <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, was not a success in the job, and fell from favour partly as a result of the murder of <a href="Thomas%20Overbury">Thomas Overbury</a> (1581–1613), to which Carr's wife Frances, the former <a href="Frances%20Carr%2C%20Countess%20of%20Somerset">Countess of Essex and later Somerset</a> (1590–1632), pleaded guilty in 1615. Carr's place as James's principal favourite was now taken by the handsome <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham</a> (1592–1628), with whom James was said to have been <a href="Personal%20relationships%20of%20James%20VI%20and%20I">infatuated</a>.

In 1613 the King commissioned Calvert to investigate Roman Catholic grievances in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, along with <a href="Sir%20Humphrey%20Wynch">Sir Humphrey Wynch</a> (1555–1625), <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Cornwallis">Sir Charles Cornwallis</a> (XXX?-1629) and <a href="Sir%20Roger%20Wilbraham">Sir Roger Wilbraham</a> (1553–1616). The commission spent almost four months in Ireland, and its final report, partly drafted by Calvert, concluded that religious conformity should be enforced more strictly in Ireland, Catholic schools be suppressed, and bad priests removed and punished. The King resolved not to reconvene the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Parliament of Ireland</a> until the Catholics "shall be better disciplined". In 1616 James endowed Calvert with the manor of <a href="Danby%20Wiske">Danby Wiske</a> in Yorkshire, which brought him into contact with Sir <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Strafford">Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford</a> (1593–1641), who became his closest friend and political ally. Calvert was now wealthy enough to buy the <a href="Kiplin%20Hall">Kiplin Hall</a> estate in his home parish. (Today, the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland">University of Maryland</a> operates a research centre there, while the main building is a <a href="house%20museum">house museum</a> owned by the Kiplin Hall Trust.) In 1617 his social status received a further boost when he was knighted, then becoming Sir George Calvert.

In 1619, Calvert completed his rise to power when James appointed him as one of the two principal <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28England%29">secretaries of state</a>. This followed the dismissal of <a href="Thomas%20Lake">Sir Thomas Lake</a> (1567–1630) due to scandals, including his wife's indiscretions with state secrets. Not emerging as a candidate until the end of the selection process, Calvert's appointment surprised him and most observers. Assuming he owed his promotion to the king's increasingly powerful favourite <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">George Villiers</a> (1592–1628) (later first <a href="Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Duke of Buckingham</a>), he sent him a great jewel as a token of thanks. Villiers returned the jewel, saying he had had nothing to do with the matter. Calvert's personal fortune was secured when he was additionally appointed a "commissioner of the treasury" with a pension of £1,000 pounds sterling and a subsidy on imported raw silk, which would later be converted to another £1,000 pension.

In Parliament, a political crisis developed over the king's policy of seeking a Spanish wife for <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, as part of a proposed alliance with the Habsburgs. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the <a href="Spanish%20Match">Spanish Match</a>, as it came to be called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state. As a result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">Commons</a>, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador's court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.

King James rewarded Calvert in 1623 for his loyalty by granting him a estate in <a href="County%20Longford">County Longford</a>, in the Irish province of <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a>, where his seat was known as the "Manor of Baltimore". Calvert was increasingly isolated from court circles as the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, (heir to the throne) and <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">George Villiers</a> wrested control of policy from the ageing James. Without consulting the diplomatically astute Calvert, the prince and the duke travelled to Spain to negotiate the Spanish marriage for themselves, with disastrous results. Instead of securing an alliance, the visit provoked a hostility between the two courts which quickly <a href="Anglo-Spanish%20War%20%281625%E2%80%931630%29">led to war</a>. In a reversal of policy, Buckingham dismissed the treaties with Spain, summoned a war council, and sought a French marriage for the Prince of Wales.

As the chief parliamentary spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown when he was reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert bowed to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations for the sale of his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.

No disgrace was attached to Calvert's departure from office: the King, to whom he had always remained personally loyal, confirmed his place on the <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> and appointed him Baron Baltimore, in <a href="County%20Longford%2C%20Ireland">County Longford</a> in <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a> in central Ireland. Immediately after Calvert resigned, he converted to Roman Catholicism.

The connection between Calvert's resignation and his conversion to Roman Catholicism was a complex one. George Cottington, a former employee of Calvert, suggested in 1628 that Calvert's conversion had been in progress a long time before it was made public. <a href="George%20Abbot%20%28Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury%29">George Abbot</a> (1562–1633), the reigning <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> (and ecclesiastical head of the independent <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>), reported that political opposition to Calvert, combined with his loss of office, had "made him discontented and, as the saying is, ""Desperatio facit monachum"", so hee apparently did turne papist, which hee now professeth, this being the third time that he hath bene to blame that way [sic]". <a href="Godfrey%20Goodman">Godfrey Goodman</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Gloucester">Bishop of Gloucester</a>, later claimed Calvert had been a secret Catholic all along ("infinitely addicted to the Catholic faith"), which explained his support for lenient policies towards Catholics and for the Spanish match.

No-one had questioned Calvert's conformity at the time, and if he had been <a href="Crypto-Papism">secretly Catholic</a>, he had hidden it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a <a href="Discalced%20Carmelites">Discalced Carmelite</a> priest reported to the <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Evangelization%20of%20Peoples">Congregation "Propaganda Fide"</a> in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met Stock at the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first <a href="Newfoundland%20Colony">Newfoundland Colony</a> (off modern Canada).

When King James I died in March 1625, his successor <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> maintained Calvert's barony but not his previous place on the Privy Council. Calvert then turned his attention to his Irish estates and his overseas investments. He was not entirely forgotten at court. After <a href="George%20Villiers%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Buckingham</a>'s dabblings in wars against Spain and France had ended in failure, he recalled Baltimore to court, and for a while may have considered employing him in the peace negotiations with Spain. Though nothing came of Baltimore's recall, he renewed his rights over the silk-import duties, which had lapsed with the death of James I, and secured Charles' blessing for his venture in the "New Found Land".

Calvert had long maintained an interest in the exploration and settlement of the <a href="New%20World">New World</a>, beginning with his investment of twenty-five pounds in the second <a href="Virginia%20Company">Virginia Company</a> in 1609, and a few months later a more substantial sum in the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>, which he increased in 1614. In 1620, Calvert purchased a tract of land in <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> from Sir <a href="William%20Vaughan%20%28writer%29">William Vaughan</a> (1575–1641), a Welsh writer and colonial investor, who had earlier failed to establish a colony on the large <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> island off the eastern coast of North America. He named the area of the peninsula as Avalon, after the legendary spot where <a href="Roman%20Britain%23Christianity">Christianity</a> was supposedly introduced to <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a> in ancient times. The plantation lay on what is now called the <a href="Avalon%20Peninsula">Avalon Peninsula</a> and included the fishing station at "<a href="Ferryland">Ferryland</a>". Calvert almost certainly had a fishery project in mind at this stage.

Calvert dispatched Captain <a href="Edward%20Wynne%20%28colonial%20governor%29">Edward Wynne</a> and a group of Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, <a href="hemp">hemp</a>, <a href="flax">flax</a>, <a href="tar">tar</a>, iron, timber and <a href="hops">hops</a>. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, "It is better and not so cold as England," and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year. Others corroborated Wynne's reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: "The land on which our Governor [Calvert and/or Wynne] planted is so good and commodious, that for the quantity, I think there is no better in many parts of England"; but he added ominously that Ferryland was "the coldest harbour in the land". Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of <a href="New%20France">New France</a> in the interior (modern <a href="Lower%20Canada">Lower Canada</a> of the 18th and 19th centuries, <a href="Quebec">Province of Quebec</a> and <a href="Canada">Dominion of Canada</a>) along the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20River">St. Lawrence River</a>, Calvert employed the pirate <a href="John%20Nutt">John Nutt</a>.

The settlement appeared to be progressing so well that in January 1623, Calvert obtained a concession from King James for the whole of Newfoundland, though the grant was soon reduced to cover only the southeastern Avalon peninsula, owing to competing claims from other English colonists. The final Charter constituted the province as a <a href="County%20palatine">"county palatinate"</a>, officially titled the "Province of Avalon", under Calvert's personal rule.

After resigning the Royal secretariat of state in 1625, the new Baron Baltimore made clear his intention to visit the colony: "I intend shortly," he wrote in March, "God willing, a journey for Newfoundland to visit a plantation which I began there some few years since." His plans were disrupted by the death of King James I, and by the crackdown on Catholics with which King Charles I began his reign to appease his opponents. The new King required all privy councillors to take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance; and since Baltimore, as a Catholic, had to refuse, he was obliged to step down from that cherished office. Given the new religious and political climate, and perhaps also to escape a serious outbreak of <a href="Second%20plague%20pandemic">plague</a> in England, Baltimore moved to his estates in Ireland. His expedition to Newfoundland had set sail without him in late May 1625 under Sir <a href="Arthur%20Aston">Arthur Aston</a>, who became the new provincial Governor of Avalon.

A reference by David Rothe, bishop of Ossary in Ireland, to a "Joane [also recorded as Jane] Baltimore now wife" of Calvert, reveals that Baltimore had recently remarried.

From the time of his conversion in 1625 onwards, Baltimore took care to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to <a href="Congregation%20for%20the%20Evangelization%20of%20Peoples">De Propaganda Fide</a> in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.

Baltimore was determined to visit his colony in person. In May 1626, he wrote to Wentworth:

Aston's return to England in late 1626, along with all the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, arriving on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both Protestant and Catholic settlers with him, as well as two <a href="secular%20clergy">secular priests</a>, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.

In 1628 he sailed again for Newfoundland, this time with his second wife Jane, most of his children, and 40 more settlers, to officially take over as <a href="Proprietary%20Governor">Proprietary Governor</a> of Avalon. He and his family moved into the house at Ferryland built by Wynne, a sizeable structure for the time, by colonial standards, and the only one in the settlement large enough to accommodate religious services for the community.

Matters connected to religion were to bedevil Baltimore's stay in "this remote part of the worlde where I have planted my selfe [sic]". He sailed at a time when English military preparations were underway to relieve the <a href="Huguenots">Huguenots</a> at La Rochelle. He was dismayed to find that the <a href="Anglo-French%20War%20%281627%E2%80%931629%29">war with France</a> had spread to Newfoundland, and that he had to spend most of his time fighting off French attacks on English fishing fleets with his own ships the "Dove" and the "Ark". As he wrote to Buckingham, "I came to builde, and sett, and sowe, but I am falne to fighting with Frenchmen [sic]". His settlers were so successful against the French that they captured several ships, which they escorted back to England to help with the war effort. Baltimore was granted the loan of one of the ships to aid in his defence of the colony, as well as a share of the prize money.

Adopting a policy of free religious worship in the colony, Baltimore allowed the Catholics to worship in one part of his house and the Protestants in another. This novel arrangement proved too much for the resident Anglican priest, <a href="Erasmus%20Stourton">Erasmus Stourton</a>—"that knave Stourton", as Baltimore referred to him—who, after altercations with Baltimore, was placed on a ship for England, where he lost no time in reporting Baltimore's practices to the authorities, complaining that the Catholic priests Smith and Hackett said <a href="mass%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">mass</a> every Sunday and "doe use all other ceremonies of the church of Rome in as ample a manner as tis used in Spayne [sic]". and that Baltimore had the son of a Protestant forcibly baptised as a Catholic. Although Stourton's complaints were investigated by the Privy Council, due to Baltimore's support in high places the case was dismissed.

Baltimore had become disenchanted with conditions in "this wofull country", and he wrote to his old acquaintances in England lamenting his troubles. The final blow to his hopes was dealt by the Newfoundland winter of 1628–9, which did not release its grip until May. Like others before them, the residents of Avalon suffered terribly from the cold and from malnutrition. Nine or ten of Baltimore's company died that winter, and with half the settlers ill at one time, his house had to be turned into a hospital. The sea froze over, and nothing would grow before May. "Tis not terra Christianorum", Baltimore wrote to Wentworth. He confessed to the king: "I have found...by too deare bought experience [that which other men] always concealed from me...that there is a sad face of wynter upon all this land".

Baltimore solicited a new charter from the king. To found an alternative colony in a less hostile climate further south, he requested "a precinct" in <a href="Colony%20and%20Dominion%20of%20Virginia">Virginia</a>, where he could grow tobacco. He wrote to his friends <a href="Francis%20Cottington">Francis Cottington</a> and Thomas Wentworth enlisting their support for this new proposal, admitting the impression his abandonment of Avalon might make in England: "I shall rayse a great deal of talke and discourse and be censured by most men of giddiness and levity [sic]". The king, perhaps guided by Baltimore's friends at court, replied expressing concern for Baltimore's health and gently advising him to forget colonial schemes and return to England, where he would be treated with every respect: "Men of your condition and breeding are fitter for other imployments than the framing of new plantations, which commonly have rugged & laborious beginnings, and require much greater meanes, in managing them, than usually the power of one private subject can reach unto".

Baltimore sent his children home to England in August. By the time the king's letter reached Avalon, he had departed with his wife and servants for Virginia.

In late September or October 1629, Baltimore arrived in <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown</a>, where the Virginians, who suspected him of designs on some of their territory and vehemently opposed Catholicism, gave him a cool welcome. They gave him the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, which he refused to take, so they ordered him to leave. After no more than a few weeks in the colony, Baltimore left for England to pursue the new charter, leaving his wife and servants behind. In early 1630 he procured a ship to fetch them, but it foundered off the Irish coast, and his wife was drowned. Baltimore described himself the following year as "a long time myself a <a href="Man%20of%20Sorrows">Man of Sorrows</a>".

Baltimore spent the last two years of his life constantly lobbying for his new charter, though the obstacles proved difficult. The Virginians, led by <a href="William%20Claiborne">William Claiborne</a>, who sailed to England to make the case, campaigned aggressively against separate colonising of the <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Chesapeake</a>, claiming they possessed the rights to that area. Baltimore was short of capital, having exhausted his fortune, and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends. To make matters worse, in the summer of 1630 his household was infected by the plague, which he survived. He wrote to Wentworth: "Blessed be God for it who hath preserved me now from shipwreck, hunger, <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a> and pestilence..."

His health declining, Baltimore's persistence over the charter finally paid off in 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the new land of <a href="Province%20of%20Carolina">Carolina</a> into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries to the north of the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a>, on either side of the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.

In his will, written the day before he died, Baltimore beseeched his friends Wentworth and Cottington to act as guardians and supervisors to his first son Cecil, who inherited the title of Lord Baltimore and the imminent grant of Maryland. Baltimore's two colonies in the New World continued under the proprietorship of his family. Avalon, which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of fish, was expropriated by Sir <a href="David%20Kirke">David Kirke</a>, with a new royal charter which Cecil Calvert vigorously challenged, and it was finally absorbed into Newfoundland in 1754. Although Baltimore's failed Avalon venture marked the end of an early era of attempts at proprietary colonisation, it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of Newfoundland.

Maryland became a prime tobacco exporting colony in the mid-Atlantic and, for a time, a refuge for Catholic settlers, as George Calvert had hoped. Under the rule of the Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony.

One hundred and forty years after its first settlement, Maryland joined twelve other British colonies along the Atlantic coast in declaring their independence from British rule and the right to freedom of religion for all citizens in the new United States.

Aldfrith of Northumbria

Aldfrith (<a href="Early%20Modern%20Irish">Early Modern Irish</a>: Flann Fína mac Ossu; <a href="Latin">Latin</a>: "Aldfrid", "Aldfridus"; died 14 December 704 or 705) was king of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> from 685 until his death. He is described by early writers such as <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a> and <a href="Stephen%20of%20Ripon">Stephen of Ripon</a> as a man of great learning. Some of his works and some letters written to him survive. His reign was relatively peaceful, marred only by disputes with Bishop <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, a major figure in the early Northumbrian church.

Aldfrith was born on an uncertain date to <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">Oswiu of Northumbria</a> and an Irish princess named <a href="F%C3%ADn">Fín</a>. Oswiu later became King of Northumbria; he died in 670 and was succeeded by his son <a href="Ecgfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Ecgfrith</a>. Aldfrith was educated for a career in the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">church</a> and became a scholar. However, in 685, when Ecgfrith was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dun%20Nechtain">battle of Nechtansmere</a>, Aldfrith was recalled to Northumbria, reportedly from the <a href="Inner%20Hebrides">Hebridean</a> island of <a href="Iona">Iona</a>, and became king.

In his early-8th-century account of Aldfrith's reign, Bede states that he "ably restored the shattered fortunes of the kingdom, though within smaller boundaries". His reign saw the creation of works of <a href="Hiberno-Saxon%20art">Hiberno-Saxon art</a> such as the <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a> and the <a href="Codex%20Amiatinus">Codex Amiatinus</a>, and is often seen as the start of <a href="Northumbria%27s%20golden%20age">Northumbria's golden age</a>.

By the year 600, most of what is now England had been conquered by invaders from the continent, including <a href="Angles">Angles</a>, <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a>, and <a href="Jutes">Jutes</a>. <a href="Bernicia">Bernicia</a> and <a href="Deira">Deira</a>, the two <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> kingdoms in the north of England, were first united under a single ruler in about 605 when <a href="%C3%86thelfrith%20of%20Northumbria">Æthelfrith</a>, king of Bernicia, extended his rule over Deira. Over the course of the 7th century, the two kingdoms were sometimes ruled by a single king, and sometimes separately. The combined kingdom became known as the kingdom of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>: it stretched from the <a href="River%20Humber">River Humber</a> in the south to the <a href="River%20Forth">River Forth</a> in the north.

In 616, Æthelfrith was succeeded by <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a>, a Deiran. Edwin banished Æthelfrith's sons, including both <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a> and <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">Oswiu of Northumbria</a>. Both spent their exile in <a href="D%C3%A1l%20Riata">Dál Riata</a>, a kingdom spanning parts of northeastern Ireland and western Scotland. Oswiu was a child when he came to Dál Riata, and grew up in an Irish milieu. He became a fluent speaker of Old Irish, and may have married a princess of the <a href="U%C3%AD%20N%C3%A9ill">Uí Néill</a> dynasty, probably <a href="F%C3%ADn">Fín</a> the daughter (or possibly granddaughter) of <a href="Colm%C3%A1n%20R%C3%ADmid">Colmán Rímid</a>. Aldfrith was a child of this marriage, but his date of birth is unrecorded. He was probably thus a cousin or nephew of the noted scholar <a href="Cenn%20F%C3%A1elad%20mac%20Aillila">Cenn Fáelad mac Aillila</a>, and perhaps a nephew of Bishop <a href="Finan%20of%20Lindisfarne">Finan of Lindisfarne</a>. Irish law made Fín's kin, the <a href="Cen%C3%A9l%20nE%C3%B3gain">Cenél nEógain</a> of the northern Uí Néill, responsible for his upbringing. The relationship between Aldfrith's father and mother was not considered a lawful marriage by Northumbrian churchmen of his day, and he is described as the son of a <a href="concubine">concubine</a> in early sources.

Oswald and Oswiu returned to Northumbria after Edwin's death in 633, and between them they ruled for much of the middle of the 7th century. The 8th-century monk and chronicler <a href="Bede">Bede</a> lists both Oswald and Oswiu as having held "imperium", or overlordship, over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms; in Oswiu's case his dominance extended beyond the Anglo-Saxons to the <a href="Picts">Picts</a>, the <a href="Gaels">Gaels</a> of <a href="D%C3%A1l%20Riata">Dál Riata</a>, and the many obscure and nameless native British kingdoms in what are now <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a> and southern <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Oswiu's overlordship was ended in 658 by the rise of <a href="Wulfhere%20of%20Mercia">Wulfhere of Mercia</a>, but his reign continued until his death in 670, when Ecgfrith, one of his sons by his second wife, <a href="Eanfl%C3%A6d">Eanflæd</a>, succeeded him. Ecgfrith was unable to recover Oswiu's position in Mercia and the southern kingdoms, and was defeated by Wulfhere's brother <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Mercia">Æthelred</a> in a battle on the <a href="River%20Trent">River Trent</a> in 679.

Ecgfrith sent an army under his general, <a href="Beornh%C3%A6th">Berht</a>, to Ireland in 684 where he ravaged the plain of Brega, destroying churches and taking hostages. The raid may have been intended to discourage support for any claim Aldfrith might have to the throne, though other motives are possible.

Ecgfrith's two marriages—the first to the saintly virgin <a href="%C3%86thelthryth">Æthelthryth</a> (Saint Audrey), the second to Eormenburh—produced no children. He had two full brothers: <a href="Alchfrith%20of%20Deira">Alhfrith</a>, who is not mentioned after 664, and <a href="%C3%86lfwine%20of%20Deira">Ælfwine</a>, who was killed at the battle on the Trent in 679. Hence the succession in Northumbria was unclear for some years before Ecgfrith's death. Bede's "Life of Cuthbert" recounts a conversation between <a href="Cuthbert%20of%20Lindisfarne">Cuthbert</a> and Abbess <a href="%C3%86lffl%C3%A6d%20of%20Whitby">Ælfflæd of Whitby</a>, daughter of Oswiu, in which Cuthbert foresaw Ecgfrith's death. When Ælfflæd asked about his successor, she was told she would love him as a brother:

"But," said she, "I beseech you to tell me where he may be found." He answered, "You behold this great and spacious sea, how it aboundeth in islands. It is easy for God out of some of these to provide a person to reign over England." She therefore understood him to speak of [Aldfrith], who was said to be the son of her father, and was then, on account of his love of literature, exiled to the Scottish islands.

<a href="Cuthbert%20of%20Lindisfarne">Cuthbert</a>, later considered a saint, was a second cousin of Aldfrith (according to Irish genealogies), which may have been the reason for his proposal as monarch.

Ecgfrith was killed during a campaign against his cousin, the <a href="King%20of%20the%20Picts">King of the Picts</a> <a href="Bridei%20map%20Beli">Bridei map Beli</a>, at a battle known as Nechtansmere to the Northumbrians, in Pictish territory north of the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>. Bede recounts that Queen Eormenburh and Cuthbert were visiting <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a> that day, and that Cuthbert had a premonition of the defeat. Ecgfrith's death threatened to break the hold of the descendants of Æthelfrith on Northumbria, but the scholar Aldfrith became king and the thrones of Bernicia and Deira remained united.

Although rival claimants of royal descent must have existed, there is no recorded resistance to Aldfrith's accession. It has also been suggested that Aldfrith's ascent was eased by support from Dál Riata, the <a href="U%C3%AD%20N%C3%A9ill">Uí Néill</a>, and the <a href="Picts">Picts</a>, all of whom might have preferred the mature, known quantity of Aldfrith to an unknown and more warlike monarch, such as Ecgfrith or Oswiu had been. The historian Herman Moisl, for example, wrote that "Aldfrith was in Iona in the year preceding the battle [of Nechtansmere]; immediately afterwards, he was king of Northumbria. It is quite obvious that he must have been installed by the Pictish-Dál Riatan alliance". Subsequently, a battle between the Northumbrians and the Picts in which Berht was killed is recorded by Bede and the Irish annals in 697 or 698. Overall, Aldfrith appears to have abandoned his predecessors' attempts to dominate Northumbria's neighbours.

Bede, paraphrasing <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, wrote that following Ecgfrith's death, "the hopes and strengths of the English realm began 'to waver and slip backward ever lower'". The Northumbrians never regained the dominance of central Britain lost in 679, or of northern Britain lost in 685. Nonetheless, Northumbria remained one of the most powerful states of Britain and Ireland well into the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a>.

Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira throughout his reign, but the two parts remained distinct, and would again be divided by the Vikings in the late 9th century. The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later <a href="Anglo-Scottish%20border">Anglo-Scottish border</a>, with <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, <a href="Hexham">Hexham</a>, <a href="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a>, and <a href="Yeavering">Yeavering</a> being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith's death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at <a href="Dunbar">Dunbar</a>, and religious centres at <a href="Coldingham%20Priory">Coldingham</a> and <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose</a>. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are more obscure, but a <a href="Bishop%20of%20Whithorn">Bishop of Whithorn</a> is known from shortly after Aldfrith's reign. <a href="York">York</a>, <a href="Catterick%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Catterick</a>, <a href="Ripon">Ripon</a>, and <a href="Whitby">Whitby</a> appear to have been important sites in Deira.

Northumbria's southern frontier with Mercia ran across England, from the <a href="Humber">Humber</a> in the east, following the <a href="River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire">River Ouse</a> and the <a href="River%20Don%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">River Don</a>, to the <a href="Mersey">Mersey</a> in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the <a href="Roman%20Rig">Roman Rig</a> dyke, near modern <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, appears to show that it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The <a href="Nico%20Ditch">Nico Ditch</a>, to the south of modern <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.

Along with the king, royal family, and chief noblemen, the church was a major force in Northumbria. Churchmen were not only figures of spiritual authority, they were major landowners, who also controlled trade, centred at major churches and monasteries in a land without cities and towns. The <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lindisfarne">bishopric of Lindisfarne</a> was held by Cuthbert at Aldfrith's accession; Cuthbert was succeeded by the Irish-educated <a href="Eadberht%20of%20Lindisfarne">Eadberht</a>, who would later be <a href="Abbot%20of%20Iona">Abbot of Iona</a> and bring the <a href="Easter%20controversy">Easter controversy</a> to an end, and then by <a href="Eadfrith%20of%20Lindisfarne">Eadfrith</a>, creator of the <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a>. The bishops of Lindisfarne sometimes held the see of <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hexham">Hexham</a>, but during Aldfrith's reign it was held by <a href="John%20of%20Beverley">John of Beverley</a>, a pupil and protégé of <a href="Theodore%20of%20Tarsus">Theodore</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The bishopric of York was held by <a href="Bosa%20of%20York">Bosa</a> in 685. <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a> was given the see in 687, but removed in 691 with Bosa returning to York. The short-lived see at <a href="Abercorn">Abercorn</a>, created in 681 for Bishop <a href="Trumwine%20of%20Abercorn">Trumwine</a>, collapsed in the period after Ecgfrith's death and the first known <a href="Bishop%20of%20Whithorn">Bishop of Whithorn</a> was appointed in the reign of King <a href="Ceolwulf%20of%20Northumbria">Ceolwulf</a>. Important monasteries existed at <a href="Whitby%20Abbey">Whitby</a>, where the known abbesses tended to be members of the Deiran royal family, at <a href="Monkwearmouth-Jarrow%20Priory">Monkwearmouth-Jarrow</a>, where Bede was a monk, and at <a href="Ripon%20Cathedral">Ripon</a>.

Aldfrith appears to have had the support of leading ecclesiastics, most notably his half-sister Ælfflæd and the highly respected Bishop Cuthbert. He is known to have received <a href="confirmation%20%28Christian%20sacrament%29">confirmation</a> at the hands of <a href="Aldhelm%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Sherborne">Aldhelm</a>, later the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Sherborne%20%28historic%29">Bishop of Sherborne</a> in the south-western Anglo-Saxon <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Wessex">Kingdom of Wessex</a>. Aldhelm too had received an Irish education, but in Britain, at <a href="Malmesbury%2C%20Wiltshire">Malmesbury</a>. Correspondence between the two survives, and Aldhelm sent Aldfrith his treatise on the <a href="numerology">numerology</a> of the number seven, the "Epistola ad Acircium". Aldfrith also owned a manuscript on cosmography, which (according to Bede) he purchased from Abbot Ceolfrith of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in exchange for an estate valued at eight <a href="hide%20%28unit%29">hide</a>s. Aldfrith was a close friend of <a href="Adomn%C3%A1n%20of%20Iona">Adomnán</a>, <a href="Abbot%20of%20Iona">Abbot of Iona</a> from 679, and may have studied with him. In the 680s Aldfrith twice met with Adomnán, who came to seek the release of the Irish captives taken in Berht's expedition of 684. These were released and Adomnán presented Aldfrith with a copy of his treatise "<a href="De%20Locis%20Sanctis">De Locis Sanctis</a>" ("On the Holy Places"), a description of the places of <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> in the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>, and at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Bede reports that Aldfrith circulated Adomnán's work for others to read.

Bede described Aldfrith as a scholar, and his interest in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a "sapiens", a term from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the <a href="Plato">Plato</a>nic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also makes it clear that the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated from the time of Aldfrith's death.

Aldfrith's relations with the Church were, however, not always smooth. He inherited from Ecgfrith a troubled relationship with <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, a major ecclesiastical figure of the time. Wilfrid, the bishop of <a href="York">York</a>, had been exiled by Ecgfrith for his role in persuading Ecgfrith's wife, Æthelthryth, to remain a saintly celibate. In 686, at the urging of Archbishop Theodore, Aldfrith allowed Wilfrid to return. Aldfrith's relations with Wilfrid were stormy; the hostility between the two was partly caused by Aldfrith's allegiances with the Celtic Church, a consequence of his upbringing in exile. A more significant cause of strife was Wilfrid's opposition to Theodore's division, in 677, of his huge Northumbrian diocese. When Wilfrid returned from exile the reconciliation with Aldfrith did not include Aldfrith's support for Wilfrid's attempts to recover his episcopal authority over the whole of the north. By 691 or 692 their differences were beyond repair. Wilfrid's hagiographer writes:For a while all would be peace between the wise King Aldfrith and our holy bishop, and a happier state of affairs could hardly be imagined. Then spite would boil up again and the situation would be reversed. And so they continued for years, in and out of friendship with each other, till finally their quarrels came to a head and the king banished Wilfrid from Northumbria.

Wilfrid spent his exile in Mercia, where he enjoyed the staunch support of King Æthelred. In 702 or 703, Aldfrith convened a <a href="Council%20of%20Austerfield">council</a> at <a href="Austerfield">Austerfield</a>, on the southern border of Northumbria, which was attended by <a href="Bertwald">Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, and many bishops. The question of Wilfrid's return to Northumbria was hotly debated and then rejected by the bishops. According to Stephen of Ripon, King Aldfrith offered to use his army to pressure Wilfrid into accepting the decision, but the bishops reminded him that he had promised Wilfrid <a href="safe-conduct">safe-conduct</a>. After returning to Mercia, Wilfrid was <a href="Excommunication">excommunicated</a> by his enemies among the bishops. He responded by journeying to Rome, where he appealed in person to <a href="Pope%20John%20VI">Pope John VI</a>. The Pope provided him with letters to Aldfrith ordering that Wilfrid be restored to his offices. Aldfrith refused to receive the letters, and Wilfrid remained in disfavour.

Aldfrith's reign is considered the beginning of <a href="Northumbria%27s%20Golden%20Age">Northumbria's Golden Age</a>, which lasted until the end of the 8th century. The period saw the flowering of <a href="Insular%20art">Insular art</a> in Northumbria and produced the <a href="Lindisfarne%20Gospels">Lindisfarne Gospels</a>, perhaps begun in Aldfrith's time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20mission">Anglo-Saxon mission</a>s to the continent.

The Lindisfarne Gospels are believed to be the work of <a href="Eadfrith%20of%20Lindisfarne">Eadfrith of Lindisfarne</a>, <a href="bishop%20of%20Lindisfarne">bishop of Lindisfarne</a> from 698. They are not the only surviving Northumbrian <a href="illuminated%20manuscripts">illuminated manuscripts</a> from Aldfrith's time. Also active at Lindisfarne in the late 7th century was the scribe known as the "Durham-Echternach calligrapher", who produced the <a href="Durham%20Gospels">Durham Gospels</a> and the <a href="Echternach%20Gospels">Echternach Gospels</a>. The <a href="Codex%20Amiatinus">Codex Amiatinus</a> was a product of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, made on the orders of Abbot <a href="Ceolfrid">Ceolfrid</a>, probably in the decade after Aldfrith's death.

Two significant items of jewellery from Northumbria in this period have survived. The <a href="Ripon%20Jewel">Ripon Jewel</a>, discovered in the precincts of <a href="Ripon%20Cathedral">Ripon Cathedral</a> in 1977, is difficult to date but its grandeur and the location of the find have suggested a link with Bishop Wilfrid, whose rich furnishings of the church at Ripon are on record. Bishop Cuthbert's <a href="pectoral%20cross">pectoral cross</a> was buried with him during Aldfrith's reign, either at his death in 687 or his reburial in 698 and is now at <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a>. There are few surviving architectural or monumental remains from the period. The <a href="Bewcastle%20Cross">Bewcastle Cross</a>, the <a href="Ruthwell%20Cross">Ruthwell Cross</a> and the <a href="Hexham%20Cross">Hexham Cross</a> are probably to be dated to one or two generations after Aldfrith's time. <a href="Escomb%20Church">Escomb Church</a> is the best preserved Northumbrian church of the period, dated to the late 7th century. The ruined chapel at <a href="Heysham">Heysham</a>, overlooking <a href="Morecambe%20Bay">Morecambe Bay</a>, may be somewhat later in date.

The Northumbrian coinage is thought to have begun during Aldfrith's reign. Early silver coins, known as <a href="sceat">sceat</a>tas, appeared, replacing the impractical gold as a medium of exchange. Exceptionally for the period, Aldfrith's coins bear his name, rather than that of a moneyer, in an Irish <a href="uncial%20script">uncial script</a>. Most show a lion, with upraised tail.

Aldfrith was married to <a href="Cuthburh">Cuthburh</a>, sister of King <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine of Wessex</a>; the marriage thus allied Aldfrith with one of the most powerful kings in Anglo-Saxon England. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" records that Aldfrith and Cuthburh separated, and Cuthburh established an abbey at <a href="Wimborne%20Minster">Wimborne Minster</a> where she was abbess. At least two sons were born to Aldfrith, but whether Cuthburh was their mother is unrecorded. <a href="Osred%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Osred</a>, born around 696 or 697, succeeded to the throne after a civil war following Aldfrith's death. Little is known of Offa, who is presumed to have been killed after being taken from Lindisfarne in 750 on the orders of King <a href="Eadberht%20of%20Northumbria">Eadberht of Northumbria</a>. <a href="Osric%20of%20Northumbria">Osric</a>, who was later king, may have been Aldfrith's son, or alternatively the son of Aldfrith's half-brother <a href="Alhfrith%20of%20Deira">Alhfrith</a>. The 13th-century discovery of a tomb thought to be that of St <a href="Osana">Osana</a> has led to the suggestion that Osana was the daughter of Aldfrith, although this view is not widely held by modern historians.

Aldfrith was said to have been ill for some time before his death, dying on 14 December 704 or 705. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" adds that he died at <a href="Driffield">Driffield</a> in the <a href="East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">East Riding of Yorkshire</a>. The succession was disputed by <a href="Eadwulf%20of%20Northumbria">Eadwulf</a>, supported initially by Bishop Wilfrid, and supporters of Aldfrith's young son Osred, apparently led by Berht's kinsman <a href="Berhtfrith">Berhtfrith</a>.

The reports of Aldfrith's death in the <a href="Irish%20annals">Irish annals</a> call him Aldfrith son of Oswiu, but some of these are glossed by later scribes with the name Flann Fína mac Ossu. A collection of <a href="wisdom%20literature">wisdom literature</a> attributed to Flann Fína, the "Briathra Flainn Fhina Maic Ossu", has survived, though the text is not contemporary with Aldfrith as it is in <a href="Middle%20Irish">Middle Irish</a>, a form of Irish not in use until the 10th century.

Angus Lewis Macdonald

Angus Lewis Macdonald (August 10, 1890 – April 13, 1954), popularly known as 'Angus L.', was a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> lawyer, law professor and <a href="Politics%20of%20Canada">politician</a> from <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. He served as the <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal</a> premier of Nova Scotia from 1933 to 1940, when he became the federal minister of defence for naval services. He oversaw the creation of an effective <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Canadian navy</a> and <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> <a href="convoy">convoy</a> service during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. After the war, he returned to Nova Scotia to become premier again. In the election of 1945, his Liberals returned to power while their main rivals, the <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Conservatives</a>, failed to win a single seat. The Liberal rallying cry, "All's Well With Angus L.," was so effective that the Conservatives despaired of ever beating Macdonald. He died in office in 1954.

Macdonald's more than 15 years as premier brought fundamental changes. Under his leadership, the Nova Scotia government spent more than $100 million paving roads, building bridges, extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education. Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> by putting the jobless to work on highway projects. He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character, undermine self-respect and discourage personal initiative. However, he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government could not afford to participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces.

Macdonald was considered one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a <a href="national%20policy">national policy</a> that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a> in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.

Macdonald was a classical liberal in the 19th-century tradition of <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>. He believed in individual freedom and responsibility and feared that the growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty. For him, the role of the state was to provide basic services. He supported public ownership of utilities like the <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Power">Nova Scotia Power Commission</a>, but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies.

Angus Lewis Macdonald was born August 10, 1890, on a small family farm at Dunvegan, <a href="Inverness%20County%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Inverness County</a>, on <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton Island</a>. He was the son of Lewis Macdonald and Veronique "Veronica" Perry, and the ninth child in a family of 14. His mother was from a prominent <a href="Acadians">Acadian</a> family on <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a> and his maternal grandfather was politician <a href="Stanislaus%20Francis%20Perry">Stanislaus Francis Perry</a>. His father's family had emigrated to Cape Breton from the <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> in 1810. The Macdonalds were devout Roman Catholics as well as ardent Liberal Party supporters.

In 1905, when Macdonald was 15, the family moved to the town of Port Hood, Cape Breton. Macdonald attended the Port Hood Academy. He hoped to enroll next in the <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> program at <a href="St%20Francis%20Xavier%20University">St Francis Xavier University</a> in <a href="Antigonish%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Antigonish</a>, but his family couldn't afford to pay for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education. Midway through his university studies, he took another year off to earn money teaching. He completed his final term on credit and was required to teach in the university's high school during 1914–15 to pay off his debt. Macdonald did well at St. FX. He played rugby, joined the debating team, edited the student newspaper and, in his graduating year, won the gold medal in seven of his eight courses. He was also class <a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a>.

The <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out while Macdonald was earning his university degree. In 1915, he underwent military training in the Canadian Officers Training Corps. In February 1916, he joined the 185th battalion, known as the <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Highlanders">Cape Breton Highlanders</a>, leaving for Britain in October 1916 where he received further training. Macdonald was finally sent to the front lines in France in May 1918 as a lieutenant in Nova Scotia's 25th battalion. He participated in heavy fighting and on one occasion led his entire company because all of the other officers had been wounded or killed. Macdonald felt fortunate to have been spared, but his luck ran out in Belgium when he was hit in the neck by a German sniper's bullet on November 7, 1918, just four days before the <a href="Armistice">Armistice</a>. Macdonald spent eight months in Britain recovering from his wound. He returned home to his family in Cape Breton in 1919. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that the war had made him "more serious and less self-confident", but "struck by the willingness of so many to march to horrible deaths in the name of an abstract principle".

In September 1919, the 29-year-old Macdonald began studying at <a href="Dalhousie%20Law%20School">Dalhousie Law School</a> in Halifax. During his two years there, Macdonald formed lifelong friendships with students who were to become members of the political elite in the region. Once again, he excelled in athletics, was elected to the Dalhousie students' council, became the associate editor of the student newspaper and led the opposition in the law school's <a href="Model%20parliament">Mock Parliament</a>. He scored firsts in nearly every course and graduated in 1921 with academic distinction.

Macdonald was hired by the Nova Scotia government as assistant deputy attorney-general immediately after graduating from law school. He worked mainly as an administrator, although he occasionally appeared in court to help the attorney general prosecute a case.

In 1922, Macdonald became a part-time lecturer at the law school. When he left the attorney-general's office in 1924, he became a full-time professor. Macdonald was a popular and effective teacher. One former student describes him sitting at his desk on the rostrum speaking slowly and deliberately while gazing intently at the ceiling. "The more students disagreed (with one another in class) the more Angus encouraged it."

On June 17, 1924, when he was 33, Macdonald married Agnes Foley, a member of a prominent Irish Catholic family. They had worked together in the attorney general's office where Foley served as secretary. Between 1925 and 1936, the Macdonalds would have three daughters and a son. Agnes raised the children and ran the household after Macdonald entered politics. Biographer John Hawkins writes she eventually helped her husband win election in a Halifax <a href="Electoral%20district%20%28Canada%29">riding</a> with a significant Irish Catholic population. She had a large circle of friends including members of the powerful Liberal Women's societies of Halifax. Hawkins also notes that Agnes Macdonald was a gifted hostess who loved conversation. "Quick witted, her rapid and varied flow of language contrasted with Angus L.'s deliberate, thoughtful manner of speaking, which some have described as a 'drawl'."

In 1925–26, while teaching at the Dalhousie Law School, Macdonald took additional courses in law at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> in New York, mainly by correspondence. He used these courses as the basis for full-time graduate work at the <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> in Boston, Massachusetts in 1928. Harvard's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement. That view was reflected in Macdonald's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under <a href="civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil law</a>.

When the deanship of the law school came open in 1929, Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job. He apparently had strong support from several members of the university's board of governors. At the same time however, he was increasingly drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely. In the end, the job was offered to <a href="Sidney%20Earle%20Smith">Sidney Smith</a>, another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school. Macdonald did stay, but only for one more year. In 1930, he resigned so he would be free to enter politics.

The federal election in the summer of 1930 gave the 40-year-old Macdonald a chance to run for office. He decided to contest the riding of <a href="Inverness%20%28electoral%20district%29">Inverness</a> in his native <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton</a>. There he faced a Conservative opponent whose style contrasted sharply with his own cool and reserved manner. According to biographer John Hawkins, <a href="Isaac%20Duncan%20MacDougall">I. D. "Ike" MacDougall</a> "was a gifted performer who before an audience could cut an opponent's well-marshalled arguments until they fell amid roars of laughter. He was the master of hyperbole, pun and high spirits. He could win a rural audience, not by his logic, but by his performance on the platform". Macdonald campaigned hard, but the trend was against him. The Conservatives led by <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a> defeated <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King's</a> unpopular Liberals. And in Inverness, Ike MacDougall was re-elected by the narrow margin of 165 votes. It was to be Macdonald's only election defeat. Afterwards, Macdonald retreated to <a href="Halifax%20%28former%20city%29">Halifax</a> where he opened his own private law office in August 1930.

Macdonald was active in provincial Liberal Party organizational work during the latter part of the 1920s. In 1925, the party had suffered a crushing defeat after 43 years in power. On election day, the Liberals were reduced to three seats in the Nova Scotia legislature. Many believed that the time had come to return the party to its reformist roots. Macdonald worked with other reform-minded members to establish a network of younger Liberals intent on reviving their party.

In the 1928 provincial election, the Liberals regained some of their lost popularity in one of the closest votes in Nova Scotia history. The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">stock market crash</a> of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary school textbooks. It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Confederation</a>.

The convention, held on October 1, 1930, proved to be a turning point both for the party and for Macdonald. In a departure from tradition, the party's new leader would be chosen by convention delegates instead of Liberal <a href="caucus">caucus</a> members at the legislature. Two veterans of Liberal politics, both wealthy businessmen, were contesting the leadership. There was little enthusiasm, however, for either. Just as nominations were about to close, a delegate from <a href="Truro%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Truro</a> rose unexpectedly to nominate Macdonald. Surprised, Macdonald at first declined the nomination, then agreed to accept it when he sensed strong support on the convention floor. A few hours later, the 40-year-old Macdonald had won a resounding first-ballot victory to become the new Liberal leader.

After winning the Liberal leadership, Macdonald travelled the province on speaking tours helping organize party support in every constituency. As Liberal leader, he proved to be an effective platform speaker. According to biographer John Hawkins, Macdonald's "plain talk and simplicity" persuaded audiences of his honesty. He developed the ability to explain political issues with a "clarity that every voter could understand". When the <a href="legislature">legislature</a> was in session, he led the Liberals from the public galleries because he had no seat in the House. There were six vacancies, but the Conservatives refused to call <a href="by-election">by-election</a>s fearing they would lose their five-seat majority. Macdonald publicly criticized <a href="Gordon%20Sidney%20Harrington">Premier Gordon Harrington</a> for depriving so many Nova Scotians of representation. He deplored what he called "the loss of responsible government." It was a message that struck a chord in the province that had been the first in Canada to achieve <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> in 1848 thanks to the efforts of the great liberal Reformer <a href="Joseph%20Howe">Joseph Howe</a>. Privately however, Macdonald rejoiced that the government couldn't risk calling a by-election telling one supporter years later, "If the truth must be told, I was sometimes afraid that they would open up a seat and deprive me of this sort of ammunition".

Macdonald was able to use the theme of responsible government even more effectively during the provincial election campaign of 1933. The governing <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Nova%20Scotia">Conservatives</a>, desperate to avoid electoral defeat, had enacted changes requiring that new voters' lists be drawn up by government-appointed registrars immediately before each election. Predictably, thousands of Liberal voters were left off the lists and the new law allowed only three days for corrections. The Liberals secured a court order requiring the appointment of additional registrars and some of the disenfranchised voters were finally added to the lists. The so-called Franchise Scandal enabled the Liberal press to cast Macdonald as a latter-day Joe Howe, crusading for the rights of the people. "No newcomer to the political scene", writes historian Murray Beck, "has ever become so quickly, widely, and favourably known in such a dramatic fashion". The scandal, compounded by suffering in the province due to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, resulted in Macdonald's Liberals winning 22 of the 30 seats on August 22, 1933. The Conservatives were now associated in the public mind with corruption and hard times. They would not regain power for 23 years.

Macdonald was sworn in as Premier of Nova Scotia on September 5, 1933. He was 43 years old and had never held a seat in the legislature. Historian Murray Beck writes that Macdonald's cabinet was "probably Nova Scotia's strongest". Biographer Stephen Henderson points out that the "ministers were fresh, motivated and knowledgeable about their portfolios", although Macdonald himself had no experience in finance. Biographer John Hawkins characterizes the Liberal party of 1933 as "a party of thinkers and reformers". During the 1930s, Macdonald's Liberals took credit for leading the province out of the depths of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. As journalist Harry Flemming wrote many years later, Macdonald became "God himself", the premier who "paved the roads and put the power into every home from <a href="Cape%20North%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Cape North</a> to <a href="Cape%20Sable%20Island">Cape Sable</a>".
On his first day in office, Macdonald kept a key Liberal promise by bringing in <a href="old%20age%20pension">old age pension</a>s for elderly people in need. Cheques would be mailed out to 6,000 pensioners by the end of March 1934. It was a popular move even though monthly pension payments in Nova Scotia were substantially below the national average.

The economic conditions facing the new government were dismal. Tens of thousands of Nova Scotians were impoverished and unemployed. The government expected that 75,000 Nova Scotians would need assistance during the coming winter. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald sympathized with the poor, but he worried that direct government relief payments would undermine their pride and self-respect. Even though direct relief might be cheaper, the Macdonald government preferred to hire the unemployed for public works projects such as paving roads. Henderson reports that in 1933, there were only of paved roads in the province. By 1937, that figure had risen to 605. The government financed such public works by selling low-interest bonds and raising gasoline taxes from six to eight cents a gallon.

Macdonald also urged the federal Conservative government of <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a> to increase financial support to poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly the responsibility of the provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.

Macdonald tried to deal with the financial imbalances in Confederation by appointing a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>. He asked it to recommend economic policies the province should follow to lessen the effects of the Depression and to lay out a framework for negotiations with the federal government.

The three-man Jones Commission included <a href="Harold%20Innis">Harold Innis</a>, a prominent economic historian who had studied disparities between highly developed manufacturing regions and marginal ones that depended primarily on exploiting natural resources. After touring the province and hearing from more than 200 witnesses, the Commission issued its report in December 1934. Macdonald could take satisfaction in its finding that high tariffs had sheltered central Canadian manufacturing at Nova Scotia's expense and that federal subsidies to the province were "seriously inadequate".

The Commission recommended that the federal government assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial relations. Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of <a href="rural%20electrification">rural electrification</a> to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.

The Macdonald government took practical steps to promote tourism as a way of bringing money into the province. It improved conditions for tourists by granting small loans to hotel, motel and cottage owners to upgrade their facilities. It also offered cooking classes to restaurant and hotel employees. The government's extensive road building program made it easier for tourists to travel. But biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald went well beyond these practical steps to promote Nova Scotia as a beautiful and rustic place peopled by colourful Scots, <a href="Acadians">Acadians</a>, Germans and <a href="Mi%27kmaq%20people">Mi'kmaq</a>. Government advertising portrayed the province "as a place where urban, middle-class families could go to 'step back in time'". Gradually, Henderson maintains, the tourism campaigns created a new identity for Nova Scotians. "They witnessed the provincial state constructing an elaborate network of modern roads; they read books and brochures extolling the beauty of the province, and they heard their premier waxing romantically about the pure, simple nobility of their ancestors." Macdonald was especially enthusiastic about "the romanticized culture of the Highland Scots". Historian Ian McKay writes that under his leadership, the provincial government gave money to the Gaelic College; bestowed Scottish names on key tourism sites and stationed "a brawny Scots piper" at the border with <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a>. Macdonald also helped assemble more than a quarter of a million acres (4,000 km) for the <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Highlands%20National%20Park">Cape Breton Highlands National Park</a> complete with a fancy resort hotel and world-class golf course. "Macdonald believed", Henderson writes, "he had created a piece of Scotland for tourists in the New World". And, as more tourists came, Macdonald's stature grew.

The Nova Scotia legislature recognized the growing power of <a href="industrial%20unionism">industrial unions</a> in the 1930s by passing what historian Stephen Henderson calls "Canada's first piece of modern labour legislation". Although Macdonald's governing Liberals and the opposition Conservatives agreed on the need to protect union rights, the parties vied with each other to take credit for the Trade Union Act. In January 1937, Premier Macdonald carried a bottle of bootleg rum to a meeting with union officials in Sydney, Cape Breton where they gave him a draft bill based on the American <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Act">National Labor Relations Act</a>. Before the Macdonald government could introduce the bill in the legislature, the Conservatives presented a similar one of their own. The legislation faced opposition from the Canadian Manufacturers' Association during public hearings, but Liberals and Conservatives combined to pass it unanimously. The new Trade Union Act required employers to bargain with any union chosen by a majority of their employees. It also prohibited employers from firing workers for organizing a union.

Nova Scotia's well-entrenched system of paying off government supporters with jobs and contracts continued to flourish under the Macdonald Liberals. In his comprehensive history of Canadian patronage, journalist Jeffrey Simpson writes that the Liberals used road improvements to win votes, with highway crews "especially busy before and during election campaigns." Simpson adds that the Liberals awarded government contracts to companies approved by the party. In return, the firms were required to kickback some of the money they received to the Liberals. Biographer Stephen Henderson argues that Macdonald himself did not relish the traditional practice of filling government jobs with party supporters. Nevertheless, the "wave of partisan hirings and firings" continued as committees in each riding "scrutinized employees for inappropriate political activity and rated prospective candidates based on what they or their families had done for the Liberal party".

Fortunately for the Macdonald government, economic conditions improved during the 1930s. In March 1937, Macdonald announced that after 14 years of running operating deficits, the Nova Scotia government had recorded a surplus with another forecast for the next year. The pro-Liberal "Halifax Chronicle" gleefully described the scene in the legislature: "the House sat for a moment, as if not comprehending the good news, then rocked with acclaim, at least the Government side of the House did, though the opposition, stilled and stunned-like, sat like figures carved in stone". Macdonald promised the government would spend another $7.5 million on its popular road paving program overseen by <a href="Alexander%20Stirling%20MacMillan">A. S. MacMillan</a>, the veteran Minister of Highways. MacMillan, also Chairman of the <a href="Nova%20Scotia%20Power">Nova Scotia Power Commission</a>, had been extending electrical service into rural areas. He now introduced a rural electrification bill designed to subsidize the cost of providing electricity.

After these preparations, the premier called a provincial election for June 29, 1937. Macdonald campaigned on his government's record. On election day, his Liberals were rewarded with 25 of the 30 seats in the legislature.

Prime Minister <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a> had invited Macdonald to run for federal office during the general election of 1935. Although Macdonald turned him down, there were strong rumours in 1937 that Macdonald would soon enter federal politics. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes however, that Macdonald wanted to remain as premier so he could present Nova Scotia's case to a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> on federal-provincial relations.

The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring weaknesses in federal-provincial financial arrangements. Canada's poorer provinces found it impossible to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief. By 1937, conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> and <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> faced bankruptcy. Finally, in August 1937, Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, popularly known as the <a href="Rowell-Sirois%20Commission">Rowell-Sirois Commission</a>. According to biographer Stephen Henderson, Macdonald played an important role in shaping the Commission's final recommendations.

Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's submission and presented it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He called on the federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>es and <a href="succession%20duty">succession duties</a> to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a>es. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.

A central part of Macdonald's case concerned the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones. His argument was based on the premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them. Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer, less-populated provinces be based on need, not population, so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation.

The Commission's final report, released in May 1940, reflected many of Macdonald's recommendations. Mackenzie King called a federal-provincial conference in January 1941 to discuss the report. The provinces failed to agree on what should be done, but in April, the federal government went ahead on its own announcing it would levy steep taxes on personal and corporate incomes as a temporary measure to finance Canada's participation in the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>.

The course of Macdonald's political career changed sharply after Canada declared war on Germany in September 1939. Three months later, Mackenzie King called a federal election and on March 26, 1940, his Liberals won a decisive victory. In spite of his victory, King was under pressure to recruit the country's "best brains" into his wartime cabinet. The death of his minister of defence in an air crash in June 1940 gave King an opportunity to reorganize his administration. He asked <a href="James%20Ralston">J. L. Ralston</a>, a native Nova Scotian, to become his new minister of defence. Ralston agreed but imposed two conditions: First that <a href="James%20Lorimer%20Ilsley">J. L. Ilsley</a> of Nova Scotia replace him as minister of finance and second that he get assistance in his new portfolio.

King decided to appoint two additional ministers, one in charge of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a>, the other to oversee the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a>. He therefore, asked Macdonald to join the federal cabinet as minister of national defence for naval services. Macdonald, who had fought in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> as a soldier on the front lines in France and Belgium, decided it was his duty to fight <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> as a political leader in Ottawa. He handed over his responsibilities as premier to <a href="Alexander%20Stirling%20MacMillan">A. S. MacMillan</a> and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12, 1940.

Macdonald's five years in Ottawa were tumultuous ones. He oversaw a massive increase in Canada's naval forces and played a key role in a political crisis that threatened to tear the Liberal government and the country apart. He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King, a political leader whom Macdonald grew to loathe. When he entered the federal cabinet in 1940, Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself. By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald's federal political career was in tatters.

Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald to stand for a vacant seat in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston, Ontario</a>. It was a traditional Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir <a href="John%20A.%20Macdonald">John A. Macdonald</a>, Canada's first prime minister. In 1935 however, the riding had switched to the Liberals and King wanted to keep it. "I told Mr. King that I did not know Kingston at all, nor its problems, nor its people", Macdonald wrote later. When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however, Macdonald had no choice but to stand for office in Kingston. He won the seat by acclamation on August 12, 1940.

Macdonald faced a huge, but critical task in overseeing the expansion of the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). As historian Desmond Morton points out, the RCN was tiny when Canada entered the war in 1939. It consisted of six destroyers, five minesweepers and about 3,000 personnel in its regular forces and volunteer reserves. By the time Macdonald took office in 1940, the RCN had grown to 100 ships and more than 7,000 personnel, but as biographer Stephen Henderson notes, "few of its ships and sailors were ready for service at sea". By the end of the war, the RCN had expanded by 50 times its original strength with about 400 fighting ships, almost 500 additional craft and about 96,000 men and women.

The RCN was assigned the task of escorting supply vessels transporting food and other materials needed to keep the war going. This <a href="convoy">convoy</a> duty was critically important as German submarines or <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s sought to starve Britain into submission by sinking supply ships. The RCN performed about 40 percent of the war's transatlantic <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> escort duty. Desmond Morton argues it was Canada's "most decisive" military contribution. Canada's convoy protection efforts did not always run smoothly, however. In the early part of the war, the Canadian navy lacked equipment that could detect underwater submarines as well as efficient radar for sighting ones on the surface. To make matters worse, Canada didn't have the long-range aircraft that were the most effective anti-submarine weapons.

As supply ship losses mounted, the RCN struggled to catch up to the better-equipped British and American navies. Macdonald himself lacked military expertise and often depended on senior naval staff who kept him in the dark about equipment shortages and other problems. "Macdonald's administration of Naval Affairs did not rise to brilliance", Henderson writes, "[but] the problem may have lain more with the senior naval staff than with Macdonald". Macdonald's conflict with high ranking naval officers, particularly <a href="Percy%20W.%20Nelles">Rear Admiral Percy W. Nelles</a>, led to the effective dismissal of the latter in 1944. Yet, as the war progressed, the RCN, led by Macdonald, gradually became more effective in protecting the huge cargoes of materials on which Allied victory depended.

Biographer Stephen Henderson maintains that Macdonald played a key role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized that in the early years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.

Nevertheless, Macdonald continued to push the government to commit itself to conscription if circumstances should change. His position earned him the enmity of the politically cautious Mackenzie King. "Macdonald is a very vain man", the prime minister complained in his diary, "and has an exceptional opinion of himself. Undoubtedly, he came here expecting to possibly lead the Liberal party later on but has found that he will not be able to command the following that he expected".

As the opposition Conservatives continued to press for overseas conscription, the King government held a national <a href="plebiscite">plebiscite</a> on April 27, 1942. The plebiscite asked voters to release the government from its previous promise not to introduce compulsory war service. The results confirmed the sharp national split. English Canada voted strongly in favour and French Canada overwhelmingly against. The results of the plebiscite seemed to strengthen the position of ministers who supported conscription. Macdonald's two cabinet colleagues from Nova Scotia, defence minister <a href="James%20Ralston">J. L. Ralston</a>, and finance minister <a href="James%20Lorimer%20Ilsley">J. L. Ilsley</a>, urged the government to introduce conscription immediately. A more cautious Macdonald wanted the government to commit itself to conscription should it be required to support the war effort. 
The crisis flared again two years later when the Canadian military called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead he sat in his chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would have resigned too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.

In the end, King was forced to impose overseas conscription after the failure of the voluntary recruitment campaign, but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed. The conscription crisis however, hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister. Macdonald, disillusioned by what he saw as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics, longed to return to Nova Scotia. After King called an election for June 11, 1945, Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet.

When Macdonald returned to Nova Scotia in 1945, he was only 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20 years older. After the retirement of Premier <a href="Alexander%20Stirling%20MacMillan">A. S. MacMillan</a>, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives for the first time since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Canada%29">New Democratic Party</a>, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.

Nevertheless, Macdonald plunged into his role as a leading champion for the provinces. He argued that in order to maintain their independence, provinces needed exclusive jurisdiction over such sources of revenue as gasoline, electricity and amusement taxes. He lobbied for constitutional amendments designed to guarantee provincial rights. Macdonald urged the federal government to accept the 1940 recommendations of the <a href="Rowell-Sirois%20Commission">Rowell-Sirois Commission</a> and redistribute national wealth based on need. Such a policy, he maintained, would enable poorer provinces to sustain government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation. In the end, Macdonald won only small victories such as gaining exclusive provincial access to gasoline taxes. The federal government refused to recognize financial need as the basis for provincial subsidies.

Aside from his role as a national spokesman for provincial rights, Macdonald presided over an administration that invested heavily in education. His government financed the building of rural high schools and extended financial assistance to <a href="Dalhousie%20University">Dalhousie University</a>'s schools of medicine and law. Macdonald also appointed Nova Scotia's first minister of education, <a href="Henry%20Hicks%20%28Nova%20Scotia%20politician%29">Henry Hicks</a>, in 1949 to oversee $7.6 million in spending, about a fifth of the provincial budget.

The Macdonald Liberals easily won re-election in 1949 and 1953, but the Conservatives made steady gains under <a href="Robert%20Stanfield">Robert Stanfield</a>, their new leader. The Conservatives for example, drew attention to kickback schemes under which brewing companies, wineries and distilleries contributed to the Liberal party in exchange for the right to sell their products in government liquor stores. The Liberals seemed secure against such allegations however, as long as they were led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald. However, Macdonald suffered a slight <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> on April 11, 1954, and was admitted to hospital where he died in his sleep two nights later, just four months before his 64th birthday.

Stephen Henderson writes that the Nova Scotia legislature sat on the day of his death. Macdonald's seat was draped in Clanranald <a href="tartan">tartan</a> and a sprig of <a href="Ericaceae">heather</a> decorated his desk. Macdonald's body lay in state for three days in the legislative building as more than 100,000 people filed past to pay their respects.

Macdonald's death proved disastrous for provincial Liberals. There was no obvious successor to the popular premier. At the party's leadership convention held on September 9, 1954, the Liberals appeared badly split along religious lines. After five ballots, the convention rejected <a href="Harold%20Connolly">Harold Connolly</a>, a Roman Catholic who had served as interim premier after Macdonald's death. Instead they chose the Protestant <a href="Henry%20Hicks%20%28Nova%20Scotia%20politician%29">Henry Hicks</a>. "Unfortunately for the Liberals", historian Murray Beck writes, "it appeared as if the delegates had ganged up to defeat the only Catholic among the contestants". Beck also notes that "Nova Scotia governments have always been most vulnerable after a change in leadership". In the next provincial election held on October 30, 1956, <a href="Robert%20Stanfield">Robert Stanfield</a> and his Conservatives won 24 seats, the Liberals 18. The 23-year Liberal era, begun under Macdonald's leadership, had finally ended.

Murray Beck writes that Macdonald's political appeal to Nova Scotians may have been even stronger than the legendary <a href="Joseph%20Howe">Joseph Howe</a>'s. Like Howe, Macdonald was a passionate and eloquent leader whose elegantly crafted speeches reflected his wit, wide learning and respect for factual accuracy. Beck writes that by scrupulously fulfilling his campaign promises, Macdonald became known as a leader who always kept his word.
Macdonald's reputation as the premier who led the province out of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> rested on his commitment to ambitious government projects such as highway construction and rural electrification. He continued to support highway improvements throughout his career. Two projects that he pushed especially hard for, the <a href="Canso%20Causeway">Canso Causeway</a> linking Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and a <a href="Angus%20L.%20Macdonald%20Bridge">suspension bridge</a> spanning <a href="Halifax%20Harbour">Halifax Harbour</a> were completed after his death. The bridge, named in his honour, made it possible to travel between <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a> and <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Dartmouth</a> without having to board a ferry or drive several kilometres around the <a href="Bedford%20Basin">Bedford Basin</a>.

Macdonald consistently called for a more equitable redistribution of wealth, so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia, could share fully in Canada's prosperity. Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction, in 1957, of an <a href="equalization%20payments">equalization scheme</a> designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens. Macdonald's advocacy of provincial autonomy however, fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post-war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs.

Throughout his life, Macdonald maintained ties to his alma mater, <a href="St.%20Francis%20Xavier%20University">St. Francis Xavier University</a>. He received an honorary doctor of laws degree from St. FX in 1946. He served as honorary chair and fundraiser for the university's centennial celebrations in 1953 and raised money to support student research into the early history of the Scots in Nova Scotia. Macdonald suggested that the reading room in a new university library be called the "Hall of the Clans". St. FX adopted the idea and decided to name the library in his honour. Thus, when the Angus L. Macdonald Library officially opened on July 17, 1965, 50 coats of arms representing both Scottish and Irish clans adorned the walls of its reading room.

Stan Coveleski

Stanley Anthony Coveleski (born Stanislaus Kowalewski, July 13, 1889 – March 20, 1984) was an American <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> during the 1910s and 1920s who primarily threw the <a href="spitball">spitball</a>. In 14 seasons in the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL), Coveleski pitched for the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. In 450 career games, Coveleski pitched 3,082 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a> and posted a <a href="win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a> of 215–142, with 224 <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a>s, 38 <a href="shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a>s, and a 2.89 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA). He was inducted into the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1969.

Born in <a href="Shamokin%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shamokin, Pennsylvania</a>, Coveleski began playing professional baseball in 1908, following in the footsteps of his brother, <a href="Harry%20Coveleski">Harry Coveleski</a>. He played mostly for the <a href="Lancaster%20Red%20Roses">Lancaster Red Roses</a> until he made his major league debut with the Athletics in 1912. Following three more seasons in the minor leagues, he stayed in the major leagues after signing with the Indians in 1916. During his nine seasons with the Indians, his accomplishments included winning three games during the <a href="1920%20World%20Series">1920 World Series</a>.

After his time with the Indians ended, Coveleski spent three seasons with the Senators and one with the Yankees before retiring after the 1928 season. He retired to <a href="South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana">South Bend, Indiana</a>, where he died in 1984. A <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a>, Coveleski specialized in throwing the spitball, a pitch where the ball is altered with a foreign substance such as chewing tobacco. It was legal when his career began and outlawed in 1920, but he was one of 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the pitch.

Stanislaus Anthony Kowalewski was the youngest of five baseball-playing brothers in the coal-mining community of <a href="Shamokin%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shamokin, Pennsylvania</a> in <a href="Northumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland County</a>, east of the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a> and northeast of the state capital of <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a>. His oldest brother Jacob died serving in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> (1898); his other brothers Frank and John also played professional baseball, but only in the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor leagues</a> and never reached the major leagues. His older brother, <a href="Harry%20Coveleski">Harry Coveleski</a> (1886-1950), later won 20 games in a season on three occasions during his 14 years <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">major league</a> career.

Like many his age in the Shamokin area, Coveleski began work as a "<a href="breaker%20boy">breaker boy</a>" at a local <a href="Coal%20mining">colliery</a> at the age of 12. In return for 72 hours of labor per week, Coveleski received $3.75, or about five cents an hour. "There was nothing strange in those days about a twelve-year-old Polish kid working in the mines for 72 hours a week at a nickel an hour", he later recalled. "What was strange is that I ever got out of there". Coveleski was rarely able to play baseball as a child due to his work schedule.

Nevertheless, he worked on his pitching skills during the evenings, when he threw stones at a tin can placed 50 feet away. When he was 18 years old, Coveleski's abilities caught the attention of the local semi-professional ball club, which invited him to pitch for them. "When it came to throwing a baseball, why it was easy to pitch", Coveleski recalled. "After all, the plate's a lot bigger than a tin can to throw at". His baseball career in Shamokin was short-lived; after five games, Coveleski relocated to <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster, Pennsylvania</a>.

Coveleski signed his first professional contract in 1909 with the minor league <a href="Lancaster%20Red%20Roses">Lancaster Red Roses</a>, a club affiliated with the <a href="Tri-State%20League">Tri-State League</a>. Originally reluctant to sign for the club, he only agreed to do so if his older brother John also joined; at that time he <a href="anglicized">anglicized</a> his name, changing it to Coveleskie, which it would remain throughout his professional career. During his first trip to Lancaster, he recalled that it was "the first time I ever rode on a train", and he added that he "was too shy to eat in the hotel with the rest of the team". In 272 innings of work his first season, Coveleski had a 23–11 win-loss record with an <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> of 1.95. He pitched two more seasons for Lancaster, earning a record of 53–38 in 109 appearances through three seasons.
In 1912, he pitched for the relocated Lancaster team, the <a href="Atlantic%20City%20Lanks">Atlantic City Lanks</a>, where he had a 20–14 record with a 2.53 ERA in 40 appearances, 30 of them starts. In September 1912, manager <a href="Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a> signed him to a contract with the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a> and brought him to the major leagues, where he made his debut for the Athletics on September 10. Coveleski pitched in five games for the Athletics that season, starting two of them and finishing the season with a 2–1 record and a 3.43 ERA. After the season ended, Mack felt that Coveleski needed more seasoning, and sent him to the <a href="Spokane%20Indians">Spokane Indians</a> of the <a href="Northwestern%20League">Northwestern League</a>. Coveleski finished the 1913 season with a 17–20 record and a 2.82 ERA. Around that time, he married Mary Stivetts, and the following season he went 20–15, pitched over 300 innings, and led the league in strikeouts.

At the time of his debut, the Philadelphia club retained several talented pitchers, including <a href="Eddie%20Plank">Eddie Plank</a>, <a href="Chief%20Bender">Chief Bender</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Coombs">Jack Coombs</a>. Coveleski admitted that he "[didn't] know if I could have beat them out for a spot in the rotation." After the 1914 season, the <a href="Portland%20Beavers">Portland Beavers</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a> wanted Coveleski, and traded five players to Spokane to acquire him. While Connie Mack had an agreement with Spokane that Coveleski would be promoted after playing there for a time, the Athletics fell under new ownership in 1913 and lost control of him due to the Athletics' rights expiring. Coveleski spent his time in Portland learning to throw the <a href="spitball">spitball</a>; originally using chewing tobacco, he later used <a href="alum">alum</a>. In his lone season with Portland, he won and lost 17 games, and had a 2.67 ERA. After the season ended, the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> purchased Coveleski from Portland, and he joined the major league squad in 1916.

When Coveleski was brought up to the majors, the original intention was to use him as a <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief pitcher</a>. Due to an injury to <a href="Ed%20Klepfer">Ed Klepfer</a>, the Indians used him as a starter early on in the season, and kept him in the role when he performed well. He was scheduled to pitch in the first week of the season against his brother Harry, but the matchup never took place at Harry's behest. Coveleski fought health problems during the season, suffering from tonsillitis in the middle of the year and pitching one game with a fever of . He finished the season with a 15–13 record and a 3.41 ERA in 45 games, 27 of them starts. Coveleski had lost 10 pounds due to illness during 1916, but recovered during the offseason, gained 20 pounds, and appeared healthier by the time the season began.
Coveleski's status as the <a href="ace%20%28baseball%29">ace</a> of the staff was demonstrated when he was named the starter for <a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a> of the <a href="1917%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1917 season</a>; he beat the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> 6–4 on April 11. He improved statistically during the 1917 season, winning 19 games and losing 14 with an ERA of 1.81 and a career high 133 strikeouts. On September 19, Coveleski pitched a <a href="one-hitter%20%28baseball%29">one-hitter</a> against the New York Yankees; the only hit came from <a href="Fritz%20Maisel">Fritz Maisel</a> in the seventh inning. Coveleski continued to improve during the war-shortened <a href="1918%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1918 season</a>. His outings that year included pitching a complete game against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, where he pitched 19 innings, allowing two runs as the Indians won, 3–2. He finished the season with a 22–13 record, a 1.82 ERA, and 311 innings pitched in 38 games, 33 of them starts; his wins and ERA were both second in the American League to <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>. In 1919, Coveleski pitched in 43 games, starting 34, and had a 24–12 record and an ERA of 2.61.

At the beginning of the <a href="1920%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1920 season</a>, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was <a href="grandfather%20clause">grandfathered</a> in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28, his wife died suddenly, and he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. Nearly three months later, he was the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on August 16. In the game, Coveleski hit a <a href="sacrifice%20fly">sacrifice fly</a> to help the Indians win, 4–3, but it was best remembered as the game where Yankees pitcher <a href="Carl%20Mays">Carl Mays</a> hit <a href="Ray%20Chapman">Ray Chapman</a>, leading to the only death in MLB history from a pitch. He finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to <a href="Bob%20Shawkey">Bob Shawkey</a>.

Coveleski's helped the Indians to win the <a href="List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners">AL pennant</a> and play in the <a href="1920%20World%20Series">1920 World Series</a> against the <a href="Brooklyn%20Robins">Brooklyn Robins</a>. Coveleski was the star of the 1920 World Series, in which he pitched three complete game victories. He pitched the first game against <a href="Rube%20Marquard">Rube Marquard</a>, and allowed one run and five hits in a 3–1 Cleveland victory. Four days later, he pitched game four, again allowing one run and five hits in a 5–1 win. In game seven, the final one of the series, Coveleski threw a complete game <a href="shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a> with five hits against fellow spitballer <a href="Burleigh%20Grimes">Burleigh Grimes</a>; the 3–0 victory gave the Indians the first World Series championship in franchise history. Coveleski had an ERA of 0.67, which remains a World Series record.

After spending the offseason hunting with <a href="Smoky%20Joe%20Wood">Smoky Joe Wood</a>, Coveleski returned to the Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees to move out of first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, the first time since 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.

Early on in the <a href="1923%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1923 season</a>, Coveleski pitched 27 straight scoreless innings, winning three consecutive games during that time. However, he won less frequently as the season wore on, losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished the season with a 13–14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite that, he had an ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, and at the end of May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. By the end of the season, he had a 15–16 record and a 4.04 ERA. In December 1924, after nine years pitching for Cleveland, Coveleski was traded to the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> for pitcher <a href="By%20Speece">By Speece</a> and outfielder <a href="Carr%20Smith">Carr Smith</a>.

Despite Coveleski's success in Cleveland, he was not a fan of playing there; he stated that he "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." He also stated that it began to affect his performance on the mound, and that he began to get "lazy" from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: "The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to <a href="Steve%20O%27Neill">Steve O'Neill</a>. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".

Due to the acquisition of Coveleski, combined with winning the <a href="1924%20World%20Series">1924 World Series</a>, the Washington Senators were considered favorites to win the AL in 1925. During his first season in Washington, Coveleski bounced back from his <a href="1924%20Cleveland%20Indians%20season">1924 season</a>, and by mid-July, critics regarded his success as the biggest surprise in baseball; Cleveland considered him to be past his best. He won 20 games and lost five that year, and his ERA of 2.84 led the AL. Coveleski also finished 12th in MVP voting that year. The Senators won the AL and were to face the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in the <a href="1925%20World%20Series">1925 World Series</a>, but Coveleski suffered from sore back muscles late in the season. Coveleski pitched two games in the World Series. In game two, he faced <a href="Vic%20Aldridge">Vic Aldridge</a> in a pitcher's duel; the teams were tied at one apiece in the eighth inning, but a Pittsburgh home run led to a 3–2 loss. Aldridge and Coveleski faced off again in game five, and Coveleski allowed four runs in under seven innings, leading to a 6–3 Pirates win. The Senators lost the series in seven games, and he finished with a 3.77 ERA, five walks, three strikeouts, and two of the Senators' four losses.

Coveleski continued to pitch for Washington during the <a href="1926%20Washington%20Senators%20season">1926 season</a>. His performances that season included a 2–0 victory against the Boston Red Sox on August 31, in which the game was finished in only 78 minutes. Coveleski finished the season with 14 wins, 11 losses, 3 shutouts, and a 3.12 ERA in 36 games. To start the <a href="1927%20Washington%20Senators%20season">1927 season</a>, due to an injury to Walter Johnson, Coveleski became the <a href="List%20of%20Washington%20Senators%20Opening%20Day%20starting%20pitchers">Senators' Opening Day starter</a> against the Red Sox; he won the game 6–2. However, his performance declined due to "a chronically sore arm", which limited his playing time that season. Due to his sore arm, the Senators released him unconditionally on June 17, 1927. He finished the season with a 2–1 record and a 3.14 ERA in five games.

On December 21, 1927, Coveleski signed with the New York Yankees in an attempt at a comeback. In his final season, he posted a 5–1 record with a 5.74 ERA in 12 appearances. Coveleski failed to regain his form, however, pitching his last game on August 3, and after the signing of <a href="Tom%20Zachary">Tom Zachary</a>, manager <a href="Miller%20Huggins">Miller Huggins</a> released Coveleski. He retired from the game later that year.

In 1929, after leaving major league baseball, Coveleski relocated to <a href="South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana">South Bend, Indiana</a>. There, he ran Coveleski Service Station for a time, but closed the business during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. He became a popular member of the community in South Bend, providing free pitching lessons to local youths in a field behind his garage. After his playing career ended, he dropped the "e" at the end of his name, as he never corrected anyone if his last name was incorrectly spelled. In 1969, Coveleski was named to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> by the Veterans' Committee alongside 1920s pitcher <a href="Waite%20Hoyt">Waite Hoyt</a>. Of his introduction into the Hall he said, "I figured I'd make it sooner or later, and I just kept hoping each year would be the one." His health declined in later years, and he was eventually admitted to a local nursing home, where he died on March 20, 1984 at the age of 94.

In addition to Coveleski's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the <a href="National%20Polish-American%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 1976. In 1984, the <a href="Stanley%20Coveleski%20Regional%20Stadium">minor league baseball stadium</a> in South Bend, Indiana, was named in his honor. Coveleski was interviewed by <a href="Lawrence%20Ritter">Lawrence Ritter</a> for his 1966 book "<a href="The%20Glory%20of%20Their%20Times">The Glory of Their Times</a>", a series of interviews with players of the early 20th century. To fellow ballplayers, Coveleski was considered "taciturn and ornery" on days when he was scheduled to pitch, but was otherwise friendly with a lively sense of humor.

Coveleski had 216 wins and 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts in a 14-year career. He had 224 <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a>s, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, and it was not unusual for him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a hit or a strike. In 2001, baseball statistician <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.

Guy Burgess

Guy Francis de Moncy Burgess (16 April 1911 – 30 August 1963) was a British diplomat and <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> agent, belonging to the <a href="Cambridge%20Five">Cambridge Five</a> spy ring that operated from the mid-1930s to the early years of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. His defection in 1951 to the Soviet Union, with his fellow spy, <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Donald Maclean</a>, led to a serious breach in <a href="Special%20Relationship%23Intelligence%20sharing">Anglo-American intelligence co-operation</a>, and caused long-lasting disruption and demoralisation in Britain's foreign and diplomatic services.

Born into a wealthy middle-class family, Burgess was educated at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, the <a href="Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College">Royal Naval College, Dartmouth</a> and <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. An assiduous networker, he embraced left-wing politics at Cambridge and joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a>. He was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935, on the recommendation of the future <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a> <a href="Kim%20Philby">Kim Philby</a>. After leaving Cambridge, Burgess worked for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> as a producer, briefly interrupted by a short period as a full-time <a href="MI6">MI6</a> intelligence officer, before joining the <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a> in 1944.

At the Foreign Office, Burgess acted as a confidential secretary to <a href="Hector%20McNeil">Hector McNeil</a>, the deputy to <a href="Ernest%20Bevin">Ernest Bevin</a>, the <a href="Foreign%20Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>. This post gave Burgess access to secret information on all aspects of Britain's foreign policy during the critical post-1945 period, and it is estimated that he passed thousands of documents to his Soviet controllers. In 1950, he was appointed second secretary to the <a href="Embassy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">British Embassy in Washington</a>, a post from which he was sent home after repeated misbehaviour. Although not at this stage under suspicion, Burgess nevertheless accompanied Maclean when the latter, on the point of being unmasked, fled to Moscow in May 1951.

Burgess's whereabouts were unknown in the West until 1956, when he appeared with Maclean at a brief press conference in Moscow, claiming that his motive had been to improve Soviet-West relations. He never left the Soviet Union; he was often visited by friends and journalists from Britain, most of whom reported on a lonely and empty existence. He remained unrepentant to the end of his life, rejecting the notion that his earlier activities represented treason. He was well provided for materially, but as a result of his lifestyle his health deteriorated, and he died in 1963. Experts have found it difficult to assess the extent of damage caused by Burgess's espionage activities, but consider that the disruption in Anglo-American relations caused by his defection was perhaps of greater value to the Soviets than any information he provided. Burgess's life has frequently been fictionalised, and dramatised in productions for screen and stage.

The Burgess family's English roots can be traced to the arrival in Britain in 1592 of Abraham de Bourgeous de Chantilly, a refugee from the <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> religious persecutions in France. The family settled in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, and became prosperous, mainly as bankers. Later generations developed a military tradition; Guy Burgess's grandfather, Henry Miles Burgess, was an officer in the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> whose main service was in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. His youngest son, Malcolm Kingsford de Moncy Burgess, was born in <a href="Aden">Aden</a> in 1881, the third forename being a nod to his Huguenot ancestry. Malcolm had a generally unremarkable career in the Royal Navy, eventually reaching the rank of <a href="Commander%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Commander</a>. In 1907, he married Evelyn Gillman, the daughter of a wealthy <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> banker. The couple settled in the naval town of <a href="Devonport%2C%20Plymouth">Devonport</a> where, on 16 April 1911, their elder son was born, christened Guy Francis de Moncy. A second son, Nigel, was born two years later.

The Gillman wealth ensured a comfortable home for the young family. Guy's earliest schooling was probably with a governess until, aged nine, he began as a <a href="Boarding%20school">boarder</a> at <a href="Lockers%20Park%20School">Lockers Park</a>, an exclusive <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">preparatory school</a> near <a href="Hemel%20Hempstead">Hemel Hempstead</a> in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. He did well there; his grades were consistently good and he played for the school's <a href="association%20football">association football</a> team. Having completed the Lockers curriculum a year early, he was too young to proceed immediately, as intended, to the <a href="Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College">Royal Naval College</a> at <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Devon">Dartmouth</a>. Instead, from January 1924, he spent a year at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a>, Britain's most prestigious <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public school</a>.

Following Malcom Burgess's retirement from the navy, the family moved to <a href="West%20Meon">West Meon</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>. Here, on 15 September 1924, Malcolm died suddenly of a heart attack. Despite this traumatic event, Guy's education proceeded as planned, and in January 1925 he began at Dartmouth. Here he encountered strict discipline and insistence on order and conformity, enforced by frequent use of <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> even for minor infringements. In this environment, Burgess thrived both academically and at sports. He was marked by the college authorities as "excellent officer material", but an eye test in 1927 exposed a deficiency that precluded a career in the navy's executive branch. Burgess had no interest in the available alternatives – the engineering or <a href="Supply%20officer%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">paymaster</a> branches – and in July 1927 he left Dartmouth and returned to Eton.

Burgess's second period at Eton, between 1927 and 1930, was largely rewarding and successful, both academically and socially. Although he failed to be elected to the elite society known as <a href="Eton%20College%23Prefects">"Pop"</a>, he began to develop a network of contacts that would prove useful in later life. At Eton, sexual relationships between boys were common, and although Burgess would claim that his homosexuality began at Eton, his contemporaries could recall little evidence of this. Generally, Burgess was remembered as amusingly flamboyant, and something of an oddity with his professed left-wing social and political opinions. In January 1930, he sat for and won a history scholarship to <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, concluding his school career with further prizes in history and drawing. Throughout his life he retained fond memories of Eton; according to his biographers Stewart Purvis and Jeff Hulbert he "never showed any embarrassment that he had been educated in a citadel of educational privilege".

Burgess arrived in Cambridge in October 1930 and quickly involved himself in many aspects of student life. He was not universally liked; one contemporary described him as "a conceited unreliable shit", although others found him amusing and good company. After a term, he was elected to the Trinity Historical Society whose membership was formed from the brightest of Trinity College undergraduates and postgraduates. Here he encountered <a href="Kim%20Philby">Kim Philby</a>, and also Jim Lees, a former miner studying under a trade union scholarship, whose working-class perspective Burgess found stimulating. In June 1931, Burgess designed the <a href="Set%20construction">stage sets</a> for a student production of <a href="Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>'s play "<a href="Captain%20Brassbound%27s%20Conversion">Captain Brassbound's Conversion</a>", with <a href="Michael%20Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a> in the leading role. Redgrave considered Burgess "one of the bright stars of the university scene, with a reputation for being able to turn to anything".

Burgess by this time made no attempt to conceal his homosexuality. In 1931, he met <a href="Anthony%20Blunt">Anthony Blunt</a>, four years his senior and a Trinity postgraduate. The two shared artistic interests and became friends, possibly lovers. Blunt was a member of the intellectual society known as the <a href="Cambridge%20Apostles">"Apostles"</a>, to which in 1932 he secured Burgess's election. This gave Burgess a greatly extended range of networking opportunities; membership of the Apostles was lifelong, so at the regular meetings he met many of the leading intellectuals of the day, such as <a href="G.%20M.%20Trevelyan">G. M. Trevelyan</a>, the University's <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20History%20%28Cambridge%29">Regius Professor of History</a>, the writer <a href="E.%20M.%20Forster">E. M. Forster</a>, and the economist <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>.

In the early 1930s, the general political climate was volatile and threatening. In Britain, the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23National%20Government">financial crisis of 1931</a> pointed to the failure of capitalism, while in Germany the rise of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> was a source of increasing disquiet. Such events radicalised opinion in Cambridge and elsewhere; according to Burgess's fellow Trinity student <a href="James%20Klugmann">James Klugmann</a>, "Life seemed to demonstrate the total bankruptcy of the capitalist system and shouted aloud for some sort of quick, rational, simple alternative". Burgess's interest in <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, initiated by friends such as Lees, deepened after he heard the historian <a href="Maurice%20Dobb">Maurice Dobb</a>, a fellow of <a href="Pembroke%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Pembroke College</a>, address the Trinity Historical Society on the issue of "Communism: a Political and Historical Theory". Another influence was a fellow student, <a href="David%20Guest%20%28communist%29">David Guest</a>, a leading light in the Cambridge University Socialist Society (CUSS), within which he formed the university's first active communist cell. Under Guest's influence, Burgess began studying the works of <a href="Karl%20Marx">Marx</a> and <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Lenin</a>.

Amid these political distractions, in 1932, Burgess obtained <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification%23Variations%20of%20first-class%20honours">first-class honours</a> in Part I of the history <a href="Tripos">Tripos</a> and was expected to graduate with similar honours in Part II the following year. But although he worked hard, political activity distracted him and by the time of his final examinations in 1933 he was unprepared. During his examinations he fell ill and was unable to complete his papers; this may have been the consequence of belated cramming, or of taking <a href="amphetamines">amphetamines</a>. The examiners awarded him an <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification%23Aegrotat">"aegrotat"</a>, an unclassified degree awarded to students considered worthy of honours but prevented through illness from completing their examinations.

Despite his disappointing degree result, Burgess returned to Cambridge in October 1933 as a postgraduate student. His chosen research area was "Bourgeois Revolution in Seventeenth-Century England", but much of his time was devoted to political activism. That winter he formally joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> and became a member of its cell within CUSS. On 11 November 1933, he joined a mass demonstration against the perceived militarism of the city's <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> celebrations. The protestors' objective, laying a wreath bearing a pacifist message at the <a href="Cambridge%20War%20Memorial">Cambridge War Memorial</a>, was achieved, despite attacks and counter-demonstrations which included what the historian Martin Garrett describes as "a hail of pro-war eggs and tomatoes". Alongside Burgess was <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28spy%29">Donald Maclean</a>, a languages student from <a href="Trinity%20Hall%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity Hall</a> and an active CUSS member. In February 1934 Burgess, Maclean, and fellow-members of CUSS welcomed the <a href="Tyneside">Tyneside</a> and <a href="Teesside">Teesside</a> contingents of that month's <a href="Hunger%20marches">National Hunger March</a>, as they passed through Cambridge on their way to London.

When not occupied in Cambridge, Burgess made frequent visits to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, to confer with kindred spirits there; according to an Oxford student's later reminiscences, at that time "it was impossible to be in the intellectual swim ... without coming across Guy Burgess". Among those he befriended was <a href="Goronwy%20Rees">Goronwy Rees</a>, a young Fellow of <a href="All%20Souls%20College%2C%20Oxford">All Souls College</a>. Rees had planned to visit the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> with a fellow-<a href="University%20don">don</a> in the 1934 summer vacation, but was unable to go; Burgess took his place. During the carefully escorted trip, in June–July 1934, Burgess met some notable figures, including possibly <a href="Nikolai%20Bukharin">Nikolai Bukharin</a>, editor of "<a href="Izvestia">Izvestia</a>" and former secretary of the <a href="Communist%20International">Comintern</a>. On his return, Burgess had little to report, beyond commenting on the "appalling" housing conditions while praising the country's lack of unemployment.

When Burgess returned to Cambridge in October 1934, his prospects of a college fellowship and an academic career were fast receding. He had abandoned his research after discovering that the same ground was covered in a new book by <a href="Basil%20Willey">Basil Willey</a>. He began an alternative study of the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Rebellion of 1857</a>, but his time was largely preoccupied with politics.

Early in 1934, <a href="Arnold%20Deutsch">Arnold Deutsch</a>, a longstanding Soviet secret agent, arrived in London under the cover of a research appointment at <a href="University%20College%2C%20London">University College, London</a>. Known as "Otto", his brief was to recruit the brightest students from Britain's top universities, who might in future occupy leading positions in British institutions. In June 1934, he recruited Philby, who had come to the Soviets' notice earlier that year in Vienna where he had been involved in demonstrations against the <a href="Engelbert%20Dollfuss">Dollfuss</a> government. Philby recommended several of his Cambridge associates to Deutsch, including Maclean, by this time working in the <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a>. He also recommended Burgess, although with some reservations on account of the latter's erratic personality. Deutsch considered Burgess worth the risk, "an extremely well-educated fellow, with valuable social connections, and the inclinations of an adventurer". Burgess was given the codename "Mädchen", meaning "Girl", later changed to "Hicks". Burgess then persuaded Blunt that he could best fight <a href="fascism">fascism</a> by working for the Soviets. A few years later another Apostle, <a href="John%20Cairncross">John Cairncross</a>, was recruited by Burgess and Blunt, to complete the spy ring often characterised as the "<a href="Cambridge%20Five">Cambridge Five</a>".

Finally recognising that he had no future career at Cambridge, Burgess left in April 1935. The long-term aim 
of the Soviet intelligence services was for Burgess to penetrate <a href="British%20intelligence%20agencies">British intelligence</a>, and with this in mind he needed to publicly distance himself from his communist past. Thus he resigned his Communist Party membership and publicly renounced communism, with a gusto that shocked and dismayed his former comrades. He then looked for suitable work, applying without success for positions with the <a href="Conservative%20Research%20Department">Conservative Research Department</a> and <a href="Conservative%20Central%20Office">Conservative Central Office</a>. He sought a teaching job at Eton, but was rejected when a request for information from <a href="Dennis%20Robertson%20%28economist%29">Dennis Robertson</a>, his former Cambridge tutor, received the reply: "I would very much prefer not to answer your letter".

Late in 1935, Burgess accepted a temporary post as personal assistant to <a href="John%20Macnamara">John Macnamara</a>, the recently elected <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland">Member of Parliament</a> (MP) for <a href="Chelmsford%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Chelmsford</a>. Macnamara was on the right of his party; he and Burgess joined the <a href="Anglo-German%20Fellowship">Anglo-German Fellowship</a>, which promoted friendship with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. This enabled Burgess to disguise his political past very effectively, while gathering important information about Germany's foreign policy intentions. Within the Fellowship, Burgess would proclaim fascism as "the wave of the future", although in other forums such as the Apostles he was more circumspect. The association with fellow homosexual Macnamara involved several trips to Germany; some, according to Burgess, were dissolute. These stories, according to the historian Michael Holzman, may have been invented or exaggerated to draw attention away from Burgess's true motives.

In the autumn of 1936, Burgess met the nineteen-year-old Jack Hewit in The Bunch of Grapes, a well-known <a href="Gay%20bar">homosexual</a> bar in <a href="Strand%2C%20London">The Strand</a>. Hewit, a would-be dancer seeking work in London's musical theatres, would be Burgess's friend, manservant and intermittent lover for the next fourteen years, generally sharing Burgess's various London homes: <a href="Chester%20Square">Chester Square</a> from 1936 to 1941, <a href="Street%20names%20of%20Marylebone">Bentinck Street</a> from 1941 to 1947, and <a href="Bond%20Street">New Bond Street</a> from 1947 until 1951.

In July 1936, having twice previously applied unsuccessfully for posts at the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, Burgess was appointed as an assistant producer in the Corporation's Talks Department. Responsible for selecting and interviewing potential speakers for current affairs and cultural programmes, he drew on his extensive range of personal contacts and rarely met refusal. His relationships at the BBC were volatile; he quarrelled with management about his pay, while colleagues were irritated by his opportunism, his capacity for intrigue, and his slovenliness. One colleague, <a href="Gorley%20Putt">Gorley Putt</a>, remembered him as "a snob and a slob ... It amazed me, much later in life, to learn that he had been irresistibly attractive to most people he met".

Among those Burgess invited to broadcast were Blunt, several times, the well-connected writer-politician <a href="Harold%20Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a> (a fruitful source of high-level gossip), the poet <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, and Kim Philby's father, the <a href="Arabist">Arabist</a> and explorer <a href="St%20John%20Philby">St John Philby</a>. Burgess also sought out <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, then a powerful <a href="Backbencher">backbench</a> opponent of the government's <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a> policy. On 1 October 1938, during the <a href="Munich%20crisis">Munich crisis</a>, Burgess, who had met Churchill socially, went to the latter's home at <a href="Chartwell">Chartwell</a> to persuade him to reconsider his decision to withdraw from a projected talks series on Mediterranean countries. According to the account provided in Tom Driberg's biography, the conversation ranged over a series of issues, Burgess urging the statesman to "offer his eloquence" to help resolve the current crisis. The meeting ended with the presentation to Burgess of a signed copy of Churchill's book "<a href="Arms%20and%20the%20Covenant">Arms and the Covenant</a>", but the broadcast did not take place.

Pursuing their main objective, the penetration of the British intelligence agencies, Burgess's controllers asked him to cultivate a friendship with the author David Footman, who they knew was an <a href="MI6">MI6</a> officer. Footman introduced Burgess to his superior, <a href="Valentine%20Vivian">Valentine Vivian</a>; as a result, over the following eighteen months Burgess carried out several small assignments for MI6 on an unpaid freelance basis. He was trusted sufficiently to be used as a back channel of communication between the British prime minister, <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>, and his French counterpart <a href="Edouard%20Daladier">Edouard Daladier</a>, during the period leading to the 1938 Munich summit.

At the BBC, Burgess thought his choices of a speaker were being undermined by the BBC's subservience to the government – he attributed Churchill's non-appearance to this – and in November 1938, after another of his speakers was withdrawn at the request of the prime minister's office, he resigned. MI6 was by now convinced of his future utility, and he accepted a job with its new propaganda division, known as Section D. In common with the other members of the Cambridge Five, his entry to British intelligence was achieved without vetting; his social position and personal recommendation were considered sufficient.

Section D was established by MI6 in March 1938, as a secret organisation charged with investigating how enemies might be attacked other than through military operations. Burgess acted as Section D's representative on the Joint Broadcasting Committee (JBC), a body set up by the Foreign Office to work closely with the BBC over the transmission of anti-Hitler broadcasts to Germany. His contacts with senior government officials enabled him to keep Moscow abreast of current government thinking. He informed them that the British government saw no need for a pact with the Soviets, since they believed Britain alone could defeat the Germans without Russian assistance. This information reinforced Soviet leader <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s suspicions of Britain and may have helped to hasten the <a href="Nazi-Soviet%20Pact">Nazi-Soviet Pact</a>, signed between Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939.

After the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> in September 1939, Burgess, with Philby, who had been brought into Section D on his recommendation, ran a training course for would-be saboteurs, at Brickendonbury Manor in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. Philby later was sceptical of the value of such training, since neither he nor Burgess had any idea of the tasks these agents would be expected to perform behind the lines in German-occupied Europe. In 1940, Section D was absorbed into the new <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> (SOE). Philby was posted to a SOE training school in <a href="Beaulieu%2C%20Hampshire">Beaulieu</a>, and Burgess, who in September had been arrested for drunken driving (the charge was dismissed on payment of costs), found himself at the end of the year out of a job.

In mid-January 1941, Burgess rejoined the BBC Talks Department, while continuing to carry out freelance intelligence work, both for MI6 and its domestic intelligence counterpart <a href="MI5">MI5</a>, which he had joined in a supernumerary capacity in 1940. After <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Germany invaded the Soviet Union</a> in June 1941, the BBC required Burgess to select speakers who would depict Britain's new Soviet ally in a favourable light. He turned again to Blunt, and to his old Cambridge friend Jim Lees, and in 1942 arranged a broadcast by Ernst Henri, a Soviet agent masquerading as a journalist. No transcript of Henri's talk survives, but listeners remembered it as pure <a href="Soviet%20propaganda">Soviet propaganda</a>. In October 1941, Burgess took charge of the flagship political programme "<a href="Week%20in%20Westminster">The Week in Westminster</a>", which gave him almost unlimited access to Parliament. Information gleaned from regular wining, lunching and gossiping with MPs was invaluable to the Soviets, regardless of the content of the programmes that resulted. Burgess sought to maintain a political balance; his fellow Etonian <a href="Quintin%20Hogg%2C%20Baron%20Hailsham%20of%20St%20Marylebone">Quintin Hogg</a>, a future Conservative <a href="lord%20chancellor">lord chancellor</a>, was a regular broadcaster, as, from the opposite social and political spectrum, was <a href="Hector%20McNeil">Hector McNeil</a>, a former journalist who became a <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> MP in 1941 and served as a <a href="parliamentary%20private%20secretary">parliamentary private secretary</a> in the <a href="Churchill%20war%20ministry">Churchill war ministry</a>.

Burgess had lived in a Chester Square flat since 1935. From Easter 1941, he shared a house with Blunt and others at No. 5 <a href="Street%20names%20of%20Marylebone">Bentinck Street</a>. Here, Burgess maintained an active social life with his many acquaintances, both regular and casual; Goronwy Rees likened the Bentinck Street ambience to that of a French farce: "Bedroom doors opened and shut, strange faces appeared and disappeared down the stairs where they passed some new visitor coming up..." This account was disputed by Blunt, who claimed that such casual comings and goings were contrary to house rules since they would have disrupted other tenants' sleep.

Burgess's casual work for MI5 and MI6 deflected official suspicion as to his true loyalties, but he lived in constant fear of exposure, particularly as he had revealed the truth to Rees when trying to recruit the latter in 1937. Rees had since renounced communism and was serving as an officer in the <a href="Royal%20Welch%20Fusiliers">Royal Welch Fusiliers</a>. Believing that Rees might expose him and others, Burgess suggested to his handlers that they should kill Rees, or alternatively that he should do the job himself. Nothing came of this proposal. Always seeking ways of further penetrating the citadels of power, when in June 1944 Burgess was offered a job in the News Department of the Foreign Office, he accepted it. The BBC reluctantly assented to his release, stating that his departure would be "a serious loss".

As a press officer in the Foreign Office News Department, Burgess's role involved explaining government policy to foreign editors and diplomatic correspondents. His access to secret material enabled him to send Moscow important details of allied policy both before and during the March 1945 <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Conference</a>. He passed information relating to the postwar futures of Poland and Germany, and also contingency plans for "<a href="Operation%20Unthinkable">Operation Unthinkable</a>", which anticipated a future war with the Soviet Union. His Soviet masters rewarded his efforts with a £250 bonus. Burgess's working methods were characteristically disorganised, and his tongue was loose; according to his colleague <a href="Osbert%20Lancaster">Osbert Lancaster</a>, "[w]hen in his cups he made no bones about working for the Russians". 
Burgess had maintained contact with McNeil who, following Labour's victory in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 General Election</a>, became <a href="Minister%20of%20State">Minister of State</a> at the Foreign Office, effectively <a href="Ernest%20Bevin">Ernest Bevin</a>'s deputy. McNeil, a staunch anti-communist unsuspecting of Burgess's true allegiance, admired the latter for his sophistication and intelligence, and in December 1946 secured his services as an additional private secretary. The appointment was in breach of regular Foreign Office procedures, and there were complaints, but McNeil prevailed. Burgess quickly made himself indispensable to McNeil, and in one six-month period transmitted to Moscow the contents of 693 files, a total of over 2,000 photographed pages, for which he received a further cash reward of £200.

Early in 1948, Burgess was seconded to the Foreign Office's newly created Information Research Department (IRD), set up to counteract Soviet propaganda. The move was not a success; he was indiscreet, and his new colleagues thought him "dirty, drunken and idle". He was quickly sent back to McNeil's office, and in March 1948 accompanied McNeil and Bevin to Brussels for the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brussels">Treaty of Brussels</a>, which eventually led to the establishment of the <a href="Western%20European%20Union">Western European Union</a> and <a href="NATO">NATO</a>. He remained with McNeil until October 1948, when he was posted to the Foreign Office's Far East Department. Burgess was assigned to the China desk at a point when the <a href="Chinese%20civil%20war">Chinese civil war</a> was nearing its climax, a communist victory imminent. There were important differences of view between Britain and the US on future diplomatic relations with the forthcoming communist state. Burgess was a forceful advocate for recognition and may have influenced Britain's decision to recognise communist China in 1949.
In February 1949, a fracas at a West End Club – possibly the <a href="Royal%20Automobile%20Club">RAC</a> – resulted in a fall downstairs that left Burgess with severe head injuries, following which he was hospitalised for several weeks. Recovery was slow; according to Holzman he never functioned well after that. Nicolson noted the decline: "Oh my dear, what a sad, sad thing this constant drinking is! Guy used to have one of the most rapid and active minds I knew". Later in 1949, a holiday in Gibraltar and North Africa became a catalogue of drunkenness, promiscuous sex, and arguments with diplomatic and MI6 staff, exacerbated by the frankly homophobic attitudes towards Burgess by some local officials. Back in London, Burgess was reprimanded, but somehow retained the confidence of his superiors, so that his next posting, in July 1950, was to Washington, as second secretary in what Purvis and Hulbert describe as "one of the UK's highest-profile embassies, the creme de la creme of diplomatic postings".

Philby had preceded Burgess to Washington and was serving there as local head of MI6, following in the path of Maclean who had worked as the embassy's first secretary between 1944 and 1948. Burgess soon reverted to his erratic and intemperate habits, causing regular embarrassment in British diplomatic circles. Nevertheless, he was given work of top-secret sensitivity. Among his duties, he served on the inter-allied board responsible for the conduct of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, which gave him access to America's strategic war plans. His frequent behavioural lapses did not prevent his being chosen to act as escort to <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, when the future British prime minister visited Washington in November 1950. The episode passed without trouble; the two, both Etonians, got on well, and Burgess received a warm letter of thanks from Eden "for all your kindness".

Burgess was dissatisfied with his job. He considered leaving the diplomatic service altogether and began sounding out his Eton friend <a href="Michael%20Berry%2C%20Baron%20Hartwell">Michael Berry</a> about a journalistic post on "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>". Early in 1951 a series of indiscretions, including three speeding tickets on a single day, made his position at the embassy untenable, and he was ordered by the ambassador, <a href="Oliver%20Franks">Sir Oliver Franks</a>, to return to London. Meanwhile, the US Army's <a href="Venona%20project">Venona counterintelligence project</a>, investigating the identity of a Soviet spy codenamed "Homer" who had been active in Washington a few years earlier, had unearthed strong evidence that pointed to Donald Maclean. Philby and his Soviet spymasters believed that Maclean might crack when confronted by British intelligence, and expose the entire Cambridge ring. Burgess was thus given the task, on reaching London, of organising Maclean's defection to the Soviet Union.

Burgess returned to England on 7 May 1951. He and Blunt then contacted <a href="Yuri%20Modin">Yuri Modin</a>, the Soviet spymaster in charge of the Cambridge ring, who began arrangements with Moscow to receive Maclean. Burgess showed little urgency in proceeding with the matter, finding time to pursue his personal affairs and attend an Apostles dinner in Cambridge. On 11 May he was summoned to the Foreign Office to answer for his misconduct in Washington and, according to Boyle, was dismissed. Other commentators say he was invited to resign or "retire", and was given time to consider his position.

Burgess's diplomatic career was over, although he was not at this stage under any suspicion of treachery. He met with Maclean several times; according to Burgess's 1956 account to Driberg, the question of defection to Moscow was not raised until their third meeting, when Maclean said he was going and requested Burgess's help. Burgess had previously promised Philby that he would not go with Maclean since a double defection would put Philby's own position in serious jeopardy. Blunt's unpublished memoirs state that it was Moscow's decision to send Burgess with Maclean who, they thought, would be unable to handle the complicated escape arrangements alone. Burgess told Driberg that he had agreed to accompany Maclean because he was leaving the Foreign Office anyway, "and I probably couldn't stick the job at the "Daily Telegraph"".
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office had fixed Monday 28 May as the date for confronting Maclean with their suspicions. Philby notified Burgess who, on Friday 25 May, bought two tickets for a weekend channel cruise on the steamship "Falaise". These short cruises docked at the French port of <a href="St%20Malo">St Malo</a>, where passengers could disembark for a few hours without passport checks. Burgess also hired a saloon car, and that evening drove to Maclean's house at <a href="Tatsfield">Tatsfield</a> in Surrey, where he introduced himself to Maclean's wife Melinda as "Roger Styles". After the three had dined, Burgess and Maclean drove rapidly to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, boarding the "Falaise" just before its midnight departure – the hired car was left abandoned on the quayside.

The pair's subsequent movements were revealed later. On arrival in St Malo, they took a taxi to <a href="Rennes">Rennes</a>, then travelled by rail to Paris and on to <a href="Berne">Berne</a> in Switzerland. Here, by prior arrangement, they were issued with papers at the Soviet embassy, before travelling to <a href="Zurich">Zurich</a>, where they caught a flight to <a href="Prague">Prague</a>. Safely behind the <a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>, they were able to proceed smoothly on the final stages of their journey to Moscow.

On Saturday 26 May, Hewit informed a friend that Burgess had not come home the previous night. Since Burgess never went away without telling his mother, his absence caused some anxiety in his circle. Maclean's non-appearance at his desk on the following Monday raised concerns that he might have absconded. Disquiet increased when officials realised that Burgess, too, was missing; the discovery of the abandoned car, hired in Burgess's name, together with Melinda Maclean's revelations about "Roger Styles", confirmed that both had fled. Blunt quickly visited Burgess's flat in New Bond Street and removed incriminating materials. An MI6 search of the flat revealed papers that compromised another member of the Cambridge ring, Cairncross, who was later required to resign from his civil service post.

The news of the double flight alarmed the Americans, following the recent conviction of the atomic spy <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a>, and the defection of the physicist <a href="Bruno%20Pontecorvo">Bruno Pontecorvo</a> the previous year. Aware that his own position was now precarious, Philby recovered various spying paraphernalia from Burgess's former Washington quarters and buried them in a nearby wood. Summoned to London in June 1951, he was interrogated for several days by MI6. There were strong suspicions that he was responsible for forewarning Maclean via Burgess, but in the absence of conclusive evidence he faced no action and was permitted to retire quietly from MI6.

In the immediate aftermath, the Foreign Office made nothing public. In private circles, many rumours abounded: the pair had been kidnapped by the Russians, or by the Americans, or were replicating the flight of <a href="Rudolf%20Hess">Rudolf Hess</a> to Scotland in 1941 in an unofficial peace mission. The press was suspicious, and the story finally broke in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" on 7 June. A cautious Foreign Office statement then confirmed that Maclean and Burgess were missing and were being treated as absent without leave. In the House of Commons the Foreign Secretary, <a href="Herbert%20Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, said there was no indication that the missing diplomats had taken secret documents with them, nor would he attempt to prejudge the issue of their destination.

On 30 June the "Express" offered a reward of £1,000 for information on the diplomats' current whereabouts, an amount dwarfed shortly afterwards by the "Daily Mail"s offer of £10,000. There were numerous false sightings in the months that followed. Some press reports speculated that Burgess and Maclean were being held in Moscow's <a href="Lubyanka%20Building">Lubyanka</a> prison. Harold Nicolson thought the Soviets would "use [Burgess] for a month or so and then quietly shove him into some salt mine". Just before Christmas 1953, Burgess's mother received a letter from her son, postmarked in South London. The letter, full of affection and messages for his friends, revealed nothing of his location or circumstances. In April 1954 a senior <a href="Ministry%20of%20State%20Security%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">MGB</a> officer, <a href="Vladimir%20Mikhaylovich%20Petrov%20%28diplomat%29">Vladmir Petrov</a>, defected in Australia. He brought with him papers indicating that Burgess and Maclean had been Soviet agents since their Cambridge days, that the MGB had masterminded their escape, and that they were alive and well in the Soviet Union.

After being held in Moscow for a short period, Burgess and Maclean were sent to <a href="Samara">Kuybyshev</a>, an industrial city which Burgess described as "permanently like Glasgow on a Saturday night". He and Maclean were granted Soviet citizenship in October 1951, and took fresh identities: Burgess became "Jim Andreyevitch". Unlike Maclean, who learned the language and quickly took up useful work, Burgess spent much of his time reading, drinking, and complaining to the authorities about his treatment – he had not intended his stay to be permanent. He expected to be permitted to return to England, where he thought he could brazen out his MI5 interrogation. He also found the Soviets intolerant of homosexuality, although eventually he was allowed to retain a Russian lover, Tolya Chisekov. By early 1956 Burgess had moved back to Moscow, to a flat on Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Street, and was working part-time at the Foreign Literature Publishing House, promoting the translation of classic British novels.

In February 1956 the Soviet government allowed Burgess and Maclean to hold a brief press conference, which included two Western journalists – the first concrete proof to the West that the missing diplomats were alive. In a short statement, they denied they were communist spies and said they had come to Moscow "to achieve better understanding between the Soviet Union and the West". In Britain, reaction to their reappearance was strongly condemnatory, epitomised in a series of articles in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20People">The People</a>", purportedly written by Burgess's former friend Rees. The articles, which described Burgess as "the greatest traitor in our history", sought to emphasise Burgess's supposed dissolute lifestyle and, in the opinion of his biographer Sheila Kerr, "did much to prolong and accentuate repressive attitudes to homosexuality" in Britain. 
In July 1956 the Soviet authorities allowed Burgess's mother to visit her son. She stayed a month, mainly in the holiday resort of <a href="Sochi">Sochi</a>. During August the journalist and Labour Party politician <a href="Tom%20Driberg">Tom Driberg</a> flew to Moscow to interview Burgess – the two had first met through "The Week in Westminster". On his return, Driberg wrote a book in which Burgess was portrayed relatively sympathetically. Some assumed that the content had been vetted by the <a href="KGB">KGB</a> as a propaganda exercise; others thought its purpose was to trap Burgess into revealing information that could lead to his prosecution, should he ever return to Britain.

Over the following years, Burgess received numerous visitors from England. Redgrave came with the <a href="Royal%20Shakespeare%20Company">Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company</a> in February 1959; this visit led to Burgess's meeting with the actress <a href="Coral%20Browne">Coral Browne</a>, a friendship later the subject of <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>'s play "<a href="An%20Englishman%20Abroad">An Englishman Abroad</a>". In the same year, Burgess gave a filmed interview to the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (CBC), forgotten until its rediscovery in 2015. In it, Burgess revealed that while he wished to continue living in Russia, he maintained an affection for his home country. When the British prime minister, <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, visited Moscow in 1959, Burgess offered his expertise to the visiting party (he had once spent an evening with Macmillan at the <a href="Reform%20Club">Reform Club</a>). His offer was declined, but he used this opportunity to lobby officials for permission to visit Britain where, he said, his mother was sick. Although aware on legal advice that a successful prosecution against Burgess would be problematic, the Foreign Office issued statements implying he would face instant arrest in Britain. In the event, Burgess chose not to put the issue to the test.

Burgess suffered from increasing ill-health, largely due to a lifestyle based on poor food and excessive alcohol. In 1960 and 1961 he was treated in hospital for <a href="arteriosclerosis">arteriosclerosis</a> and ulcers, on the latter occasion being close to death. In April 1962, writing to his friend Esther Whitfield, he indicated how his belongings should be allocated should he die – Blunt, Philby, and Chisekov were all named as beneficiaries. In that same month a "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>" letter-writer proposed that "as an act of Christian charity", Burgess should be given a <a href="safe%20conduct">safe conduct</a> to visit his ailing mother in England.

In January 1963 Philby defected to Moscow, having finally been unmasked – after official exoneration by Macmillan in 1956. He and Burgess kept apart, though they may have met briefly, when the latter was on his deathbed in August 1963. Burgess died on 30 August, of arteriosclerosis and acute liver failure. He was cremated five days later; Nigel Burgess represented the family, and Maclean delivered a eulogy describing his co-defector as "a gifted and courageous man who devoted his life to the cause of a better world". Burgess's ashes were returned to England, and on 5 October 1963 were interred in the family plot at St John the Evangelist Churchyard in <a href="West%20Meon">West Meon</a>.

Modin considered Burgess the leader of the Cambridge spies: "He held the group together, infused it with his energy and led it into battle". He sent large amounts of information to Moscow: thousands of documents including policy papers, Cabinet minutes and notes of <a href="Imperial%20General%20Staff">Imperial General Staff</a> meetings. According to Holzman, "Burgess and Maclean ensured that hardly anything done by the British Foreign Office was not known to the Soviet foreign intelligence services". Views are divided as to what use the Soviets made of this information, or whether they trusted it. Released papers by the Foreign Intelligence Services of the Russian Federation record that "of particular value was the information [he] obtained about the positions of Western countries on the postwar settlement in Europe, Britain's military strategy, NATO [and] the activities of British and American intelligence agencies". But the apparent ease with which Burgess and his colleagues could acquire and send such volumes of data also created suspicions in Moscow that they were being fed misinformation. Thus, the extent of damage to British interests suffered by Burgess's activities is a matter of conjecture; Kerr concludes that "despite much fevered speculation ... there is too little evidence on the effects of [Burgess's] espionage and his influence upon international politics for a credible assessment to be feasible." 

The British establishment found it difficult to accept how someone of Burgess's background and education could betray the system that had sustained him in comfort and privilege. According to <a href="Rebecca%20West">Rebecca West</a> in "The Meaning of Treason", the demoralisation and panic caused by Burgess's defection were of greater value than the information he passed to the Soviets. The damage to Anglo-American intelligence co-operation was severe; all atomic intelligence liaison between the two countries was suspended for several years. Foreign Office complacency about recruitment and security was shattered, and although positive vetting was belatedly introduced, the diplomatic service suffered what Burgess's biographer Andrew Lownie calls "a culture of suspicion and mistrust that was still being played out half a century after the 1951 flight".

Against the popular denunciations of "traitor" and "spy", Burgess was, in Holzman's words, a revolutionary and idealist, identifying with those who thought that their society "was deeply unjust and that its Empire spread this injustice throughout the world". He never deviated from the ideological justification that he gave on his reappearance in 1956; he believed that the stark choice to be made in the twentieth century was between America and the Soviet Union. <a href="Noel%20Annan">Noel Annan</a>, in his account of British intellectual life between the world wars, states that Burgess "was a true Stalinist who hated liberals more than imperialists" and "simply believed that Britain's future lay with Russia not America". Burgess insisted there was no viable case against him in England (a view secretly shared by the British authorities), but would not visit there, since he might be prevented from returning to Moscow where he wished to live "because I am a socialist and this is a socialist country".

Burgess's life, says Lownie, can only be explained by an understanding of "the intellectual maelstrom of the 1930s, particularly amongst the young and impressionable". Yet Lownie points out that most of his fellow Cambridge communists did not work for the Russians, and indeed reassessed their position after the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Holzman stresses the high price of Burgess's political continuing commitment, which "cost him everything else he valued: the possibility of fulfilling intimate relationships, the social life that revolved around the BBC, Fleet Street and Whitehall, even the chance to be with his mother as she lay dying".

Of the other Cambridge spies, Maclean and Philby lived out their lives in Moscow, dying in 1983 and 1988 respectively. Blunt, who was interrogated many times, finally confessed in 1964, although in return for his co-operation this was not made public before his exposure in 1979; he died four years later. Cairncross, who made a partial confession in 1964 and continued thereafter to cooperate with the British authorities, worked as a writer and historian before his death in 1995.

Aspects of Burgess's life have been fictionalised in several novels and dramatised on numerous occasions. An early (1954) novel, "The Troubled Midnight" by Rodney Garland, was followed by, among others, <a href="Nicholas%20Monsarrat">Nicholas Monsarrat</a>'s "Smith and Jones" (1963), and <a href="Michael%20Dobbs">Michael Dobbs</a>'s "<a href="Winston%27s%20War">Winston's War</a>" (2003), which builds on the prewar meeting between Burgess and Churchill. Stage and screen works include Bennett's "<a href="An%20Englishman%20Abroad">An Englishman Abroad</a>", <a href="Julian%20Mitchell">Julian Mitchell</a>'s play "<a href="Another%20Country%20%28play%29">Another Country</a>" and the <a href="Another%20Country%20%28film%29">subsequent film of same title</a>, <a href="ITV%20Granada">Granada TV</a>'s 1987 drama "Philby, Burgess and Maclean" (1977), the 2003 BBC miniseries "<a href="Cambridge%20Spies">Cambridge Spies</a>", and John Morrison's 2011 stage play "A Morning with Guy Burgess", set in the last months of his life and examining themes of loyalty and betrayal.

Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo

Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (4 March 1901 or 1903 – 22 June 1937), born Joseph-Casimir Rabearivelo, is widely considered to be Africa's first modern poet and the greatest literary artist of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Part of the first generation raised under <a href="French%20Madagascar">French colonization</a>, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and <a href="ohabolana">traditional Malagasy poetry</a> prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as an adolescent in local literary reviews, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its literary journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a>, as well as literary critiques, an opera, and two novels.

Rabearivelo's early period of <a href="modernist%20poetry">modernist</a>-inspired poetry showed skill and attracted critical attention but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions. The <a href="surrealism">surrealist</a> poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim. Despite increasing critical attention in international poetry reviews, Rabearivelo was never afforded access to the elite social circles of colonial Madagascar. He suffered a series of personal and professional disappointments, including the death of his daughter, the French authorities' decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the <a href="Exposition%20Internationale%20des%20Arts%20et%20Techniques%20dans%20la%20Vie%20Moderne">Universal Exposition</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, and growing debt worsened by his philandering and opium addiction. Following Rabearivelo's suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr.

The death of Rabearivelo occurred just prior to the emergence of the "<a href="N%C3%A9gritude">Négritude</a>" movement, by which time the Malagasy poet had established an international reputation among literary figures such as <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20S%C3%A9dar%20Senghor">Léopold Sédar Senghor</a> as Africa's first modern poet. The Government of Madagascar declared Rabearivelo its national poet upon independence in 1960. The legacy and influence of his works continue to be felt and his works are a focus of ongoing academic study. Modern Malagasy poets and literary figures including <a href="Elie%20Rajaonarison">Elie Rajaonarison</a> have cited him as a major inspiration. A street and a high school in <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a> have been named after him, as has a dedicated room in the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Madagascar">National Library of Madagascar</a>.

Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, born Joseph-Casimir on 4 March 1901 or 1903 in <a href="Ambatofotsy">Ambatofotsy</a> (north of <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>), <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, was the only child of an unwed mother descended from the "Zanadralambo" ("sons of <a href="Ralambo">Ralambo</a>") caste of the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina</a> "<a href="andriana">andriana</a>" (nobles). When the French <a href="French%20Madagascar">colonized Madagascar</a> in 1897, Merina nobles including Rabearivelo's mother lost the privileges, prestige, and wealth to which they had been entitled under the former monarchy, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Imerina">Kingdom of Imerina</a>. Madagascar had been a French colony for less than a decade when Rabearivelo was born, situating him among the first generation of Malagasy to grow up under the <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">colonial system</a>. He first studied at the Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes school in the affluent neighborhood of Andohalo, then transferred to the prestigious Collège Saint-Michel, where he was expelled for lack of discipline, poor academic performance, and his reluctance to become religiously observant. He ended his studies at École Flacourt in 1915. He is believed to have published his first poems at age 14 in the literary review "Vakio Ity" under the <a href="pen%20name">pen name</a> K. Verbal.

After leaving school, he worked a variety of low-skilled jobs, including as a lace designer, an errand boy, and a secretary and interpreter to a district administrator. During this period he developed a passion for <a href="19th-century%20French%20literature">French 19th</a> and <a href="20th-century%20French%20literature">20th century literature</a> and refined his fluency in the French language; he also began teaching himself English, Spanish, and Hebrew. He changed his name to Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo to have the same initials as <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>, while continuing to occasionally use pseudonyms, including "Amance Valmond" and "Jean Osmé". He was particularly attracted to poets and writers who were outcasts in their own society, including <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Baudelaire</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Rimbaud">Rimbaud</a>.

In 1920, Rabearivelo was hired as an assistant librarian at the "Cercle de l'Union" <a href="Social%20clubs">social club</a>. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy language</a>. He began to correspond with a wide range of writers around the world, including <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gide">André Gide</a>, <a href="Paul%20Val%C3%A9ry">Paul Valéry</a>, <a href="Jean%20Amrouche">Jean Amrouche</a>, <a href="Paul%20Claudel">Paul Claudel</a>, and <a href="Valery%20Larbaud">Valery Larbaud</a>, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a <a href="proofreading">proofreader</a> at the publishing house Imprimerie de l'Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life. In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony's financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar's postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine "18° Latitude Sud".

He published his first collection of poems, "La coupe de cendres" ("The Cup of Ashes") in 1924; the same year he also translated twelve previously unpublished Malagasy language poems into French and published them in literary magazines, including "18° Latitude Sud" in Antananarivo and "La Vie" in Paris. This publication launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of Antananarivo high society, where he established himself as Madagascar's leader not only in poetry and prose, but as an esteemed journalist, art critic, translator, and writer of essays and plays.

In 1925 he published a <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a> called "L'Aube Rouge" ("The Red Dawn") about the last years of the Kingdom of Imerina. In it he honored Rainandriamampandry, the governor of <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a> who was executed by the French in 1896 for his suspected role in the <a href="Menalamba%20rebellion">Menalamba rebellion</a>. Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies, "Sylves" ("Woodlands") and "Volumes", in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He also published his second historical novel in 1928, "L'interférence" ("Interference"), which depicts the life of a noble family from the last years of the monarchy until colonization. Throughout the 1920s, he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, <a href="Jules%20Laforgue">Laforgue</a>, <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rilke</a>, <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Whitman</a>, and <a href="Luis%20de%20G%C3%B3ngora">Góngora</a>; he also translated traditional Malagasy "<a href="hainteny%23Kabary">kabary</a>" (oratory) into French for publication in French-language literary reviews.

In 1926, Rabearivelo married Mary Razafitrimo, the daughter of a local photographer, and together they had five children. He was also a womanizer and abused <a href="alcohol%20abuse">alcohol</a> and <a href="opium%20addiction">opium</a>, growing increasingly dependent on the substances after the death of his daughter. Rabearivelo constantly struggled with debt, and despite his growing fame and artistic success, he was unable to escape from poverty.

Throughout the 1930s, Rabearivelo joined with other Malagasy poets and writers in an emerging literary movement termed ""Hitady ny Very"" ("The Search for Lost Values"), which sought to promote the traditional literary and oral arts of Madagascar. Together with fellow artists Charles Rajoelisolo and Ny Avana Ramanantoanina, in August 1931 he founded a literary journal called "Ny Fandrosoam-baovao" ("New Progress") to promote Malagasy-language poetry. He published two more anthologies of thirty poems each: "Presque-Songes" ("Dream Images") (1931) and "Traduit de la nuit" ("Translated from the Night") (1932). As an experiment, he wrote Malagasy and French versions of each poem in these two books; the French versions were published in 1934 and 1935 respectively. For the remainder of his life he focused primarily on the translation of "<a href="hainteny">hainteny</a>" (traditional Malagasy poetry) into French, work which was published posthumously. He also wrote Madagascar's first and only opera, "Imaitsoanala" (1935), named for the legendary heroine mother of King <a href="Ralambo">Ralambo</a>; it was set to music composed by <a href="Andrianary%20Ratianarivo">Andrianary Ratianarivo</a> and was performed by Ratianarivo's Troupe Jeanette at the Municipal Theater of Isotry in Antananarivo.

In 1933, his three-year-old daughter Voahangy became ill and died. Rabearivelo was deeply affected by this loss and was plunged into grief from which he never recovered. His last daughter, who was born in 1936, he named Velomboahangy ("Voahangy Alive"). The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal.

The colonial high society of Antananarivo showcased Rabearivelo's work as evidence of the success of the <a href="Assimilation%20%28French%20colonial%29">French assimilation policy</a> and the beneficial effects of colonialism in Africa. In his journals, the poet wrote that he felt "used" by the French authorities in Madagascar. Governor Montagné awarded him an affiliation ("membre correspondant") with the "<a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Malgache">Académie Malgache</a>" in 1932. But in 1937, Rabearivelo's trust in the assimilation messages and gestures of Antananarivo's colonial high society was betrayed. He was imprisoned for three days for failing to pay taxes, a penalty from which he should have been exempted due to his status as a low-ranking employee of the colonial administration. He had also been promised that he would represent Madagascar at the <a href="Exposition%20Internationale%20des%20Arts%20et%20Techniques%20dans%20la%20Vie%20Moderne">1937 Universal Exposition</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, but in May 1937 the colonial authorities informed him that he would not be part of the island's delegation. Consequently, Rabearivelo became embittered toward France and its colonial message of assimilation, a sentiment strongly expressed in his journals. He was likewise rejected by Malagasy high society, who condemned his unconventional behavior and views, particularly in light of his role as husband and father. His compatriots also held him in contempt for his perceived eagerness to embrace the French colonial rule and culture.

Rabearivelo was deeply troubled by these disappointments and his worsening chronic financial troubles, in addition to the continuing grief he felt for the death of his daughter. On 19 June 1937, a French friend informed him that his hope to eventually earn a higher official role within the administrative authority could never materialize as he was largely self-taught and lacked the required diplomas. Having staked his future on a government career, Rabearivelo began to muse about his own death in his journal, writing "Perhaps one needs to die to be found sincere."

Rabearivelo committed suicide by <a href="cyanide%20poisoning">cyanide poisoning</a> on the afternoon of 22 June 1937. He may have been seriously ill with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> at the time. The morning of his suicide, Rabearivelo completed several unfinished works; he then took fourteen 250-milligram <a href="quinine">quinine</a> capsules with water at 1:53 pm, followed at 2:37 pm by ten grams of <a href="potassium%20cyanide">potassium cyanide</a>. Before dying he wrote a final poem and burned the first five volumes of his personal journal, the "Calepins Bleus" ("Blue Notebooks", 1924–1937), leaving four volumes of approximately 1,800 pages that document his life after 4 January 1933. In his final journal entries he recorded the detailed experience of his suicide, concluding with his final entry at 3:02 pm. At the time of his death, only half of his twenty literary works had been published; the remainder were printed posthumously.

Rabearivelo's first poetic work, "La coupe de cendres" (1924), demonstrates the evident mastery of <a href="meter%20%28poetry%29">meter</a> and <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a> in his earliest works, despite an absence of innovation on the classic models of poetry he uses. The works that follow this initial effort can be broadly clustered into two phases, the first being highly influenced by the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">symbolist</a> and <a href="romantic%20poetry">romantic</a> schools of poetry, and the second reflecting greater creativity and individuality in personal expression, and with a recurrent interest in reconciling a mental image of a "mythic past" with an "alienating modernity".

In the romantic period, typified by "Sylves" (1927) and "Volumes" (1928), Rabearivelo's poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of traditional models. He identified himself and his work as post-symbolist in the early part of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo's works from this period, editor <a href="Jacques%20Rabemananjara">Jacques Rabemananjara</a> acknowledged the poet's evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.

Beginning in 1931, his works begin to change in tone and show the influences of <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a> and <a href="modernist%20poetry">modernism</a>. His poems become more daring, free, and complex, while also reflecting greater doubt. According to academic Arnaud Sabatier, this change reflects "the rediscovery and embrace of the sound and images of traditional Malagasy poetry, from which he had previously distanced himself or which he had subjected to the colonial language and culture." These later works are described by academic Claire Riffard as "his strangest, evoking rural and commonplace images alongside unexpected dreamlike visions, superimposing the new and the forgotten ..." His break from convention in this period offered greater freedom to reconcile his conflicted identity, such as through his bilingual creations, "Presque-Songes" (1931) and "Traduit de la nuit" (1932).

Rabearivelo has long been considered the first modern poet of Africa. Academic Arnaud Sabatier identifies him as "one of the most important writers of the twentieth century". He has also been described by <a href="Radio%20France%20Internationale">Radio France Internationale</a> journalist Tirthankar Chanda as "the founder of the African "<a href="Organisation%20internationale%20de%20la%20Francophonie">francophonie</a>"" and "the "<a href="enfant%20terrible">enfant terrible</a>" of French literature". Rabearivelo is the most internationally famous and influential Malagasy literary figure. "<a href="Jeune%20Afrique">Jeune Afrique</a>" described him as "Madagascar's greatest poet", a sentiment echoed by <a href="L%C3%A9opold%20S%C3%A9dar%20Senghor">Léopold Sédar Senghor</a>, first president of Senegal and founder of the "<a href="N%C3%A9gritude">Négritude</a>" movement, who called him the "prince of the Malagasy poets". He was described by academic Claire Riffard as "one of the principal founders of contemporary Malagasy literature", and following national independence in 1960, the government of Madagascar affirmed his cultural contributions by promoting him as the island's national writer.

Rabearivelo struggled throughout his life to <a href="identity%20crisis">reconcile his identity</a> as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation and connection with the greater universal human experience. He has been depicted as a <a href="martyrdom">martyr</a> figure as a result of his suicide following the refusal of French authorities to grant him permission to go to France. He has been the subject of a significant number of books and conferences; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death, his work was commemorated at events organized in North America, Europe and Africa, including a week-long conference at the <a href="University%20of%20Antananarivo">University of Antananarivo</a>. Recent scholarship has questioned Rabearivelo's elevation as a colonial martyr, arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African.

The Lycée Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo was inaugurated in central Antananarivo on 21 December 1946 in honor of the poet. A room has been dedicated to the poet in the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Madagascar">National Library of Madagascar</a>, located in the capital city.

He was included in the seminal volume of poetry of the "Négritude" movement, Léopold Senghor's "Anthologie de la nouvelle poesie negre et malgache" ("Anthology of New Black and Malagasy Poetry"), published in 1948. He has inspired many Malagasy writers and poets after him, including <a href="Elie%20Rajaonarison">Elie Rajaonarison</a>, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.

The <a href="Agence%20universitaire%20de%20la%20Francophonie">Francophone University Agency</a> and Madagascar's National Center for Scientific Research collaborated to publish the entirety of Rabearivelo's works in three volumes. The first volume, comprising his journal and some of his correspondence with key figures in literary and colonial circles, was printed in October 2010. The second volume, a compilation of all his previously published works, was released in July 2012. The remaining 1,000 pages of materials produced by Rabearivelo have been published in digital format. The first complete English translation of his masterpiece "Translated from the Night" was published by Lascaux Editions in 2007.

Psilocybe semilanceata

Psilocybe semilanceata, commonly known as the liberty cap, is a <a href="psilocybin%20mushroom">psilocybin or "magic" mushroom</a> that contains the <a href="Psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive</a> compounds <a href="psilocybin">psilocybin</a> which the body breaks down to <a href="psilocin">psilocin</a>, and the <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a> <a href="baeocystin">baeocystin</a>. It is both one of the most widely distributed psilocybin mushrooms in nature, and one of the most <a href="potency%20%28pharmacology%29">potent</a>. The mushrooms have a distinctive conical to bell-shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, up to in diameter, with a small <a href="Umbo%20%28mycology%29">nipple-like protrusion</a> on the top. They are yellow to brown, covered with radial grooves when moist, and fade to a lighter color as they mature. Their <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipes</a> tend to be slender and long, and the same color or slightly lighter than the cap. The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gill</a> attachment to the stipe is adnexed (narrowly attached), and they are initially <a href="cream%20%28color%29">cream</a>-colored before tinting purple as the <a href="spore">spore</a>s mature. The spores are dark purplish-brown in <a href="spore%20print">mass</a>, <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> in shape, and measure 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s.

The mushroom grows in <a href="grassland">grassland</a> habitats, especially wetter areas. But unlike "<a href="Psilocybe%20cubensis">P. cubensis</a>", the fungus does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> species that feeds off decaying grass roots. It is widely distributed in the <a href="temperate%20climate">temperate</a> areas of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, particularly in Europe, and has been reported occasionally in temperate areas of the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> as well. The earliest reliable history of "P. semilanceata" intoxication dates back to 1799 in London, and in the 1960s the mushroom was the first European species confirmed to contain psilocybin.

The possession or sale of psilocybin mushrooms is <a href="Legal%20status%20of%20psilocybin%20mushrooms">illegal in many countries</a>.

The species was first described by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> as "Agaricus semilanceatus" in his 1838 "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici". <a href="Paul%20Kummer">Paul Kummer</a> transferred it to "<a href="Psilocybe">Psilocybe</a>" in 1871 when he raised many of Fries's sub-groupings of "Agaricus" to the level of genus. "Panaeolus semilanceatus", named by <a href="Jakob%20Emanuel%20Lange">Jakob Emanuel Lange</a> in both 1936 and 1939 publications, is a <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a>. According to the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomical</a> database <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a>, several <a href="taxon">taxa</a> once considered <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> of "P. semilanceata" are synonymous with the species now known as "<a href="Psilocybe%20strictipes">Psilocybe strictipes</a>": the "caerulescens" variety described by <a href="Pier%20Andrea%20Saccardo">Pier Andrea Saccardo</a> in 1887 (originally named "Agaricus semilanceatus" var. "coerulescens" by <a href="Mordecai%20Cubitt%20Cooke">Mordecai Cubitt Cooke</a> in 1881), the "microspora" variety described by <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> in 1969, and the "obtusata" variety described by <a href="Marcel%20Bon">Marcel Bon</a> in 1985.

Several <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> studies published in the <a href="2000s%20%28decade%29">2000s</a> demonstrated that "Psilocybe", as it was defined then, was <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>. The studies supported the idea of dividing the genus into two <a href="clade">clade</a>s, one consisting of the bluing, <a href="psilocybin%20mushroom">hallucinogenic</a> species in the family <a href="Hymenogastraceae">Hymenogastraceae</a>, and the other the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the family <a href="Strophariaceae">Strophariaceae</a>. However, the generally accepted <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> (a specimen later selected when the original author of a taxon name did not designate a <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a>) of the genus as a whole was "<a href="Psilocybe%20montana">Psilocybe montana</a>", which is a non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species. If the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the study were to be segregated, it would have left the hallucinogenic clade without a <a href="valid%20name%20%28botany%29">valid name</a>. To resolve this dilemma, several mycologists proposed in a 2005 publication to <a href="conserved%20name">conserve</a> the name "Psilocybe", with "P. semilanceata" as the type. As they explained, conserving the name "Psilocybe" in this way would prevent <a href="nomenclature">nomenclatural</a> changes to a well-known group of fungi, many species of which are "linked to archaeology, anthropology, religion, alternate life styles, forensic science, law enforcement, laws and regulation". Further, the name "P. semilanceata" had historically been accepted as the lectotype by many authors in the period 1938–68. The proposal to conserve the name "Psilocybe", with "P. semilanceata" as the type was accepted unanimously by the <a href="Nomenclature%20Committee%20for%20Fungi">Nomenclature Committee for Fungi</a> in 2009.

The mushroom takes its <a href="common%20name">common name</a> from the <a href="Phrygian%20cap">Phrygian cap</a>, also known as the "liberty cap", which it resembles; "P. semilanceata" shares its common name with "<a href="Psilocybe%20pelliculosa">P. pelliculosa</a>", a species from which it is more or less indistinguishable in appearance. The <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for Phrygian cap is "<a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">pileus</a>", nowadays the technical name for what is commonly known as the "cap" of a fungal fruit body. In the 18th century Phrygian caps were placed on <a href="Liberty%20pole">Liberty pole</a>s, which resemble the <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> of the mushroom. The generic name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "psilos" (ψιλός) ("smooth" or "bare") and the <a href="Byzantine%20Greek">Byzantine Greek</a> "kubê" (κύβη) ("head"). The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> comes from the Latin "semi" ("half" or "somewhat") and "lanceata", from "lanceolatus", meaning "spear-shaped".

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of "P. semilanceata" is in diameter and tall. It varies in shape from sharply conical to bell-shaped, often with a prominent <a href="papilla%20%28mycology%29">papilla</a> (a nipple-shaped structure), and does not change shape considerably as it ages. The cap margin is initially rolled inward but unrolls to become straight or even curled upwards in maturity. The cap is <a href="hygrophanous">hygrophanous</a>, meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration. When it is moist, the cap is <a href="ochre">ochraceous</a> to pale brown to dark <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> brown, but darker in the center, often with a greenish-blue tinge. When moist, radial grooves (striations) can be seen on the cap that correspond to the positions of the gills underneath. When the cap is dry, it becomes much paler, a light yellow-brown color. Moist mushrooms have sticky surfaces that result from a thin gelatinous film called a pellicle. This film becomes apparent if a piece of the cap is broken by bending it back and peeling away the piece. When the cap dries from exposure to the sun, the film turns whitish and is no longer peelable.

On the underside of the mushroom's cap, there are between 15 and 27 individual narrow <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> that are moderately crowded together, and they have a narrowly <a href="adnexed%20gills">adnexed</a> to almost free attachment to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>. Their color is initially pale brown, but becomes dark gray to purple-brown with a lighter edge as the spores mature. The slender yellowish-brown stipe is long by thick, and usually slightly thicker towards the base. The mushroom has a thin cobweb-like <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> that does not last long before disappearing; sometimes, the partial veil leaves an <a href="wikt%3Aannular%20zone">annular zone</a> on the stipe that may be darkened by spores. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thin and membrane-like, and roughly the same color as the surface tissue. It has a <a href="wikt%3Afarinaceous">farinaceous</a> (similar to freshly ground flour) odor and taste. All parts of the mushroom will stain a bluish color if handled or bruised, and it may naturally turn blue with age.

In <a href="spore%20print">deposit</a>, the <a href="spore">spore</a>s are a deep reddish purple-brown color. The use of a <a href="light%20microscope">light microscope</a> can reveal further details: the spores are oblong when seen in side view, and oblong to oval in frontal view, with dimensions of 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore bearing cells of the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>), are 20–31 by 5–9 μm, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases; there are no basidia found on the sterile gill edge. The cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the gill edge) measure 15–30 by 4–7 μm, and are flask-shaped with long thin necks that are 1–3.5 μm wide. "P. semilanceata" does not have pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The <a href="pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> is up to 90 μm thick, and is made of a tissue layer called an <a href="wikt%3Aixocutis">ixocutis</a>—a gelatinized layer of <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising the ixocutis are cylindrical, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>, and 1–3.5 μm wide. Immediately under the cap cuticle is the "subpellis", made of hyphae that are 4–12 μm wide with yellowish-brown encrusted walls. There are <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s present in the hyphae of all tissues.

The <a href="teleomorph%2C%20anamorph%20and%20holomorph">anamorphic</a> form of "P. semilanceata" is an <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual</a> stage in the fungus's <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a> involved in the development of mitotic <a href="diaspore%20%28botany%29">diaspores</a> (<a href="conidia">conidia</a>). In <a href="microbiological%20culture">culture</a>, grown in a <a href="petri%20dish">petri dish</a>, the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a>. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0 μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of "P. semilanceata" beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.

Scottish mycologist <a href="Roy%20Watling">Roy Watling</a> described sequestrate (<a href="truffle">truffle</a>-like) or <a href="secotioid">secotioid</a> versions of "P. semilanceata" he found growing in association with regular fruit bodies. These versions had elongated caps, long and wide at the base, with the inward curved margins closely hugging the stipe from the development of membranous flanges. Their gills were narrow, closely crowded together, and <a href="anastomose">anastomose</a>d (fused together in a vein-like network). The color of the gills was <a href="sepia%20%28color%29">sepia</a> with a brownish <a href="wine%20%28color%29">vinaceous</a> (red wine-colored) cast, and a white margin. The stipes of the fruit bodies were long by thick, with about of stipe length covered by the extended cap. The thick-walled ellipsoid spores were 12.5–13.5 by 6.5–7 μm. Despite the significant differences in morphology, <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis showed the secotioid version to be the same species as the typical <a href="morphotype">morphotype</a>.

There are several other "Psilocybe" species that may be confused with "P. semilanceata" due to similarities in physical appearance. "<a href="Psilocybe%20strictipes">P. strictipes</a>" is a slender grassland species that is differentiated macroscopically from "P. semilanceata" by the lack of a prominent papilla. "<a href="Psilocybe%20mexicana">P. mexicana</a>", commonly known as the "Mexican liberty cap", is also similar in appearance, but is found in manure-rich soil in <a href="subtropical%20grasslands">subtropical grasslands</a> in Mexico. It has somewhat smaller spores than "P. semilanceata", typically 8–9.9 by 5.5–7.7 μm. Another lookalike species is "<a href="Psilocybe%20samuiensis">P. samuiensis</a>", found in Thailand, where it grows in well-manured clay-like soils or among <a href="paddy%20field">paddy field</a>s. This mushroom can be distinguished from "P. semilanceata" by its smaller cap, up to in diameter, and its <a href="rhomboid">rhomboid</a>-shaped spores. "<a href="Psilocybe%20pelliculosa">P. pelliculosa</a>" is physically similar to such a degree that it may be indistinguishable in the field. It differs from "P. semilanceata" by virtue of its smaller spores, measuring 9–13 by 5–7 μm.

"P. semilanceata" has also been confused with the toxic <a href="muscarine">muscarine</a>-containing species "<a href="Inocybe%20geophylla">Inocybe geophylla</a>", a whitish mushroom with a silky cap, yellowish-brown to pale grayish gills, and a dull yellowish-brown spore print.

"Psilocybe semilanceata" fruits solitarily or in groups on rich and acidic soil, typically in <a href="grasslands">grasslands</a>, such as <a href="meadow">meadow</a>s, <a href="pasture">pasture</a>s, or <a href="lawn">lawn</a>s. It is often found in pastures that have been fertilized with sheep or cow <a href="feces">dung</a>, although it does not typically grow directly on the dung.

Like some other grassland <a href="psilocybin%20mushroom">psilocybin mushroom</a> species such as "<a href="Psilocybe%20mexicana">P. mexicana</a>", "<a href="Psilocybe%20tampanensis">P. tampanensis</a>" and "<a href="Conocybe%20cyanopus">Conocybe cyanopus</a>", "P. semilanceata" may form <a href="sclerotia">sclerotia</a>, a dormant form of the fungus, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing sclerotia on a malt agar surface culture.

"P. semilanceata", like all others species of the genus "<a href="Psilocybe">Psilocybe</a>", is a <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with <a href="Cyperaceae">sedges</a> in moist areas of fields, and it is thought to live on the decaying root remains.

Laboratory tests have shown "P. semilanceata" to suppress the growth of the soil-borne <a href="oomycete">water mold</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", a virulent <a href="plant%20pathogen">plant pathogen</a> that causes the disease <a href="root%20rot">root rot</a>. When grown in dual <a href="pure%20culture">culture</a> with other saprobic fungi isolated from the <a href="rhizosphere">rhizosphere</a> of grasses from its habitat, "P. semilanceata" significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two <a href="natural%20phenol">phenolic</a> compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard <a href="Antibiotic%20sensitivity">antimicrobial susceptibility tests</a>, "Psilocybe semilanceata" was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen <a href="methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus"</a> (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.

"Psilocybe" authority <a href="Gast%C3%B3n%20Guzm%C3%A1n">Gastón Guzmán</a>, in his 1983 monograph on psilocybin mushrooms, considered "Psilocybe semilanceata" the world's most widespread psilocybin mushroom species, as it has been reported on 17 countries.
In Europe, "P. semilanceata" has a widespread distribution, and is found in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>, Czech republic, Denmark, Estonia, the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine. It is generally agreed that the species is native to Europe; Watling has demonstrated that there exists little difference between specimens collected from Spain and Scotland, at both the morphological and genetic level.

The mushroom also has a widespread distribution in North America. In Canada it has been collected from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Quebec. In the United States, it is most common in the Pacific Northwest, west of the Cascade Mountains, where it fruits abundantly in autumn and early winter; fruiting has also been reported to occur infrequently during spring months. Charles Horton Peck reported the mushroom to occur in New York in the early 20th century, and consequently, much literature published since then has reported the species to be present in the eastern United States. Gaston Guzman later examined Peck's herbarium specimen, and in his comprehensive 1983 monograph on Psilocybe, concluded that Peck had misidentified it with the species now known as Panaeolina foenisecii. P. semilanceata is much less common in South America, where it has been recorded in Chile. It is also known in Australia (where it may be an introduced species) and New Zealand, where it grows in high-altitude grasslands. In 2000, it was reported from Golaghat, in the Indian state of Assam. P.semilanceata is also found in Kodaikanal hill region in the state of Tamil Nadu, India.

The first reliably documented report of "Psilocybe semilanceata" intoxication involved a British family in 1799, who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in London's <a href="Green%20Park">Green Park</a>. According to the chemist <a href="Augustus%20Everard%20Brande">Augustus Everard Brande</a>, the father and his four children experienced typical symptoms associated with ingestion, including <a href="pupil%20dilation">pupil dilation</a>, spontaneous laughter and <a href="delirium">delirium</a>. The identification of the species responsible was made possible by <a href="James%20Sowerby">James Sowerby</a>'s 1803 book "Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms", which included a description of the fungus, then known as "Agaricus glutinosus" (originally described by <a href="Moses%20Ashley%20Curtis">Moses Ashley Curtis</a> in 1780). According to German mycologist <a href="Jochen%20Gartz">Jochen Gartz</a>, the description of the species is "fully compatible with current knowledge about "Psilocybe semilanceata"."

In the early 1960s, the Swiss scientist <a href="Albert%20Hofmann">Albert Hofmann</a>—known for the <a href="chemical%20synthesis">synthesis</a> of the psychedelic drug <a href="lysergic%20acid%20diethylamide">LSD</a>—<a href="analytical%20chemistry">chemically analyzed</a> "P. semilanceata" fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist <a href="Roger%20Heim">Roger Heim</a>. Using the technique of <a href="paper%20chromatography">paper chromatography</a>, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) <a href="psilocybin">psilocybin</a> in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in "Psilocybe" species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, <a href="forensic%20chemistry">forensic</a> characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified "P. semilanceata"—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin <a href="structural%20analog">analog</a> <a href="baeocystin">baeocystin</a> was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then support the idea that the variability of psilocybin content in "P. semilanceata" is low, regardless of country of origin.

Several studies have quantified the amounts of hallucinogenic compounds found in the fruit bodies of "Psilocybe semilanceata". In 1993, Gartz reported an average of 1% psilocybin (expressed as a percentage of the <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a> of the fruit bodies), ranging from a minimum of 0.2% to a maximum of 2.37%, which is the highest psilocybin concentration reported for a mushroom. In an earlier analysis, Tjakko Stijve and Thom Kuyper (1985) found a high concentration in a single specimen (1.7%) in addition to a relatively high concentration of <a href="baeocystin">baeocystin</a> (0.36%). Smaller specimens tend to have the highest percent concentrations of psilocybin, but the absolute amount is highest in larger mushrooms. A Finnish study <a href="assay">assay</a>ed psilocybin concentrations in old <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old. Michael Beug and Jeremy Bigwood, analyzing specimens from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, reported psilocybin concentrations ranging from 0.62% to 1.28%, averaging 1.0 ±0.2%. They concluded that the species was one of the most potent, as well as the most constant in psilocybin levels. In a 1996 publication, <a href="Paul%20Stamets">Paul Stamets</a> defined a "potency rating scale" based on the total content of psychoactive compounds (including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin) in 12 species of "Psilocybe" mushrooms. Although there are certain caveats with this technique—such as the unconfirmed assumption that these compounds contribute equally to psychoactive properties—it serves as a rough comparison of potency between species. Despite its small size, "Psilocybe semilanceata" is considered a "moderately active to extremely potent" hallucinogenic mushroom (meaning the combined percentage of psychoactive compounds is typically between 0.25% to greater than 2%), and of the 12 mushrooms compared, only 3 were more potent: "<a href="Psilocybe%20azurescens">P. azurescens</a>", "<a href="Psilocybe%20baeocystis">P. baeocystis</a>", and "<a href="Psilocybe%20bohemica">P. bohemica</a>". According to Gartz (1995), "P. semilanceata" is Europe's most popular psychoactive species.

Several reports have been published in the literature documenting the effects of consumption of "P. semilanceata". Typical symptoms include visual distortions of color, depth and form, progressing to visual <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s. The effects are similar to the experience following consumption of <a href="LSD">LSD</a>, although milder. Common side effects of mushroom ingestion include <a href="Midriasis">pupil dilation</a>, <a href="tachycardia">increased heart rate</a>, <a href="Dysphoria">unpleasant mood</a>, and <a href="hyperreflexia">overresponsive reflexes</a>. As is typical of the symptoms associated with psilocybin mushroom ingestion, "the effect on mood in particular is dependent on the subject's pre-exposure personality traits", and "identical doses of psilocybin may have widely differing effects in different individuals." Although most cases of intoxication resolve without incident, there have been isolated cases with severe consequences, especially after higher dosages or persistent use. In one case reported in Poland in 1998, an 18-year-old man developed <a href="Wolff-Parkinson-White%20syndrome">Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</a>, <a href="Heart%20arrhythmia">arrhythmia</a>, and suffered <a href="myocardial%20infarction">myocardial infarction</a> after ingesting "P. semilanceata" frequently over the period of a month. The cardiac damage and myocardial infarction was suggested to be a result of either coronary <a href="vasoconstriction">vasoconstriction</a>, or because of <a href="platelet">platelet</a> hyperaggregation and <a href="vascular%20occlusion">occlusion</a> of small <a href="coronary%20circulation">coronary arteries</a>.
One danger of attempting to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, is the possibility of misidentification with <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">toxic species</a>. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous "<a href="Cortinarius%20rubellus">Cortinarius rubellus</a>" for "P. semilanceata". As a result, he suffered <a href="Chronic%20kidney%20disease">end-stage renal failure</a>, and required a <a href="kidney%20transplantation">kidney transplant</a>. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in <a href="Takotsubo%20cardiomyopathy">Takotsubo cardiomyopathy</a>, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the <a href="myocardium">myocardium</a>. A <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a>-based test to specifically identity "P. semilanceata" was reported by Polish scientists in 2007. Liberty caps can also be easily misidentified for poisonous <a href="Psathyrella">Psathyrella</a> species.

In 1998, a Swedish study reported trace amounts of <a href="phenethylamine">phenethylamine</a> in "P. semilanceata" up to 146 microg/g wet weight which the authors referred to as "high amount of PEA" that play a possible role in adverse reactions. However, a typical dose of 30 grams of fresh mushrooms will correspond to maximum 4.38 mg phenethylamine. The authors mention that phenethylamine is rapidly inactivated through metabolic breakdown by monoamine oxidase (MAO), but are suggesting that there may be an interaction between phenylethylamine and psilocin (the metabolic <a href="chemical%20decomposition">breakdown product</a> of psilocybin) through <a href="competitive%20inhibition">competitive inhibition</a> of <a href="monoamine%20oxidase">monoamine oxidase</a> enzymes. The issue has been described by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>/<a href="Canadian%20Centre%20for%20Occupational%20Health%20and%20Safety">CCOHS</a> joint project <a href="IPCS%20INCHEM">IPCS INCHEM</a> in a monograph, and by the <a href="European%20Monitoring%20Centre%20for%20Drugs%20and%20Drug%20Addiction">European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction</a> (EMCDDA).

Alexander Shulgin says in his book <a href="PiHKAL">PiHKAL</a> that he didn't observe any effects from 1600 mg phenethylamine alone. Also, <a href="Dr.%20Duke%27s%20Phytochemical%20and%20Ethnobotanical%20Databases">Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases</a> record on <a href="cocoa%20bean">"Theobroma cacao" beans</a> measure 5600 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> (5.6 mg/g) <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, the chemical precursor to phenylethylamine. R. Gordon Wasson reports that <a href="Cocoa%20solids">cacao</a> and magic mushroom is combined in traditional rituals used by Mexican shamans, including <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Sabina">María Sabina</a>.

The legal status of psilocybin mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as <a href="Class%20A%20drugs">Class A</a> (United Kingdom) or <a href="Controlled%20Substances%20Act%23Schedule%20I%20controlled%20substances">Schedule I</a> (US) drugs under the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> 1971 <a href="Convention%20on%20Psychotropic%20Substances">Convention on Psychotropic Substances</a>. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including "P. semilanceata", is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) there has been a tightening of laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed <a href="cannabis%20coffee%20shop">cannabis coffee shop</a>s and <a href="smart%20shop">smart shop</a>s, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.
They are legal in Jamaica and Brazil and decriminalised in Portugal. And current grassroots efforts for an Oregon ballot measure http://egov.sos.state.or.us/elec/web_irr_search.record_detail?p_reference=20200012..LSCYYY. in the US expect to legalize psychedelic mushrooms for recreation and therapeutic treatment in that state.

<a href="Riksdag">The Riksdag</a> added "Psilocybe semilanceata" to under "Swedish schedule I" (""substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use"") as of October 1, 1997, published by <a href="Medical%20Products%20Agency%20%28Sweden%29">Medical Products Agency (MPA)</a> in regulation "LVFS 1997:15" listed as Psilocybe semilanceata (toppslätskivling).

The Raft of the Medusa

The Raft of the Medusa ( ) is an <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> of 1818–19 by the French <a href="Romantic%20movement">Romantic</a> painter and <a href="lithography">lithographer</a> <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20G%C3%A9ricault">Théodore Géricault</a> (1791–1824). Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491 cm × 716 cm (16' 1" × 23' 6"), it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval <a href="French%20frigate%20M%C3%A9duse%20%281810%29">frigate "Méduse"</a>, which ran aground off the coast of today's <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practised cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.

Géricault chose to depict this event in order to launch his career with a large-scale uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Paris Salon</a>, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the <a href="Romanticism">Romantic movement</a> in French painting.

Although "The Raft of the Medusa" retains elements of the traditions of <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's influence can be seen in the works of <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a>, <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>, <a href="Gustave%20Courbet">Gustave Courbet</a>, and <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a>.

In June 1816, the French <a href="frigate">frigate</a> "<a href="French%20frigate%20M%C3%A9duse%20%281810%29">Méduse</a>" departed from <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a>, bound for the <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>ese port of <a href="Saint-Louis%2C%20Senegal">Saint-Louis</a>. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the <a href="Combat%20stores%20ship">storeship</a> "Loire", the <a href="brig">brig</a> <a href="HMS%20Plumper%20%281804%29">"Argus"</a> and the <a href="corvette">corvette</a> "Écho". Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed <a href="Ranks%20in%20the%20French%20Navy">captain</a> of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20 years. After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">Louis XVIII</a>, though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside the concerns of the monarch. The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281814%29">Peace of Paris</a>. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel <a href="Julien-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Schmaltz">Julien-Désiré Schmaltz</a>, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.

In an effort to make good time, the "Méduse" overtook the other ships, but due to poor navigation it drifted off course. On 2 July, it ran aground on a sandbank off the West African coast, near today's <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>. The collision was widely blamed on the incompetence of De Chaumereys, a returned <a href="%C3%A9migr%C3%A9">émigré</a> who lacked experience and ability, but had been granted his commission as a result of an act of political preferment. Efforts to free the ship failed, so, on 5 July, the frightened passengers and crew started an attempt to travel the to the African coast in the frigate's six boats. Although the "Méduse" was carrying 400 people, including 160 crew, there was space for only about 250 in the boats. The remainder of the ship's complement and half of a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to garrison Senegal - at least 146 men and one woman - were piled onto a hastily built raft, that partially submerged once it was loaded. Seventeen crew members opted to stay aboard the grounded "Méduse". The captain and crew aboard the other boats intended to tow the raft, but after only a few miles the raft was turned loose. For sustenance the crew of the raft had only a bag of ship's biscuit (consumed on the first day), two casks of water (lost overboard during fighting) and six casks of wine.

According to critic Jonathan Miles, the raft carried the survivors "to the frontiers of human experience. Crazed, parched and starved, they slaughtered mutineers, ate their dead companions and killed the weakest." After 13 days, on 17 July 1816, the raft was rescued by the "Argus" by chance—no particular search effort was made by the French for the raft. By this time only 15 men were still alive; the others had been killed or thrown overboard by their comrades, died of starvation, or thrown themselves into the sea in despair. The incident became a huge public embarrassment for the French monarchy, only recently restored to power after <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="Hundred%20Days">defeat in 1815</a>.

"The Raft of the Medusa" portrays the moment when, after 13 days adrift on the raft, the remaining 15 survivors view a ship approaching from a distance. According to an early British reviewer, the work is set at a moment when "the ruin of the raft may be said to be complete". The painting is on a monumental scale of 491 × 716 cm (193.3 × 282.3 in), so that most of the figures rendered are life-sized and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant.

The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship's attention.

The pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.
The viewer's attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right. According to the art historian Justin Wintle, "a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex." Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the "Argus", the ship that eventually rescued the survivors.

Géricault's palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors' clothes, the sea and the clouds. Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that Géricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain. The work's lighting has been described as "<a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggesque</a>", after the Italian artist closely associated with <a href="tenebrism">tenebrism</a>—the use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even Géricault's treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures. From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.

Géricault was captivated by accounts of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish his reputation as a painter. Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with 2 survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and <a href="Alexandre%20Corr%C3%A9ard">Alexandre Corréard</a>, an engineer from the <a href="Arts%20et%20M%C3%A9tiers%20ParisTech">École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers</a>. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting. According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, "Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided."

Earlier travels had exposed Géricault to victims of insanity and plague, and while researching the "Méduse" his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the <a href="Rigor%20mortis">stiffness</a> of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.

He worked with Corréard, Savigny and another of the survivors, the carpenter Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of the planks. Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast on a number of occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>.

He drew and painted numerous preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative moments of the disaster he would depict in the final work. The painting's conception proved slow and difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event.

Among the scenes he considered were the mutiny against the officers from the second day on the raft, the cannibalism that occurred after only a few days, and the rescue. Géricault ultimately settled on the moment, recounted by one of the survivors, when they first saw, on the horizon, the approaching rescue ship "Argus"—visible in the upper right of the painting—which they attempted to signal. The ship, however, passed by. In the words of one of the surviving crew members, "From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief."
To a public well-versed in the particulars of the disaster, the scene would have been understood to encompass the aftermath of the crew's abandonment, focusing on the moment when all hope seemed lost—the "Argus" reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.

The author <a href="Rupert%20Christiansen">Rupert Christiansen</a> points out that the painting depicts more figures than had been on the raft at the time of the rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.

Géricault, who had just been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic existence in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.

He used friends as models, most notably the painter <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a> (1798–1863), who modelled for the figure in the foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow at the foot of the mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures.

According to Hubert Wellington, Delacroix—who would become the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault's death—wrote, "Géricault allowed me to see his "Raft of Medusa" while he was still working on it. It made so tremendous an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room."

Géricault painted with small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed little time for reworking and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a>, white, <a href="naples%20yellow">naples yellow</a>, two different <a href="red%20ochre">yellow ochres</a>, two <a href="red%20ochre">red ochre</a>s, <a href="sienna">raw sienna</a>, <a href="light%20red">light red</a>, <a href="burnt%20sienna">burnt sienna</a>, <a href="crimson%20lake">crimson lake</a>, <a href="Prussian%20blue">Prussian blue</a>, <a href="peach%20black">peach black</a>, <a href="Bone%20char">ivory black</a>, cassel earth and <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a>. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but over a period of time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.

Géricault drew an outline sketch of the composition onto the canvas. He then posed models one at a time, completing each figure before moving onto the next, as opposed to the more usual method of working over the whole composition. The concentration in this way on individual elements gave the work both a "shocking physicality" and a sense of deliberate theatricality—which some critics consider an adverse effect. Over 30 years after the completion of the work, his friend Montfort recalled:

Working with little distraction, the artist completed the painting in eight months; the project as a whole took 18 months.

"The Raft of the Medusa" fuses many influences from the <a href="Old%20Master">Old Master</a>s, from the "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Michelangelo%29">Last Judgment</a>" and <a href="Sistine%20Chapel%20ceiling">Sistine Chapel ceiling</a> of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> (1475–1564) and <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>'s "<a href="Transfiguration%20%28Raphael%29">Transfiguration</a>", to the monumental approach of <a href="Jacques-Louis%20David">Jacques-Louis David</a> (1748–1825) and <a href="Antoine-Jean%20Gros">Antoine-Jean Gros</a> (1771–1835), to contemporary events. By the 18th century, shipwrecks had become a recognised feature of <a href="marine%20art">marine art</a>, as well as an increasingly common occurrence as more journeys were made by sea. <a href="Claude%20Joseph%20Vernet">Claude Joseph Vernet</a> (1714–1789) created many such images, achieving naturalistic colour through direct observation—unlike other artists at that time—and was said to have tied himself to the mast of a ship in order to witness a storm.

Although the men depicted on the raft had spent 13 days adrift and suffered hunger, disease and cannibalism, Géricault pays tribute to the traditions of heroic painting and presents his figures as muscular and healthy. According to the art historian <a href="Richard%20Muther%20%28art%20historian%29">Richard Muther</a>, there is still a strong debt to <a href="Classicism">Classicism</a> in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid "unpictorial" costumes. Muther observes that there is "still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death".

The influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting's scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant "fruitful moment"—the first awareness of the approaching ship—is described. In 1793, David also painted an important current event with "<a href="The%20Death%20of%20Marat">The Death of Marat</a>". His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the <a href="French%20Revolution">revolution in France</a>, and it served as an important precedent for Géricault's decision to also paint a current event. David's pupil, Antoine-Jean Gros, had, like David, represented "the grandiosities of a school irredeemably associated with a lost cause", but in some major works, he had given equal prominence to Napoleon and anonymous dead or dying figures. Géricault had been particularly impressed by the 1804 painting "<a href="Bonaparte%20Visiting%20the%20Plague-Victims%20of%20Jaffa">Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Victims of Jaffa</a>", by Gros.

The young Géricault had painted copies of work by <a href="Pierre-Paul%20Prud%27hon">Pierre-Paul Prud'hon</a> (1758–1823), whose "thunderously tragic pictures" include his masterpiece, "Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime", where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously influenced Géricault's painting.

The foreground figure of the older man may be a reference to <a href="Ugolino%20and%20Dante">Ugolino</a> from <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a>'s <a href="Divine%20Comedy">"Inferno"</a>—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a> (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a>, which was one of the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for "The Raft of the Medusa" in <a href="Watercolor%20painting">watercolour</a>, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.

Several English and American paintings including "<a href="The%20Death%20of%20Major%20Pierson">The Death of Major Pierson</a>" by <a href="John%20Singleton%20Copley">John Singleton Copley</a> (1738–1815)—also painted within two years of the event—had established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which Géricault may have known from prints: "<a href="Watson%20and%20the%20Shark">Watson and the Shark</a>" (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like "The Raft of the Medusa", concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; "<a href="The%20Defeat%20of%20the%20Floating%20Batteries%20at%20Gibraltar%2C%20September%201782">The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782</a>" (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of Géricault's work; and "" (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition. A further important precedent for the political component was the works of <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a>, particularly his "<a href="The%20Disasters%20of%20War">The Disasters of War</a>" series of 1810–12, and his 1814 masterpiece "<a href="The%20Third%20of%20May%201808">The Third of May 1808</a>". Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply "Shipwreck" (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style have nothing in common with "The Raft of the Medusa". It is unlikely that Géricault had seen the picture.

"The Raft of the Medusa" was first shown at the 1819 <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Paris Salon</a>, under the title "Scène de Naufrage" ("Shipwreck Scene"), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers. The exhibition was sponsored by <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">Louis XVIII</a> and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. Géricault's canvas was the star at the exhibition: "It strikes and attracts all eyes" ("Le Journal de Paris"). Louis XVIII visited three days before the opening and said: """", or "Monsieur Géricault, you've painted a shipwreck, but it's not one for you". The critics were divided: the horror and "terribilità" of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of <a href="classicism">classicism</a> expressed their distaste for what they described as a "pile of corpses", whose realism they considered a far cry from the "ideal beauty" represented by <a href="Girodet">Girodet</a>'s "Pygmalion and Galatea", which triumphed the same year. Géricault's work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? <a href="Marie-Philippe%20Coupin%20de%20la%20Couperie">Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie</a>, a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: "Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel." The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic <a href="Auguste%20Jal">Auguste Jal</a>, who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its <a href="modernity">modernity</a>. The historian <a href="Jules%20Michelet">Jules Michelet</a> approved: "our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa".

Géricault had deliberately sought to be both politically and artistically confrontational. Critics responded to his aggressive approach in kind, and their reactions were either ones of revulsion or praise, depending on whether the writer's sympathies favoured the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> or Liberal viewpoint. The painting was seen as largely sympathetic to the men on the raft, and thus by extension to the anti-imperial cause adopted by the survivors Savigny and <a href="Alexandre%20Corr%C3%A9ard">Corréard</a>. The decision to place a black man at the pinnacle of the composition was a controversial expression of Géricault's <a href="Abolitionism">abolitionist</a> sympathies. The art critic Christine Riding has speculated that the painting's later exhibition in London was planned to coincide with anti-slavery agitation there. According to art critic and curator <a href="Karen%20Wilkin">Karen Wilkin</a>, Géricault's painting acts as a "cynical indictment of the bungling malfeasance of France's post-Napoleonic officialdom, much of which was recruited from the surviving families of the "<a href="Ancien%20R%C3%A9gime">Ancien Régime</a>"".

The painting generally impressed the viewing public, although its subject matter repelled many, thus denying Géricault the popular acclaim which he had hoped to achieve. At the end of the exhibition, the painting was awarded a gold medal by the judging panel, but they did not give the work the greater prestige of selecting it for the Louvre's national collection. Instead, Géricault was awarded a commission on the subject of the <a href="Sacred%20Heart">Sacred Heart of Jesus</a>, which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, whose finished painting he then signed as his own. Géricault retreated to the countryside, where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his unsold work was rolled up and stored in a friend's studio.

Géricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820, where it was shown at <a href="William%20Bullock%20%28collector%29">William Bullock</a>'s <a href="Egyptian%20Hall">Egyptian Hall</a> in <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, London, from 10 June until the end of the year, and viewed by about 40,000 visitors. The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in <a href="French%20art">French art</a>. It received more positive reviews than when it was shown at the Salon. In part, this was due to the manner of the painting's exhibition: in Paris it had initially been hung high in the Salon Carré—a mistake that Géricault recognised when he saw the work installed—but in London it was placed close to the ground, emphasising its monumental impact. There may have been other reasons for its popularity in England as well, including "a degree of national self-congratulation", the appeal of the painting as lurid entertainment, and two theatrical entertainments based around the events on the raft which coincided with the exhibition and borrowed heavily from Géricault's depiction. From the London exhibition Géricault earned close to 20,000 francs, which was his share of the fees charged to visitors, and substantially more than he would have been paid had the French government purchased the work from him. After the London exhibition, Bullock brought the painting to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> early in 1821, but the exhibition there was far less successful, in large part due to a competing exhibition of a <a href="moving%20panorama">moving panorama</a>, "The Wreck of the Medusa" by the Marshall brothers firm, which was said to have been painted under the direction of one of the survivors of the disaster.
"The Raft of the Medusa" was championed by the curator of the Louvre, <a href="Louis%20Nicolas%20Philippe%20Auguste%20de%20Forbin">comte de Forbin</a> who purchased it for the museum from Géricault's heirs after his death in 1824. The painting now dominates its gallery there. The display caption tells us that "the only hero in this poignant story is humanity".

At some time between 1826 and 1830 American artist <a href="George%20Cooke%20%28painter%29">George Cooke</a> (1793–1849) made a copy of the painting in a smaller size, (130.5 x 196.2 cm; approximately 4 ft × 6 ft), which was shown in Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C. to crowds who knew about the controversy surrounding the shipwreck. Reviews favoured the painting, which also stimulated plays, poems, performances and a children's book. It was bought by a former admiral, Uriah Phillips, who left it in 1862 to the <a href="New-York%20Historical%20Society">New York Historical Society</a>, where it was miscatalogued as by <a href="Gilbert%20Stuart">Gilbert Stuart</a> and remained inaccessible until the mistake was uncovered in 2006, after an enquiry by Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, a professor of art history at the <a href="University%20of%20Delaware">University of Delaware</a>. The university's conservation department undertook restoration of the work.

Because of deterioration in the condition of Géricault's original, the Louvre in 1859–60 commissioned two French artists, Pierre-Désiré Guillemet and Étienne-Antoine-Eugène Ronjat, to make a full size copy of the original for loan exhibitions.

In the autumn of 1939, the "Medusa" was packed for removal from the Louvre in anticipation of the outbreak of war. A scenery truck from the <a href="Com%C3%A9die-Fran%C3%A7aise">Comédie-Française</a> transported the painting to Versailles in the night of 3 September. Some time later, the "Medusa" was moved to the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chambord">Château de Chambord</a> where it remained until after the end of the Second World War.

In its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth, "The Raft of the Medusa" was a landmark in the emerging <a href="Romanticism">Romantic movement</a> in French painting, and "laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution" against the prevailing <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> style. Géricault's compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a> genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style. In France, both history painting and the Neoclassical style continued through the work of Antoine-Jean Gros, <a href="Jean%20Auguste%20Dominique%20Ingres">Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres</a>, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20G%C3%A9rard">François Gérard</a>, <a href="Anne-Louis%20Girodet%20de%20Roussy-Trioson">Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson</a>, <a href="Pierre-Narcisse%20Gu%C3%A9rin">Pierre-Narcisse Guérin</a>—teacher of both Géricault and Delacroix—and other artists who remained committed to the artistic traditions of David and <a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</a>.

In his introduction to "The Journal of Eugène Delacroix", Hubert Wellington wrote about Delacroix's opinion of the state of French painting just prior to the Salon of 1819. According to Wellington, "The curious blend of classic with realistic outlook which had been imposed by the discipline of David was now losing both animation and interest. The master himself was nearing his end, and exiled in Belgium. His most docile pupil, Girodet, a refined and cultivated classicist, was producing pictures of astonishing frigidity. Gérard, immensely successful painter of portraits under the Empire—some of them admirable—fell in with the new vogue for large pictures of history, but without enthusiasm."

"The Raft of the Medusa" contains the gestures and grand scale of traditional history painting; however, it presents ordinary people, rather than heroes, reacting to the unfolding drama. Géricault's raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, "the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism".

The unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications of the extent to which Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.

Hubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for Géricault. The dramatic composition of Géricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, "Géricault allowed me to see his "Raft of Medusa" while he was still working on it." The painting's influence is seen in Delacroix's "<a href="The%20Barque%20of%20Dante">The Barque of Dante</a>" (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix's later works, such as "The Shipwreck of Don Juan" (1840).

According to Wellington, Delacroix's masterpiece of 1830, "<a href="Liberty%20Leading%20the%20People">Liberty Leading the People</a>", springs directly from Géricault's "The Raft of the Medusa" and Delacroix's own "<a href="The%20Massacre%20at%20Chios">Massacre at Chios</a>". Wellington wrote that "While Géricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions."
<br>
The art and sculpture historian Albert Elsen believed that "The Raft of the Medusa" and Delacroix's "Massacre at Chios" provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a>'s monumental sculpture "<a href="The%20Gates%20of%20Hell">The Gates of Hell</a>". He wrote that "Delacroix's "Massacre at Chios" and Géricault's "Raft of the Medusa" confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies ... If Rodin was inspired to rival Michelangelo's "Last Judgment", he had Géricault's "Raft of the Medusa" in front of him for encouragement."

While <a href="Gustave%20Courbet">Gustave Courbet</a> (1819–1877) could be described as an anti-Romantic painter, his major works like "A Burial at Ornans" (1849–50) and "<a href="The%20Artist%27s%20Studio">The Artist's Studio</a>" (1855) owe a debt to "The Raft of the Medusa". The influence is not only in Courbet's enormous scale, but in his willingness to portray ordinary people and current political events, and to record people, places and events in real, everyday surroundings. The 2004 exhibition at the <a href="Clark%20Art%20Institute">Clark Art Institute</a>, "Bonjour Monsieur Courbet: The Bruyas Collection from the Musee Fabre, Montpellier", sought to compare the 19th-century <a href="Realism%20%28visual%20arts%29">Realist</a> painters Courbet, <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Daumier">Honoré Daumier</a> (1808–1879), and early <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a> (1832–1883) with artists associated with Romanticism, including Géricault and Delacroix. Citing "The Raft of the Medusa" as an instrumental influence on Realism, the exhibition drew comparisons between all of the artists. The critic <a href="Michael%20Fried">Michael Fried</a> sees Manet directly borrowing the figure of the man cradling his son for the composition of "Angels at the Tomb of Christ".

The influence of "The Raft of the Medusa" was felt by artists beyond France. <a href="Francis%20Danby">Francis Danby</a>, a British painter born in Ireland, probably was inspired by Géricault's picture when he painted "Sunset at Sea after a Storm" in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that "The Raft of the Medusa" was "the finest and grandest historical picture I have ever seen".

"<a href="The%20Gulf%20Stream%20%28painting%29">The Gulf Stream</a>" (1899), by the American artist <a href="Winslow%20Homer">Winslow Homer</a> (1836–1910), replicates the composition of "The Raft of the Medusa" with a damaged vessel, ominously surrounded by sharks and threatened by a waterspout. Like Géricault, Homer makes a black man the pivotal figure in the scene, though here he is the vessel's sole occupant. A ship in the distance mirrors the "Argus" from Géricault's painting. The move from the drama of Romanticism to the new Realism is exemplified by the stoic resignation of Homer's figure. The man's condition, which in earlier works might have been characterised by hope or helplessness, has turned to "sullen rage".

In the early 1990s, sculptor <a href="John%20Connell">John Connell</a>, in his "Raft Project", a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated "The Raft of the Medusa" by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and tar and placing them on a large wooden raft.

Remarking on the contrast between the dying figures in the foreground and the figures in the mid-ground waving towards the approaching rescue ship, the French art historian Georges-Antoine Borias wrote that Géricault's painting represents, "on the one hand, desolation and death. On the other, hope and life."

For <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a>, "The Raft of the Medusa" "remains the chief example of romantic pathos expressed through the nude; and that obsession with death, which drove Géricault to frequent mortuary chambers and places of public execution, gives truth to his figures of the dead and the dying. Their outlines may be taken from the classics, but they have been seen again with a craving for violent experience."

Today, a bronze <a href="Relief">bas-relief</a> of "The Raft of the Medusa" by <a href="Antoine%20%C3%89tex">Antoine Étex</a> adorns Géricault's grave in <a href="P%C3%A8re%20Lachaise%20Cemetery">Père Lachaise Cemetery</a> in Paris.

Richard Cantillon

Richard Cantillon (; 1680s – ) was an Irish-French economist and author of "Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général" ("Essay on the Nature of Trade in General"), a book considered by <a href="William%20Stanley%20Jevons">William Stanley Jevons</a> to be the "cradle of <a href="political%20economy">political economy</a>". Although little information exists on Cantillon's life, it is known that he became a successful banker and merchant at an early age. His success was largely derived from the political and business connections he made through his family and through an early employer, <a href="James%20Brydges%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Chandos">James Brydges</a>. During the late 1710s and early 1720s, Cantillon speculated in, and later helped fund, <a href="John%20Law%20%28economist%29">John Law</a>'s <a href="Mississippi%20Company">Mississippi Company</a>, from which he acquired great wealth. However, his success came at a cost to his debtors, who pursued him with lawsuits, criminal charges, and even murder plots until his death in 1734.

"Essai" remains Cantillon's only surviving contribution to economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, but was not published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, probably in the late 1770s, and considered essential reading for political economy. Despite having much influence on the early development of the <a href="physiocrat">physiocrat</a> and <a href="classical%20economics">classical schools</a> of thought, "Essai" was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his experiences as a banker, and especially by the <a href="speculative%20bubble">speculative bubble</a> of John Law's Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially <a href="William%20Petty">William Petty</a>.

"Essai" is considered the first complete treatise on economics, with numerous contributions to the science. These contributions include: his cause and effect <a href="methodology">methodology</a>, monetary theories, his conception of the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, and the development of spatial economics. Cantillon's "Essai" had significant influence on the early development of political economy, including the works of <a href="Adam%20Smith">Adam Smith</a>, <a href="Anne%20Robert%20Jacques%20Turgot%2C%20Baron%20de%20Laune">Anne Turgot</a>, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Say">Jean-Baptiste Say</a>, <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Bastiat">Frédéric Bastiat</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Quesnay">François Quesnay</a>.

While details regarding Richard Cantillon's life are scarce, it is thought that he was born sometime during the 1680s in <a href="County%20Kerry">County Kerry</a>, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of <a href="Ballyheigue">Ballyheigue</a>. Sometime in the middle of the first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British <a href="Paymaster%20General">Paymaster General</a> <a href="James%20Brydges%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Chandos">James Brydges</a>, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the <a href="War%20of%20Spanish%20Succession">War of Spanish Succession</a>. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, thanks in large part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.

At this time, Cantillon became involved with British <a href="mercantilism">mercantilist</a> <a href="John%20Law%20%28economist%29">John Law</a> through the <a href="Mississippi%20Company">Mississippi Company</a>. Based on the monetary theory proposed by William Potter in his 1650 tract "The Key of Wealth", John Law posited that <a href="Expansionary%20monetary%20policy">increases in the money supply</a> would lead to the employment of unused land and labour, leading to higher productivity. In 1716, the French government granted him both permission to found the "Banque Générale" and virtual monopoly over the right to develop French territories in North America, named the Mississippi Company. In return, Law promised the French government to finance its debt at low rates of interest. Law began a financial speculative bubble by selling shares of the Mississippi Company, using the "Banque Générale"'s virtual monopoly on the issue of bank notes to finance his investors.

Richard Cantillon amassed a great fortune from his speculation, buying Mississippi Company shares early and selling them at inflated prices. Cantillon's financial success and growing influence caused friction in his relationship with John Law, and sometime thereafter Law threatened to imprison Cantillon if the latter did not leave France within twenty-four hours. Cantillon replied: "I shall not go away; but I will make your system succeed." To that end, in 1718 Law, Cantillon, and wealthy speculator <a href="Joseph%20Gage">Joseph Gage</a> formed a private company centred on financing further speculation in North American real estate.

In 1719, Cantillon left Paris for <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, returning briefly in early 1720. Lending in Paris, Cantillon had outlying debt repaid to him in London and Amsterdam. With the collapse of the "Mississippi bubble", Cantillon was able to collect on debt accruing high rates of interest. Most of his debtors had suffered financial damage in the bubble collapse and blamed Cantillon—until his death, Cantillon was involved in countless lawsuits filed by his debtors, leading to a number of murder plots and criminal accusations.

On 16 February 1722, Cantillon married Mary Mahony, daughter of —a wealthy merchant and former Irish general—spending much of the remainder of the 1720s travelling throughout Europe with his wife. Cantillon and Mary had two children, a son who died at an early age and a daughter, Henrietta, wife successively of <a href="William%20Stafford-Howard%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Stafford">the 3rd Earl of Stafford</a> and <a href="Robert%20Maxwell%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Farnham">the 1st Earl of Farnham</a>. Although he frequently returned to Paris between 1729 and 1733, his permanent residence was in London. In , his residence in London was burned to the ground, and it is generally assumed that Cantillon died in the fire. While the fire's causes are unclear, the most widely accepted theory is that Cantillon was murdered. One of Cantillon's biographers, Antoine Murphy, has advanced the alternative theory that Cantillon staged his own death to escape the harassment of his debtors, appearing in <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a> under the name Chevalier de Louvigny.

Although there is evidence that Richard Cantillon wrote a wide variety of manuscripts, only his "<a href="Essai%20Sur%20La%20Nature%20Du%20Commerce%20En%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9ral">Essai Sur La Nature Du Commerce En Général</a>" (abbreviated "Essai") survives. Written in 1730, it was published in French in 1755, and was translated into English by <a href="Henry%20Higgs">Henry Higgs</a> in 1932. Evidence suggests that "Essai" <a href="%23Influence">had tremendous influence</a> on the early development of economic science. However, Cantillon's treatise was largely neglected during the 19th century. In the late 19th century and it was "rediscovered" by <a href="William%20Stanley%20Jevons">William Stanley Jevons</a>, who considered it the "cradle of political economy". Since then, Cantillon's "Essai" has received growing attention. "Essai" is considered the first complete treatise on economic theory, and Cantillon has been called the "father of enterprise economics".
One of the greatest influences on Cantillon's writing was English economist <a href="William%20Petty">William Petty</a> and his 1662 tract "Treatise on Taxes". Although Petty provided much of the groundwork for Cantillon's "Essai", Anthony Brewer argues that Petty's influence has been overstated. Apart from Petty, other possible influences on Cantillon include <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>, <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, <a href="Livy">Livy</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a>, <a href="Charles%20Davenant">Charles Davenant</a>, <a href="Edmond%20Halley">Edmond Halley</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>, <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Le%20Prestre%20de%20Vauban">Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban</a>, and <a href="Jean%20Boisard">Jean Boisard</a>. Cantillon's involvement in John Law's speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight on the relationship between increases in the supply of money, price, and production.

Cantillon's "Essai" is written using a distinctive causal <a href="methodology">methodology</a>, separating Cantillon from his mercantilist predecessors. "Essai" is peppered with the word "natural", which in the case of Cantillon's treatise is meant to imply a cause and effect relationship between economic actions and phenomena. Economist Murray Rothbard credits Cantillon with being one of the first theorists to isolate economic phenomena with simple models, where otherwise uncontrollable variables can be fixed. Cantillon made frequent use of the concept of <a href="ceteris%20paribus">ceteris paribus</a> throughout "Essai" in an attempt to neutralise independent variables. Furthermore, he is credited with employing a methodology similar to <a href="Carl%20Menger">Carl Menger</a>'s methodological individualism, by deducing complex phenomena from simple observations.

A cause and effect methodology led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics to a greater degree than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated <a href="Balance%20of%20trade">trade surpluses</a> and <a href="Commodity%20money">specie</a> accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.

Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise early in "Essai", regarding the origins of wealth and price formation on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself "nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life." While Cantillon advocated an "intrinsic" theory of value, based on the input of land and labour (cost of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.

In "Essai", Cantillon provided an advanced version of John Locke's <a href="quantity%20theory%20of%20money">quantity theory of money</a>, focusing on relative inflation and the <a href="velocity%20of%20money">velocity of money</a>. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of <a href="Neutrality%20of%20money">non-neutral money</a>. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living at the expense of later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.

Addressing the mercantilist belief that monetary intervention could cause a perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries where there is a relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the competitiveness of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling competitiveness. Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative competitiveness. Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a <a href="zero-sum">zero-sum</a> game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.

A relatively advanced theory of interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for the risk of the possible insolvency of the debtor. In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory of interest is therefore similar to <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>'s <a href="liquidity%20preference">liquidity preference</a> theory.

Traditionally it is <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Say">Jean-Baptiste Say</a> who is credited for coining the word and advancing the concept of the entrepreneur, but in fact it was Cantillon who first introduced the term in "Essai". Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Mises">Ludwig von Mises</a>, <a href="Frank%20Knight">Frank Knight</a>, and <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the entrepreneur as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the entrepreneur brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.

Spatial economics deal with distance and area, and how these may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of spatial economics is usually ascribed to German economist <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20von%20Th%C3%BCnen">Johann Heinrich von Thünen</a>; however, Cantillon addressed spatial economics nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs. Conclusions on spatial economics were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that are more difficult to transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs. In "Essai", spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.

Apart from originating theories on the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon also provided a dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed a considerable amount of unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only as long as there are economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.

While "Essai" was not published until 1755 as a result of heavy censorship in France, it did widely circulate in the form of an unpublished manuscript between its completion and its publication. It notably influenced many direct forerunners of the <a href="classical%20economics">classical school</a> of thought, including <a href="Anne-Robert-Jacques%20Turgot%2C%20Baron%20de%20Laune">Turgot</a> and other <a href="physiocrats">physiocrats</a>. Cantillon was a major influence on physiocrat <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Quesnay">François Quesnay</a>, who may have learned of Cantillon's work through <a href="Victor%20de%20Riqueti%2C%20marquis%20de%20Mirabeau">Marquis of Mirabeau</a>. While it is evident that "Essai" influenced Quesnay, to what degree remains controversial. There is evidence that Quesnay did not fully understand, or was not completely aware of, Cantillon's theories. Many of Quesnay's economic beliefs were elucidated previously in "Essai", but Quesnay did reject a number of Cantillon's premises, including the scarcity of land and Cantillon's population theory. Also, Quesnay recognised the scarcity of capital and capital accumulation as a prerequisite for investment. Nevertheless, Cantillon was considered the "father of physiocracy" by Henry Higgs, due to his influence on Quesnay. It is also possible that Cantillon influenced Scottish economist <a href="James%20Denham-Steuart">James Steuart</a>, both directly and indirectly.

Cantillon is one of the few economists cited by Adam Smith, who directly borrows Cantillon's subsistence theory of wages. Large sections of Smith's economic theory were possibly directly influenced by Cantillon, although in many respects Adam Smith advanced well beyond the scope of Cantillon. Some economic historians have argued that Adam Smith provided little of value from his own intellect, notably Schumpeter and Rothbard. In any case, through his influence on Adam Smith and the physiocrats, Cantillon was quite possibly the pre-classical economist who contributed most to the ideas of the classical school. Illustrative of this was Cantillon's influence on Say, which is noticeable in the methodology employed in the latter's "Treatise on Political Economy".

SMS Königsberg (1905)

SMS "Königsberg" ("His Majesty's Ship "Königsberg") was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg-class%20cruiser%20%281905%29">her class</a> of <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s built by the German "<a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Kaiserliche Marine</a>" (Imperial Navy). Named after <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>, the capital of East Prussia, she was laid down in January 1905, launched in December of that year and completed by June 1906. Her <a href="ship%20class">class</a> included three other ships: , , and . "Königsberg" was armed with a main battery of ten guns and had a top speed of .

After her commissioning, "Königsberg" served with the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>'s reconnaissance force. During this period, she frequently escorted <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>'s yacht on visits to foreign countries. In April 1914, the ship was sent on what was to have been a two-year deployment to <a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a>, but this was interrupted by the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August of that year. "Königsberg" initially attempted to raid British and French commercial traffic in the region, but only destroyed one merchant ship in the course of her career. Coal shortages hampered her ability to attack shipping. On 20 September 1914, she surprised and sank the British <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zanzibar">Battle of Zanzibar</a>.

"Königsberg" then retreated into the <a href="Rufiji%20River">Rufiji River</a> to repair her engines. Before the repairs could be completed, British cruisers located "Königsberg", and, unable to steam into the river to destroy her, set up a blockade. After several attempts to sink the ship during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rufiji%20Delta">Battle of Rufiji Delta</a>, the British sent two <a href="Monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a>, and , to destroy the German cruiser. On 11 July 1915, the two monitors got close enough to severely damage "Königsberg", forcing her crew to scuttle the ship. The surviving crew salvaged all ten of her main guns and joined Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Paul%20von%20Lettow-Vorbeck">Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</a>'s guerrilla <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">campaign in East Africa</a>. "Königsberg" was partially broken up in 1963–65 for scrap, and the remains sank into the riverbed.

"Königsberg" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sisters</a> were designed to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in <a href="German%20colonial%20empire">Germany's colonial empire</a>. This was a result of budgetary constraints that prevented the "Kaiserliche Marine" from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles.

"Königsberg" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> and had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">triple-expansion steam engines</a> powered by eleven coal-fired <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s rated at . These provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . "Königsberg" had a crew of 14 officers and 308 enlisted men.

The ship was armed with ten <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">10.5 cm SK L/40 naval gun</a>s in single pedestal mounts. There were two side by side forward on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>, six <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, three on either side, and two side by side aft. The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. "Königsberg" also carried ten <a href="5.2%20cm%20SK%20L/55%20naval%20gun">SK guns</a> in single mounts. She was also equipped with a pair of <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s with five <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es submerged in the hull on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick amidships. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> sides were thick.

"Königsberg" was ordered under the contract name ""<a href="Ersatz">Ersatz</a>" " and was laid down at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">Imperial Dockyard</a> in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 12 January 1905. She was launched on 12 December 1905, when the "<a href="Lord%20Mayor">Oberbürgermeister</a>" of <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>, <a href="Siegfried%20K%C3%B6rte">Siegfried Körte</a>, christened the ship, after which <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> work commenced. She was commissioned into the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a> on 6 April 1907. Her trials were interrupted at the beginning of June when she was tasked with escorting <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>'s yacht during three sailing <a href="regatta">regatta</a>s including <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a>. The two ships then cruised the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and stopped at <a href="Nordkapp">Nordkapp</a>, where from 3 to 6 August, Wilhelm II met Czar <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II of Russia</a>. After returning to Germany, "Königsberg" resumed her sea trials, which lasted from 9 August to 9 September. She visited her namesake city from 21 to 23 September and was later assigned to the fleet scouting forces to replace the cruiser on 5 November. At this time, "Königsberg" was again used to escort Wilhelm II's yacht, this time in company with the new <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> and the dispatch boat on a visit to Britain. The ships stopped in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and the <a href="Thames">Thames</a>, and were visited by Queen <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Wilhelmina of the Netherlands</a>.

On 17 December, "Königsberg" was tasked with another goodwill visit, this time escorting the Kaiser's brother, <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281862%E2%80%931929%29">Prince Heinrich</a>, and a delegation of naval officers to <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a>, Sweden to meet King <a href="Oscar%20II%20of%20Sweden">Oscar II</a>. The visit lasted until 20 December. "Königsberg" participated in the normal peacetime routine of individual and squadron training for 1908 without incident. The year ended with a major training cruise, first in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> and North Sea and later into the Atlantic, that ended in early December. The ship then went into drydock over the winter of 1908–09 for periodic maintenance, emerging for service again in early February 1909. A typical training routine followed for the next two years, interrupted only by a collision with the new cruiser on 16 February 1910 in the <a href="Kiel%20Bay">Kiel Bay</a>, and two trips escorting the Kaiser in 1910; the first to <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> on 9–13 March and the second to Britain from 8 to 27 May. The collision with "Dresden" caused significant damage to both ships, though no one on either vessel was injured. Both ships were repaired in Kiel. "Dresden" also won the Kaiser's "Schießpreis" (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the reconnaissance force during this period. From December 1909 to September 1910, "<a href="Fregattenkapit%C3%A4n">Fregattenkapitän</a>" (Frigate Captain) <a href="Adolf%20von%20Trotha">Adolf von Trotha</a> served as the ship's commander.

From 8 March to 22 May 1911, "Königsberg" cruised in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> with Wilhelm II aboard "Hohenzollern". On 10 June, "Königsberg" was replaced in the reconnaissance force by the new cruiser ; "Königsberg" was transferred to <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, where she was placed out of service on 14 June for modernization work. On 22 January 1913, the ship was recommissioned for service with the fleet, to replace the cruiser which was also being modernized. This service lasted until 19 June, when "Königsberg" was again placed in reserve in Kiel. During this period of active service, she was assigned to the training squadron from 1 to 18 April. In early 1914, the high command decided to send "Königsberg" to <a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a>, where she would replace the current station ship, the old <a href="unprotected%20cruiser">unprotected cruiser</a> .

On 1 April 1914, "Fregattenkapitän" <a href="Max%20Looff">Max Looff</a> took command of the ship. "Königsberg" left Kiel on 25 April, stopped in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>, and then left three days later for a two-year deployment to German East Africa. She steamed into the Mediterranean Sea and stopped in Spanish and Italian ports before entering the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. After passing through the canal, she stopped briefly in <a href="Aden">Aden</a> before arriving in <a href="Dar%20es%20Salaam">Dar es Salaam</a>, the capital of German East Africa, on 5 June. Two days later, the "<a href="Schutztruppe">Schutztruppe</a>" (Protection Force) celebrated their 25th anniversary in the colony; the deputy commander of the "Schutztruppe" presented Looff with a model of the cruiser , which had been the longest serving warship with the unit. "Königsberg" surveyed the harbor at <a href="Bagamoyo">Bagamoyo</a> later in the year. The African colonial subjects considered the ship to be quite impressive, particularly her three funnels, which were assumed to signify a warship more powerful than one with only two funnels. The ship acquired the nickname "Manowari na bomba tatu", or "the man of war with three pipes".

As tensions in Europe rose in the aftermath of the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a>, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar es Salaam on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the "<a href="Admiralstab">Admiralstab</a>" (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe. Concurrently, the cruisers of the British <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope%20Station">Cape Squadron</a>, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up "Königsberg" at the colony's capital Dar es Salaam. Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day. "Königsberg" steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, "Königsberg" was ordered to attack British commerce around the entrance to the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier "Koenig" from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Portuguese East Africa</a> to deny it to "Königsberg". Looff then radioed the German steamer <a href="SS%20Zieten">"Zieten"</a> to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. "Königsberg" chased after the German freighter <a href="SS%20Goldenfels">"Goldenfels"</a>, whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. "Königsberg" was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of "Goldenfels" to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.

On 6 August, "Königsberg" found a British ship off the coast of <a href="Oman">Oman</a>, the freighter "City of Winchester". A <a href="prize%20crew">prize crew</a> took the ship along with "Königsberg", and the two vessels met "Zieten" four days later in the <a href="Khuriya%20Muriya%20Islands">Khuriya Muriya Islands</a>, where coal from "City of Winchester" was transferred to "Königsberg". The freighter was thereafter sunk. The British crew was taken aboard "Zieten", which departed the following day and stopped in <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>. Meanwhile, the steamer "Somali", under the command of "<a href="Korvettenkapit%C3%A4n">Korvettenkapitän</a>" (Corvette Captain) Zimmer, had left Dar es Salaam with a cargo of of coal on the night of 3–4 August to resupply "Königsberg"; the two ships met ten days later. By the time Looff rendezvoused with "Somali", his ship was down to a mere of coal. "Somali" transferred some of coal to the cruiser, which permitted a sweep to Madagascar. No British or French ships were found, however, and so "Königsberg" met "Somali" again on 23 August and took on coal for four days of cruising.

In the meantime, British warships bombarded Dar es Salaam and destroyed the German wireless station there. By this time, "Königsberg"s engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff needed to find a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the <a href="Rufiji%20River">Rufiji</a> Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the <a href="survey%20ship">survey ship</a> "Möwe". On 3 September 1914 at high tide, "Königsberg" passed over the <a href="Shoal">bar</a> at the mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed at the mouth of the river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply "Königsberg", observed a British cruiser—"Pegasus"—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at <a href="Zanzibar">Zanzibar</a> on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the <a href="Congo%20Act%20of%201885">Congo Act of 1885</a>.

On 19 September, "Königsberg" left the Rufiji and arrived off Zanzibar the following morning. She opened fire at a range of about at 05:10, starting the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zanzibar">Battle of Zanzibar</a>; within 45 minutes, "Pegasus" caught fire, rolled over to port, and sank. Crewmen aboard "Pegasus" had raised a <a href="white%20flag">white flag</a>, but it could not be seen aboard "Königsberg" due to the heavy smoke. "Pegasus"s crew suffered 38 dead and 55 wounded, while "Königsberg" was undamaged and had no casualties. After sinking "Pegasus", "Königsberg" bombarded the wireless station and dumped barrels filled with sand into the harbor entrance to simulate <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>. While leaving the harbor, "Königsberg" spotted the picket ship "Helmut" and sank her with three shells.

The cruiser then returned to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar es Salaam where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.

Concerned with the threat "Königsberg" posed to troop transports from India, the British reinforced the flotilla tasked with tracking down the elusive German raider, and placed the ships under the command of Captain <a href="Sidney%20Robert%20Drury-Lowe">Sidney R. Drury-Lowe</a>. The sinking of "Pegasus" convinced the British that "Königsberg" must still be in German East Africa. On 19 October, the cruiser found the German East Africa Line ship "Präsident" at <a href="Lindi">Lindi</a>. A boarding party searched the ship and discovered documents indicating she had supplied "Königsberg" with coal in the Rufiji the previous month. On 30 October, the cruiser located "Königsberg" and "Somali" in the delta. The cruisers "Chatham", "Dartmouth", and blockaded the Rufiji Delta to ensure "Königsberg" could not escape.

On 3 November, the British began a bombardment in an attempt to destroy or neutralize "Königsberg" and "Somali". "Königsberg" was protected by the thick <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> swamps, which concealed the ship and offered a degree of cover from British shellfire, especially while the British ships remained outside the river. A collier, "Newbridge", was converted into a <a href="blockship">blockship</a> to be sunk in the main channel of the delta to prevent "Königsberg"s escape. Despite heavy German fire from both sides of the river, the British successfully sank "Newbridge" across one of the delta mouths on 10 November, though the German raider could still put to sea via other channels. Looff decided to move his ship further upriver, to make it more difficult for the British to destroy her. In doing so, his ship would occupy a disproportionate number of British vessels that could otherwise have been employed elsewhere. In the course of the campaign, the British reinforced the squadron blockading the Rufiji with additional cruisers, including and the Australian .

A civilian pilot, Denis Cutler of <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, was commissioned into the Royal Marines and persuaded to make his private <a href="Curtiss%20Aeroplane%20and%20Motor%20Company">Curtiss</a> <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> available for the British Empire. The Royal Navy requisitioned the passenger ship to serve as a makeshift <a href="Seaplane%20tender">tender</a> for Cutler's aircraft. On his first attempt to locate the cruiser, Cutler, who did not have a compass, got lost and was forced to land on a desert island. On his second flight, he successfully located "Königsberg", and a third flight with a Royal Navy observer confirmed his observations. His aircraft's radiator was damaged on the flight and he was grounded until replacement parts could be brought from Mombasa. A pair of <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> <a href="Sopwith%20Aviation%20Company">Sopwiths</a> were brought up with the intention of scouting and even bombing the ship. They soon fell apart in the tropical conditions. A trio of <a href="Short%20Brothers">Short</a> seaplanes fared a little better, though they too were quickly disabled by the conditions.

Also in November, the British sought to use the guns of the old battleship to sink the cruiser. The attempt was unsuccessful, once again because the shallow waters prevented the battleship from getting within range. In December, "<a href="Oberstleutnant">Oberstleutnant</a>" (Lieutenant Colonel) <a href="Paul%20von%20Lettow-Vorbeck">Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</a> requested as many crew members from the ship as possible for the <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">East Africa Campaign</a> against the British; a total of 220 men were left aboard to keep the ship in fighting condition. This was not enough, however, to permit the ship to go to sea. "Königsberg" moved further up the river on 18 December. On 23 December, the British used a pair of shallow-draft ships to sail up the delta. They hit "Somali" once before German defensive fire forced them to retreat.
In the meantime, conditions were deteriorating on "Königsberg". There were shortages of coal, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Although safe from the British, the crew was ravaged by <a href="malaria">malaria</a> and other tropical ailments. Generally cut off from the outside world, the morale of the sailors fell. However, the situation was marginally improved with a scheme to resupply the ship and give her a fighting chance to return home. A captured British merchant ship, "Rubens", was renamed "Kronborg". It was given a <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> flag, papers, and a crew of German sailors selected for their ability to speak <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a>. It was then packed with coal, field guns, ammunition, small arms, and various supplies. As the freighter approached East Africa, "Königsberg" prepared to sortie to meet the ship and attempt to break out and return to Germany. Instead, "Königsberg" was trapped in the river by two cruisers and several smaller vessels. "Hyacinth" intercepted "Kronborg" as she approached, and chased her to <a href="Manza%20Bay">Manza Bay</a>. The trapped ship was forced aground and set on fire, but the Germans salvaged much of her cargo and put it to use later in the East Africa Campaign.

Finally, in April 1915, the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> agreed to a plan submitted by Drury-Lowe the previous November, which envisioned attacking the German cruiser with shallow-draft <a href="Monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a>, capable of navigating the Rufiji River. Two of the warships, and , armed with a pair of guns each, were brought from Britain. "Königsberg" had in the meantime been moved a third time, even further upriver. On 6 July 1915, the two monitors crossed the outer sandbar and steamed up the river, despite heavy fire from German positions on the river banks. They stopped at a point they thought to be from "Königsberg", which would be in range of their own guns but farther than the smaller German guns could reply. Aircraft were used to spot the fall of shot. The monitors' navigation was faulty, however, and after opening fire, they found themselves to be within range of "Königsberg"s guns. She hit "Mersey" twice in the engagement; one shell disabled the forward 6-inch gun, and another holed the ship below the waterline. "Königsberg" was hit four times in return, one shell striking beneath the waterline and causing some flooding. In the span of three hours, "Königsberg" forced both British ships to withdraw.
They returned again on 11 July, after having repaired the damage sustained in the first attempt. The two monitors conducted a five-hour bombardment. "Königsberg" opened fire at 12:12, initially with four guns, but only three guns remained in action after 12:42, two guns after 12:44, and one gun after 12:53. The two monitors did not respond until 12:31, once they had been anchored into their firing positions, and scored several serious hits that caused a major fire at the ship's stern and inflicted heavy casualties. By 13:40, "Königsberg" had run low on ammunition and her gun crews had suffered very heavy casualties, and so Looff ordered the crew to abandon ship and to drop the <a href="breech%20block">breech block</a>s for the guns overboard to disable them. Two torpedo warheads were detonated in the ship's bow to <a href="Scuttling">scuttle</a> her; the ship rolled over slightly to starboard and sank up to the upper deck with her flags still flying. Nineteen men had been killed in the battle, with another forty-five wounded, including Looff.

Later that day, the crew returned to haul down the ship's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day. The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; together with the ship's crew, they went on to see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow-Vorbeck. All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry <a href="MV%20Liemba">"Götzen"</a> of the inland <a href="Lake%20Tanganyika">Lake Tanganyika</a> fleet. The surviving sailors, organized as the "Königsberg-Abteilung" (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the <a href="Brandenburg%20Gate">Brandenburg Gate</a> in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.
In 1924, John Ingle, the former captain of "Pegasus", was tasked with clearing wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, he bought the salvage rights to "Königsberg" for the price of £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5 cm guns are preserved, one in <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>, South Africa, one in <a href="Jinja%2C%20Uganda">Jinja, Uganda</a>, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from "Pegasus".

Philip Seymour Hoffman

Philip Seymour Hoffman (July 23, 1967 – February 2, 2014) was an American actor, director, and producer. Best known for his distinctive supporting and <a href="character%20actor">character roles</a> – typically lowlifes, eccentrics, bullies, and misfits – Hoffman acted in many films from the early 1990s until his death in 2014.

Drawn to theater as a teenager, Hoffman studied acting at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>'s <a href="Tisch%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">Tisch School of the Arts</a>. He began his screen career in a 1991 episode of "<a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order">Law & Order</a>" and started to appear in films in 1992. He gained recognition for his supporting work, notably in "<a href="Scent%20of%20a%20Woman%20%281992%20film%29">Scent of a Woman</a>" (1992), "<a href="Boogie%20Nights">Boogie Nights</a>" (1997), "<a href="Happiness%20%281998%20film%29">Happiness</a>" (1998), "<a href="Patch%20Adams%20%28film%29">Patch Adams</a>" (1998), "<a href="The%20Big%20Lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a>" (1998), "<a href="Magnolia%20%28film%29">Magnolia</a>" (1999), "<a href="The%20Talented%20Mr.%20Ripley%20%28film%29">The Talented Mr. Ripley</a>" (1999), "<a href="Almost%20Famous">Almost Famous</a>" (2000), "<a href="Punch-Drunk%20Love">Punch-Drunk Love</a>" (2002), and "<a href="Along%20Came%20Polly">Along Came Polly</a>" (2004). He began to occasionally play leading roles, and for his portrayal of the author <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a> in "<a href="Capote%20%28film%29">Capote</a>" (2005), won multiple accolades, including the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>. Hoffman's profile continued to grow, and he received three more Oscar nominations for his supporting work as a brutally frank CIA officer in "<a href="Charlie%20Wilson%27s%20War%20%28film%29">Charlie Wilson's War</a>" (2007), a priest accused of <a href="pedophilia">pedophilia</a> in "<a href="Doubt%20%282008%20film%29">Doubt</a>" (2008), and the charismatic leader of a <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>-type movement in "<a href="The%20Master%20%282012%20film%29">The Master</a>" (2012).

While he mainly worked in <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a>s, including "<a href="The%20Savages%20%28film%29">The Savages</a>" (2007) and "<a href="Synecdoche%2C%20New%20York">Synecdoche, New York</a>" (2008), Hoffman also appeared in "Flawless" (1999), and <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> blockbusters such as "<a href="Twister%20%281996%20film%29">Twister</a>" (1996) and "" (2006), and in one of his final roles, as <a href="Plutarch%20Heavensbee">Plutarch Heavensbee</a> in the "<a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%20series%29">Hunger Games</a>" series (2013–15). The feature "<a href="Jack%20Goes%20Boating%20%28film%29">Jack Goes Boating</a>" (2010) marked his debut as a filmmaker. Hoffman was also an accomplished theater actor and director. He joined the <a href="off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a> <a href="LAByrinth%20Theater%20Company">LAByrinth Theater Company</a> in 1995, where he directed, produced, and appeared in numerous stage productions. His performances in three <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> plays – "<a href="True%20West%20%28play%29">True West</a>" in 2000, "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>" in 2003, and "<a href="Death%20of%20a%20Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a>" in 2012 – all led to <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> nominations.

Hoffman struggled with drug addiction as a young adult and relapsed in 2013 after many years of abstinence. In February 2014, he died of <a href="combined%20drug%20intoxication">combined drug intoxication</a>. Remembered for his fearlessness in playing reprehensible characters, and for bringing depth and humanity to such roles, Hoffman was described in his "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" obituary as "perhaps the most ambitious and widely admired American actor of his generation".

Hoffman was born on July 23, 1967, in the <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester</a> suburb of <a href="Fairport%2C%20New%20York">Fairport, New York</a>. His mother, Marilyn O'Connor (née Loucks), came from nearby <a href="Waterloo%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Waterloo</a> and worked as an elementary school teacher before becoming a lawyer and eventually a <a href="family%20court">family court</a> judge. His father, Gordon Stowell Hoffman, who was of German descent, was a native of <a href="Geneva%2C%20New%20York">Geneva, New York</a>, and worked for the <a href="Xerox%20Corporation">Xerox Corporation</a>. Along with one brother, <a href="Gordy%20Hoffman">Gordy</a>, Hoffman has two sisters, Jill and Emily.

Hoffman was baptized a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> and attended <a href="Mass%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Mass</a> as a child, but did not have a heavily religious upbringing. His parents divorced when he was nine, and the children were raised primarily by their mother. Hoffman's childhood passion was sports, particularly wrestling and baseball, but at age 12, he saw a stage production of <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a>'s "<a href="All%20My%20Sons">All My Sons</a>" and was transfixed. He recalled in 2008, "I was changed – permanently changed – by that experience. It was like a miracle to me". Hoffman developed a love for the theater, and proceeded to attend regularly with his mother, who was a lifelong enthusiast. He remembered that productions of "<a href="Quilters%20%28musical%29">Quilters</a>" and "<a href="Stoo%20Hample">Alms for the Middle Class</a>", the latter starring a teenaged <a href="Robert%20Downey%2C%20Jr.">Robert Downey, Jr.</a>, were also particularly inspirational. At the age of 14, Hoffman suffered a neck injury that ended his sporting activity, and he began to consider acting. Encouraged by his mother, he joined a drama club, and initially committed to it because he was attracted to a female member.

Acting gradually became a passion for Hoffman: "I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when I decided it was what I wanted to do." At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 <a href="New%20York%20State%20Summer%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">New York State Summer School of the Arts</a> in <a href="Saratoga%20Springs%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga Springs</a>, where he met his future collaborators <a href="Bennett%20Miller">Bennett Miller</a> and <a href="Dan%20Futterman">Dan Futterman</a>. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: "We were attracted to the fact that he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate." Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>'s (NYU) <a href="Tisch%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">Tisch School of the Arts</a>. Between starting on the program and graduating from <a href="Fairport%20High%20School">Fairport High School</a>, he continued his training at the <a href="Circle%20in%20the%20Square%20Theatre">Circle in the Square Theatre</a>'s summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an <a href="Usher%20%28occupation%29">usher</a>. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.

After graduating, Hoffman worked in off-Broadway theater and made additional money with customer service jobs. He made his screen debut in 1991, in a "<a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order">Law & Order</a>" episode called "<a href="The%20Violence%20of%20Summer%20%28Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order%29">The Violence of Summer</a>", playing a man accused of rape. His first cinema role came the following year, when he was credited as "Phil Hoffman" in the <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a> "<a href="Triple%20Bogey%20on%20a%20Par%20Five%20Hole">Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole</a>". After this, he adopted his grandfather's name, Seymour, to avoid confusion with another actor. More film roles promptly followed, with appearances in the studio production "<a href="My%20New%20Gun">My New Gun</a>", and a small role in the comedy "<a href="Leap%20of%20Faith%20%28film%29">Leap of Faith</a>", starring <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a>. Following these roles, he gained attention playing a spoiled student in the Oscar-winning <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a> film "<a href="Scent%20of%20a%20Woman%20%281992%20film%29">Scent of a Woman</a>" (1992). Hoffman auditioned five times for his role, which "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" journalist Ryan Gilbey says gave him an early opportunity "to indulge his skill for making unctuousness compelling". The film earned US$134 million worldwide and was the first to get Hoffman noticed. Reflecting on "Scent of a Woman", Hoffman later said "If I hadn't gotten into that film, I wouldn't be where I am today." At this time, he abandoned his job in a <a href="delicatessen">delicatessen</a> to become a professional actor.

Hoffman continued playing small roles throughout the early 1990s. After appearing in "<a href="Joey%20Breaker">Joey Breaker</a>" and the critically panned teen zombie picture "<a href="My%20Boyfriend%27s%20Back%20%281993%20film%29">My Boyfriend's Back</a>", he had a more notable role playing <a href="John%20Cusack">John Cusack</a>'s wealthy friend in the crime comedy "<a href="Money%20for%20Nothing%20%281993%20film%29">Money for Nothing</a>". In 1994, he portrayed an inexperienced mobster in the crime thriller "<a href="The%20Getaway%20%281994%20film%29">The Getaway</a>", starring <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a> and <a href="Kim%20Basinger">Kim Basinger</a>, and he subsequently appeared with <a href="Andy%20Garc%C3%ADa">Andy García</a> and <a href="Meg%20Ryan">Meg Ryan</a> in the romantic drama "<a href="When%20a%20Man%20Loves%20a%20Woman%20%28film%29">When a Man Loves a Woman</a>". He then played an uptight police deputy who gets punched by <a href="Paul%20Newman">Paul Newman</a> – one of Hoffman's acting idols – in the drama "<a href="Nobody%27s%20Fool%20%281994%20film%29">Nobody's Fool</a>".

Still considering stage work to be fundamental to his career, Hoffman joined the <a href="LAByrinth%20Theater%20Company">LAByrinth Theater Company</a> of New York City in 1995. This association lasted the remainder of his life; along with appearing in multiple productions, he later became co-artistic director of the theater company with <a href="John%20Ortiz">John Ortiz</a>, and directed various plays over the years. Hoffman's only film appearance of 1995 was in the 22-minute short comedy "The Fifteen Minute Hamlet", which satirized the film industry in an Elizabethan setting. He played the characters of Bernardo, Horatio, and Laertes alongside <a href="Austin%20Pendleton">Austin Pendleton</a>'s Hamlet.

Between April and May 1996, Hoffman appeared at the <a href="Joseph%20Papp%20Public%20Theater">Joseph Papp Public Theater</a> in a <a href="Mark%20Wing-Davey">Mark Wing-Davey</a> production of <a href="Caryl%20Churchill">Caryl Churchill</a>'s "<a href="The%20Skriker">The Skriker</a>". Following this, based on his work in "Scent of a Woman", he was cast by writer–director <a href="Paul%20Thomas%20Anderson">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> to appear in his debut feature "<a href="Hard%20Eight%20%28film%29">Hard Eight</a>" (1996). Hoffman had only a brief role in the crime thriller, playing a cocksure young <a href="craps">craps</a> player, but it began the most important collaboration of his career.
Before cementing his creative partnership with Anderson, Hoffman appeared in one of the year's biggest blockbusters, "<a href="Twister%20%281996%20film%29">Twister</a>", playing a grubby, hyperactive <a href="Storm%20chasing">storm chaser</a> alongside <a href="Helen%20Hunt">Helen Hunt</a> and <a href="Bill%20Paxton">Bill Paxton</a>. According to a "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" survey of <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> users, "Twister" is the film with which Hoffman is most popularly associated. He then reunited with Anderson for the director's second feature, "Boogie Nights", about the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Pornography">Golden Age of Pornography</a>. The ensemble-piece starred <a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a>, <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a>, and <a href="Burt%20Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>; Hoffman played a <a href="Boom%20operator%20%28media%29">boom operator</a>, described by David Fear of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" as a "complete, unabashed loser", who attempts to seduce Wahlberg's character. Warmly received by critics, the film grew into a <a href="cult%20classic">cult classic</a>, and it has been cited as the role in which Hoffman first showed his full ability. Fear commended the "naked emotional neediness" of the performance, adding that it made for compulsive viewing. Hoffman later expressed his appreciation for Anderson when he called the director "incomparable".

Continuing with this momentum, Hoffman appeared in five films in 1998. He had supporting roles in the crime thriller "<a href="Montana%20%281998%20film%29">Montana</a>" and the romantic comedy "<a href="Next%20Stop%20Wonderland">Next Stop Wonderland</a>", both of which were commercial failures, before working with the <a href="Joel%20and%20Ethan%20Coen">Coen brothers</a> in their dark comedy "<a href="The%20Big%20Lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a>". Hoffman had long been a fan of the directors, and relished the experience of working with them. Appearing alongside <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> and <a href="John%20Goodman">John Goodman</a>, Hoffman played Brandt, the smug personal assistant of the titular character. Although it was only a small role, he claimed it was one for which he was most recognized, in a film that has achieved cult status and a large fan base. Between March and April 1998, Hoffman made 30 appearances on stage at the <a href="New%20York%20Theatre%20Workshop">New York Theatre Workshop</a> in a production of <a href="Mark%20Ravenhill">Mark Ravenhill</a>'s "<a href="Shopping%20and%20Fucking">Shopping and Fucking</a>", portraying an ex-heroin addict.

Hoffman took an unflattering role in <a href="Todd%20Solondz">Todd Solondz</a>'s "<a href="Happiness%20%281998%20film%29">Happiness</a>" (1998), a misanthropic comedy about the lives of three sisters and those around them. He played Allen, a strange loner who makes crude phone calls to women; the character furiously masturbates during one conversation, producing what film scholar Jerry Mosher calls an "embarrassingly raw performance". Jake Coyle of the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> rated Allen as one of the creepiest characters in American cinema, but critic Xan Brooks highlighted the pathos that Hoffman brought to the role. "Happiness" was controversial but widely praised, and Hoffman's role has been cited by critics as one of his best. His final 1998 release was more mainstream, as he appeared as a medical graduate in the <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a> comedy "<a href="Patch%20Adams%20%28film%29">Patch Adams</a>". The film was critically panned, but one of the highest-grossing of Hoffman's career.

In 1999, Hoffman starred opposite <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> as <a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a> Rusty Zimmerman in <a href="Joel%20Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a>'s drama "<a href="Flawless%20%281999%20film%29">Flawless</a>". Hoffman considered De Niro the most imposing actor with whom he had appeared, and he felt that working with the veteran performer profoundly improved his own acting. Hoffman's ability to avoid clichés in playing such a delicate role was noted by critics, and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> said it confirmed him as "one of the best new character actors". He was rewarded with his first <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award">Screen Actors Guild Award</a> nomination. Hoffman then reunited with Paul Thomas Anderson, where he was given an atypically virtuous role in the ensemble drama "<a href="Magnolia%20%28film%29">Magnolia</a>". The film, set over one day in Los Angeles, features Hoffman as a nurse who cares for <a href="Jason%20Robards">Jason Robards</a>' character. The performance was approved of by the medical industry, and Jessica Winter of the "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" considered it Hoffman's most indelible work, likening him to a guardian angel in his caring for the dying father. "Magnolia" has been included in lists of the greatest films of all time, and it was a personal favorite of Hoffman's.

One of the most critically and commercially successful films of Hoffman's career was "<a href="The%20Talented%20Mr.%20Ripley%20%28film%29">The Talented Mr. Ripley</a>" (1999), which he considered "as edgy as you can get for a Hollywood movie". He played a "preppy bully" who taunts <a href="Matt%20Damon">Matt Damon</a>'s Ripley in the thriller, a character which Jeff Simon of "The Buffalo News" called "the truest upper class twit in all of American movies". Hoffman's performance caught the attention of <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a> – another of his cinematic idols – with his performance: "I sat up straight in my seat and said, 'Who is that?' I thought to myself: My God, this actor is fearless. He's done what we all strive for – he's given this awful character the respect he deserves, and he's made him fascinating." In recognition of his work in "Magnolia" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley", Hoffman was named the year's <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a> by the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review">National Board of Review</a>.

Following a string of roles in successful films in the late 1990s, Hoffman had established a reputation as a top supporting player who could be relied on to make an impression with each performance. His film appearances were likened by David Kamp of "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" to "discovering a prize in a box of cereal, receiving a bonus, or bumping unexpectedly into an old friend". According to Jerry Mosher, as the year 2000 began, "it seemed Hoffman was everywhere, poised on the cusp of stardom".

Hoffman had begun to be recognized as a theater actor in 1999, when he received a <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award">Drama Desk Award</a> nomination for <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Featured%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Outstanding Featured Actor</a> for the off-Broadway play "The Author's Voice". This success continued with the 2000 Broadway revival of <a href="Sam%20Shepard">Sam Shepard</a>'s "<a href="True%20West%20%28play%29">True West</a>", where Hoffman alternated roles nightly with co-star <a href="John%20C.%20Reilly">John C. Reilly</a>, making 154 appearances between March and July 2000. <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> of "The New York Times" felt that it was the best stage performance of Hoffman's career, calling him "brilliant", and the actor earned a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> nomination for <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Best Actor in a Play</a>. The following year, Hoffman appeared with Meryl Streep, <a href="Natalie%20Portman">Natalie Portman</a>, and John Goodman in a <a href="Delacorte%20Theater">Delacorte Theater</a> production of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>'s "<a href="The%20Seagull">The Seagull</a>" – although Brantley felt that this performance was less fully realized. As a stage director, Hoffman received two Drama Desk Award nominations for <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Director%20of%20a%20Play">Outstanding Director of a Play</a>: one for "<a href="Jesus%20Hopped%20the%20%27A%27%20Train">Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train</a>" in 2001, and another for "Our Lady of 121st Street" in 2003. In a 2008 interview, Hoffman opined that "switching hats" between acting and directing helped him improve in both roles.

<a href="David%20Mamet">David Mamet</a>'s comedy "<a href="State%20and%20Main">State and Main</a>", about the difficulties of shooting a film in rural <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, was Hoffman's first film role of 2000 and had a limited release. He had a more prominent supporting role that year in "<a href="Almost%20Famous">Almost Famous</a>", <a href="Cameron%20Crowe">Cameron Crowe</a>'s popular <a href="Coming-of-age%20film">coming-of-age</a> film set in the 1970s music industry. Hoffman portrayed the enthusiastic rock critic <a href="Lester%20Bangs">Lester Bangs</a>, a task by which he felt burdened, but he managed to convey the real figure's mannerisms and sharp wit after watching him in a BBC interview. The following year, Hoffman featured as the narrator and interviewer in "<a href="The%20Party%27s%20Over%20%282001%20film%29">The Party's Over</a>", a documentary about the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">2000 U.S. elections</a>. He assumed the position of a "politically informed and alienated <a href="Generation%20X">Generation-Xer</a>" who seeks to be educated in U.S. politics, but ultimately reveals the extent of public dissatisfaction in this area.

In 2002, Hoffman was given his first leading role (despite joking at the time "Even if I was hired into a leading-man part, I'd probably turn it into the non-leading-man part") in <a href="Todd%20Louiso">Todd Louiso</a>'s tragicomedy "<a href="Love%20Liza">Love Liza</a>" (2002). His brother Gordy wrote the script, which Hoffman had seen at their mother's house five years earlier, about a widower who starts sniffing gasoline to cope with his wife's suicide. He considered it the finest piece of writing he had ever read, "incredibly humble in its exploration of grief", but critics were less enthusiastic about the production. A review for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> wrote that Hoffman had finally been given a part that showed "what he's truly capable of", but few witnessed this as the film had a limited release and earned only US$210,000.

Later in 2002, Hoffman starred opposite <a href="Adam%20Sandler">Adam Sandler</a> and <a href="Emily%20Watson">Emily Watson</a> in Anderson's critically acclaimed fourth picture, the surrealist romantic comedy-drama "<a href="Punch-Drunk%20Love">Punch-Drunk Love</a>" (2002), where he played an illegal phone-sex "supervisor". Drew Hunt of the "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>" saw the performance as a fine example of Hoffman's "knack for turning small roles into seminal performances" and praised the actor's comedic ability. In a very different film, Hoffman was next seen with <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> in the high-budget thriller "<a href="Red%20Dragon%20%282002%20film%29">Red Dragon</a>", a prequel to "<a href="The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs%20%28film%29">The Silence of the Lambs</a>", portraying the meddlesome tabloid journalist <a href="Freddy%20Lounds">Freddy Lounds</a>. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in <a href="Spike%20Lee">Spike Lee</a>'s drama "<a href="25th%20Hour">25th Hour</a>", playing an English teacher who makes a devastating drunken mistake. Both Lee and the film's lead <a href="Edward%20Norton">Edward Norton</a> were thrilled to work with Hoffman, and Lee confessed that he had long wanted to do a picture with the actor, but had waited until he found the right role. Hoffman considered his character, Jakob, to be one of the most reticent characters he had ever played, a straight-laced "corduroy-pants-wearing kind of guy." Roger Ebert promoted "25th Hour" to one of his "Great Movies" in 2009, and along with A. O. Scott, considered it to be one of the best films of the 2000s.

The drama "<a href="Owning%20Mahowny">Owning Mahowny</a>" (2003) gave Hoffman his second lead role, starring opposite <a href="Minnie%20Driver">Minnie Driver</a> as a bank employee who <a href="embezzle">embezzle</a>s money to feed his <a href="gambling%20addiction">gambling addiction</a>. Based on the true story of Toronto banker <a href="Brian%20Molony">Brian Molony</a>, who committed the largest fraud in Canadian history, Hoffman met with Molony to prepare for the role and help him play the character as accurately as possible. He was determined not to conform to "movie character" stereotypes, and his portrayal of addiction won approval from the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Psychiatrists">Royal College of Psychiatrists</a>. Roger Ebert assessed Hoffman's performance as "a masterpiece of discipline and precision," but the film earned little at the box office.

Hoffman's second 2003 appearance was a small role in <a href="Anthony%20Minghella">Anthony Minghella</a>'s successful <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> epic "<a href="Cold%20Mountain%20%28film%29">Cold Mountain</a>". He played an immoral preacher, a complex character that Hoffman described as a "mass of contradictions". The same year, from April to August, he appeared with <a href="Vanessa%20Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a> in a Broadway revival of <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>'s "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>". Director <a href="Robert%20Falls">Robert Falls</a> later commented on the dedication and experience that Hoffman brought to his role of alcoholic Jamie Tyrone: "Every night he ripped it up to an extent that he couldn't leave [the role]. Phil carried it with him." Hoffman received his second Tony Award nomination, this time for <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Featured%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Best Featured Actor in a Play</a>. In 2004, he appeared as the crude, has-been actor friend of <a href="Ben%20Stiller">Ben Stiller</a>'s character in the box-office hit "<a href="Along%20Came%20Polly">Along Came Polly</a>". Reflecting on the role, "People" said it proved that "Hoffman could deliver comedic performances with the best of them".

A turning point in Hoffman's career came with the biographical film "<a href="Capote%20%28film%29">Capote</a>" (2005), which dramatized <a href="Truman%20Capote">Truman Capote</a>'s experience of writing his <a href="true%20crime">true crime</a> novel "<a href="In%20Cold%20Blood">In Cold Blood</a>" (1966). Hoffman took the title role for a project that he co-produced and helped come to fruition. Portraying the idiosyncratic writer proved highly demanding, requiring significant weight loss and four months of research – such as watching video clips of Capote to help him affect the author's effeminate voice and mannerisms. Hoffman stated that he was not concerned with perfectly imitating Capote's speech, but he did feel a great duty to "express the vitality and the nuances" of the writer. During filming, he stayed in character constantly so as not to lose the voice and posture: "Otherwise," he explained, "I would give my body a chance to bail on me." "Capote" was released to great acclaim, particularly regarding Hoffman's performance. Many critics commented that the role was designed to win awards, and indeed Hoffman received an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Oscar</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Drama">Golden Globe</a>, <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Male%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA</a>, and various other critics' awards. In 2006, "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>" listed his role in "Capote" as the 35th-greatest movie performance of all time. After the film, several commentators began to describe Hoffman as one of the finest, most ambitious actors of his generation.

Hoffman received his only <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> nomination for his supporting role in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> miniseries "<a href="Empire%20Falls%20%28miniseries%29">Empire Falls</a>" (2005), about life in a New England town. He ultimately lost to castmate Paul Newman. In 2006, he appeared in the summer blockbuster "", playing the villainous arms dealer Owen Davian opposite <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>. A journalist for "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" stated that Hoffman's "black-hat performance was one of the most delicious in a Hollywood film since <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a>'s in "<a href="Die%20Hard">Die Hard</a>" ", and he was generally approved of for bringing gravitas to the action film. With a gross of nearly US$400 million, it exposed Hoffman to a mainstream audience.

Returning to independent films in 2007, Hoffman began with a starring role in <a href="Tamara%20Jenkins">Tamara Jenkins</a>'s "<a href="The%20Savages%20%28film%29">The Savages</a>", where <a href="Laura%20Linney">Laura Linney</a> and he played siblings responsible for putting their dementia-ridden father (<a href="Philip%20Bosco">Philip Bosco</a>) in a care home. Jake Coyle of the Associated Press stated that it was "the epitome of a Hoffman film: a mix of comedy and tragedy told with subtlety, bone-dry humor, and flashes of grace". Hoffman received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in "The Savages". He next appeared in "<a href="Before%20the%20Devil%20Knows%20You%27re%20Dead">Before the Devil Knows You're Dead</a>", the final film by veteran director <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>, where he played a <a href="Real%20estate%20broker">realtor</a> who embezzles funds from his employer to support his drug habit. Mosher comments that the character was one of the most unpleasant of Hoffman's career, but that his "fearlessness again revealed the humanity within a deeply flawed character" as he appeared naked in the opening sex scene. The film was received positively by critics as a powerful and affecting thriller.

<a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>'s political film "<a href="Charlie%20Wilson%27s%20War%20%28film%29">Charlie Wilson's War</a>" (2007) gave Hoffman his second Academy Award nomination, again for playing a real individual – <a href="Gust%20Avrakotos">Gust Avrakotos</a>, the <a href="CIA">CIA</a> agent who conspired with <a href="Charlie%20Wilson%20%28Texas%20politician%29">Congressman Charlie Wilson</a> (played by <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>) to aid Afghani rebels in their <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">fight against the Soviet Union</a>. Todd McCarthy wrote of Hoffman's performance: "Decked out with a pouffy '80s hairdo, moustache, protruding gut and ever-present smokes ... whenever he's on, the picture vibrates with conspiratorial electricity." The film was a critical and commercial success, and along with his Oscar nomination for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a>, Hoffman was nominated for a <a href="BAFTA%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">BAFTA</a> and a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor%20-%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe Award</a>.

The year 2008 contained two significant Hoffman roles. In <a href="Charlie%20Kaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a>'s enigmatic drama "<a href="Synecdoche%2C%20New%20York">Synecdoche, New York</a>", he starred as Caden Cotard, a frustrated dramatist who attempts to build a scale replica of New York inside a warehouse for a play. Hoffman again showed his willingness to reveal unattractive traits, as the character ages and deteriorates, and committed to a deeply psychological role. Critics were divided in their response to the "ambitious and baffling" film. Sonny Bunch of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" found it "impressionistic, inaccessible, and endlessly frustrating", likening Hoffman's character to "God, if God lacked imagination". Roger Ebert, on the contrary, named it the best film of the decade and considered it one of the greatest of all time, and <a href="Robbie%20Collin">Robbie Collin</a>, film critic for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", believes Hoffman gave one of cinema's best performances.

Hoffman's second role of the year came opposite Meryl Streep and <a href="Amy%20Adams">Amy Adams</a> in <a href="John%20Patrick%20Shanley">John Patrick Shanley</a>'s "Doubt", where he played Father Brendan Flynn – a priest accused of <a href="child%20sexual%20abuse">sexually abusing</a> a 12-year-old African American student in the 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with <a href="Doubt%20%28play%29">the play</a> and appreciated the opportunity to bring it to the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to a priest who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of "The Guardian" suspicious of it as <a href="Oscar%20bait">Oscar bait</a>, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Male%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role%20-%20Motion%20Picture">Screen Actors Guild</a>.

On stage in 2009, Hoffman played <a href="Iago">Iago</a> in <a href="Peter%20Sellars">Peter Sellars</a>' futuristic production of "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>" (with the title role by <a href="John%20Ortiz">John Ortiz</a>), which received mixed reviews. Ben Brantley, theatre critic of "The New York Times", found it to be "exasperatingly misconceived", remarking that even when Hoffman is attempting to "manipulate others into self-destruction, he comes close to spoiling everything by erupting into genuine, volcanic fury". Hoffman also did his first <a href="Voice%20acting">vocal performance</a> for the <a href="claymation">claymation</a> film "<a href="Mary%20and%20Max">Mary and Max</a>", although the film did not initially have an American release. He played Max, a depressed New Yorker with <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, while <a href="Toni%20Collette">Toni Collette</a> voiced Mary – the Australian girl who becomes his <a href="pen%20pal">pen pal</a>. Continuing with animation, Hoffman then worked on an episode of the children's show "<a href="Arthur%20%28TV%20series%29">Arthur</a>" and received a <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award">Daytime Emmy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performer%20In%20An%20Animated%20Program">Outstanding Performer In An Animated Program</a>. Later in the year, he played a brash American disc jockey opposite <a href="Bill%20Nighy">Bill Nighy</a> and <a href="Rhys%20Ifans">Rhys Ifans</a> in <a href="Richard%20Curtis">Richard Curtis</a>'s British comedy "<a href="The%20Boat%20That%20Rocked">The Boat That Rocked</a>" (also known as "Pirate Radio") – a character based on <a href="Emperor%20Rosko">Emperor Rosko</a>, a host of <a href="Radio%20Caroline">Radio Caroline</a> in 1966. He also had a <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> role as a bartender in <a href="Ricky%20Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a>'s "<a href="The%20Invention%20of%20Lying">The Invention of Lying</a>".

Reflecting on Hoffman's work in the late 2000s, Mosher writes that the actor remained impressive, but had not delivered a testing performance on the level of his work in "Capote". The film critic <a href="David%20Thomson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Thomson</a> believed that Hoffman showed indecisiveness at this time, unsure whether to play spectacular supporting roles or become a lead actor who is capable of controlling the emotional dynamic and outcome of a film.

Hoffman's profile continued to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama "<a href="Jack%20Goes%20Boating%20%28film%29">Jack Goes Boating</a>" was adapted from <a href="Robert%20Glaudini">Robert Glaudini</a>'s play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack – a lonely limousine driver looking for love – after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" remarked that "Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember what it was about as I left", while critic <a href="Mark%20Kermode">Mark Kermode</a> appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to "Jack Goes Boating", in 2010 Hoffman also directed <a href="Brett%20C.%20Leonard">Brett C. Leonard</a>'s tragic drama "The Long Red Road" for the <a href="Goodman%20Theatre">Goodman Theatre</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Steven Oxman of "Variety" described the production as "heavy handed" and "predictable", but "intriguing and at least partially successful".

Hoffman next had significant supporting roles in two films, both released in the last third of 2011. In "<a href="Moneyball%20%28film%29">Moneyball</a>", a sports drama about the <a href="2002%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">2002 season</a> of the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a> baseball team, he played the manager <a href="Art%20Howe">Art Howe</a>. The film was a critical and commercial success, and Hoffman was described as "perfectly cast" by Ann Hornaday of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", but the real-life Art Howe accused the filmmakers of giving an "unfair and untrue" portrayal of him. Hoffman's second film of the year was <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>'s political drama "<a href="The%20Ides%20of%20March%20%282011%20film%29">The Ides of March</a>", in which he played the earnest campaign manager to the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> presidential candidate Mike Morris (Clooney). The film was well-received and Hoffman's performance, especially in the scenes opposite <a href="Paul%20Giamatti">Paul Giamatti</a> – who played the rival campaign manager – was positively noted. Hoffman's work on the film earned him his fourth BAFTA Award nomination.

In the spring of 2012, Hoffman made his final stage appearance, starring as <a href="Willy%20Loman">Willy Loman</a> in a Broadway revival of "<a href="Death%20of%20a%20Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a>". Directed by Mike Nichols, the production ran for 78 performances and was the highest-grossing show in the <a href="Ethel%20Barrymore%20Theatre">Ethel Barrymore Theatre</a>'s history. Many critics felt that Hoffman, at 44, was too young for the role of 62-year-old Loman, and Chris Jones of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" felt that the character had been interpreted poorly. Hoffman admitted that he found the role difficult, but he nevertheless earned his third Tony Award nomination.

Hoffman collaborated with Paul Thomas Anderson for the fifth time in "<a href="The%20Master%20%282012%20film%29">The Master</a>" (2012), where he turned in what critic <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> considered the most memorable performance of his career. Set in 1950s America, the film featured Hoffman as Lancaster Dodd, the charismatic leader of a nascent Scientology-type movement who brings a troubled man (<a href="Joaquin%20Phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a>) under his tutelage. Hoffman was instrumental in the project's development, having been involved with it for three years. He assisted Anderson in the writing of the script by reviewing samples of it, and suggested making Phoenix's character, Freddie Quell, the protagonist instead of Dodd. A talented dancer, Hoffman was able to showcase his abilities by performing a jig during a surreal sequence; Bradshaw called it an "extraordinary moment" that "only Hoffman could have carried off." "The Master" was praised as an intelligent and challenging drama, and Drew Hunt of the "Chicago Reader" also felt that it contained Hoffman's finest work: "He's inscrutable yet welcoming, intimidating yet charismatic, villainous yet fatherly. He epitomizes so many things at once that it's impossible to think of [Dodd] as mere movie character". Hoffman and Phoenix received a joint <a href="Volpi%20Cup">Volpi Cup</a> Award at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> for their performances, and Hoffman was also nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, a BAFTA Award and a SAG Award for the supporting role.

"<a href="A%20Late%20Quartet">A Late Quartet</a>" was Hoffman's other film release of 2012, where he played a violinist in a string quartet whose members (played by <a href="Christopher%20Walken">Christopher Walken</a>, <a href="Catherine%20Keener">Catherine Keener</a>, and <a href="Mark%20Ivanir">Mark Ivanir</a>) face a crisis when one is diagnosed with <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>. The drama received favorable reviews, and Stephen Holden of "The New York Times" called Hoffman's performance "exceptional". In 2013, Hoffman joined the popular "Hunger Games" series in its second film, "", where he played gamemaker <a href="Plutarch%20Heavensbee">Plutarch Heavensbee</a>. The film finished as the 10th-highest grossing in history to that point, and Hoffman became recognizable to a new generation of film-goers. In January 2014, shortly before his death, he attended the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> to promote two films. In <a href="Anton%20Corbijn">Anton Corbijn</a>'s "<a href="A%20Most%20Wanted%20Man%20%28film%29">A Most Wanted Man</a>", a thriller based on <a href="John%20le%20Carr%C3%A9">John le Carré</a>'s novel, Hoffman played a German intelligence officer. His performance was praised by Xan Brooks as one of "terrific, lip-smacking relish: full of mischief, anchored by integrity." The other was "<a href="God%27s%20Pocket">God's Pocket</a>", the directorial debut of actor <a href="John%20Slattery">John Slattery</a>, in which Hoffman played a thief. In November 2014, nine months after his death, Hoffman was seen in "".

At the time of his death, Hoffman was filming "", the final film in the series, and had already completed the majority of his scenes. His two remaining scenes were rewritten to compensate for his absence, and the film was released in November 2015. Hoffman was also preparing for his second directorial effort, a <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>-era drama titled "Ezekiel Moss", which was to star Amy Adams and <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>. In addition, he had filmed a <a href="pilot%20episode">pilot episode</a> for the <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a> series "<a href="Happyish">Happyish</a>", in which he played the lead role of an advertising executive, but plans for a full season were put on hold following his death. The role was later passed on to <a href="Steve%20Coogan">Steve Coogan</a>.

Hoffman rarely mentioned his personal life in interviews, stating in 2012 that he would "rather not because my family doesn't have any choice. If I talk about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice. So I choose not to." For the last 14 years of his life, he was in a relationship with costume designer Mimi O'Donnell, whom he had met in 1999 when they were both working on the play "<a href="In%20Arabia%20We%27d%20All%20Be%20Kings">In Arabia We'd All Be Kings</a>", which Hoffman directed. They lived in New York City and had a son and two daughters. Hoffman and O'Donnell separated in the fall of 2013, some months before his death.

Hoffman was also discreet about his religious and political beliefs, but it is known that he voted for the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States">Green Party</a> candidate <a href="Ralph%20Nader">Ralph Nader</a> in the 2000 presidential election. He felt that keeping his personal life private was beneficial to his career: "The less you know about me the more interesting it will be to watch me do what I do".

In a 2006 interview with "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>", Hoffman revealed he had engaged in <a href="substance%20abuse">drug and alcohol abuse</a> during his time at New York University, saying he had used "anything I could get my hands on. I liked it all." Following his graduation in 1989, he entered a <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation program</a> at age 22, and remained sober for 23 years. However, he relapsed in 2013, and admitted himself to drug rehabilitation for about 10 days in May of that year.

Although friends stated that Hoffman's drug use was under control at the time, on February 2, 2014, the actor was found dead in the bathroom of his <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> apartment by a friend, playwright and screenwriter <a href="David%20Bar%20Katz">David Bar Katz</a>. Hoffman was 46 years old. Detectives searching the apartment found heroin and prescription medications at the scene, and revealed that he was discovered with a syringe in his arm. The death was officially ruled an accident after an investigation including the Manhattan ADA <a href="Alex%20Spiro">Alex Spiro</a>, caused by "acute <a href="combined%20drug%20intoxication">mixed drug intoxication</a>, including heroin, cocaine, <a href="benzodiazepine">benzodiazepine</a>s, and <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>". Whether Hoffman had taken all of the substances on the same day, or whether any of the substances had remained in his system from earlier use was not reported. A funeral was held at <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Ignatius%20Loyola%20%28New%20York%20City%29">St. Ignatius Loyola Church</a> in Manhattan on February 7, 2014, and was attended by many of his former co-stars. Those who attended the funeral service included, <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, <a href="Cate%20Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a>, <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>, <a href="Joaquin%20Phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a>, <a href="Laura%20Linney">Laura Linney</a>, <a href="Amy%20Adams">Amy Adams</a>, <a href="Michelle%20Williams%20%28actress%29">Michelle Williams</a>, <a href="Marisa%20Tomei">Marisa Tomei</a>, <a href="Chris%20Rock">Chris Rock</a>, <a href="Ellen%20Burstyn">Ellen Burstyn</a>, <a href="Louis%20C.K.">Louis C.K.</a>, <a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>, and <a href="Diane%20Sawyer">Diane Sawyer</a> 

Hoffman's unexpected death was widely lamented by fans and the film industry, and was described by several commentators as a considerable loss to the profession. On February 5, 2014, the LAByrinth Theatre Company honored his memory by holding a candlelight vigil, and Broadway dimmed its lights for one minute. In another tribute, actress <a href="Cate%20Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a> dedicated her <a href="BAFTA%20for%20Best%20Actress">BAFTA</a> trophy to Hoffman when she received the award for "<a href="Blue%20Jasmine">Blue Jasmine</a>" on February 16. Three weeks after Hoffman's death, Katz established the American Playwriting Foundation in the actor's memory. With the money received from a <a href="libel">libel</a> lawsuit against the "<a href="National%20Enquirer">National Enquirer</a>" (which had inaccurately published that Hoffman and Katz were lovers), the foundation awards an annual prize of US$45,000 to the author of an unproduced play. Katz named this the "Relentless Prize" in honor of Hoffman's dedication to the profession. Hoffman left his fortune, around US$35 million, to Mimi O'Donnell in his October 2004 will, trusting her to distribute money to their children.

At the 2018 Academy Awards, <a href="Sam%20Rockwell">Sam Rockwell</a> dedicated his win for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a> to him, stating at the end of his acceptance speech "This is for my buddy, Phil Hoffman." Katz remembered him by a <a href="prose%20poem">prose poem</a> written in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" on December 21, 2014.

Hoffman was held in high regard within both the film and theater industries, and he was often cited in the media as one of the finest actors of his generation. Despite this status among his peers and critics, he was never one of the most popular film stars, and has been overlooked in lists of all-time greatest actors. He was not a typical movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking <a href="matin%C3%A9e%20idol">matinée idol</a> looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was grateful for his appearance as it made him believable in a wide range of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The "<a href="Aiken%20Standard">Aiken Standard</a>" of South Carolina referred to him as an "anti-star", whose real identity remained "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think there are other people who are interested in what I do."

Most of Hoffman's notable roles came in independent films, including particularly original ones, but he also featured in several Hollywood blockbusters. He generally played supporting roles, appearing in both dramas and comedies, but was noted for his ability to make small parts memorable. Peter Bradshaw, film critic for "The Guardian", felt that "Almost every single one of his credits had something special about it".

Hoffman was praised for his versatility and ability to fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: "his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies" writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of "Love Liza", believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of "The Guardian" remarked that the actor's particular talent was to "take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it". "The more pathetic or deluded the character," writes Gilbey, "the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous." When asked in 2006 why he undertook such roles, Hoffman responded, "I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking for people who have a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's what interests me."

The journalist Jeff Simon described Hoffman as "probably the most in-demand <a href="character%20actor">character actor</a> of his generation", but Hoffman claimed never to take it for granted that he would be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having any luck he quietly replied, "I'm in a film, "Cold Mountain", that has just come out." <a href="Patrick%20Fugit">Patrick Fugit</a>, who worked with Hoffman on "Almost Famous", recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in "a <a href="School%20of%20Hard%20Knocks">school-of-hard-knocks</a> way", remarking that "there was a certain weight that came with him". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, "ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it." He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.

Hoffman occasionally changed his hair and lost or gained weight for parts, and he went to great lengths to reveal the worst in his characters. But in a 2012 interview, he confessed that performing to a high standard was a challenge: "The job isn't difficult. Doing it well is difficult." In an earlier interview with "The New York Times", he explained how deeply he loved acting but added, "that deep kind of love comes at a price: for me, acting is torturous, and it's torturous because you know it's a beautiful thing ... Wanting it is easy, but trying to be great – well, that's absolutely torturous." This struggle was confirmed by the author <a href="John%20le%20Carr%C3%A9">John le Carré</a>, who met Hoffman during the adaptation of his novel "A Most Wanted Man". While praising the actor's intelligence and intuition, le Carré acknowledged the burden that Hoffman felt: "It was painful and exhausting work, and probably in the end his undoing. The world was too bright for him to handle."

Hoffman appeared in 55 films and one miniseries during his screen career spanning 22 years. He won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for "<a href="Capote%20%28film%29">Capote</a>" (2005), and was nominated three times for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a> for "<a href="Charlie%20Wilson%27s%20War%20%28film%29">Charlie Wilson's War</a>" (2007), "<a href="Doubt%20%282008%20film%29">Doubt</a>" (2008), and "<a href="The%20Master%20%282012%20film%29">The Master</a>" (2012). He also received five <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> nominations (winning one), five <a href="BAFTA%20Award">BAFTA Award</a> nominations (winning one), four <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>s (winning one), and won the <a href="Volpi%20Cup">Volpi Cup</a> at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>. Hoffman remained active in theater throughout his career, starring in ten and directing 19 stage productions (predominantly in New York). He received three <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> nominations for his Broadway performances: two for <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20by%20a%20Leading%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Best Leading Actor</a>, in "<a href="True%20West%20%28play%29">True West</a>" (2000) and "<a href="Death%20of%20a%20Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a>" (2012), and one for <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20by%20a%20Featured%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Best Featured Actor</a> in "<a href="Long%20Day%27s%20Journey%20into%20Night">Long Day's Journey into Night</a>" (2003).

Serpin

Serpins are a <a href="Protein%20superfamily">superfamily</a> of <a href="protein">protein</a>s with similar structures that were first identified for their <a href="Protease%20inhibitor%20%28biology%29">protease inhibition</a> activity and are found in all <a href="kingdom%20%28biology%29">kingdoms</a> of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like <a href="serine%20protease">serine protease</a>s (serine protease inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they <a href="Irreversible%20inhibition">irreversibly inhibit</a> their target <a href="protease">protease</a> by undergoing a large <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a> to disrupt its <a href="active%20site">active site</a>. This contrasts with the more common <a href="Competitive%20inhibition">competitive</a> mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.

Protease inhibition by serpins controls an array of biological processes, including <a href="coagulation">coagulation</a> and <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>, and consequently these proteins are the target of <a href="medical%20research">medical research</a>. Their unique conformational change also makes them of interest to the <a href="structural%20biology">structural biology</a> and <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a> research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to <a href="mutations">mutations</a> that can result in serpinopathies such as <a href="Proteopathy">protein misfolding</a> and the formation of inactive long-chain <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s. Serpin <a href="polymerisation">polymerisation</a> not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing <a href="cell%20death">cell death</a> and <a href="organ%20dysfunction">organ failure</a>.

Although most serpins control <a href="proteolysis">proteolytic</a> cascades, some proteins with a serpin structure are not <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">enzyme inhibitor</a>s, but instead perform diverse functions such as <a href="storage%20protein">storage</a> (as in <a href="egg%20white">egg white</a>—<a href="ovalbumin">ovalbumin</a>), transport as in hormone <a href="carriage%20proteins">carriage proteins</a> (<a href="thyroxine-binding%20globulin">thyroxine-binding globulin</a>, <a href="transcortin">cortisol-binding globulin</a>) and <a href="molecular%20chaperone">molecular chaperoning</a> (<a href="HSP47">HSP47</a>). The term "serpin" is used to describe these members as well, despite their non-inhibitory function, since they are evolutionarily related.

Protease inhibitory activity in blood plasma was first reported in the late 1800s, but it was not until the 1950s that the serpins <a href="antithrombin">antithrombin</a> and <a href="alpha%201-antitrypsin">alpha 1-antitrypsin</a> were isolated. Initial research focused on their role in human disease: <a href="alpha%201-antitrypsin%20deficiency">alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency</a> is one of the most common <a href="genetic%20disorder">genetic disorder</a>s, causing <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a>, and antithrombin deficiency results in <a href="thrombosis">thrombosis</a>.

In the 1980s, it became clear that these inhibitors were part of <a href="protein%20superfamily">superfamily</a> of <a href="Sequence%20homology">related</a> proteins that included both protease inhibitors (e.g. <a href="Alpha%201-antitrypsin%20deficiency">alpha 1-antitrypsin</a>) and non-inhibitory members (e.g. <a href="ovalbumin">ovalbumin</a>). The name "serpin" was coined based on the most common activity of the superfamily (serine protease inhibitors). Around the same time, the first <a href="Protein%20tertiary%20structure">structures</a> were solved for serpin proteins (first in the relaxed, and later in the stressed conformation). The structures indicated that the inhibitory mechanism involved an unusual conformational change and prompted the subsequent <a href="structural%20biology">structural</a> focus of serpin studies.

Over 1000 serpins have now been identified, including 36 human proteins, as well as molecules in all <a href="kingdom%20%28biology%29">kingdom</a>s of life—<a href="animals">animals</a>, <a href="plants">plants</a>, <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, and <a href="archaea">archaea</a>—and some <a href="Poxviridae">viruses</a>. In the 2000s, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in order to categorise members of the serpin superfamily based on their evolutionary relationships. Serpins are therefore the largest and most diverse superfamily of protease inhibitors.

Most serpins are <a href="protease">protease</a> inhibitors, targeting extracellular, <a href="chymotrypsin">chymotrypsin</a>-like <a href="serine%20protease">serine protease</a>s. These proteases possess a <a href="nucleophile">nucleophilic</a> <a href="serine">serine</a> residue in a <a href="catalytic%20triad">catalytic triad</a> in their <a href="active%20site">active site</a>. Examples include <a href="thrombin">thrombin</a>, <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a>, and <a href="human%20neutrophil%20elastase">human neutrophil elastase</a>. Serpins act as <a href="Irreversible%20inhibition">irreversible</a>, <a href="suicide%20inhibitor">suicide inhibitor</a>s by trapping an intermediate of the protease's catalytic mechanism.

Some serpins inhibit other protease classes, typically <a href="cysteine%20protease">cysteine protease</a>s, and are termed "cross-class inhibitors". These enzymes differ from serineproteases in that they use a nucleophilic <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a> residue, rather than a <a href="serine">serine</a>, in their active site. Nonetheless, the enzymatic chemistry is similar, and the mechanism of inhibition by serpins is the same for both classes of protease. Examples of cross-class inhibitory serpins include <a href="SERPINB4">serpin B4</a> a <a href="squamous%20cell%20carcinoma">squamous cell carcinoma</a> antigen 1 (SCCA-1) and the avian serpin <a href="myeloid%20and%20erythroid%20nuclear%20termination%20stage-specific%20protein">myeloid and erythroid nuclear termination stage-specific protein</a> (MENT), which both inhibit <a href="papain">papain</a>-like <a href="cysteine%20protease">cysteine protease</a>s.

Approximately two-thirds of human serpins perform extracellular roles, inhibiting proteases in the bloodstream in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to <a href="blood%20clotting">blood clotting</a> (antithrombin), the <a href="Inflammation">inflammatory</a> and <a href="immune%20responses">immune responses</a> (antitrypsin, <a href="alpha%201-antichymotrypsin">antichymotrypsin</a>, and <a href="C1-inhibitor">C1-inhibitor</a>) and tissue remodelling <a href="Plasminogen%20activator%20inhibitor-1">(PAI-1)</a>. By inhibiting <a href="signalling%20cascade">signalling cascade</a> proteases, they can also affect <a href="Developmental%20biology">development</a>. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples of the range of functions performed by human serpin, as well as some of the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.

The protease targets of intracellular inhibitory serpins have been difficult to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins may be to protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is <a href="SERPINB9">Serpin B9</a>, which inhibits the <a href="cytotoxic">cytotoxic</a> <a href="granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granule</a> protease <a href="granzyme%20B">granzyme B</a>. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of <a href="apoptosis">cell death</a> pathways.

Some <a href="virus">virus</a>es use serpins to disrupt protease functions in their host. The <a href="cowpox">cowpox</a> <a href="viral%20protein">viral serpin</a> CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) is used in order to avoid inflammatory and <a href="apoptosis">apoptotic</a> responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host's inflammatory response through inhibition of <a href="Interleukin%201%20family">IL-1</a> and <a href="Interleukin%2018">IL-18</a> processing by the cysteine protease <a href="caspase">caspase</a>-1. In <a href="eukaryotes">eukaryotes</a>, a plant serpin inhibits both <a href="metacaspase">metacaspase</a>s and a papain-like cysteine protease.

Non-inhibitory extracellular serpins also perform a wide array of important roles. <a href="Thyroxine-binding%20globulin">Thyroxine-binding globulin</a> and <a href="transcortin">transcortin</a> transport the hormones <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a> and <a href="cortisol">cortisol</a>, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin <a href="ovalbumin">ovalbumin</a> is the most abundant protein in <a href="egg%20white">egg white</a>. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a <a href="storage%20protein">storage protein</a> for the <a href="prenatal%20development">developing foetus</a>. <a href="Heat%20shock%20protein%2047">Heat shock serpin 47</a> is a <a href="Chaperone%20%28protein%29">chaperone</a>, essential for proper <a href="folding%20%28chemistry%29">folding</a> of <a href="collagen">collagen</a>. It acts by stabilising collagen's <a href="Collagen">triple helix</a> whilst it is being processed in the <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a>.

Some serpins are both protease inhibitors and perform additional roles. For example, the nuclear cysteine protease inhibitor <a href="myeloid%20and%20erythroid%20nuclear%20termination%20stage%20specific%20protein">MENT</a>, in <a href="bird">bird</a>s also acts as a <a href="chromatin%20remodeling">chromatin remodelling</a> molecule in a bird's <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s.

All serpins share a common <a href="Protein%20tertiary%20structure">structure</a> (or fold), despite their varied functions. All typically have three <a href="beta%20sheet">β-sheets</a> (named A, B and C) and eight or nine <a href="alpha%20helix">α-helices</a> (named hA–hI). The most significant regions to serpin function are the A-sheet and the reactive centre loop (RCL). The A-sheet includes two <a href="%CE%B2%20strands">β-strands</a> that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the 'shutter', and upper region called the 'breach'. The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules. Structures have been solved showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A-sheet, and serpins are thought to be in <a href="dynamic%20equilibrium">dynamic equilibrium</a> between these two states. The RCL also only makes temporary interactions with the rest of the structure, and is therefore highly flexible and exposed to the solvent.

The serpin structures that have been determined cover several different conformations, which has been necessary for the understanding of their multiple-step mechanism of action. <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">Structural biology</a> has therefore played a central role in the understanding of serpin function and biology.

Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit their target proteases by the typical <a href="Competitive%20inhibition">competitive</a> ("lock-and-key") mechanism used by most small <a href="protease%20inhibitor%20%28biology%29">protease inhibitors</a> (e.g. <a href="Kunitz-type%20protease%20inhibitor">Kunitz-type inhibitor</a>s). Instead, serpins use an unusual <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a>, which disrupts the structure of the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis. The conformational change involves the RCL moving to the opposite end of the protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra <a href="Beta%20sheet">antiparallel</a> β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).

<a href="Serine%20protease">Serine</a> and <a href="cysteine%20protease">cysteine protease</a>s catalyse peptide bond cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue of the active site <a href="Catalytic%20triad">triad</a> performs a <a href="nucleophile">nucleophilic</a> attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new <a href="N-terminus">N-terminus</a> and forms a covalent <a href="ester">ester</a>-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an <a href="acyl-enzyme%20intermediate">acyl-enzyme intermediate</a>. For standard <a href="Substrate%20%28chemistry%29">substrates</a>, the ester bond is <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolysed</a> and the new <a href="C-terminus">C-terminus</a> is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative <a href="Enzyme%20kinetics">kinetic rate</a> of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.

Since the RCL is still covalently attached to the protease via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls protease from the top to the bottom of the serpin and distorts the catalytic triad. The distorted protease can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as <a href="Irreversible%20inhibition">irreversible inhibitors</a> and as <a href="suicide%20inhibitor">suicide inhibitor</a>s since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease, and can only function once.

The <a href="conformational%20change">conformational mobility</a> of serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, the function of inhibitory serpins can be <a href="Allosteric%20regulation%23Allosteric%20modulation">regulated</a> by <a href="allosteric">allosteric</a> interactions with specific <a href="cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29">cofactor</a>s. The <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystal structures</a> of <a href="antithrombin">antithrombin</a>, <a href="heparin%20cofactor%20II">heparin cofactor II</a>, <a href="myeloid%20and%20erythroid%20nuclear%20termination%20stage-specific%20protein">MENT</a> and murine <a href="alpha%201-antichymotrypsin">antichymotrypsin</a> reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted into the top of the A <a href="%CE%B2-sheet">β-sheet</a>. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.

The archetypal example of this situation is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward the body of the serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain <a href="heparin">heparin</a>, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of <a href="thrombin">thrombin</a> and <a href="factor%20Xa">factor Xa</a>. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called <a href="Exosite%20%28biology%29">exosite</a>s) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of <a href="Fondaparinux">Fondaparinux</a>, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an <a href="anticoagulant">anti-clotting drug</a>.

Certain serpins spontaneously undergo the S to R transition without having been cleaved by a protease, to form a conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is not exactly the same as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.

Regulation of the latency transition can act as a control mechanism in some serpins, such as <a href="PAI-1">PAI-1</a>. Although PAI-1 is produced in the inhibitory S conformation, it "auto-inactivates" by changing to the latent state unless it is bound to the cofactor <a href="vitronectin">vitronectin</a>. Similarly, antithrombin can also spontaneously convert to the latent state, as an additional modulation mechanism to its allosteric activation by heparin. Finally, the N-terminus of tengpin, a serpin from "<a href="Thermoanaerobacter">Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis</a>", is required to lock the molecule in the native inhibitory state. Disruption of interactions made by the N-terminal region results in spontaneous conformational change of this serpin to the latent conformation.

Certain non-inhibitory serpins also use the serpin conformational change as part of their function. For example, the native (S) form of <a href="thyroxine-binding%20globulin">thyroxine-binding globulin</a> has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, <a href="transcortin">transcortin</a> has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.

In some serpins, the S to R transition can activate <a href="Cell%20signaling">cell signalling</a> events. In these cases, a serpin that has formed a complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells to the presence of protease activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.

When a serpin inhibits a target protease, it forms a permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (<a href="LRP1">LRP</a>), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin, PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing <a href="Endocytosis">cellular uptake</a>. Similarly, the "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>" serpin, necrotic, is degraded in the <a href="lysosome">lysosome</a> after being trafficked into the cell by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian <a href="LDL%20receptor">LDL receptor</a> family).

Serpins are involved in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related diseases are the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder <a href="%CE%B1-Antitrypsin%20deficiency">α-Antitrypsin deficiency</a> is one of the most common hereditary diseases.

Since the stressed serpin fold is high-energy, mutations can cause them to incorrectly change into their lower-energy conformations (e.g. relaxed or latent) before they have correctly performed their inhibitory role.

Mutations that affect the rate or the extent of RCL insertion into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by reducing the amount of active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants "wibble" and "wobble", both promote formation of the <a href="Antithrombin%23Cleaved%20and%20latent%20antithrombin">latent state</a>.

The structure of the disease-linked mutant of antichymotrypsin (L55P) revealed another, inactive "δ-conformation". In the δ-conformation, four residues of the RCL are inserted into the top of β-sheet A. The bottom half of the sheet is filled as a result of one of the α-helices (the F-helix) partially switching to a β-strand conformation, completing the β-sheet hydrogen bonding. It is unclear whether other serpins can adopt this conformer, and whether this conformation has a functional role, but it is speculated that the δ-conformation may be adopted by Thyroxine-binding globulin during thyroxine release. The non-inhibitory proteins related to serpins can also cause diseases when mutated. For example, mutations in SERPINF1 cause <a href="osteogenesis%20imperfecta">osteogenesis imperfecta</a> type VI in humans.

In the absence of a required serpin, the protease that it normally would regulate is over-active, leading to pathologies. Consequently, simple deficiency of a serpin (e.g. a <a href="null%20mutation">null mutation</a>) can result in disease. <a href="Gene%20knockout">Gene knockout</a>s, particularly in <a href="Knockout%20mouse">mice</a>, are used experimentally to determine the normal functions of serpins by the effect of their absence.

In some rare cases, a single amino acid change in a serpin's RCL alters its specificity to target the wrong protease. For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) causes the <a href="%CE%B11-antitrypsin">α1-antitrypsin</a> serpin to inhibit thrombin, causing a <a href="bleeding">bleeding</a> disorder.

The majority of serpin diseases are due to <a href="protein%20aggregation">protein aggregation</a> and are termed "serpinopathies". Serpins are vulnerable to disease-causing mutations that promote formation of misfolded polymers due to their inherently unstable structures. Well-characterised serpinopathies include <a href="alpha%201-antitrypsin%20deficiency">α1-antitrypsin deficiency</a> (alpha-1), which may cause familial <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a> and sometimes liver <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>, certain familial forms of <a href="thrombosis">thrombosis</a> related to <a href="antithrombin%20deficiency">antithrombin deficiency</a>, types 1 and 2 <a href="angioedema">hereditary angioedema</a> (HAE) related to deficiency of <a href="C1-inhibitor">C1-inhibitor</a>, and <a href="familial%20encephalopathy%20with%20neuroserpin%20inclusion%20bodies">familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies</a> (FENIB; a rare type of <a href="dementia">dementia</a> caused by neuroserpin polymerisation).

Each monomer of the serpin aggregate exists in the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other <a href="proteopathy">proteopathies</a> (e.g. <a href="prion">prion</a> diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a> of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of <a href="liver">liver</a> cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the details of how serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.

Physiological serpin polymers are thought to form via <a href="Protein%20domain">domain swapping</a> events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with the final stages of serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both <a href="protein%20dimer">dimer</a> and <a href="protein%20trimer">trimer</a> domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.

Several therapeutic approaches are in use or under investigation to treat the most common serpinopathy: antitrypsin deficiency. Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related pulmonary <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a>. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as <a href="Prolastin">Prolastin</a>). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver <a href="Organ%20transplantation">transplantation</a> has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in <a href="induced%20pluripotent%20stem%20cell">induced pluripotent stem cell</a>s has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation "in vitro".

Serpins are the most widely distributed and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to <a href="eukaryote">eukaryote</a> organisms, but have since been found in <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="archaea">archaea</a> and some <a href="viruses">viruses</a>. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a> from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of <a href="collagen">collagen</a>, and cycles between the <a href="Golgi%20apparatus">cis-Golgi</a> and the <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a>.

Protease-inhibition is thought to be the ancestral function, with non-inhibitory members the results of evolutionary <a href="neofunctionalisation">neofunctionalisation</a> of the structure. The S to R conformational change has also been adapted by some binding serpins to regulate affinity for their targets.

The human genome encodes 16 serpin clades, termed serpinA through serpinP, including 29 inhibitory and 7 non-inhibitory serpin proteins. The human serpin naming system is based upon a <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis of approximately 500 serpins from 2001, with proteins named serpinXY, where X is the clade of the protein and Y the number of the protein within that clade. The functions of human serpins have been determined by a combination of <a href="Biochemistry">biochemical</a> studies, human <a href="genetic%20disorder">genetic disorder</a>s, and <a href="Knockout%20mouse">knockout mouse models</a>.

Many <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian serpins have been identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous <a href="rodent">rodent</a> serpins (particularly some of the <a href="murine">murine</a> intracellular serpins) as well as the <a href="uterine%20serpin">uterine serpin</a>s. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the <a href="endometrium">endometrium</a> of a restricted group of mammals in the <a href="Laurasiatheria">Laurasiatheria</a> clade under the influence of <a href="progesterone">progesterone</a> or <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>. They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the <a href="conceptus">conceptus</a> or to participate in transplacental transport.

The "<a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">Drosophila melanogaster</a>" genome contains 29 serpin encoding genes. Amino acid sequence analysis has placed 14 of these serpins in serpin clade Q and three in serpin clade K with the remaining twelve classified as orphan serpins not belonging to any clade. The clade classification system is difficult to use for "Drosophila" serpins and instead a nomenclature system has been adopted that is based on the position of serpin genes on the "Drosophila" <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s. Thirteen of the "Drosophila" serpins occur as isolated genes in the genome (including Serpin-27A, see below), with the remaining 16 organised into five gene clusters that occur at chromosome positions 28D (2 serpins), 42D (5 serpins), 43A (4 serpins), 77B (3 serpins) and 88E (2 serpins).

Studies on "Drosophila" serpins reveal that Serpin-27A inhibits the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls <a href="Regional%20specification%23Dorsal/ventral%20axis">dorsoventral patterning</a>. Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), which results in <a href="Toll-like%20receptor">toll-mediated</a> signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the <a href="Innate%20immune%20system%23Host%20defense%20in%20invertebrates">innate immune response</a> in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In "Tenebrio molitor" (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.

The genome of the <a href="nematode">nematode</a> worm "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">C. elegans</a>" contains 9 serpins, all of which lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a protective function and guards against stress-induced <a href="calpain">calpain</a>-associated lysosomal disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 are sensitive to stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable role in determining cell fate.

<a href="Plant">Plant</a> serpins were amongst the first members of the superfamily that were identified. The serpin barley protein Z is highly abundant in barley grain, and one of the major protein components in beer. The genome of the model plant, "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" contain 18 serpin-like genes, although only 8 of these are full-length serpin sequences.

Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of mammalian chymotrypsin-like serine proteases "in vitro", the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), which is able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin as well as several blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the <a href="prolamin">prolamin</a> storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, "in vitro" feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.

Alternative roles and protease targets for plant serpins have been proposed. The "Arabidopsis" serpin, AtSerpin1 (At1g47710; ), mediates set-point control over programmed cell death by targeting the 'Responsive to Desiccation-21' (RD21) papain-like cysteine protease. AtSerpin1 also inhibits <a href="metacaspase">metacaspase</a>-like proteases "in vitro". Two other "Arabidopsis" serpins, AtSRP2 (At2g14540) and AtSRP3 (At1g64030) appear to be involved in responses to DNA damage.

A single <a href="Fungus">fungal</a> serpin has been characterized to date: celpin from "<a href="Neocallimastigomycota">Piromyces</a>" <a href="spp.">spp.</a> strain E2. "Piromyces" is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal <a href="dockerin">dockerin</a> domains in addition to its serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal <a href="cellulosome">cellulosome</a>, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.

Predicted serpin genes are sporadically distributed in <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s. "In vitro" studies on some of these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors "in vivo". Several prokaryote serpins are found in <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a>s. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although "<a href="Clostridium%20thermocellum">Clostridium thermocellum</a>" serpin localises to the <a href="cellulosome">cellulosome</a>. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.

Serpins are also expressed by <a href="virus">virus</a>es as a way to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by <a href="Poxviridae">pox viruses</a>, including <a href="Cowpox">cow pox</a> (vaccinia) and <a href="Rabbitpox">rabbit pox</a> (myxoma), are of interest because of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac <a href="Allotransplantation">allograft</a> survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase 1 and caspase 8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.

Sea otter

The sea otter ("Enhydra lutris") is a <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a> native to the coasts of the northern and eastern <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">North Pacific Ocean</a>. Adult sea <a href="otter">otter</a>s typically weigh between , making them the heaviest members of the <a href="Mustelidae">weasel family</a>, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, the sea otter's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of <a href="fur">fur</a>, the densest in the animal kingdom. Although it can walk on land, the sea otter is capable of living exclusively in the ocean.

The sea otter inhabits nearshore environments, where it dives to the sea floor to <a href="forage">forage</a>. It preys mostly on marine invertebrates such as <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, various <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, and some species of <a href="fish">fish</a>. Its foraging and eating habits are noteworthy in several respects. First, its <a href="Tool%20use%20by%20sea%20otters">use of rocks</a> to dislodge prey and to open shells makes it one of the few mammal species to use tools. In most of its range, it is a <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a>, controlling sea urchin populations which would otherwise inflict extensive damage to <a href="kelp%20forest">kelp forest</a> <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s. Its diet includes prey species that are also valued by humans as food, leading to conflicts between sea otters and fisheries.

Sea otters, whose numbers were once estimated at 150,000–300,000, were hunted extensively for their fur between 1741 and 1911, and the world population fell to 1,000–2,000 individuals living in a fraction of their historic range. A subsequent international ban on hunting, conservation efforts, and reintroduction programs into previously populated areas have contributed to numbers rebounding, and the species occupies about two-thirds of its former range. The recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in <a href="marine%20conservation">marine conservation</a>, although populations in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> and <a href="California">California</a> have recently declined or have plateaued at depressed levels. For these reasons, the sea otter remains classified as an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a>.

The sea otter is the heaviest (the <a href="giant%20otter">giant otter</a> is longer, but significantly slimmer) member of the family <a href="Mustelidae">Mustelidae</a>, a diverse group that includes the 13 <a href="otter">otter</a> species and terrestrial animals such as <a href="weasel">weasel</a>s, <a href="badger">badger</a>s, and <a href="mink">mink</a>s. It is unique among the mustelids in not making or <a href="burrow">burrow</a>s, in having no functional <a href="anal%20scent%20glands">anal scent glands</a>, and in being able to live its entire life without leaving the water. The only member of the genus "Enhydra", the sea otter is so different from other mustelid species that, as recently as 1982, some scientists believed it was more closely related to the <a href="earless%20seal">earless seal</a>s. <a href="Molecular%20phylogeny">Genetic</a> analysis indicates the sea otter and its closest <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> relatives, which include the African <a href="speckle-throated%20otter">speckle-throated otter</a>, <a href="European%20otter">European otter</a>, <a href="African%20clawless%20otter">African clawless otter</a> and <a href="oriental%20small-clawed%20otter">oriental small-clawed otter</a>, shared an ancestor approximately 5 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">Mya</a> (million years ago).

Fossil evidence indicates the "Enhydra" lineage became isolated in the North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct "Enhydra macrodonta" and the modern sea otter, "Enhydra lutris". One related species has been described, "Enhydra reevei", from the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> of <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>. The modern sea otter evolved initially in northern <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a> and Russia, and then spread east to the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, mainland <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, and down the North American coast. In comparison to <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns, <a href="sirenian">sirenian</a>s, and <a href="pinniped">pinniped</a>s, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth. The full genome of the northern sea otter ("Enhydra lutris kenyoni") was <a href="DNA%20sequencing">sequenced</a> in 2017 and may allow for examination of the sea otter's <a href="Speciation">evolutionary divergence</a> from terrestrial mustelids.

The first scientific description of the sea otter is contained in the field notes of <a href="Georg%20Steller">Georg Steller</a> from 1751, and the species was described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" of 1758. Originally named "Lutra marina", it underwent numerous name changes before being accepted as "Enhydra lutris" in 1922. The generic name "Enhydra", derives from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "en"/εν "in" and "hydra"/ύδρα "water", meaning "in the water", and the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "lutris", meaning "otter".

The sea otter was formerly sometimes referred to as the "sea <a href="beaver">beaver</a>", being the marine fur-bearer similar in commercial value to the terrestrial beaver. <a href="Rodent">Rodent</a>s (of which the beaver is one) are not closely related to otters, which are carnivorans. It is not to be confused with the <a href="marine%20otter">marine otter</a>, a rare otter species native to the southern west coast of South America. A number of other otter species, while predominantly living in fresh water, are commonly found in marine coastal habitats. The extinct <a href="sea%20mink">sea mink</a> of northeast North America is another mustelid that had adapted to a marine environment.

Three subspecies of the sea otter are recognized with distinct geographical distributions. "Enhydra lutris lutris" (<a href="Nominate%20subspecies">nominate</a>), the Asian sea otter, ranges from the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> north of Japan to Russia's <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a> in the western Pacific Ocean. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, "E. l. kenyoni", the northern sea otter, is found from Alaska's <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> to Oregon and "E. l. nereis", the southern sea otter, is native to central and southern California. The Asian sea otter is the largest subspecies and has a slightly wider skull and shorter nasal bones than both other subspecies. Northern sea otters possess longer <a href="Jaw%23Mammals">mandibles</a> (lower jaws) while southern sea otters have longer <a href="rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrums</a> and smaller teeth.

The sea otter is one of the smallest <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a> species, but it is the heaviest mustelid. Male sea otters usually weigh and are in length, though specimens up to have been recorded. Females are smaller, weighing and measuring in length. For its size, the male otter's <a href="baculum">baculum</a> is very large, massive and bent upwards, measuring in length and at the base.

Unlike most other marine mammals, the sea otter has no <a href="blubber">blubber</a> and relies on its exceptionally thick <a href="fur">fur</a> to keep warm. With up to 150,000 strands of hair per square centimeter (nearly one million per sq in), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof <a href="guard%20hairs">guard hairs</a> and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually rather than in a distinct <a href="molt">molt</a>ing season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>. The coloration of the <a href="pelage">pelage</a> is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color than the rest of the body.

The sea otter displays numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears can close. The hind feet, which provide most of its propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully <a href="webbed%20foot">webbed</a>. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable gripping slippery prey. The bones show <a href="osteosclerosis">osteosclerosis</a>, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy.
The sea otter propels itself underwater by moving the rear end of its body, including its tail and hind feet, up and down, and is capable of speeds of up to 9 km/h (5.6 mph). When underwater, its body is long and streamlined, with the short forelimbs pressed closely against the chest. When at the surface, it usually floats on its back and moves by sculling its feet and tail from side to side. At rest, all four limbs can be folded onto the torso to conserve heat, whereas on particularly hot days, the hind feet may be held underwater for cooling. The sea otter's body is highly <a href="buoyant">buoyant</a> because of its large <a href="lung%20capacity">lung capacity</a> – about 2.5 times greater than that of similar-sized land mammals – and the air trapped in its fur. The sea otter walks with a clumsy, rolling gait on land, and can run in a bounding motion.

Long, highly sensitive <a href="vibrissa">whiskers</a> and front paws help the sea otter find prey by <a href="touch">touch</a> when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly when the wind is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of <a href="Olfaction">smell</a> is more important than <a href="Visual%20perception">sight</a> as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its <a href="hearing%20%28sense%29">hearing</a> is neither particularly acute nor poor.

An adult's 32 <a href="teeth">teeth</a>, particularly the <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, are flattened and rounded for crushing rather than cutting food. <a href="Pinniped">Seals</a> and sea otters are the only <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s with two pairs of lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a> teeth rather than three; the adult <a href="dentition">dental formula</a> is . The teeth and bones are sometimes stained purple as a result of ingesting sea urchins.
The sea otter has a <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a> two or three times that of comparatively sized <a href="Terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a> mammals. It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary to counteract the loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.

The sea otter is <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>. It has a period of foraging and eating in the morning, starting about an hour before sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.

Sea otters spend much of their time grooming, which consists of cleaning the fur, untangling knots, removing loose fur, rubbing the fur to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the fur. To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have <a href="lice">lice</a> or other parasites in the fur. When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their fur.

The sea otter hunts in short dives, often to the <a href="sea%20floor">sea floor</a>. Although it can hold its breath for up to five minutes, its dives typically last about one minute and not more than four. It is the only marine animal capable of lifting and turning over rocks, which it often does with its front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may also pluck <a href="snail">snail</a>s and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into underwater mud for <a href="clam">clam</a>s. It is the only marine mammal that catches <a href="fish">fish</a> with its forepaws rather than with its teeth.

Under each foreleg, the sea otter has a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest. In this pouch (preferentially the left one), the animal stores collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock, unique to the otter, that is used to break open shellfish and clams. There, the sea otter eats while floating on its back, using its forepaws to tear food apart and bring it to its mouth. It can chew and swallow small <a href="mussel">mussel</a>s with their shells, whereas large mussel shells may be twisted apart. It uses its lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a> teeth to access the meat in shellfish.
To eat large sea urchins, which are mostly covered with spines, the sea otter bites through the underside where the spines are shortest, and licks the soft contents out of the urchin's shell.

The sea otter's use of rocks when hunting and feeding makes it one of the few <a href="mammal">mammal</a> species to use tools. To open hard shells, it may pound its prey with both paws against a rock on its chest. To pry an <a href="abalone">abalone</a> off its rock, it hammers the abalone shell using a large stone, with observed rates of 45 blows in 15 seconds. Releasing an abalone, which can cling to rock with a force equal to 4,000 times its own body weight, requires multiple dives.

Although each adult and independent juvenile forages alone, sea otters tend to rest together in single-sex groups called rafts. A raft typically contains 10 to 100 animals, with male rafts being larger than female ones. The largest raft ever seen contained over 2000 sea otters. To keep from drifting out to sea when resting and eating, sea otters may wrap themselves in <a href="kelp">kelp</a>.

A male sea otter is most likely to mate if he maintains a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.

The species exhibits a variety of vocal behaviors. The cry of a pup is often compared to that of a <a href="seagull">seagull</a>. Females coo when they are apparently content; males may grunt instead. Distressed or frightened adults may whistle, hiss, or in extreme circumstances, scream. Although sea otters can be playful and sociable, they are not considered to be truly <a href="social%20animal">social animal</a>s. They spend much time alone, and each adult can meet its own needs in terms of hunting, grooming, and defense.

Sea otters are <a href="polygynous">polygynous</a>: males have multiple female partners. However, temporary pair-bonding occurs for a few days between a female in <a href="estrus">estrus</a> and her mate. Mating takes place in the water and can be rough, the male biting the female on the muzzle – which often leaves scars on the nose – and sometimes holding her head under water.

Births occur year-round, with peaks between May and June in northern populations and between January and March in southern populations. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> appears to vary from four to twelve months, as the species is capable of <a href="delayed%20implantation">delayed implantation</a> followed by four months of pregnancy. In California, sea otters usually breed every year, about twice as often as those in Alaska.

Birth usually takes place in the water and typically produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3 kg (3 to 5 lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur is replaced by adult fur after about 13 weeks.

<a href="Lactation">Nursing</a> lasts six to eight months in Californian populations and four to twelve months in Alaska, with the mother beginning to offer bits of prey at one to two months. The milk from a sea otter's two abdominal <a href="nipple">nipple</a>s is rich in fat and more similar to the milk of other marine mammals than to that of other <a href="mustelid">mustelid</a>s. A pup, with guidance from its mother, practices swimming and diving for several weeks before it is able to reach the sea floor. Initially, the objects it retrieves are of little food value, such as brightly colored <a href="starfish">starfish</a> and pebbles. Juveniles are typically independent at six to eight months, but a mother may be forced to abandon a pup if she cannot find enough food for it; at the other extreme, a pup may nurse until it is almost adult size. Pup mortality is high, particularly during an individual's first winter – by one estimate, only 25% of pups survive their first year. Pups born to experienced mothers have the highest survival rates.

Females perform all tasks of feeding and raising offspring, and have occasionally been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much has been written about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups – a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.

Females become sexually mature at around three or four years of age and males at around five; however, males often do not successfully breed until a few years later. A captive male sired offspring at age 19. In the wild, sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the <a href="Seattle%20Aquarium">Seattle Aquarium</a> died at the age of 28 years. Sea otters in the wild often develop worn <a href="teeth">teeth</a>, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.

There are several documented cases in which male sea otters have <a href="Sexual%20coercion">forcibly copulated</a> with juvenile <a href="harbor%20seal">harbor seal</a>s, sometimes resulting in death. Similarly, forced copulation by sea otters involving animals other than Pacific harbor seals has occasionally been reported.

Sea otters live in coastal waters 15 to 23 meters (50 to 75 ft) deep, and usually stay within a kilometer (⅔ mi) of the shore. They are found most often in areas with protection from the most severe ocean winds, such as rocky coastlines, thick <a href="kelp%20forest">kelp forest</a>s, and <a href="barrier%20reefs">barrier reefs</a>. Although they are most strongly associated with rocky <a href="substrate%20%28marine%20biology%29">substrates</a>, sea otters can also live in areas where the sea floor consists primarily of mud, sand, or silt. Their northern range is limited by ice, as sea otters can survive amidst <a href="drift%20ice">drift ice</a> but not <a href="land-fast%20ice">land-fast ice</a>. Individuals generally occupy a home range a few kilometers long, and remain there year-round.

The sea otter population is thought to have once been 150,000 to 300,000, stretching in an arc across the North Pacific from northern Japan to the central <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a> in Mexico. The fur trade that began in the 1740s reduced the sea otter's numbers to an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 members in 13 colonies. Hunting records researched by historian Adele Ogden place the westernmost limit of the hunting grounds off the northern Japanese island of <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> and the easternmost limit off <a href="Punta%20Morro%20Hermosa">Punta Morro Hermosa</a> about south of <a href="Punta%20Eugenia">Punta Eugenia</a>, <a href="Baja%20California%20Sur">Baja California's</a> westernmost headland in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>.

In about two-thirds of its former range, the species is at varying levels of recovery, with high population densities in some areas and <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> populations in others. Sea otters currently have stable populations in parts of the Russian east coast, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and California, with reports of recolonizations in Mexico and Japan. Population estimates made between 2004 and 2007 give a worldwide total of approximately 107,000 sea otters.

Adele Ogden wrote in "The California Sea Otter Trade" that sea otter were hunted "from Yezo northeastward past the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Group</a> and <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka</a> to the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Chain</a>". "Yezo" refers to the island of <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> in northern Japan.

Currently, the most stable and secure part of the sea otter's range is <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. Before the 19th century, around 20,000 to 25,000 sea otters lived near the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a>, with more near <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a> and the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a>. After the years of the Great Hunt, the population in these areas, currently part of Russia, was only 750. By 2004, sea otters had repopulated all of their former habitat in these areas, with an estimated total population of about 27,000. Of these, about 19,000 are at the Kurils, 2,000 to 3,500 at Kamchatka and another 5,000 to 5,500 at the Commander Islands. Growth has slowed slightly, suggesting the numbers are reaching <a href="carrying%20capacity">carrying capacity</a>.

<a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> is the heartland of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the population in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a> accounts for most of the change; the cause of this decline is not known, although <a href="orca">orca</a> predation is suspected. The sea otter population in <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a> was also hit hard by the <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a>, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.

Along the North American coast south of Alaska, the sea otter's range is discontinuous. A remnant population survived off Vancouver Island into the 20th century, but it died out despite the 1911 international protection treaty, with the last sea otter taken near <a href="Kyuquot%2C%20British%20Columbia">Kyuquot</a> in 1929. From 1969 to 1972, 89 sea otters were flown or shipped from Alaska to the west coast of Vancouver Island. This population increased to over 5,600 in 2013 with an estimated annual growth rate of 7.2%, and their range on the island's west coast extended north to <a href="Cape%20Scott%20Provincial%20Park">Cape Scott</a> and across the Queen Charlotte Strait to the <a href="Broughton%20Archipelago">Broughton Archipelago</a> and south to <a href="Clayoquot%20Sound">Clayoquot Sound</a> and <a href="Tofino">Tofino</a>. In 1989, a separate colony was discovered in the central British Columbia coast. It is not known if this colony, which numbered about 300 animals in 2004, was founded by transplanted otters or was a remnant population that had gone undetected. By 2013, this population exceeded 1,100 individuals, was increasing at an estimated 12.6% annual rate, and its range included <a href="Aristazabal%20Island">Aristazabal Island</a>, and <a href="Milbanke%20Sound">Milbanke Sound</a> south to <a href="Calvert%20Island%20%28British%20Columbia%29">Calvert Island</a>. In 2008, Canada determined the status of sea otters to be "special concern".

In 1969 and 1970, 59 sea otters were translocated from Amchitka Island to <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, and released near <a href="La%20Push">La Push</a> and <a href="Point%20Grenville">Point Grenville</a>. The translocated population is estimated to have declined to between 10 and 43 individuals before increasing, reaching 208 individuals in 1989. As of 2017, the population was estimated at over 2,000 individuals, and their range extends from Point Grenville in the south to <a href="Cape%20Flattery">Cape Flattery</a> in the north and east to Pillar Point along the <a href="Strait%20of%20Juan%20de%20Fuca">Strait of Juan de Fuca</a>.

In Washington, sea otters are found almost exclusively on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of sea otters in the <a href="San%20Juan%20Islands">San Juan Islands</a> and <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> almost always turn out to be <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">North American river otter</a>s, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.

The last native sea otter in Oregon was probably shot and killed in 1906. In 1970 and 1971, a total of 95 sea otters were transplanted from Amchitka Island, Alaska to the Southern Oregon coast. However, this translocation effort failed and otters soon again disappeared from the state. In 2004, a male sea otter took up residence at Simpson Reef off of Cape Arago for six months. This male is thought to have originated from a colony in Washington, but disappeared after a coastal storm. On 18 February 2009, a male sea otter was spotted in <a href="Depoe%20Bay">Depoe Bay</a> off the <a href="Oregon%20Coast">Oregon Coast</a>. It could have traveled to the state from either California or Washington.

The historic population of California sea otters was estimated at 16,000 before the fur trade decimated the population, leading to their assumed extinction. Today's population of California sea otters are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 sea otters located near <a href="Bixby%20Creek%20Bridge">Bixby Creek Bridge</a> in March 1938 by Howard G. Sharpe, owner of the nearby Rainbow Lodge on Bixby Bridge in <a href="Big%20Sur">Big Sur</a>. Their principal range has gradually expanded and extends from <a href="Pigeon%20Point%20Lighthouse">Pigeon Point</a> in <a href="San%20Mateo%20County">San Mateo County</a> to <a href="Santa%20Barbara%20County">Santa Barbara County</a>.

Sea otters were once numerous in <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. Historical records revealed the <a href="Russian-American%20Company">Russian-American Company</a> sneaked <a href="Aleut%20people">Aleuts</a> into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose</a>, <a href="San%20Mateo%2C%20California">San Mateo</a>, <a href="San%20Bruno%2C%20California">San Bruno</a> and around <a href="Angel%20Island%20%28California%29">Angel Island</a>. The founder of <a href="Fort%20Ross">Fort Ross</a>, <a href="Ivan%20Kuskov">Ivan Kuskov</a>, finding otters scarce on his second voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters in three months. By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the <a href="Rancho%20Punta%20de%20Quentin">Rancho Punta de Quentin</a> was granted to Captain <a href="John%20B.%20R.%20Cooper">John B. R. Cooper</a>, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor <a href="Juan%20Bautista%20Alvarado">Juan Bautista Alvarado</a> along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent at the mouth of <a href="Corte%20Madera%20Creek%20%28Marin%20County%2C%20California%29">Corte Madera Creek</a>.

In the late 1980s, the USFWS relocated about 140 southern sea otters to <a href="San%20Nicolas%20Island">San Nicolas Island</a> in southern California, in the hope of establishing a reserve population should the mainland be struck by an oil spill. To the surprise of biologists, the majority of the San Nicolas sea otters swam back to the mainland. Another group of twenty swam north to <a href="San%20Miguel%20Island">San Miguel Island</a>, where they were captured and removed. By 2005, only 30 sea otters remained at San Nicolas, although they were slowly increasing as they thrived on the abundant prey around the island. The plan that authorized the translocation program had predicted the carrying capacity would be reached within five to 10 years. The spring 2016 count at San Nicolas Island was 104 sea otters, continuing a 5-year positive trend of over 12% per year. Sea otters were observed twice in Southern California in 2011, once near Laguna Beach and once at Zuniga Point Jetty, near San Diego. These are the first documented sightings of otters this far south in 30 years.

When the USFWS implemented the translocation program, it also attempted, in 1986, to implement "zonal management" of the Californian population. To manage the competition between sea otters and fisheries, it declared an "otter-free zone" stretching from <a href="Point%20Conception">Point Conception</a> to the Mexican border. In this zone, only San Nicolas Island was designated as sea otter habitat, and sea otters found elsewhere in the area were supposed to be captured and relocated. These plans were abandoned after many translocated otters died and also as it proved impractical to capture the hundreds of otters which ignored regulations and swam into the zone. However, after engaging in a period of public commentary in 2005, the Fish and Wildlife Service failed to release a formal decision on the issue. Then, in response to lawsuits filed by the Santa Barbara-based Environmental Defense Center and the Otter Project, on 19 December 2012 the USFWS declared that the "no otter zone" experiment was a failure, and will protect the otters re-colonizing the coast south of Point Conception as threatened species. Although abalone fisherman blamed the incursions of sea otters for the decline of abalone, commercial abalone fishing in southern California came to an end from overfishing in 1997, years before significant otter moved south of Point Conception. In addition, <a href="white%20abalone">white abalone</a> ("Haliotis sorenseni"), a species never overlapping with sea otter, had declined in numbers 99% by 1996, and became the first marine invertebrate to be federally listed as endangered.

Although the southern sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant population of about 50 individuals in <a href="Big%20Sur">Big Sur</a> since protection in 1911, from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about <a href="Tunitas%20Creek">Tunitas Creek</a> to a point 2 km southeast of <a href="Pigeon%20Point%20Lighthouse">Pigeon Point</a>, and the southern boundary has moved from approximately <a href="Coal%20Oil%20Point">Coal Oil Point</a> to <a href="Gaviota%20State%20Park">Gaviota State Park</a>. Recently, a toxin called <a href="microcystin">microcystin</a>, produced by a type of <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a> ("Microcystis"), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. <a href="Great%20white%20shark">Great white shark</a>s do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.

For southern sea otters to be considered for removal from threatened species listing, the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) determined that the population should exceed 3,090 for three consecutive years. In response to recovery efforts, the population climbed steadily from the mid-20th century through the early 2000s, then remained relatively flat from 2005 to 2014 at just under 3,000. There was some contraction from the northern (now <a href="Pigeon%20Point%20Lighthouse">Pigeon Point</a>) and southern limits of the sea otter's range during the end of this period, circumstantially related to an increase in lethal shark bites, raising concerns that the population had reached a plateau. However, the population increased markedly from 2015 to 2016, with the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) California sea otter survey 3-year average reaching 3,272 in 2016, the first time it exceeded the threshold for delisting from the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a> (ESA). If populations continued to grow and ESA delisting occurred, southern sea otters would still be fully protected by state regulations and the <a href="Marine%20Mammal%20Protection%20Act">Marine Mammal Protection Act</a>, which set higher thresholds for protection, at approximately 8,400 individuals. However, ESA delisting seems unlikely due to a precipitous population decline recorded in the spring 2017 USGS sea otter survey count, from the 2016 high of 3,615 individuals to 2,688, a loss of 25% of the California sea otter population.

Historian Adele Ogden described sea otters are particularly abundant in "Lower California", now the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a>, where "seven bays...were main centers". The southernmost limit was Punta Morro Hermoso about south of <a href="Punta%20Eugenia">Punta Eugenia</a>, in turn a headland at the southwestern end of <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Vizca%C3%ADno%20Bay">Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay</a>, on the west coast of the Baja Peninsula. Otter were also taken from <a href="San%20Benito%20Island">San Benito Island</a>, <a href="Cedros%20Island">Cedros Island</a>, and <a href="Isla%20Natividad">Isla Natividad</a> in the Bay. By the early 1900s, Baja's sea otters were extirpated by hunting. In a 1997 survey, small numbers of sea otters, including pups, were reported by local fishermen, but scientists could not confirm these accounts. However, male and female otters have been confirmed by scientists off shores of the Baja Peninsula in a 2014 study, who hypothesize that otter dispersed there beginning in 2005. These sea otter may have dispersed from <a href="San%20Nicolas%20Island">San Nicolas Island</a>, which is away, as individuals have been recorded traversing distances of over . Genetic analysis of most of these animals were consistent with California, i.e. United States, otter origins, however one otter had a haplotype not previously reported, and could represent a remnant of the original native Mexican otter population.

Sea otters consume over 100 prey species. In most of its range, the sea otter's diet consists almost exclusively of marine <a href="Benthos">benthic</a> invertebrates, including <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, <a href="Urechis%20unicinctus">fat innkeeper worms</a>, a variety of <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s such as <a href="clam">clam</a>s and <a href="mussel">mussel</a>s, <a href="abalone">abalone</a>, other <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, and <a href="snail">snail</a>s. Its prey ranges in size from tiny <a href="limpet">limpet</a>s and <a href="crab">crab</a>s to <a href="giant%20octopus">giant octopus</a>es. Where prey such as sea urchins, clams, and abalone are present in a range of sizes, sea otters tend to select larger items over smaller ones of similar type. In California, they have been noted to ignore <a href="Pismo%20clam">Pismo clam</a>s smaller than 3 inches (7 cm) across.

In a few northern areas, fish are also eaten. In studies performed at <a href="Amchitka%20Island">Amchitka Island</a> in the 1960s, where the sea otter population was at <a href="carrying%20capacity">carrying capacity</a>, 50% of food found in sea otter stomachs was fish. The fish species were usually bottom-dwelling and sedentary or sluggish forms, such as "<a href="Hemilepidotus%20hemilepidotus">Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus</a>" and family <a href="Tetraodontidae">Tetraodontidae</a>. However, south of Alaska on the North American coast, fish are a negligible or extremely minor part of the sea otter's diet. Contrary to popular depictions, sea otters rarely eat <a href="starfish">starfish</a>, and any <a href="kelp">kelp</a> that is consumed apparently passes through the sea otter's system undigested.

The individuals within a particular area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, a wider variety of prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful.

Sea otters are a classic example of a <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a>; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain <a href="benthic">benthic</a> (sea floor) herbivores, particularly <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by <a href="kelp%20forest">kelp forest</a>s leads to profound <a href="Cascade%20effect%20%28ecology%29">cascade effects</a> on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into <a href="urchin%20barren">urchin barren</a>s, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Kelp forests are extremely productive ecosystems. Kelp forests sequester (absorb and capture) CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Sea otters may help mitigate effects of climate change by their cascading trophic influence

Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the <a href="Big%20Sur">Big Sur</a> coast of California However, some kelp forest <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and <a href="estuaries">estuaries</a>.

Sea otters affect rocky ecosystems that are dominated by <a href="mussel">mussel</a> beds by removing mussels from rocks. This allows space for competing species and increases species diversity.

Leading mammalian predators of this species include <a href="orca">orca</a>s and <a href="sea%20lion">sea lion</a>s, and bald eagles may grab pups from the surface of the water. Young predators may kill an otter and not eat it. On land, young sea otters may face attack from bears and <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s. In California, great white sharks are their primary predator but there is no evidence that the sharks eat them.

<a href="Urban%20runoff">Urban runoff</a> transporting cat feces into the ocean brings "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>", an obligate parasite, which has killed sea otters. Parasitic infections of "<a href="Sarcocystis">Sarcocystis</a> neurona" are also associated with human activity. According to the U.S. Geological Survey and the CDC, northern sea otters off Washington have been infected with the <a href="H1N1%20flu%20virus">H1N1 flu virus</a> and "may be a newly identified animal host of influenza viruses".

Sea otters have the thickest fur of any mammal. Their beautiful fur is a main target for many hunters. Archaeological evidence indicates that for thousands of years, <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a> have hunted sea otters for food and fur. Large-scale hunting, part of the <a href="Maritime%20Fur%20Trade">Maritime Fur Trade</a>, which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive from all over the world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of fur.

In the early 18th century, Russians began to hunt sea otters in the Kuril Islands and sold them to the Chinese at <a href="Kyakhta">Kyakhta</a>. Russia was also exploring the far northern Pacific at this time, and sent <a href="Vitus%20Bering">Vitus Bering</a> to map the Arctic coast and find routes from Siberia to North America. In 1741, on his second North Pacific voyage, Bering was shipwrecked off <a href="Bering%20Island">Bering Island</a> in the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a>, where he and many of his crew died. The surviving crew members, which included naturalist <a href="Georg%20Steller">Georg Steller</a>, discovered sea otters on the beaches of the island and spent the winter hunting sea otters and gambling with otter pelts. They returned to Siberia, having killed nearly 1,000 sea otters, and were able to command high prices for the pelts. Thus began what is sometimes called the "Great Hunt", which would continue for another hundred years. The Russians found the sea otter far more valuable than the <a href="sable">sable</a> skins that had driven and paid for most of their expansion across Siberia. If the sea otter pelts brought back by Bering's survivors had been sold at Kyakhta prices they would have paid for one tenth the cost of Bering's expedition. In 1775 at Okhotsk, sea otter pelts were worth 50–80 rubles as opposed to 2.5 rubles for sable.
Russian fur-hunting expeditions soon depleted the sea otter populations in the Commander Islands, and by 1745, they began to move on to the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>. The Russians initially traded with the <a href="Aleut%20people">Aleuts</a> inhabitants of these islands for otter pelts, but later enslaved the Aleuts, taking women and children hostage and torturing and killing Aleut men to force them to hunt. Many Aleuts were either murdered by the Russians or died from diseases the hunters had introduced. The Aleut population was reduced, by the Russians' own estimate, from 20,000 to 2,000. By the 1760s, the Russians had reached <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. In 1799, Emperor Paul I consolidated the rival fur-hunting companies into the <a href="Russian-American%20Company">Russian-American Company</a>, granting it an imperial charter and protection, and a monopoly over trade rights and territorial acquisition.
Under Aleksandr I, the administration of the merchant-controlled company was transferred to the Imperial Navy, largely due to the alarming reports by naval officers of native abuse; in 1818, the indigenous peoples of Alaska were granted civil rights equivalent to a townsman status in the Russian Empire.

Other nations joined in the hunt in the south. Along the coasts of what is now <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> explorers bought sea otter pelts from <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> and sold them in Asia. In 1778, British explorer <a href="Captain%20James%20Cook">Captain James Cook</a> reached <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a> and bought sea otter furs from the First Nations people. When Cook's ship later stopped at a <a href="China">Chinese</a> port, the pelts rapidly sold at high prices, and were soon known as "soft gold". As word spread, people from all over Europe and North America began to arrive in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> to trade for sea otter furs.

Russian hunting expanded to the south, initiated by American ship captains, who subcontracted Russian supervisors and Aleut hunters in what are now Washington, Oregon, and California. Between 1803 and 1846, 72 American ships were involved in the otter hunt in California, harvesting an estimated 40,000 skins and tails, compared to only 13 ships of the Russian-American Company, which reported 5,696 otter skins taken between 1806 and 1846. In 1812, the Russians founded an agricultural settlement at what is now <a href="Fort%20Ross%2C%20California">Fort Ross</a> in northern California, as their southern headquarters.
Eventually, sea otter populations became so depleted, commercial hunting was no longer viable. It had stopped in the Aleutian Islands, by 1808, as a conservation measure imposed by the Russian-American Company. Further restrictions were ordered by the Company in 1834. When Russia <a href="Alaska%20purchase">sold Alaska</a> to the United States in 1867, the Alaska population had recovered to over 100,000, but Americans resumed hunting and quickly <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> the sea otter again. Prices rose as the species became rare. During the 1880s, a pelt brought $105 to $165 in the London market, but by 1903, a pelt could be worth as much as $1,125. In 1911, Russia, Japan, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States signed the <a href="North%20Pacific%20Fur%20Seal%20Convention%20of%201911">Treaty for the Preservation and Protection of Fur Seals</a>, imposing a moratorium on the harvesting of sea otters. So few remained, perhaps only 1,000–2,000 individuals in the wild, that many believed the species would become <a href="extinction">extinct</a>.

During the 20th century, sea otter numbers rebounded in about two-thirds of their historic range, a recovery considered one of the greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> still lists the sea otter as an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a>, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as <a href="oil%20pollution">oil pollution</a>, predation by <a href="orca">orca</a>s, <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, and conflicts with fisheries – sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by <a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous peoples</a> in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately after the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.

The most significant threat to sea otters is <a href="oil%20spill">oil spill</a>s, to which they are particularly vulnerable, since they rely on their fur to keep warm. When their fur is soaked with oil, it loses its ability to retain air, and the animals can quickly die from <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>. The <a href="liver">liver</a>, <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s, and <a href="lung">lung</a>s of sea otters also become damaged after they inhale oil or ingest it when grooming. The <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> of 24 March 1989 killed thousands of sea otters in <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a>, and as of 2006, the lingering oil in the area continues to affect the population. Describing the public sympathy for sea otters that developed from media coverage of the event, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson wrote:

The small geographic ranges of the sea otter populations in California, Washington, and British Columbia mean a single major spill could be catastrophic for that state or province. Prevention of oil spills and preparation to rescue otters if one happens is a major focus for conservation efforts. Increasing the size and range of sea otter populations would also reduce the risk of an oil spill wiping out a population. However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them.

In the Aleutian Islands, a massive and unexpected disappearance of sea otters has occurred in recent decades. In the 1980s, the area was home to an estimated 55,000 to 100,000 sea otters, but the population fell to around 6,000 animals by 2000. The most widely accepted, but still controversial, hypothesis is that killer whales have been eating the otters. The pattern of disappearances is consistent with a rise in predation, but there has been no direct evidence of orcas preying on sea otters to any significant extent.

Another area of concern is California, where recovery began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. <a href="Necropsies">Necropsies</a> of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>" and <a href="acanthocephala">acanthocephala</a>n parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The "Toxoplasma gondii" parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed to the deaths of many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.

Sea otter habitat is preserved through several <a href="Marine%20protected%20area">protected areas</a> in the <a href="Protected%20areas%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Protected%20areas%20in%20Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="Protected%20areas%20of%20Canada">Canada</a>. In marine protected areas, polluting activities such as dumping of waste and oil drilling are typically prohibited. An estimated 1,200 sea otters live within the <a href="Monterey%20Bay%20National%20Marine%20Sanctuary">Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary</a>, and more than 500 live within the <a href="Olympic%20Coast%20National%20Marine%20Sanctuary">Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary</a>.

Some of the sea otter's preferred prey species, particularly <a href="abalone">abalone</a>, <a href="clam">clam</a>s, and <a href="crab">crab</a>s, are also food sources for humans. In some areas, massive declines in <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a> harvests have been blamed on the sea otter, and intense public debate has taken place over how to manage the competition between sea otters and humans for seafood.

The debate is complicated because sea otters have sometimes been held responsible for declines of shellfish stocks that were more likely caused by <a href="overfishing">overfishing</a>, disease, pollution, and <a href="seismic">seismic</a> activity. Shellfish declines have also occurred in many parts of the North American Pacific coast that do not have sea otters, and conservationists sometimes note the existence of large concentrations of shellfish on the coast is a recent development resulting from the fur trade's near-<a href="Local%20extinction">extirpation</a> of the sea otter. Although many factors affect shellfish stocks, sea otter predation can deplete a fishery to the point where it is no longer commercially viable. Scientists agree that sea otters and abalone fisheries cannot exist in the same area, and the same is likely true for certain other types of shellfish, as well.

Many facets of the interaction between sea otters and the human economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the <a href="kelp">kelp</a> harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp is used in the production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest <a href="red%20sea%20urchin">red sea urchin</a>s both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>s, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.

For many maritime indigenous cultures throughout the North Pacific, especially the <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a> in the Kuril Islands, the <a href="Koryaks">Koryaks</a> and <a href="Itelmen">Itelmen</a> of Kamchatka, the <a href="Aleut%20people">Aleut</a> in the Aleutian Islands, the <a href="Haida%20people">Haida</a> of <a href="Haida%20Gwaii">Haida Gwaii</a> and a host of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest%20Coast">tribes on the Pacific coast of North America</a>, the sea otter has played an important role as a cultural, as well as material, resource. In these cultures, many of which have strongly <a href="animist">animist</a> traditions full of legends and stories in which many aspects of the natural world are associated with spirits, the sea otter was considered particularly kin to humans. The <a href="Nuu-chah-nulth%20people">Nuu-chah-nulth</a>, Haida, and other <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> of coastal British Columbia used the warm and luxurious pelts as chiefs' regalia. Sea otter pelts were given in <a href="potlatch">potlatch</a>es to mark coming-of-age ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. The Aleuts carved sea otter bones for use as ornaments and in games, and used powdered sea otter <a href="baculum">baculum</a> as a medicine for fever.

Among the <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a>, the otter is portrayed as an occasional messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu <a href="Yukar">epic</a>, the "<a href="Kutune%20Shirka">Kutune Shirka</a>", tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links have been associated with the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphism</a>. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations  the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.

Since the mid-1970s, the beauty and charisma of the species have gained wide appreciation, and the sea otter has become an icon of environmental conservation. The round, expressive face and soft, furry body of the sea otter are depicted in a wide variety of souvenirs, postcards, clothing, and stuffed toys.

Sea otters can do well in <a href="Captivity%20%28animal%29">captivity</a>, and are featured in over 40 <a href="public%20aquarium">public aquarium</a>s and <a href="zoo">zoo</a>s. The <a href="Seattle%20Aquarium">Seattle Aquarium</a> became the first institution to raise sea otters from conception to adulthood with the birth of Tichuk in 1979, followed by three more pups in the early 1980s. In 2007, a <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> video of two sea otters holding paws drew 1.5 million viewers in two weeks, and had over 20 million views . Filmed five years previously at the <a href="Vancouver%20Aquarium">Vancouver Aquarium</a>, it was YouTube's most popular animal video at the time, although it has since been surpassed. The lighter-colored otter in the video is Nyac, a survivor of the 1989 <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill">"Exxon Valdez" oil spill</a>. Nyac died in September 2008, at the age of 20. Milo, the darker one, died of lymphoma in January 2012
