Halo (Beyoncé song)

"Halo" is a song recorded by American singer <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a> for her third studio album, "<a href="I%20Am...%20Sasha%20Fierce">I Am... Sasha Fierce</a>" (2008). Included on the "I Am..." disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyoncé's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> released the song, the album's fourth single, to <a href="mainstream%20radio">mainstream radio</a> in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by <a href="Ray%20LaMontagne">Ray LaMontagne</a>'s 2004 song "Shelter," "Halo" was written and composed by <a href="Ryan%20Tedder">Ryan Tedder</a>, <a href="E.%20Kidd%20Bogart">Evan Bogart</a>, and Beyoncé herself. It was conceived by Tedder and Nealante' specifically for Beyoncé, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for <a href="Leona%20Lewis">Leona Lewis</a>.

"Halo" is a <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> <a href="power%20ballad">power ballad</a>, the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features <a href="drum">drum</a>, <a href="piano">piano</a>, <a href="Keyboard%20instrument">keyboard</a>, <a href="String%20instrument">string</a>, <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>, and <a href="Percussion%20instrument">percussion</a> instrumentation. The song faced a controversy when <a href="Kelly%20Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> claimed that Tedder had reused the musical arrangement in her own 2009 song "<a href="Already%20Gone%20%28Kelly%20Clarkson%20song%29">Already Gone</a>." "Halo" received positive reviews from music critics, who made comparisons with Lewis's 2007 song "<a href="Bleeding%20Love">Bleeding Love</a>." Its production and Beyoncé's emotional vocals also received critical praise. "Halo" was nominated for <a href="Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a> and won <a href="Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female Pop Vocal Performance</a> at the <a href="52nd%20Grammy%20Awards">52nd Grammy Awards</a>. It won <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Song">Best Song</a> at the <a href="2009%20MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">2009 MTV Europe Music Awards</a>. "Halo" topped the singles charts of Brazil, Norway, and Slovakia, and reached the top five on the singles chart of Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the US. It has received over ten certifications including a seven-times platinum certification from Australia and a double-platinum from Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

<a href="Philip%20Andelman">Philip Andelman</a> directed the ballad's accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, which features American actor <a href="Michael%20Ealy">Michael Ealy</a>. It portrays a romantic relationship between Beyoncé's and Ealy's characters. Critics complimented Beyoncé's looks in the clip. An alternative music video, which shows Ealy's character being chased by police through a forest at night, was posted on the Internet in May 2010. The lyrics to "Halo" were changed for two of Beyoncé's special live performances: in a tribute to <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> following his death, and in a tribute to the victims of the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>. The song has been <a href="Cover%20version">covered</a> by many artists, including <a href="Florence%20and%20the%20Machine">Florence and the Machine</a>, <a href="Harper%20Blynn">Harper Blynn</a>, and <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a>. It was performed on the television show "<a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>," and was added to the international soundtrack of the Brazilian <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="India%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20A%20Love%20Story">India – A Love Story</a>."

"Halo" was composed by <a href="Ryan%20Tedder">Ryan Tedder</a>, lead vocalist of <a href="OneRepublic">OneRepublic</a>, together with <a href="Evan%20%26quot%3BKidd%26quot%3B%20Bogart">Evan "Kidd" Bogart</a> and <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>. In an interview for <a href="HitQuarters">HitQuarters</a>, Kidd narrated the events that led to writing the song. OneRepublic canceled their tour after Tedder had broken his <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a> and had undergone surgery. The following day, the band sent Tedder to Los Angeles. There, he and Kidd were socializing when Tedder expressed his desire to write a song. Kidd was initially opposed to the idea because Tedder was supposed to be recuperating, but the pair went to Tedder's studio. During the writing sessions, singer <a href="Ray%20LaMontagne">Ray LaMontagne</a> was the primary inspiration for "Halo". Kidd suggested they create a song in the style of LaMontagne's "<a href="Trouble%20%28Ray%20LaMontagne%20album%29">Shelter</a>" for Beyoncé and her husband <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>, and proposed the title "Halo" after hearing Tedder play "angelic" <a href="chord%20%28music%29">chords</a>. They wrote the song in three hours.

According to <a href="Simon%20Cowell">Simon Cowell</a>, owner of the music production company <a href="Syco%20Entertainment">Syco Entertainment</a>, Bogart and Tedder intended "Halo" for his client, singer <a href="Leona%20Lewis">Leona Lewis</a>, who could not record the song because of her tight schedule. Cowell was upset that Beyoncé chose to record the song. David Balls, editor of the British media website <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>, asked Tedder during an interview whether "Halo" had initially been written for Lewis. Tedder answered that he had only tentatively offered the track to Lewis, after Beyoncé waited a long time before recording it. He commented:

There was this huge scandal that originally "Halo" was meant to go to Leona. That was never the case ... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song ... I thought this would be a brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have ... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just want to know if you like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!"

Tedder and Beyoncé produced "Halo" in 2008 at Los Angeles' Manfield Studios, and at <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s Germano and Roc The Mic Studios. Tedder did the musical <a href="arrangement">arrangement</a>s and played the <a href="musical%20instrument">instrument</a>s, while Christian Baker assisted in <a href="sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction">recording</a> the music. <a href="Mark%20Stent">Mark "Spike" Stent</a> <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> the track with assistance from Matt Green, and Jim Caruana recorded Beyoncé's vocals; both these tasks were done at Roc the Mic Studios. "Halo" is present on the "I Am..." disc of the <a href="double%20album">double album</a> "<a href="I%20Am...%20Sasha%20Fierce">I Am... Sasha Fierce</a>", as it is a <a href="Ballad%20%28music%29">ballad</a> that shows Beyoncé's insecurities about love, and the person she is "underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama". Beyoncé has said that she loves singing ballads because, "... the music and the emotion in the story is told so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say."

"Halo" is a contemporary <a href="downtempo">downtempo</a> power ballad that features a <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> production. It has elements of <a href="Gospel%20music">gospel</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>. Instrumentation is provided by a <a href="piano">piano</a>, a <a href="Keyboard%20instrument">keyboard</a>, <a href="big%20drum">big drum</a>s, a <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>, <a href="String%20instrument">strings</a>, and <a href="percussion%20instrument">percussion instrument</a>s. The cascading piano work is accompanied by percussive <a href="Beat%20%28music%29">beats</a> that alternate between <a href="handclaps">handclaps</a> and foot stomps. "Halo" was composed using <a href="time%20signature">common time</a> in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="A%20major">A major</a>, with a tempo of 84 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. It is built on the <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a> A–Bm–Fm–D, and is written in the common <a href="verse%26amp%3Bndash%3Bchorus%20form">verse–chorus form</a>. Beyoncé's vocals span from <a href="C%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">C</a> to the <a href="head%20voice">head voice</a> note of <a href="F%E2%99%AF%20%28musical%20note%29">F</a>, incorporate <a href="melisma">melisma</a>, and are supported by backing vocals. She <a href="Ornament%20%28music%29">ornaments</a> her singing with <a href="vibrato">vibrato</a> yelps and <a href="Trill%20%28music%29">trills</a>—rapid alternations between two <a href="adjacent%20%28music%29">adjacent</a> notes, usually a <a href="semitone">semitone</a> or <a href="Major%20second">tone</a> apart. The arrangement also consists of <a href="symphonic">symphonic</a> "<a href="crescendo">crescendo</a>s" and electronic <a href="Accent%20%28music%29">accents</a>.

In "Halo", Beyoncé professes her all-encompassing love to her heavenly lover with open-hearted emotion. She said, "['Halo'] is angelic ... like you see [angels'] faces instantly when you hear it. [Its lyrics] are basically saying that I had these walls built up about love; you completely tore them down and when I look at you I see your halo, it's really beautiful." Backed by a piano, claps and step stomps that set a spiritualized atmosphere, Beyoncé opens the song 
with the lines: "Remember those walls I built? Well, baby, they're tumbling down". She sings the <a href="Introduction%20%28music%29">introduction</a> in a low <a href="Register%20%28music%29">register</a>, and the power of her voice gradually increases as the song progresses. In the pre-chorus, she chants, "Everywhere I'm looking now, I'm surrounded by your embrace, baby I can see your halo, you know you're my saving grace, you're everything I need and more, it's written all over your face". Beyoncé then echoes the word "halo" in the <a href="Refrain">chorus</a>; the third and final one is preceded by a 1980s drum <a href="Break%20%28music%29">breakdown</a>, and is complemented by <a href="Sweep-picking">sweeping</a> strings and percussion.

"Halo" and "<a href="Ego%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Ego</a>" were initially planned for simultaneous release in the US, following the 2008 dual <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a>s "<a href="If%20I%20Were%20a%20Boy">If I Were a Boy</a>" and "<a href="Single%20Ladies%20%28Put%20a%20Ring%20on%20It%29">Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)</a>". But the release of "Ego" was canceled and replaced with "<a href="Diva%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Diva</a>". "Halo" was taken from a different disc of "I Am... Sasha Fierce" to "Diva"; the intention was to demonstrate the concept that Beyoncé has conflicting personalities—the central theme of the album. The motif was demonstrated by placing the album's ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. "Halo" was sent by Music World Entertainment and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> to <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit radio</a> playlists on January 20, 2009, while "Diva" was classified for <a href="rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic contemporary</a> and <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban contemporary</a> radio playlists. A digital <a href="extended%20play">extended play</a> (EP) containing a <a href="radio%20edit">radio edit</a> and four <a href="remix">remix</a>es of "Halo" was later released on April 14, 2009.

On February 20, 2009, "Halo" was released as a two-track <a href="Music%20download">digital download</a>, including a remix of "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada—where the song was also made available on a digital EP, as a <a href="maxi%20single">maxi single</a> and a <a href="12-inch%20single">vinyl single</a> on April 14, 2009. In France, it was released as a stand-alone digital download on March 20, 2009. On the same date, "Halo" was serviced digitally alongside the album version of "Diva" in mainland Europe, including Germany, where it was also made available as a <a href="Compact%20Disc%20single">CD single</a> on April 3 and a vinyl single on April 12, 2009. In the United Kingdom, a digital EP containing the album version and three remixes of "Halo" was released on April 13, 2009.

Soon after composing "Halo", Tedder worked with <a href="Kelly%20Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> on her fourth studio album, "<a href="All%20I%20Ever%20Wanted%20%28album%29">All I Ever Wanted</a>" (2009), for which they wrote "<a href="Already%20Gone%20%28Kelly%20Clarkson%20song%29">Already Gone</a>" together. When the song came out, critics noted a resemblance to Beyoncé's "Halo". Clarkson, however, initially stated that she was unaware of any similarities between the two songs. She eventually realized their resemblance when she listened to both recordings closely; the similarities are most notable in the backing tracks, which in both cases feature a melancholy piano, loud drums, and handclaps. Clarkson tried to prevent "Already Gone" from being included on "All I Ever Wanted", but it was impossible to make last minute changes, as her album was already being printed when "I Am... Sasha Fierce" was released. She accused Tedder of using the same arrangement on both "Already Gone" and "Halo", and complained that people would, incorrectly, assume she was stealing it from Beyoncé.

Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder commented that he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her criticism was "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of "Already Gone" and "Halo" are completely different. Calling "Already Gone" one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to "listen [to the two ballads] and form their own opinions". Clarkson also tried to stop her label, <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA</a>, from releasing "Already Gone" as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can do whatever they want with it." Clarkson later told James Montgomery of <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a> that it was unfortunate "Already Gone" and "Halo" sound so similar, but noted that at least they have different vocal melodies.

Christian Williams of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine wrote that the pop sound of "Halo" should take it to the top of the charts. He added that comparisons could be made to Lewis' "<a href="Bleeding%20Love">Bleeding Love</a>" (2007), but concluded that "Halo" "hangs high on its own merits". Michael Slezak of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" described "Halo" as "an absolutely glorious and perfectly produced track", which had the potential to be as commercially successful as "<a href="Crazy%20in%20Love%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Crazy in Love</a>" (2003) and "<a href="Irreplaceable">Irreplaceable</a>" (2007). Joey Guerra of the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" wrote that it was an immediate standout on "I Am... Sasha Fierce". Praising the "big and wide" melodies of "Halo", Matos Michaelangelo of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" commented that Beyoncé has "a real flair for grandeur". Jennifer Cady of <a href="E%21%20Online">E! Online</a> wrote that the song could be included on a romantic mixtape, and James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the "tear-jerking power" of "Halo" reveals "sides of Beyoncé we never knew existed". Ryan Dombal of <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">"Pitchfork"</a> wrote that Beyoncé's vocal delivery was "strident and exposed", reminiscent of <a href="Celine%20Dion">Céline Dion</a>'s style.

In spite of what he called the "garden-variety lyrics" of the ballad, James Reed of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote that "Halo" was "the most evocative power ballad" recorded by Beyoncé, comparing it to the work done by American <a href="record%20producer">record producer</a> and songwriter <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a> on his <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a> mixing board. Critics have highlighted the similarities of "Halo" to <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>'s "<a href="Umbrella%20%28song%29">Umbrella</a>" (2007); Alexis Petridis of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" noted that "Halo" has the same "icy synths, drivetime rock dynamic, and a similar repetitive chorus". This view was echoed by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News and Brent DiCrescenzo of "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28company%29">Timeout</a>", who viewed "Halo" as a "<a href="Bette%20Midler">Bette Midler</a>–level hymn from ['Umbrella'], lift[ing its] savior theme". Nick Levine of Digital Spy described "Halo" as a "muscular hybrid" of "Umbrella" and Lewis' "Bleeding Love". David Balls of the same website wrote, "Halo' is a contemporary power ballad in the 'Bleeding Love' mould ... Could Lewis have pulled this off better? Well, that's a matter of opinion of course, but Mrs. Jay-Z doesn't leave much room for improvement."

"Halo" was nominated for Best Single at the <a href="2009%20Urban%20Music%20Awards">2009 Urban Music Awards</a>, and for Best Love Song at the 2009 <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Awards">Teen Choice Awards</a>. It won <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Song">Best Song</a> at the <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards%202009">MTV Europe Music Awards 2009</a>. The ballad was placed at number seven of "<a href="Rap-Up">Rap-Up</a>"s list of the 25 best songs of 2009. "Halo" was nominated at the <a href="52nd%20Grammy%20Awards">52nd Grammy Awards</a> in the categories of <a href="Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a> and <a href="Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female Pop Vocal Performance</a>, winning the latter. It also won Best Foreign Song at the 2010 Croatian <a href="Porin%20%28music%20award%29">Porin Awards</a>. The live version of "Halo", featured on "" (2009), was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the <a href="53rd%20Grammy%20Awards">53rd Grammy Awards</a>. The <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Publishers">American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers</a> (ASCAP) recognized "Halo" as one of the most performed songs of 2009 at the 27th ASCAP Pop Music Awards. On the occasion of Beyoncé's thirtieth birthday, Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz of "Billboard" magazine placed the ballad at number 18 on their list of Beyoncé's 30 biggest "Billboard" hits. On "The Village Voice" year-end <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> singles list, "Halo" was ranked at numbers 443 and 114 in 2008 and 2009 respectively. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number three on their list of ten best Beyoncé's songs writing that other power ballads "don't come more powerful than this one, which finds Beyoncé belting alongside what sounds to be every instrument in the entire world (including a dope one-second drum solo)". <a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a> named "Halo" the 23rd best song of 2009.

"Halo" debuted at number 93 in the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart issue dated February 7, 2009. It peaked at number 5 in the chart issue dated May 23, 2009.

After spending 30 weeks in the top 40 of the Hot 100 chart, "Halo" last charted on the week ending August 29, 2009.

It emerged as the most listened to song on radio in Brazil during the same period as it registered 24,734 plays on radio stations throughout the country. "Halo" was also the most downloaded song in Brazil from November 2009 to November 2010, as highlighted by the first edition of the Brazilian Digital Music Awards.

The accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a>s for "Halo" and "Diva" premiered simultaneously on the US <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> on December 23, 2008. Shot in late November 2008 in a <a href="SoHo">SoHo</a> townhouse owned by Beyoncé, the video was directed by <a href="Philip%20Andelman">Philip Andelman</a> and features actor <a href="Michael%20Ealy">Michael Ealy</a> as Beyoncé's love interest. Ealy was happy to work with Beyoncé, as he had loved the song immediately after hearing it. This was the second time he was asked to star in a video for a song by Beyoncé; the first was "Irreplaceable", which he had refused because he did not appreciate its theme and concept. He had advised Beyoncé: "Call me when you have a hero role."

The video, which Beyoncé has considered intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that passes through a window. In one scene, Beyoncé's character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest looks down at her from a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of "Entertainment Weekly", the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 <a href="Romance%20film">romantic</a> <a href="drama%20film">drama film</a> "<a href="Flashdance">Flashdance</a>". Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly at each other as they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, she opens her eyes; after Ealy kisses the back of her neck, the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video "make [Beyoncé] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" praised Beyoncé's "amazing figure". The video was ranked at number 74 on <a href="Black%20Entertainment%20Television">BET</a>'s "Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009" countdown.

An alternative video surfaced online in late May 2010, explaining why Beyoncé's character was remembering her love interest in the original version. It begins with a view of the night sky and many trees, as Beyoncé drives a car and Ealy's character is chased by the police through a forest. As the video progresses, she parks her car on the side of the road and scenes from the original version are shown. <a href="Police%20dog">Police dog</a>s eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely. An open bag reveals stolen money, which is dispersed by the wind. At the end of the video, in the forest, Beyoncé finds Ealy lying lifelessly on the ground.

Beyoncé's first live performance of "Halo" was at the <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award">NAACP Awards</a> on February 12, 2009. Wearing a white gown, she sang the ballad while archival footage from the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> was shown on many screens in the background. Brennan Williams of Entertainment Newswire wrote that Beyoncé's "breathtaking performance" showed why she received the 2009 <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Female%20Artist">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Female Artist</a>. She also sang "Halo" on the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>" on April 22, 2009, and on <a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">"The Today Show"</a> the following day. The song was later added to the <a href="set%20list">set list</a> of her <a href="I%20Am...%20Tour">I Am... Tour</a> in 2009–10, when it was performed during the concert's <a href="Encore%20%28concert%29">encore</a>. After Beyoncé finished her "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" performance, she sang "Halo". She initially sang the ballad on stage before descending to shake hands with everybody in the front rows. Deborah McAleese and Lauren Mulvenny of "<a href="The%20Belfast%20Telegraph">The Belfast Telegraph</a>" commented that the ballad "was sung with great passion". It was included on her CD/DVD live albums "I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas" and "<a href="I%20Am...%20World%20Tour">I Am... World Tour</a>" (2010). Beyoncé performed "Halo" live, as the closing song at the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival%202011">2011 Glastonbury Festival</a>, in front of an audience of more than 175,000. During the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> special "A Night With Beyoncé", which aired on December 4, 2011 in the UK, she sang the ballad to a selected crowd of fans.

On June 25, 2009, American entertainer <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> <a href="Death%20of%20Michael%20Jackson">died</a> while Beyoncé was touring. His death led her to perform tributes to Jackson at tour venues, including <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> on July 1, 2009; and <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> on July 3, 2009. During the tribute, an image of Jackson was shown on the main screen. As Beyoncé sang an emotional rendition of "Halo", she changed the lyrics to "Michael I can see your Halo / I pray your music won't fade away". On January 12, 2010, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> was struck by an <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">earthquake</a>. A <a href="charitable%20organization">charity</a> <a href="telethon">telethon</a> called "" took place on January 22, 2010, in which many artists, including Beyoncé, participated. She performed an <a href="Acoustic%20music">acoustic</a> version of "Halo" with <a href="Coldplay">Coldplay</a>'s lead vocalist <a href="Chris%20Martin">Chris Martin</a> playing the piano. To make the song match the night's purpose, Beyoncé weaved "Haiti" into its lyrics, singing "Haiti, we can see your halo / You know you're my saving grace / You're everything I need and more, it's written all over your face / Haiti, we can see your halo / I pray you won't fade away". This version was included on the 2010 live album <a href="Hope%20for%20Haiti%20Now%20%28album%29">"Hope for Haiti Now"</a>.

On February 11, 2012, American recording artist <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a> died. After her death, Beyoncé performed a tribute for Houston during her revue in May 2012, at the <a href="Revel%20Atlantic%20City">Revel</a> resort in <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>. Wearing a red dress, Beyoncé began the performance of "Halo" singing the first verse of Whitney Houston's "<a href="I%20Will%20Always%20Love%20You%23I%20Will%20Always%20Love%20You%20%28Whitney%20Houston%20song%29">I Will Always Love You</a>". Maura Johnston of "The Village Voice" praised the performance noting that the song was "given an explosive coda" which showed how "the most basically structured song by one of pop's most template-hewing songwriters... could be turned into something glorious with the right singer." While reviewing the revue, Kyle Anderson of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote that "the most attention-grabbing moments of the night... came when she dipped into other artists' catalogs". Ben Ratliff of "The New York Times" mentioned the song in the "almost continuous high point" of the concert. On February 3, 2013, Beyoncé performed the song during the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVII%20halftime%20show">Super Bowl XLVII halftime show</a>. "Halo" was added to the setlist of her <a href="The%20Mrs.%20Carter%20Show%20World%20Tour">The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour</a>. The song was also performed as part of the <a href="On%20the%20Run%20Tour%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20and%20Jay-Z%29">On The Run Tour</a> with Jay Z and <a href="The%20Formation%20World%20Tour">The Formation World Tour</a> in 2016.

In 2009, "Halo" was covered by <a href="Florence%20and%20the%20Machine">Florence and the Machine</a> on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>'s <a href="Live%20Lounge">Live Lounge</a>. Elementary school group <a href="PS22%20chorus">PS22 chorus</a> covered "Halo" and "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" during the 2009 "Billboard" Women in Music luncheon held at <a href="The%20Pierre">The Pierre</a> in New York City. At the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, American singer <a href="Katy%20Perry">Katy Perry</a> performed a mash-up of "Halo" and the other Best Song nominees. American singer <a href="Mike%20Posner">Mike Posner</a> also covered the ballad with different lyrics, and placed it on his 2009 album "<a href="A%20Matter%20of%20Time%20%28Mike%20Posner%20mixtape%29">A Matter of Time</a>". According to an MTV writer, Posner's rendition was "a refreshing take on the original". David Sides also made a piano cover of the song and released it on his album "The Collection, Vol. 3". "Halo" is featured on the British <a href="compilation%20album">compilation album</a> <a href="Now%20That%27s%20What%20I%20Call%20Music%21%2073%20%28UK%20series%29">"Now! 73"</a>. The song was <a href="Mashup%20%28music%29">blended</a> with "How to Break a Heart" by the Irish <a href="boy%20band">boy band</a> <a href="Westlife">Westlife</a>, on their 2010 <a href="Where%20We%20Are%20Tour%20%28Westlife%29">Where We Are Tour</a>. On February 5, 2012, the team on the Australian talent show, "<a href="Young%20Talent%20Time">Young Talent Time</a>", sang "Halo" as the closing song of that night. On April 17, 2013, <a href="Angie%20Miller%20%28American%20singer%29">Angie Miller</a>, a contestant on the <a href="American%20Idol%20%28season%2012%29">12th season</a> of "<a href="American%20Idol">American Idol</a>" covered the song during an episode of the show. Melissa Locker of "Rolling Stone" magazine commented that she was "at her best" and "managed to tap into that power sans piano".

"Halo" has been covered by other musicians, including <a href="Ailee">Ailee</a>, <a href="Ceo%20%28musician%29">ceo</a> (Eric Berglund) and Harper Blynn. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media has written that no cover has been "quite as inspired or as perversely logical" as the one by ceo. Built essentially on bumpy beats, this version makes use of an <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>, 1980s-era stylized <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>, strings, and <a href="Horn%20%28instrument%29">horns</a>, and ends with a <a href="Rapping">rapped</a> outro. A <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a> cover of "Halo" by <a href="Major%20Lazer">Major Lazer</a>, with lead vocals by <a href="Elephant%20Man%20%28musician%29">Elephant Man</a>, was posted on the former's <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account the night after Beyoncé won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 2011 Grammy Awards. Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Entertainment Weekly" commented that their version "stays fairly close to the original, except with Elephant Man growling instead of Beyoncé belting the verses". In 2012, Swedish singer <a href="Robin%20Stjernberg">Robin Stjernberg</a>, member of the boy band <a href="What%27s%20Up%21">What's Up!</a>, covered the song and included it on his solo debut album "<a href="My%20Versions">My Versions</a>". A cover by singer-songwriter <a href="LP%20%28singer%29">LP</a>, also in 2012, was described by <a href="MTV">MTV</a> as "[finding] the perfect balance between making it her own and preserving the integrity of the original melody". In 2013, "Halo" was covered by the Icelandic band <a href="Hjaltal%C3%ADn">Hjaltalín</a>, with their version of "Halo" appearing as the B-side of their single "Crack in a Stone". A gospel-style version of the song was recorded by <a href="Jahm%C3%A9ne%20Douglas">Jahméne Douglas</a> and was released on his album "<a href="Love%20Never%20Fails%20%28Jahm%C3%A9ne%20Douglas%20album%29">Love Never Fails</a>" (2013). Indian singer <a href="Sunidhi%20Chauhan">Sunidhi Chauhan</a> covered "Halo" during a concert at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in London in late September 2013. A writer of "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" included the performance of the song as one of the highlights of the concert.

"Halo" was blended with <a href="Katrina%20and%20the%20Waves">Katrina and the Waves</a>' 1985 song "<a href="Walking%20on%20Sunshine%20%28Katrina%20and%20the%20Waves%20song%29">Walking on Sunshine</a>", in the "<a href="Vitamin%20D%20%28Glee%29">Vitamin D</a>" episode of the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox Broadcasting Company</a> television show "<a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>". Released as a single, this version peaked at number 4 on the Irish Singles Chart, number 8 on the <a href="UK%20Official%20Download%20Chart">UK Official Download Chart</a>, number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, number 10 on the ARIA Singles Chart, number 28 on the <a href="Canadian%20Hot%20100">Canadian Hot 100</a> chart, and number 40 on the Hot 100 chart.

Acetic acid

Acetic acid , systematically named ethanoic acid , is a colourless liquid <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a> with the <a href="chemical%20formula">chemical formula</a> CHCOOH (also written as CHCOH or CHO). When undiluted, it is sometimes called "glacial acetic acid". <a href="Vinegar">Vinegar</a> is no less than 4% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid the main component of vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to <a href="polyvinyl%20acetate">polyvinyl acetate</a> and <a href="cellulose%20acetate">cellulose acetate</a>. It is classified as a <a href="acid%20strength">weak acid</a> since it only partially <a href="Dissociation%20%28chemistry%29">dissociates</a> in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.

Acetic acid is the second simplest <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a> (after <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>). It consists of a <a href="methyl%20group">methyl group</a> attached to a <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxyl group</a>. It is an important <a href="reagent">chemical reagent</a> and industrial chemical, used primarily in the production of <a href="cellulose%20acetate">cellulose acetate</a> for <a href="photographic%20film">photographic film</a>, <a href="polyvinyl%20acetate">polyvinyl acetate</a> for wood <a href="Adhesive">glue</a>, and synthetic fibres and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in <a href="descaling%20agent">descaling agent</a>s. In the <a href="food%20industry">food industry</a>, acetic acid is controlled by the <a href="E%20number">food additive code</a> E260 as an <a href="acidity%20regulator">acidity regulator</a> and as a condiment. In <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to <a href="coenzyme%20A">coenzyme A</a>, it is central to the <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s and <a href="fat">fat</a>s.

The global demand for acetic acid is about 6.5 million <a href="metric%20ton">metric ton</a>s per year (Mt/a), of which approximately 1.5 Mt/a is met by recycling; the remainder is manufactured from <a href="methanol">methanol</a>. Vinegar is mostly dilute acetic acid, often produced by <a href="ethanol%20fermentation">fermentation</a> and subsequent oxidation of <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>.

The <a href="trivial%20name">trivial name</a> "acetic acid" is the most commonly used and <a href="preferred%20IUPAC%20name">preferred IUPAC name</a>. The systematic name "ethanoic acid", a valid <a href="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature. The name "acetic acid" derives from "acetum", the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a>, and is related to the word <a href="acid">acid</a> itself.

"Glacial acetic acid" is a name for water-free (<a href="anhydrous">anhydrous</a>) acetic acid. Similar to the <a href="German%20language">German</a> name "Eisessig" ("ice-vinegar"), the name comes from the ice-like crystals that form slightly below room temperature at (the presence of 0.1% water lowers its melting point by 0.2 °C).

A common <a href="symbol%20%28chemistry%29">symbol</a> for acetic acid is "AcOH", where "Ac" is the <a href="skeletal%20formula%23Pseudoelement%20symbols">pseudoelement symbol</a> representing the <a href="acetyl">acetyl</a> <a href="functional%20group">group</a> −C(=O)−; the <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate base</a>, <a href="acetate">acetate</a> (), is thus represented as "AcO". (The "Ac" is not to be confused with the symbol for the element <a href="actinium">actinium</a>; the context prevents confusion among organic chemists.) To better reflect its structure, acetic acid is often written as –C(O)OH, −C(=O)OH, COOH, and . In the context of <a href="acid-base%20reaction">acid-base reaction</a>s, the abbreviation "HAc" is sometimes used, where "Ac" in this case is a symbol for acetate (rather than acetyl). Acetate is the <a href="ion">ion</a> resulting from loss of from acetic acid. The name "acetate" can also refer to a <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a> containing this anion, or an <a href="ester">ester</a> of acetic acid.

The hydrogen centre in the <a href="carboxyl%20group">carboxyl group</a> (−COOH) in carboxylic acids such as acetic acid can separate from the molecule by ionization:
Because of this release of the <a href="proton">proton</a> (H), acetic acid has acidic character. Acetic acid is a weak <a href="monoprotic%20acid">monoprotic acid</a>. In aqueous solution, it has a <a href="Acid%20dissociation%20constant">pK</a> value of 4.76. Its <a href="conjugate%20acid">conjugate base</a> is <a href="acetate">acetate</a> (CHCOO). A 1.0 <a href="Molarity">M</a> solution (about the concentration of domestic vinegar) has a <a href="pH">pH</a> of 2.4, indicating that merely 0.4% of the acetic acid molecules are dissociated. However, in very dilute (< 10 M) solution acetic acid is >90% dissociated.

In solid acetic acid, the molecules form chains, individual molecules being interconnected by <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s. In the vapour at , dimers can be detected. Dimers also occur in the liquid phase in dilute solutions in non-hydrogen-bonding solvents, and a certain extent in pure acetic acid, but are disrupted by hydrogen-bonding solvents. The dissociation <a href="enthalpy">enthalpy</a> of the dimer is estimated at 65.0–66.0 kJ/mol, and the dissociation entropy at 154–157 J mol K. Other carboxylic acids engage in similar intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.

<a href="Liquid">Liquid</a> acetic acid is a <a href="hydrophile">hydrophilic</a> (<a href="Polar%20molecule">polar</a>) <a href="protic%20solvent">protic solvent</a>, similar to ethanol and <a href="water">water</a>. With a moderate <a href="relative%20static%20permittivity">relative static permittivity</a> (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and <a href="sugar">sugar</a>s, but also non-polar compounds such as oils as well as polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s such as water, <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>, and <a href="hexane">hexane</a>. With higher alkanes (starting with <a href="octane">octane</a>), acetic acid is not completely <a href="miscible">miscible</a>, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and <a href="miscibility">miscibility</a> properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent in the production of <a href="dimethyl%20terephthalate">dimethyl terephthalate</a>.

At physiological pHs, acetic acid is usually fully ionised to <a href="acetate">acetate</a>.

The <a href="acetyl">acetyl</a> <a href="functional%20group">group</a>, formally derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to <a href="coenzyme%20A">coenzyme A</a>, it is central to the <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s and <a href="fat">fat</a>s. Unlike longer-chain carboxylic acids (the <a href="fatty%20acids">fatty acids</a>), acetic acid does not occur in natural <a href="triglyceride">triglyceride</a>s. However, the artificial triglyceride <a href="triacetin">triacetin</a> (glycerine triacetate) is a common food additive and is found in cosmetics and topical medicines.
Acetic acid is produced and <a href="Excretion">excreted</a> by <a href="acetic%20acid%20bacteria">acetic acid bacteria</a>, notably the genus "<a href="Acetobacter">Acetobacter</a>" and "<a href="Clostridium%20acetobutylicum">Clostridium acetobutylicum</a>". These bacteria are found universally in <a href="food">food</a>stuffs, <a href="water">water</a>, and <a href="soil">soil</a>, and acetic acid is produced naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid is also a component of the <a href="vaginal%20lubrication">vaginal lubrication</a> of <a href="human">human</a>s and other <a href="primate">primate</a>s, where it appears to serve as a mild <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> agent.

Acetic acid is produced industrially both synthetically and by bacterial <a href="fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a>. About 75% of acetic acid made for use in the chemical industry is made by the <a href="carbonylation">carbonylation</a> of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5 Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an production was approximately 1 Mt/a and declining, while <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese production was 0.7 Mt/a. Another 1.5 Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5 Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are <a href="Celanese">Celanese</a> and <a href="BP">BP</a> Chemicals. Other major producers include <a href="Millennium%20Chemicals">Millennium Chemicals</a>, <a href="Sterling%20Chemicals">Sterling Chemicals</a>, <a href="Samsung">Samsung</a>, <a href="Eastman%20Chemical%20Company">Eastman</a>, and <a href="Svensk%20Etanolkemi">Svensk Etanolkemi</a>.

Most acetic acid is produced by methanol <a href="carbonylation">carbonylation</a>. In this process, methanol and <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> react to produce acetic acid according to the equation:

The process involves <a href="iodomethane">iodomethane</a> as an intermediate, and occurs in three steps. A <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>, <a href="metal%20carbonyl">metal carbonyl</a>, is needed for the carbonylation (step 2).

Two related processes for the carbonylation of methanol: the rhodium-catalyzed <a href="Monsanto%20process">Monsanto process</a>, and the iridium-catalyzed <a href="Cativa%20process">Cativa process</a>. The latter process is <a href="Green%20chemistry">greener</a> and more efficient and has largely supplanted the former process, often in the same production plants. Catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes, but the Cativa process requires less, so the <a href="water-gas%20shift%20reaction">water-gas shift reaction</a> is suppressed, and fewer by-products are formed.

By altering the process conditions, <a href="acetic%20anhydride">acetic anhydride</a> may also be produced on the same plant using the rhodium catalysts.

Prior to the commercialization of the Monsanto process, most acetic acid was produced by oxidation of <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>. This remains the second-most-important manufacturing method, although it is usually not competitive with the carbonylation of methanol. The acetaldehyde can be produced by <a href="alkyne%20hydration">hydration of acetylene</a>. This was the dominant technology in the early 1900s.

Light <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a> components are readily oxidized by oxygen or even air to give <a href="organic%20peroxide">peroxides</a>, which decompose to produce acetic acid according to the <a href="chemical%20equation">chemical equation</a>, illustrated with butane:
Such oxidations require metal catalyst, such as the naphthenate <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salt</a>s of <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, and <a href="chromium">chromium</a>.

The typical reaction is conducted at <a href="temperature">temperature</a>s and pressures designed to be as hot as possible while still keeping the butane a liquid. Typical reaction conditions are and 55 atm. Side-products may also form, including <a href="butanone">butanone</a>, <a href="ethyl%20acetate">ethyl acetate</a>, <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>, and <a href="propionic%20acid">propionic acid</a>. These side-products are also commercially valuable, and the reaction conditions may be altered to produce more of them where needed. However, the separation of acetic acid from these by-products adds to the cost of the process.

Under similar conditions and using similar <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>s as are used for butane oxidation, the <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">air</a> to produce acetic acid can oxidize <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a>.

Using modern catalysts, this reaction can have an acetic acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are <a href="ethyl%20acetate">ethyl acetate</a>, <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>, and <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a>, all of which have lower <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a>s than acetic acid and are readily separated by <a href="distillation">distillation</a>.

Acetaldehyde may be prepared from <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> via the <a href="Wacker%20process">Wacker process</a>, and then oxidised as above.

In more recent times, chemical company <a href="Showa%20Denko">Showa Denko</a>, which opened an ethylene oxidation plant in <a href="%C5%8Cita%20Prefecture">Ōita</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, in 1997, commercialised a cheaper single-stage conversion of ethylene to acetic acid. The process is catalyzed by a <a href="palladium">palladium</a> metal catalyst supported on a <a href="heteropoly%20acid">heteropoly acid</a> such as <a href="silicotungstic%20acid">silicotungstic acid</a>. Similar process use the same metal catalyst on silicotungstic acid and silica:

It is thought to be competitive with methanol carbonylation for smaller plants (100–250 kt/a), depending on the local price of ethylene.
The approach will be based on utilizing a novel selective photocatalytic oxidation technology for the selective oxidation of ethylene and ethane to acetic acid. Unlike traditional oxidation catalysts, the selective oxidation process will use UV light to produce acetic acid at ambient temperatures and pressure.

For most of human history, acetic acid bacteria of the genus "<a href="Acetobacter">Acetobacter</a>" have made acetic acid, in the form of vinegar. Given sufficient oxygen, these bacteria can produce vinegar from a variety of alcoholic foodstuffs. Commonly used feeds include <a href="Cider">apple cider</a>, <a href="wine">wine</a>, and fermented <a href="cereal">grain</a>, <a href="malt">malt</a>, <a href="rice">rice</a>, or <a href="potato">potato</a> mashes. The overall chemical reaction facilitated by these bacteria is:

A dilute alcohol solution inoculated with "Acetobacter" and kept in a warm, airy place will become vinegar over the course of a few months. Industrial vinegar-making methods accelerate this process by improving the supply of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> to the bacteria.

The first batches of vinegar produced by fermentation probably followed errors in the <a href="winemaking">winemaking</a> process. If <a href="must">must</a> is fermented at too high a temperature, acetobacter will overwhelm the <a href="yeast%20%28wine%29">yeast</a> naturally occurring on the <a href="grapes">grapes</a>. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners did not understand the process.

One of the first modern commercial processes was the "fast method" or "German method", first practised in Germany in 1823. In this process, fermentation takes place in a tower packed with wood shavings or <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>. The alcohol-containing feed is trickled into the top of the tower, and fresh <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">air</a> supplied from the bottom by either natural or forced <a href="convection">convection</a>. The improved air supply in this process cut the time to prepare vinegar from months to weeks.

Nowadays, most vinegar is made in submerged tank <a href="Microbiological%20culture">culture</a>, first described in 1949 by Otto Hromatka and Heinrich Ebner. In this method, alcohol is fermented to vinegar in a continuously stirred tank, and oxygen is supplied by bubbling air through the solution. Using modern applications of this method, vinegar of 15% acetic acid can be prepared in only 24 hours in batch process, even 20% in 60-hour fed-batch process.

Species of <a href="anaerobic%20bacteria">anaerobic bacteria</a>, including members of the genus "<a href="Clostridium">Clostridium</a>" or "<a href="Acetobacterium">Acetobacterium</a>" can convert sugars to acetic acid directly without creating ethanol as an intermediate. The overall chemical reaction conducted by these bacteria may be represented as:

These <a href="acetogen">acetogen</a>ic bacteria produce acetic acid from one-carbon compounds, including methanol, <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, or a mixture of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>:

This ability of "Clostridium" to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, suggests that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like "Acetobacter". However, "Clostridium" bacteria are less acid-tolerant than "Acetobacter". Even the most acid-tolerant "Clostridium" strains can produce vinegar in concentrations of only a few per cent, compared to "Acetobacter" strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce vinegar using "Acetobacter", rather than using "Clostridium" and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications.

Acetic acid is a chemical <a href="reagent">reagent</a> for the production of chemical compounds. The largest single use of acetic acid is in the production of vinyl acetate <a href="monomer">monomer</a>, closely followed by acetic anhydride and ester production. The volume of acetic acid used in vinegar is comparatively small.

The primary use of acetic acid is the production of <a href="vinyl%20acetate">vinyl acetate</a> monomer (VAM). In 2008, this application was estimated to consume a third of the world's production of acetic acid. The reaction consists of <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> and acetic acid with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> over a <a href="palladium">palladium</a> <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>, conducted in the gas phase.
Vinyl acetate can be polymerised to <a href="polyvinyl%20acetate">polyvinyl acetate</a> or other <a href="polymers">polymers</a>, which are components in <a href="paint">paint</a>s and <a href="adhesive">adhesive</a>s.

The major <a href="ester">ester</a>s of acetic acid are commonly used as solvents for <a href="ink">ink</a>s, <a href="paint">paint</a>s and <a href="coating">coating</a>s. The esters include <a href="ethyl%20acetate">ethyl acetate</a>, "n"-<a href="butyl%20acetate">butyl acetate</a>, <a href="isobutyl%20acetate">isobutyl acetate</a>, and <a href="propyl%20acetate">propyl acetate</a>. They are typically produced by <a href="catalyst">catalyzed</a> reaction from acetic acid and the corresponding <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>:

Most acetate esters, however, are produced from <a href="acetaldehyde">acetaldehyde</a> using the <a href="Tishchenko%20reaction">Tishchenko reaction</a>. In addition, ether acetates are used as solvents for <a href="nitrocellulose">nitrocellulose</a>, <a href="acrylic%20lacquer">acrylic lacquer</a>s, <a href="varnish">varnish</a> removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers are produced from <a href="ethylene%20oxide">ethylene oxide</a> or <a href="propylene%20oxide">propylene oxide</a> with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, have been shown to be harmful to human reproduction.

The product of the <a href="condensation%20reaction">condensation</a> of two molecules of acetic acid is <a href="acetic%20anhydride">acetic anhydride</a>. The worldwide production of acetic anhydride is a major application, and uses approximately 25% to 30% of the global production of acetic acid. The main process involves dehydration of acetic acid to give <a href="ketene">ketene</a> at 700–750 °C. Ketene is thereafter reacted with acetic acid to obtain the anhydride:

Acetic anhydride is an <a href="acetylation">acetylation</a> agent. As such, its major application is for <a href="cellulose%20acetate">cellulose acetate</a>, a synthetic <a href="textile">textile</a> also used for <a href="photographic%20film">photographic film</a>. Acetic anhydride is also a reagent for the production of <a href="heroin">heroin</a> and other compounds.

Glacial acetic acid is an excellent polar <a href="protic%20solvent">protic solvent</a>, as noted <a href="Acetic%20acid%23Solvent%20properties">above</a>. It is frequently used as a solvent for <a href="recrystallization%20%28chemistry%29">recrystallization</a> to purify organic compounds. Acetic acid is used as a <a href="solvent">solvent</a> in the production of <a href="terephthalic%20acid">terephthalic acid</a> (TPA), the raw material for <a href="polyethylene%20terephthalate">polyethylene terephthalate</a> (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production.

Acetic acid is often used as a solvent for reactions involving <a href="carbocation">carbocation</a>s, such as <a href="Friedel-Crafts%23Friedel%E2%80%93Crafts%20alkylation">Friedel-Crafts alkylation</a>. For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic <a href="camphor">camphor</a> involves a <a href="Wagner-Meerwein%20rearrangement">Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement</a> of <a href="camphene">camphene</a> to <a href="isobornyl%20acetate">isobornyl acetate</a>; here acetic acid acts both as a solvent and as a <a href="nucleophile">nucleophile</a> to trap the <a href="rearrangement%20reaction">rearranged</a> carbocation.

Glacial acetic acid is used in analytical chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a> than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as <a href="perchloric%20acid">perchloric acid</a>.

Acetic acid injection into a tumor has been used to treat cancer since the 1800s.

Acetic acid is used as part of <a href="cervical%20cancer%20screening">cervical cancer screening</a> in many areas in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a>. The acid is applied to the <a href="cervix">cervix</a> and if an area of white appears after about a minute the test is positive.

Acetic acid is an effective antiseptic when used as a 1% solution, with broad spectrum of activity against streptococci, staphylococci, pseudomonas, enterococci and others. It may be used to treat skin infections caused by pseudomonas strains resistant to typical antibiotics.

While diluted acetic acid is used in <a href="iontophoresis">iontophoresis</a>, no high quality evidence supports this treatment for rotator cuff disease.

As a treatment for <a href="otitis%20externa">otitis externa</a>, it is on the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization%27s%20List%20of%20Essential%20Medicines">World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines</a>, the most important medications needed in a basic <a href="health%20system">health system</a>.

Acetic acid has 349 kcal per 100 g. Vinegar is typically no less than 4% acetic acid by mass. Legal limits on acetic acid content vary by jurisdiction. Vinegar is used directly as a <a href="condiment">condiment</a>, and in the <a href="pickling">pickling</a> of vegetables and other foods. Table vinegar tends to be more diluted (4% to 8% acetic acid), while commercial food pickling employs solutions that are more concentrated. The proportion of acetic acid used worldwide as vinegar is not as large as commercial uses, but is by far the oldest and best-known application.

Acetic acid undergoes the typical <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a>s of a carboxylic acid. Upon treatment with a standard base, it converts to metal <a href="acetate">acetate</a> and <a href="water">water</a>. With strong bases (e.g., organolithium reagents), it can be doubly deprotonated to give LiCHCOLi. Reduction of acetic acid gives ethanol. The OH group is the main site of reaction, as illustrated by the conversion of acetic acid to <a href="acetyl%20chloride">acetyl chloride</a>. Other substitution derivatives include <a href="acetic%20anhydride">acetic anhydride</a>; this <a href="anhydride">anhydride</a> is produced by <a href="Condensation%20reaction">loss of water</a> from two molecules of acetic acid. <a href="Ester">Ester</a>s of acetic acid can likewise be formed via <a href="Fischer%20esterification">Fischer esterification</a>, and <a href="amide">amide</a>s can be formed. When heated above , acetic acid decomposes to produce <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="methane">methane</a>, or to produce <a href="ketene">ketene</a> and water:

Acetic acid is mildly <a href="corrosion">corrosive</a> to <a href="metal">metal</a>s including <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, forming <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas and salts called <a href="acetate">acetate</a>s:
Because <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> forms a <a href="Passivation%20%28chemistry%29">passivating</a> acid-resistant film of <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a>, aluminium tanks are used to transport acetic acid. Metal acetates can also be prepared from acetic acid and an appropriate <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">base</a>, as in the popular "<a href="Sodium%20bicarbonate">baking soda</a> + vinegar" reaction:

A <a href="colour%20reaction">colour reaction</a> for salts of acetic acid is <a href="iron%28III%29%20chloride">iron(III) chloride</a> solution, which results in a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with <a href="arsenic%20trioxide">arsenic trioxide</a> form <a href="cacodyl%20oxide">cacodyl oxide</a>, which can be detected by its <a href="odour">malodorous</a> vapours.

Organic or inorganic salts are produced from acetic acid. Some commercially significant derivatives:

Halogenated acetic acids are produced from acetic acid. Some commercially significant derivatives:

Amounts of acetic acid used in these other applications together account for another 5–10% of acetic acid use worldwide.

<a href="Vinegar">Vinegar</a> was known early in civilization as the natural result of exposure of <a href="beer">beer</a> and <a href="wine">wine</a> to air, because acetic acid-producing bacteria are present globally. The use of acetic acid in <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a> extends into the 3rd century BC, when the <a href="Greece">Greek</a> philosopher <a href="Theophrastus">Theophrastus</a> described how vinegar acted on metals to produce <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s useful in art, including "white lead" (<a href="lead%20carbonate">lead carbonate</a>) and "<a href="verdigris">verdigris</a>", a green mixture of <a href="copper">copper</a> salts including <a href="copper%28II%29%20acetate">copper(II) acetate</a>. Ancient <a href="Rome">Romans</a> boiled soured wine to produce a highly sweet syrup called "sapa". <a href="Defrutum">Sapa</a> that was produced in lead pots was rich in <a href="Lead%28II%29%20acetate">lead acetate</a>, a sweet substance also called "sugar of lead" or "sugar of <a href="Saturn%20%28mythology%29">Saturn</a>", which contributed to <a href="lead%20poisoning">lead poisoning</a> among the Roman aristocracy.

In the 16th-century <a href="Germany">German</a> alchemist <a href="Andreas%20Libavius">Andreas Libavius</a> described the production of <a href="acetone">acetone</a> from the <a href="dry%20distillation">dry distillation</a> of lead acetate, <a href="ketonic%20decarboxylation">ketonic decarboxylation</a>. The presence of water in vinegar has such a profound effect on acetic acid's properties that for centuries chemists believed that glacial acetic acid and the acid found in vinegar were two different substances. French chemist <a href="Pierre%20Adet">Pierre Adet</a> proved them identical.

In 1845 German chemist <a href="Hermann%20Kolbe">Hermann Kolbe</a> <a href="Chemical%20synthesis">synthesised</a> acetic acid from <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a>s for the first time. This reaction sequence consisted of <a href="halogenation">chlorination</a> of <a href="carbon%20disulfide">carbon disulfide</a> to <a href="carbon%20tetrachloride">carbon tetrachloride</a>, followed by <a href="pyrolysis">pyrolysis</a> to <a href="tetrachloroethylene">tetrachloroethylene</a> and aqueous chlorination to <a href="trichloroacetic%20acid">trichloroacetic acid</a>, and concluded with <a href="electrolysis">electrolytic</a> <a href="organic%20redox%20reaction">reduction</a> to acetic acid.

By 1910, most glacial acetic acid was obtained from the <a href="pyroligneous%20acid">pyroligneous liquor</a>, a product of the distillation of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with <a href="limewater">milk of lime</a>, and the resulting <a href="calcium%20acetate">calcium acetate</a> was then acidified with <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 <a href="ton">ton</a>s of glacial acetic acid, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of <a href="indigo%20dye">indigo dye</a>.

Because both <a href="methanol">methanol</a> and <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> are commodity raw materials, methanol carbonylation long appeared to be attractive precursors to acetic acid. <a href="Henri%20Dreyfus">Henri Dreyfus</a> at <a href="British%20Celanese">British Celanese</a> developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925. However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high <a href="pressure">pressure</a>s needed (200 <a href="Atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atm</a> or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process, which used a <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> catalyst, was developed by German chemical company <a href="BASF">BASF</a> in 1963. In 1968, a <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a>-based catalyst ("cis"−[Rh(CO)I]) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by-products. US chemical company <a href="Monsanto%20Company">Monsanto Company</a> built the first plant using this catalyst in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see <a href="Monsanto%20process">Monsanto process</a>). In the late 1990s, the chemicals company <a href="BP">BP</a> Chemicals commercialised the <a href="Cativa%20process">Cativa</a> catalyst ([Ir(CO)I]), which is promoted by <a href="iridium">iridium</a> for greater efficiency. This <a href="iridium">iridium</a>-catalyzed <a href="Cativa%20process">Cativa process</a> is <a href="Green%20chemistry">greener</a> and more efficient and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants.

<a href="Interstellar%20medium">Interstellar</a> acetic acid was discovered in 1996 by a team led by David Mehringer using the former <a href="Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland%20Association">Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association</a> array at the <a href="Hat%20Creek%20Radio%20Observatory">Hat Creek Radio Observatory</a> and the former <a href="Millimeter%20Array">Millimeter Array</a> located at the <a href="Owens%20Valley%20Radio%20Observatory">Owens Valley Radio Observatory</a>. It was first detected in the <a href="Sagittarius%20B2">Sagittarius B2</a> North molecular cloud (also known as the Sgr B2 <a href="Large%20Molecule%20Heimat">Large Molecule Heimat</a> source). Acetic acid has the distinction of being the first molecule discovered in the interstellar medium using solely <a href="Radio%20telescope%23Radio%20interferometry">radio interferometers</a>; in all previous ISM molecular discoveries made in the millimetre and centimetre wavelength regimes, single dish radio telescopes were at least partly responsible for the detections.

Concentrated acetic acid is <a href="corrosion">corrosive</a> to skin. These burns or blisters may not appear until hours after exposure.

Prolonged inhalation exposure (eight hours) to acetic acid vapours at 10 ppm can produce some irritation of eyes, nose, and throat; at 100 ppm marked lung irritation and possible damage to lungs, eyes, and skin may result. Vapour concentrations of 1,000 ppm cause marked irritation of eyes, nose and upper respiratory tract and cannot be tolerated. These predictions were based on animal experiments and industrial exposure.

In 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm has been reported. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of the skin of the hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).

The hazards of solutions of acetic acid depend on the concentration. The following table lists the <a href="Directive%2067/548/EEC">EU classification</a> of acetic acid solutions:

Concentrated acetic acid can be ignited only with difficulty at standard temperature and pressure, but becomes a flammable risk in temperatures greater than , and can form explosive mixtures with air at higher temperatures (<a href="explosive%20limit">explosive limit</a>s: 5.4–16%).

Mr. Dooley

Mr. Dooley (or Martin J. Dooley) is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional</a> <a href="Irish%20people">Irish immigrant</a> bartender created by American journalist <a href="Finley%20Peter%20Dunne">Finley Peter Dunne</a>. Dooley was the subject of many Dunne columns between 1893 and 1915, and again in 1924 and 1926. Dunne's essays contain the bartender's commentary on various topics (often national or international affairs). They became extremely popular during the 1898 <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> and remained so afterwards; they are collected in several books. The essays are in the form of conversations in <a href="Hiberno-English">Irish dialect</a> between Mr. Dooley, who in the columns owns a tavern in the <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Chicago">Bridgeport</a> area of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and one of the fictional bar's patrons (in later years, usually Malachi Hennessy) with most of the column a monologue by Dooley. The pieces are not widely remembered, but originated lasting sayings such as "the Supreme Court follows the election returns".

Mr. Dooley was invented by Dunne to replace a similar character whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.

Dunne's bartender came to wider attention with the wartime columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide. Both the columns and the books collecting them gained national acclaim. Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time and inspiration for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure in part due to his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it required have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.

Peter Dunne was born on July 10, 1867, in Chicago, the son of Irish immigrants; he added the first name "Finley", his mother's <a href="maiden%20name">last name at birth</a>, in his early twenties. A precocious boy, he did well in elementary school but finished last in his high school class of 50, possibly because of the death of his mother, and was sent to work at about age 17 in 1884. Dunne got a menial job on the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", where superiors soon noticed his street smarts, and made him police reporter. Over the next few years, Dunne worked for several Chicago papers, gaining in salary and responsibility, and by 1888 at age 21 was <a href="city%20editor">city editor</a> and a political writer for the "<a href="Chicago%20Times">Chicago Times</a>".

While at the "Times", Dunne may have made his first experiments in <a href="Hiberno-English">Irish dialect</a>: an anonymous police reform series published in January 1889. "Officer Quinn and his Friends" features an Irish-American policeman who digs up a suspicious footprint in the snow. Quinn means to take it to the station but is sidetracked at a saloon, emerging several hours later to find the evidence melted. The writer of the Quinn pieces uses unneeded Irishisms, and his spelling is often awkward. When Dunne took a new job with the "Tribune" later in 1889, the use of Irish dialect in stories followed him; one account of a conversation between two Irish-American members of the <a href="Chicago%20City%20Council">city council</a> is rendered as they would have spoken it. He first signed his name to Irish dialect pieces in the second half of 1890, in a series about real-life Colonel Thomas Jefferson Dolan, a small-time Democratic hanger-on. The series, which ended when Dunne left for the "<a href="Chicago%20Herald%20%281881%E2%80%9395%29">Chicago Herald</a>" in late 1890, contains elements of the Dooley stories, including mostly being told from a single perspective (an alter ego for Dunne), as well as painting a detailed portrait of the Irish-American scene. By then, Dunne had polished his use of Irish dialect.

The early 1890s saw an increasing use of dialect in Chicago's newspapers, sometimes to mock, but more often to give voice to the immigrant communities that filled Chicago's neighborhoods, and whose worth was being appreciated. By 1892, Dunne, who was still only aged 25, was editorial chairman of the "<a href="Chicago%20Evening%20Post">Chicago Evening Post</a>". Its management was marketing (unsuccessfully, as it proved) a smaller-size weekly edition to compete with the large Sunday papers. Cornelius McAuliff, Dunne's editor, asked him to write a humorous piece for each edition of the new periodical. Accordingly, Dunne wrote for the Sunday "Post" on December 4, 1892, a piece in Irish dialect called "Frank's Visit to Grover", concerning the efforts of former congressman <a href="Frank%20Lawler">Frank Lawler</a> to gain appointment as Chicago's postmaster, a political plum to be awarded by the new president, <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. Lawler's visit to New York to see Cleveland is described by another Irishman, Alderman <a href="John%20Powers%20%28alderman%29">Johnny Powers</a>—Cleveland promises the post (Lawler did not in real life receive it) before Lawler and the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">president-elect</a> settle down to drinking and shooting pool.

In the December 11, 1892 Sunday paper, Dunne wrote another dialect column, this time set in the upscale Dearborn Street saloon of Colonel Malachi McNeary (in all columns but the first spelled McNeery). That barkeeper was based on James McGarry, owner of a saloon near Chicago's newspaper district; Dunne and other journalists would drink there and write their stories. Beginning in the second McNeery column, the listener for his monologues is Johnny McKenna, a real-life figure, who was a Republican in a mostly Democratic Irish community, and who often received government jobs as a token of bipartisanship. The <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> was the major event of 1893 in Chicago, and McNeery was used as a mouthpiece for Dunne's commentary on the events and sights of the fair. For example, McNeery views a meeting of the fair's Board of Lady Managers, chaired by <a href="Bertha%20Palmer">Bertha Palmer</a>, who in the column proves incapable of stopping an argument between the members.

Although the Sunday "Post" was ended because of financial losses, the McNeery columns were moved to the Saturday edition because of their popularity. This local fame came with some annoyance to McNeery's real-life analogue, McGarry, who found himself called McNeery, and even stared at by a Swedish immigrant, a nationality held by Chicago Irish in disdain. One afternoon, when Dunne was in McGarry's tavern, the journalist found him uncommunicative, until his sudden explosion, "You can't put printer's ink on me with impunity," announcing that he intended to see Dunne's publisher, John R. Walsh. According to Grace Eckley in her volume on Dunne's works, the political positions McNeery was made to espouse were contrary to those of some of McGarry's customers, placing him in an uncomfortable position. The following day, Walsh asked Dunne to change the name, but the writer decided this would not be enough if the fictional saloon was kept as is; instead a humbler establishment (and bartender) in some remoter part of Chicago seemed called for. McKenna, unlike McGarry, was enjoying the attention, and, hearing of the problem, took Dunne to his heavily Irish neighborhood of <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Chicago">Bridgeport</a>, introducing him to locals there. Moving the venue to Bridgeport had advantages. A "<a href="shanty%20Irish">shanty Irish</a>" barkeeper could be permitted greater freedom of expression than McNeery, for to more urbane Chicagoans, Bridgeporters were unsophisticated, humorous <a href="hillbilly">hicks</a>. As Dunne later put it, "while it might be dangerous to call an alderman a thief in English no one could sue if a comic Irishman denounced the statesman as a thief". McGarry's heavy brogue featured in McNeery's speech, and was retained in the move to Bridgeport.

Dunne introduced the change in his column on October 7, 1893. McNeery was depicted as having gone home to Ireland, and the bereft McKenna, seeking companionship, enters the Bridgeport saloon of Martin J. Dooley, located on <a href="Archer%20Avenue">Archer Avenue</a> (to become famous as "Archey Road"), in which he had not been in some years, but where Mr. Dooley greets him as if they had parted the day before. Dooley serves him two drinks and an earful on local affairs—McKenna speaks only two brief sentences, one of which is his greeting. Dunne later stated that at first, he viewed the Dooley pieces as just another weekly feature, done hurriedly in an hour without much attempt at polish.

Over the first few months of weekly Mr. Dooley columns, in 1893 and 1894, the character of Dooley began to take shape. The backstory that Dunne gave Dooley began with the future bartender's birth in <a href="County%20Roscommon">County Roscommon</a>, Ireland (which had given birth to McGarry), about sixty years previously. Dooley was one of the roughly 2,000,000 Irish people who emigrated to North America during the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Potato Famine</a> (1845–50), coming across on one of the <a href="coffin%20ship">coffin ship</a>s, and later spoke of the hardships and deaths on the journey. Arriving in New York, he tried Pittsburgh and St. Louis, and settled in Chicago in the early 1850s. He worked in the typical occupations available to Irish of the time, as a laborer swinging a pickaxe and then driving horse-drawn wagons; but found these employments not to his liking, as each was dominated by Irishmen from counties other than Roscommon. He remains suspicious of, or even hostile towards, men from certain other counties, with "sheep-stealin' <a href="County%20Mayo">Mayo</a> men" heading the list. Tiring of employed labor, he established a bar on Archer Avenue, spending the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> there. His bar became the sort of community tavern around which, together with home and church, Irish life revolved. He interested himself in Democratic Party politics, and after a successful two-year term as a <a href="precinct%20captain">precinct captain</a> between 1873 and 1875, was mentioned for the post of <a href="Chicago%20City%20Council">city alderman</a> but was not selected to be a candidate. He remains a bachelor, running his bar which caters to <a href="rolling%20mill">rolling mill</a> workers employed nearby, and dubs himself a "saloonkeeper and Doctor of Philosophy".

Although Mr. Dooley would become famous for his commentary on national affairs, the columns of the first years were generally more local in scope. Through the lips of Dooley, Dunne built a detailed view of Bridgeport, a vibrant community with its own idiosyncrasies and with important local figures. According to historian <a href="Charles%20Fanning">Charles Fanning</a>, this made Bridgeport "the most solidly realized ethnic neighborhood in nineteenth-century American literature". In the first year, less than half of the columns were political in nature, but this proportion increased as Dunne used Dooley as a weapon for reform of the corrupt city council; according to Dunne's biographer, <a href="Elmer%20Ellis">Elmer Ellis</a>, "over the eight years from 1892 to 1900 there was no single force for improvement more important than the Dooley essays". Dunne depicted Bridgeport as a community whose Irish nature is on the verge of dissolution as other ethnic groups move in, an evolution to which Dooley reacts in various ways ranging from resignation to near-panic.

Commerce from the Columbian Exposition had helped shield Chicago from the gloom of the economic <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>, which enveloped much of the rest of the nation, but after the exposition closed, the winter of 1893–94 saw much unemployment, suffering and starvation. As Irish immigrants were disproportionately employed as laborers, and had less education than other ethnic groups, Bridgeport was hit especially hard by the depression, and this was reflected in the columns. Dunne's anger especially focused on <a href="George%20Pullman">George Pullman</a>, whose wage cuts for his workers (while not cutting the rents of their houses, which his company owned) helped provoke the <a href="Pullman%20Strike">Pullman Strike</a> of 1894. In his column of August 25, Dunne wrote,

Dunne brought this column into the "Post" composing room to be <a href="movable%20type">set in type</a>. When he returned later to check the proof, the typesetters began to drum their sticks on their cases, and then burst into lengthy applause, an experience Dunne described as the most moving of his life."

Mr. Dooley would become known for his humor, which was present in many of the Bridgeport columns, but the Pullman pieces were not the only ones to be serious. One had the drunkard Grady's little girl come shivering to Dooley's door on a winter's night with a can to be filled with beer for her father. Dooley accompanies her home, and tries to beat some decency into the sodden Grady. Another, with Dooley's recollections of a long-ago Christmas in Roscommon, caused Dunne to be brought to tears by his own writing. In another, Dooley joins with Father Kelly, the parish priest, in getting relief for "the man Carey down the street that nobody likes, him being a notorious infidel". Dooley and the priest gather provisions for the atheist, later getting him a job, and endure his speech against the Bible until Kelly cuts him off, "What talk have ye? Go an' starve no more." Although he applauded such acts of individual charity, Dunne through Dooley denigrated charitable organizations, wondering that "a man can square himself with his conscience by giving one thousand dollars to a policeman and telling him to distribute it! Why don't they get the poor up in a cage in Lincoln Park and hand them food on the end of a window pole, if they're afraid they'll bite[?]"

Among the comic themes during the Chicago years was that of courtship and marriage, with much humor made from the supposed aversion of many Irish males to the altar. The local plumber, Dacey, does not fall to matrimony until he enters the wrong city building and comes out with a marriage license rather than one for a dog. The fireman Hannigan's courting of Dolan's daughter is broken off after fifteen years when he is embarrassed by her giving him a wig as a Christmas present to cover his bald head; but for that she would be courted still. With Danny Duggan too shy to propose, Father Kelly acts on his behalf, resulting in "the dear little colleen trembling and crying, but holding on to him like a pair of ice tongs".

By 1895, the Mr. Dooley columns had attracted a large following in Chicago, though because he did not sign them, few knew the name of the author outside the newspaper trade. The two Democratic morning newspapers in Chicago at that time were the "Herald", owned by James W. Scott, and the "Times", which like the "Post" was owned by Walsh. In early 1895, Scott bought Walsh's two papers, and merged the "Times" and "Herald". The new "<a href="Chicago%20Times-Herald">Times-Herald</a>" promised to be a powerful progressive force, with the "Post" its afternoon auxiliary; but Scott almost immediately died. Both the "Post" and the merged paper were bought by <a href="H.%20H.%20Kohlsaat">H. H. Kohlsaat</a>. One of the main supporters of <a href="William%20McKinley%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201896">the campaign</a> of Ohio Governor <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>, a Republican, for the presidency, Kohlsaat soon announced a new editorial policy: the papers would be strictly nonpartisan, except that they would be for McKinley, for <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a> (which McKinley supported), "and for anything he wants". The new policy cramped Dunne's style not only in his editorial writing, but in the Mr. Dooley pieces as well. Both major candidates, McKinley and Democrat <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, were the butts of Mr. Dooley's wit about equally, and the bartender noted with regret the partisan anger that filled the nation. That rancor led to the effective end of McKenna's role in the column, as he (a <a href="Silver%20Republican%20Party">Silver Republican</a>) differed with McKinley over the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>, and as its opponent would not let his name be used in a paper that backed it. The fictional Malachi Hennessy, more typical of Bridgeport than McKenna as a rolling mill worker with a large family (McKenna was a bachelor), became his replacement. Hennessy had first appeared in the column on June 22, 1895, making an ill-fated decision to umpire a baseball game, and had been brought back in June 1896 as a Democrat and a "<a href="free%20silver">free silver</a>" supporter, a foil to McKenna, who was depicted as backing the gold standard. McKenna regretted his decision, but was infrequently mentioned thereafter. Hennessy, stolid, patient, and not very bright, was often the butt of Dooley's jokes, but Dunne dedicated his third collection of Dooley stories "To the Hennessys of the world who suffer and are silent."

During 1897, Dunne sometimes set his sights overseas, discussing <a href="Queen%20Victoria%27s%20Diamond%20Jubilee">Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee</a>. Dooley noted that while the sun never set on her domains, the original owners did not get to "set" [sit] there either, "bein' kept movin' be the polis [police]". Late that year, Dunne moved to the "<a href="Chicago%20Journal">Chicago Journal</a>" as <a href="managing%20editor">managing editor</a> and Mr. Dooley began to comment at his new venue in early 1898. Dunne had been limited at his old position by Kohlsaat's insistence that his papers support President McKinley's efforts to settle differences with Spain over Cuba short of war. At the "Journal", where <a href="yellow%20journalism">the journalism was yellow</a> and shrill appeals for war the norm, Dunne labored under no such inhibitions. He had always turned away praise of the Dooley pieces from those aware of his authorship, wishing to be known as a serious writer. Because of the dialect, the Dooley columns were more difficult for him than writing editorials and columns in plain English. He had ended his last Dooley piece at the "Post" with the barkeeper bidding farewell, locking the saloon door (as Dunne put it) "perhaps for the last time", possibly meaning that Dooley was done. Dooley had been depicted as in favor of war against Spain in the "Post", and Dunne favored military intervention to free Cuba. On February 19, 1898, four days after the <a href="USS%20Maine%20%28ACR-1%29">USS "Maine"</a> sank in Havana harbor, Dunne restored Dooley to his arsenal against the Spanish. Fanning wrote of Mr. Dooley's subsequent howls for war: "[A]bandoning his usual stance as a cool and neutral ironist, Mr. Dooley becomes one more loud, irrational voice expressing cruelly simplified hatred of Spain and anger at President McKinley. These new pieces mark the low point in the Dooley canon, for in them Dunne shatters the persona that he has built up so consistently."

By the time war was declared in late April 1898, Mr. Dooley had moderated his position, even if the "Journal" had not. On April 16, Dunne had Dooley paint a mocking portrait of <a href="Fitzhugh%20Lee">Fitzhugh Lee</a>, the U.S. consul in Havana whose belligerent reports were fueling the drive to war, in a column printed while the "Journal"'s editorial page was praising Lee. But the real breakthrough was after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Manila%20Bay">Battle of Manila Bay</a> on May 1. That a battle had taken place was known, but as the American commander, Admiral <a href="George%20Dewey">George Dewey</a>, was believed to have severed the cable lines, no word came to the United States, and the nation waited in suspense, fearing defeat. Then, news that Dewey had destroyed the dilapidated Spanish fleet arrived, but the details, and the fate of Dewey and his ships and men, were unknown. Before word came from Dewey that he had not lost a ship or man appeared the May 7 Mr. Dooley piece, "On His Cousin George", that is the admiral, for "Dewey or Dooley, 'tis all th' same". Dooley predicted that "he'll write home and say he's got the islands; and he'll turn them over to the government and go back to his ship, and <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a>'ll organize the Philippine Islands Jute and Cider Company, and the revolutionists'll wish they hadn't. That's what'll happen. Mark my word."

"On His Cousin George" was an immediate success, reprinted in over 100 newspapers. The columns had not been copyrighted; the "Journal" quickly acted to protect new essays, and thereafter collected reprint fees. Anecdotes poured in; a recitation of the column had calmed a savage meeting of the Texas Bar Association; another brought down the house at a meeting of California's <a href="Bohemian%20Club">Bohemian Club</a>; the U.S. ambassador in London, <a href="Joseph%20Choate">Joseph Choate</a>, read it to an audience of Britons. Mr. Dooley even reached the seats of power; Dunne's June 25, 1898 piece imagining a chaotic meeting of the president's cabinet was read to that body by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Lyman%20Gage">Lyman Gage</a>, a Chicagoan. Dunne struck a chord with his columns as people came to realize how badly bungled were many aspects of the war effort. A repeated target of Dunne's wit was commanding general <a href="Nelson%20A.%20Miles">Nelson A. Miles</a>, noted for having designed his own uniforms, which arrived at the embarkation point in Tampa "mounted on a superb specyal ca-ar", and "his uniforms are coming down in special steel-protected bullion trains from the mine, where they've been kept for a year. He has ordered out the gold reserve for to equip his staff, numbering eight thousand men, many of whom are clubmen; and, as soon as he can have his pictures took, he will crush the Spanish with one blow". When Miles invaded Puerto Rico in July without much resistance by the Spanish, Mr. Dooley reported on the general's experience of combat: "He has been in great peril from a withering fire of bouquets, and he has met and overpowered some of the most savage orators in Puerto Rico; but, when I last heard of him, he had pitched his tents and ice-cream freezers near the enemy's wall, and was gradually silencing them with proclamations".

The "Journal" supported the retention of the Spanish colonies taken during the war, including <a href="the%20Philippines">the Philippines</a>, but Mr. Dooley dissented, anticipating that there would be far more advantage for Americans who would exploit the islands than for the Filipinos whose lot imperialists said they were anxious to improve. "'We can't give you any votes, because we haven't more than enough to go around now, but we'll treat you the way a father should treat his children if we have to break every bone in your bodies. So come to our arms,' says we".

Friends had long urged Dunne to collect the Dooley pieces in book form, but he was reluctant, considering them lightweight. With the barkeeper now nationally known, Dunne finally agreed, and "Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War" appeared in November 1898. The book's preface was signed "F.P.D." the only time he would make even a slight acknowledgement of authorship in the eight Dooley books published in his lifetime, a gesture in vain as he was already becoming well known. It was an immediate bestseller, gaining favorable reviews from the critics. Dunne had selected almost all of the wartime pieces for the second half of the book ("in War"). At the time, he could not get copies of his columns from before 1895, and may have felt that non-Chicagoans would not appreciate Bridgeport; thus, just 5 of the 31 "peace" essays dealt only with the affairs of that neighborhood. He did include a piece that featured Molly Donahue, the <a href="new%20woman">new woman</a> of the neighborhood, and also a moving tribute to a heroic local fireman. When Dooley reached Britain in 1899, first in pirated editions and then in an official one, the reception was again warm. In June 1899, the "Journal" wrote:
Dunne travelled to New York and to London in 1899, taking leave from the "Journal". He was treated as a celebrity in both places. Even as he was feted for Mr. Dooley, he privately gave his creation little worth, telling the publisher of the second Dooley collection, "Mr. Dooley in the Hearts of His Countrymen" (1899) that he was free to make changes, or even exclude one of the pure Bridgeport stories. Dunne had been able to secure copies of most or all of his work, and the second volume contains "The Irishman Abroad", the fifth Dooley piece published; more than half are stories of Bridgeport, including some of Dunne's character studies of its denizens. The volume was well received by critics.

In 1900, Dunne moved to New York. Dooley's musings, since the war, had been entirely on affairs outside Chicago, with no Bridgeport columns, as Dunne needed to satisfy the demands of a national audience. In January 1900, just before he left the "Journal", he wrote a Bridgeport piece, in which many of the earlier ones were recalled. This was the last Dooley piece written for a newspaper not to be syndicated; it appeared exclusively in the "Journal".

Dunne had hoped that by moving to New York to write full-time, he would be able to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, including a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a note from the author appeared in the "<a href="Ladies%27%20Home%20Journal">Ladies' Home Journal</a>" after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.
A third Dooley collection, "Mr. Dooley's Philosophy", appeared in 1900. The lead story was "A Book Review", that is, Mr. Dooley's discussion of <a href="New%20York%20Governor">New York Governor</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s wartime memoir, "The Rough Riders". In Mr. Dooley's version, Roosevelt wins the whole war by himself, a role slightly greater than that in his actual book. Dooley's conclusion: "No man that bears a grudge against himself'll ever be governor of a state. And if Teddy done it all he ought to say so and relieve the suspense. But if I were him I'd call the book "Alone in Cuba"." Somewhat to Dunne's surprise, "Rosenfelt" (as Dooley called him) took the sting in good humor, and when the two met, told Dunne of a young female admirer of his, who told the governor that she had read all of his books, with her favorite "Alone in Cuba". Roosevelt was elected vice president on McKinley's ticket in 1900, and when he succeeded after <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">the president was assassinated</a> the following year, Dunne wrote of the new chief executive, the youngest to hold that position, "a man is ... old enough to be president when he becomes president. If he ain't, it'll age him."

Dunne also supported Roosevelt in late 1901 when the president invited <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a>, an African American, to the White House for a meal—the president's action caused outrage among white Southerners, who overwhelmingly <a href="Solid%20South">voted for the Democratic Party</a>. Dooley described Washington's visit as "going to be the ruination of President Teddy's chances in the South. Thousands of men who wouldn't have voted for him under any circumstances has now declared that under no circumstances would they now vote for him."

Another 1901 piece led to one of Mr. Dooley's most famous quotations. A number of lawsuits brought in the wake of the 1898 war dealt with the issue of whether the Constitution applied with full force in the former Spanish colonies annexed by the United States, none of which had been granted an <a href="Organized%20incorporated%20territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">organized government</a> by Congress. This question was known as whether the Constitution follows the flag. In 1901, the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> decided these lawsuits, known as the <a href="Insular%20Cases">Insular Cases</a>. The justices' written opinions were difficult to understand, and the court deeply divided, but the net effect was to hold that the Constitution did not follow the flag. The decisions gave Mr. Dooley an opportunity to puncture the court's ivory-tower reputation, "no matter whether the constitution follows the flag or not, the Supreme Court follows the election returns". The phrase has often been quoted, sometimes by people who have never heard of Mr. Dooley.

The year 1902 saw a steady stream of high-quality Dooley pieces written by Dunne, with the barkeeper philosopher commenting on the events of the day, including <a href="Coronation%20of%20Edward%20VII">King Edward's coronation</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s tales of <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, and Arctic exploration. But most were on American politics. That Dunne was often a guest of Roosevelt at the White House did not spare the president from being skewered by Dooley, nor was the former Rough Rider's aggressive foreign policy spared. Dunne disliked imperialism, and was outraged by the actions of U.S. forces in the <a href="Philippine%E2%80%93American%20War">Philippine insurrection against American rule</a>; he satirized <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Philippines">Governor</a> <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a>'s glowing report on progress there, "We are giving hundreds of these poor benighted heathen the well-known old-fashioned American <a href="water%20cure%20%28torture%29">water cure</a> ... Everywhere, happiness, content, love of the step-mother country, except in places where there are people."

The presidential campaign of 1904, as Roosevelt sought election in his own right, brought Mr. Dooley ample opportunity to comment. The bartender mocked those who wished to be vice presidential candidate on Roosevelt's ticket, alleging that the Republicans "found a man from Wisconsin who was in drink and almost nominated him when his wife came in and dragged him away. They got <a href="Charles%20W.%20Fairbanks">Senator Fairbanks</a> to accept ... by showing him a picture of our great and noble president trying to jump a horse over a six-foot fence". The president's enthusiastic campaigning attracted Mr. Dooley's attention: "And when Theodore Roosevelt kisses a baby thousands of mothers in all corners of the land hear the report and the baby knows it's been kissed and bears the honorable scar through life. Twenty years from now the country will be full of young fellows looking as though they'd graduated from a German college."

Dunne had never found the actual writing of the Dooley pieces difficult, once he got started—it was finding that initial inspiration, and putting himself in a suitable frame of mind to compose, that he found increasingly hard after 1905. Aware that the columns were reaching an audience of millions and would be reviewed by critics when placed in book form, Dunne was reluctant to release pieces he considered substandard, and defended his position strongly in correspondence with the syndicators. In 1906, he joined with <a href="Ida%20Tarbell">Ida Tarbell</a> and <a href="Lincoln%20Steffens">Lincoln Steffens</a> in forming "<a href="The%20American%20Magazine">The American Magazine</a>", a project that occupied time and energy, especially since his regular column, "In the Interpreter's House", contained musings like Mr. Dooley's but without brogue or barroom. This allowed Dunne to make his points without tedious dialect. Thus, the Dooley columns continued only irregularly, occupying parts of each year from 1905 to 1915.

When Mr. Dooley could be found behind his bar, his sayings remained at a high standard. Roosevelt remained a target, friend, and White House host, one who took seriously what Mr. Dooley said and corresponded with Dunne about it. In 1906, after the publication of <a href="Upton%20Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a>'s <a href="muckraking">muckraking</a> "<a href="The%20Jungle">The Jungle</a>", about the unsanitary horrors of the meatpacking trade, Dooley summed up the objections of the packers to the book, "if they had a blind man in the Health Department, a few competent friends on the Federal Bench, and [corrupt Illinois senator] <a href="William%20Lorimer%20%28politician%29">Farmer Bill Lorimer</a> to protect the cattle interests of the Great West, they cared not who made the novels of our country." In June 1907, Dooley and Hennessy speculated as to what Roosevelt would do when his term expired in 1909. Dooley stated that were he an ex-president, the publican would try to do something really hard and likely to take up the remainder of his days, "I'd thry to be President again".

None of the columns after Dunne joined "The American Magazine" attracted the attention the earlier ones had, but Mr. Dooley continued to comment on the issues of the day. <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> was a repeated target, as was <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>, whom Dooley summed up with "he never done anything wrong, save in the way of business" In 1909, during the debates over the <a href="Payne%E2%80%93Aldrich%20Tariff">Payne–Aldrich Tariff</a>, Dunne examined the bill and came out of it with an exotic item called "divvy-divvy", which Mr. Dooley allowed, "was let in as a compliment to [Finance Committee chairman] <a href="Nelson%20W.%20Aldrich">Senator Aldrich</a>. It's his motto." A seventh Dooley book was published in 1910, but given disappointing sales, the publishers abandoned plans for another in 1911. Although Dunne was a strong supporter of Roosevelt in the contentious 1912 presidential election, Mr. Dooley retained his customary above-the-fray attitude, mocking Roosevelt's excited oratory with Dooley feeling there was a large fire somewhere, a mystery solved when he opens the newspaper and learns "much to my relief, that it was not my pants but the Republic that was on fire".

Sickened by the carnage of World War I, and by the growing suspicion and intolerance with which Americans regarded each other, Dunne ended the Dooley series in 1915. The last of the original series of Mr. Dooley was "On Going to See the Doctor", which appeared in the February 1915 "Hearst's" magazine. Mourned critic <a href="Gilbert%20Seldes">Gilbert Seldes</a>, "We needed him badly during the war". Dunne was by then editor of "<a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>", but was left unemployed, though with a financial cushion, when the magazine was sold in 1919. He was urged by many to resurrect the Dooley series, but was reluctant, as the publication of the eighth Dooley collection that year, "Mr. Dooley on Making a Will and Other Necessary Evils" gained only lukewarm sales and reviews; <a href="Francis%20Hackett">Francis Hackett</a> of "The New Republic" accused Dunne of "scor[ing] hard and often—on a newspaper target".

It was not until 1922 that Dunne, driven by financial need, began to work on Dooley again, first by shortening old columns for re-syndication, and then, during the 1924 presidential campaign, writing new ones for the newspapers, with Mr. Dooley's tavern transformed by Prohibition into a <a href="speakeasy">speakeasy</a>. Beginning early in the year, these appeared on a weekly basis but ended in the final days of the campaign, and conflict with the syndicator when Dunne was unable to produce expected columns put an end to original Mr. Dooley in newspapers. Although prominently featured, these new columns did not generate a great deal of interest. Nevertheless, Dunne was encouraged enough to agree, in 1926, to do a regular Dooley piece for the weekly <a href="Liberty%20%28general%20interest%20magazine%29">"Liberty"</a> magazine. These appeared regularly for six months, and then Dunne ended the arrangement. Ellis speculated that Dunne may no longer have been in financial need, or knew that the pieces were not up to the standards he had earlier set. Dunne's friendship with some of the figures associated with the scandals of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Warren%20G.%20Harding">Harding administration</a>, such as <a href="Harry%20Daugherty">Harry Daugherty</a> and <a href="Edward%20Doheny">Edward Doheny</a>, made it difficult for Mr. Dooley to keep up his pose of disinterested outsider, and Dunne indirectly defended Daugherty in one piece. Dunne's last Mr. Dooley column was "On the Farmer's Woes", appearing in the July 3, 1926 issue.

Soon after the series with "Liberty" ended, Dunne received a large bequest from his friend <a href="Payne%20Whitney">Payne Whitney</a>, relieving him of the need to work. Thereafter, Dunne gave up professional writing, with the exception of an infrequent guest editorial or column, and did not write any more Dooley pieces; he died in 1936.

Over 500 columns and thirty years, Dunne's use of Irish dialect remained fairly consistent. He avoided stereotypically Irish words like "begorrah". Among the vowel shifts Dunne used is that from ē (as in the first vowel sound in "easily") to ā (thus, it becomes "aisily"). The word "my" becomes "me" in the mouth of Dooley, and "by" becomes "be", but these are more grammatical distortions than vowel shifts. The letter "y" is often used to begin constructions beginning with multiple vowels, like "-ious" and "-iate", thus they become "-yus" (gloryus) and "-yate" (humilyate) and when added next to consonants or <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s can distort the word in a way confusing to the reader (villain becomes villyan; giant becomes joynt). Some of the puns that Dunne made transcend language barriers, as when Dooley renders <a href="%C3%89mile%20Zola">Émile Zola</a>'s famous admonition in the <a href="Dreyfus%20affair">Dreyfus case</a>, "<a href="J%27Accuse%E2%80%A6%21">J'Accuse…!</a>" (I Accuse!), as "jackuse" (jackass). Pronouncing it at Dreyfus's trial gets Zola "thrun ... out" for "a hell of a mane thing to say to anny man".

The authenticity of Dunne's use of dialect was controversial even in his own lifetime. Dunne's partisans claimed that it was genuine Roscommon dialect, phonetically transcribed. But Dunne never called it such, making it clear in the columns that Mr. Dooley had been in America for many years, and so his dialect would have been modified by decades of exposure to an Archey Road wherein was known every way of speaking heard from <a href="Armagh">Armagh</a> to <a href="Bantry%20Bay">Bantry Bay</a>, and more besides. Dunne was not always consistent in his usages, and spells Dooley's favorite subject, "polytics", "polliticks", "pollytics" and correctly. According to Ellis, while Dunne was no <a href="philologist">philologist</a>, he had a good ear, and the biographer considered the Dooley pieces the outstanding use of Irish-American dialect in written form. Paul Green, though, in his introduction to the 1988 edition of "Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War", averred that scholars in Ireland have stated that Dunne did not capture the dialect, and have written that the Dooley pieces were not popular there. According to Dunne's son Philip, except in a few of the early pieces, Dooley "spoke always as an American, dealing with American and world issues. Eliminate the brogue and the pieces stand out as what they were: pure Americana."
Scholars have differed on the issue of what is to be made of Mr. Dooley and the often bizarre things Dunne placed in his mouth: whether Dooley is intended to believe that he is a cousin of Admiral Dewey, or that "Mack" (as he calls President McKinley) has actually said the seemingly unlikely things that the barkeeper relates. Walter Blair, in his 1942 volume on American humor, considered Mr. Dooley too much of a provincial innocent to grasp that referring to the president so familiarly might be a . Many Dooley pieces commence "I see by the papers", that is, the newspapers Dooley subscribes to for his customers to read and which the bartender peruses at slack times, constituting a major source of information for him. Blair contended that Dooley knows only what he reads in the "Evening Post" and other papers, and gullibly believes quotations he has heard without attribution from his customer Hogan were made up by that bookish patron. Dunne wrote in 1898 that Dooley "reads the newspapers with solemn care, heartily hates them, and accepts all they print for the sake of drowning Hennessy's rising protests against his logic".

Norris Yates, in his "The American Humorist" (1964), argued that Dooley is entirely reliant on the papers for information, and has understood them badly. He wrote that Mr. Dooley is intended to be the opposite of the well-informed citizen sought by the <a href="Progressive%20Movement">Progressive Movement</a>, and that his comments contain more truth than he knows. John O. Rees, in his journal article on Mr. Dooley, suggested that the barkeeper is intended to act in full awareness of how fantastic his words can be; he is expanding on what he has seen in the papers, turning it into a pointed story for the entertainment and edification of Hennessy, and himself. Dooley's apparent misrenderings of the literary quotations Hogan has supposedly regaled him with are, most frequently, too pointed to be mere muddling from the uneducated mind, for example alluding to <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Gray's</a> <a href="Elegy%20Written%20in%20a%20Country%20Churchyard">"Elegy"</a> in stating, while discussing high-society gossip, "No one wants to hear what Hogan calls, 'The short and simple scandals of the poor'." Although Mr. Dooley claims not to read books, this is not true as he reviews at least two, Roosevelt's tale of his time in Cuba and Sinclair's "The Jungle". Occasionally Hennessy is fooled into believing what Dooley has spoken is literally so, forcing the publican to explain to his customer that what he has said was "a joke. I med it up."

For Dunne, the Dooley pieces were a burden, but one that brought him fame and money, neither of which was enough to keep him at his desk once he gained the Whitney legacy. Before he died in 1936, Dunne knew that interest in the Dooley pieces was fading, and this saddened him. Understanding that readers were having trouble with the Irish dialect, he experimented with translating the columns into ordinary English, but published none in that form. In 1938, "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" noted in an article, "if you try quoting Mr. Dooley's brogue to the average listener you will be rewarded with a look of intense pain. But if you translate Mr. Dooley into ordinary English nearly everything precipitates out as pure wisdom." Ellis, writing in 1941, argued, "that the Dooley essays are journalism of the finest type few will dispute; that they are literature in the more permanent sense may not be so clear. Were the American-Irish brogue of Mr. Dooley still a living and growing language there might be no doubt about it, but Mr. Dooley's language has become at least obsolescent, and that puts the future of the Dooley essay in serious question." Ellis noted that attempts to imitate Dunne's success with other Irish-dialect columns failed, and suggested the brogue was not essential to the originals' popularity, "Dunne's essays lose nothing today when translated into ordinary English words".

Author <a href="J.%20C.%20Furnas">J. C. Furnas</a> regretted that "a Presidential year always makes Dooleyites feel frustrated. In 1960 we need Mr. Dooley to deal adequately with such things as public-opinion polls; <a href="Harry%20Truman">Mr. Truman's</a> opinion of primaries; the spring swarming of <a href="Kennedy%20family">the Kennedys</a> in Minnesota; [and] the problem [of] whether <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Mr. Nixon</a> should invite <a href="Checkers%20speech">Checkers</a> back into the act". Writing again in 1991, Furnas suggested potential Dooley targets might include the <a href="Robert%20Bork%20Supreme%20Court%20nomination">Bork</a> and <a href="David%20Souter">Souter</a> confirmation hearings, and the omnipresence of <a href="blue%20jeans">blue jeans</a>; but that an impediment to a revival of interest in Dooley was the present-day view of dialect works as demeaning. English professor John W. Lowe stated that Dooley "set the model for an ethnic spokesman who could be entertaining and informative at the same time using humor to mask a subversive form of humor and get a message across. Then, the Irish made it, and they found his brogue and dialect embarrassing."

Historian <a href="Richard%20Hofstadter">Richard Hofstadter</a> deemed Dunne through Dooley "one of [the Progressive Era's] shrewdest commentators". <a href="Louis%20Filler">Louis Filler</a> wrote in 1954 that "any lively mention of the Progressive Era is bound to evoke recollections of Dooley, usually in the form of one of his aphorisms". Dunne is closely associated with that era, and worked with several of the <a href="muckrakers">muckrakers</a> during the first decade of the 20th century. Scholars have not agreed on the extent to which Dunne through Dooley influenced the era: Ellis believed that the Dooley columns paved the way for public acceptance of the realistic writing of the muckrakers, but Filler disagreed, noting that Dunne's was one of many voices calling for reform in the 1890s. Journalism professor John M. Harrison argued that though Dunne's progressivism, of a non-Marxist sort, placed him at odds with others who urged change, "he was as effective as any writer of his time in keeping before the public mind those issues and questions that were the moving forces in the Progressive movement".

According to Chase Madar in his 2012 article on Dooley, "though Mr. Dooley has been nearly forgotten since the 1930s, in his prime he was the subject of comic strips and pop songs and quoted widely by presidents and Parliaments". As well as the adage about the Supreme Court following the election returns, other Dooleyisms that survived Dunne's time include "politics ain't <a href="bean%20bag">bean-bag</a>" and that a purpose of newspapers was to "comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable". In July 2016, <a href="Kevin%20D.%20Williamson">Kevin D. Williamson</a> used "politics ain't beanbag" (as he put it) to excuse the failure of unsuccessful contenders for the Republican presidential nomination to fulfill their promises and endorse the winner, <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>.

Contrasting with Dooley's present obscurity is the fame of Dunne's friend <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>. Furnas argued that Dooley was read and accepted by a far wider audience in his time than was Twain, thus rousing "the suspicion that as between the two, Dunne better fitted the notion of a national humorist". Fanning wrote, "Dunne's expansion of the literary uses of the vernacular dialect voice is comparable, though on a smaller scale, to Mark Twain's decision to let Huck Finn tell his own story."

Dorset Ooser

The Dorset Ooser () is a wooden head that featured in the 19th-century <a href="folk%20culture">folk culture</a> of <a href="Melbury%20Osmond">Melbury Osmond</a>, a village in the southwestern English county of <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. The head was hollow, thus perhaps serving as a <a href="Mask%23Europe">mask</a>, and included a humanoid face with horns, a beard, and a hinged jaw which allowed the mouth to open and close. Although sometimes used to scare people during practical jokes, its main recorded purpose was as part of a local variant of the <a href="charivari">charivari</a> custom known as "<a href="Charivari%23England">skimity riding</a>" or "rough music", in which it was used to humiliate those who were deemed to have behaved in an immoral manner.

The Dorset Ooser was first brought to public attention in 1891, at which time it was under the ownership of the Cave family of Melbury Osmond's Holt Farm. After travelling with Edward Cave to <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, the Ooser went missing around 1897. Since then, various <a href="folkloristics">folklorists</a> and historians have debated the origins of the head, which has possible connections to the horned costumes sometimes worn by participants in English <a href="Mummers%20play">Mummers play</a>s. The folklorists <a href="Frederick%20Thomas%20Elworthy">Frederick Thomas Elworthy</a> and H. S. L. Dewar believed that the head was a representation of the <a href="Devil">Devil</a> and thus was designed to intimidate people into behaving according to the local community's moral system. Conversely, the folklorist <a href="Margaret%20Murray">Margaret Murray</a> suggested that it represented a <a href="Celtic%20polytheism">pre-Christian</a> <a href="List%20of%20fertility%20deities%23Celtic%20mythology">god of fertility</a> whose worship survived in Dorset into the modern period, although more recent scholarship has been highly sceptical of this interpretation. The etymology of "Ooser" is also disputed, with various possibilities available.

In 1975 a replica of the original Ooser was produced by John Byfleet, which has since been on display at <a href="Dorset%20County%20Museum">Dorset County Museum</a> in <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a>. This mask retains a place in Dorset folk culture, being removed from the museum for use in local <a href="Morris%20dance">Morris dancing</a> processions held by the Wessex Morris Men on both <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Day">St. George's Day</a> and <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a>. The design of the Ooser has also inspired the production of copies which have been used as representations of the <a href="Horned%20God">Horned God</a> in the <a href="Modern%20paganism">modern Pagan</a> religion of <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a> in both the United Kingdom and United States.

A wooden head, the Dorset Ooser had been cut from a single block of timber, with the exception of the lower jaw, which was movable and connected to the rest of the mask by leather hinges. The lower jaw could be moved by pulling on a string which passed through a hole in the upper jaw to connect to the lower. The mask also contained locks of hair on either side of its head, a beard on its chin, and a pair of bullock's horns. Between the Ooser's eyes was a rounded boss, the meaning of which is unknown. The Ooser was hollow, allowing someone to place their own head within it, potentially permitting it to be worn as a mask whilst being supported on the shoulders; however, there were no holes allowing for the wearer to see while wearing it in this way. The historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> described the Ooser as "a terrifying horned mask with human face, staring eyes, beard, and gnashing teeth". Similarly, the folklorist H. S. L. Dewar stated that "the expression of the eyes [conveyed] a really agonized spirit of hatred, terror, and despair".

The term "Ooser" was pronounced with a short, quick "s" by villagers as "Osser". It is unclear if the head itself was the Ooser, or whether it instead was designed as a depiction of an entity called the Ooser. Dewar suggested the possibility that it might have been connected to the term "Wurse", used for the Devil in <a href="Layamon">Layamon</a>'s "<a href="Layamon%27s%20Brut">Brut</a>", or to the 17th-century Italian term "Oser", again used for the Devil. Alternately, he suggested that it might be a derivative of "Guisard" or "Guiser", two old terms for a <a href="mummers%20play">mummer</a>. Hutton instead proposed that "Osser" possibly derived from "Wooset", a term used in the dialect around <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> to refer to a pole upon which a horse's skull with deer's horns was affixed. This Wooset was recorded as having been paraded by youths in the <a href="Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire">Marlborough</a> district until the 1830s, where it was used to mock neighbours whose partners were suspected of marital infidelity, the horns being a traditional sign of <a href="cuckold">cuckold</a>ry. Similar traditions have been recorded in Wiltshire and Somerset, where they can be traced back to at least the early 17th century.

The first public mention of the Dorset Ooser was in an 1891 edition of "Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries", where it was the subject of an article by the journal's editor, Charles Herbert May. The head was, at the time, in the possession of Thos Cave of Holt Farm in <a href="Melbury%20Osmond">Melbury Osmond</a>; the editor noted that it had been owned by Cave's family from "time out of mind". Cave had stated that it had formerly been kept in an "old malt-house" in the village, "where it was an object of terror to children who ventured to intrude upon the premises". May noted that it was "possibly the only example now in existence, or at any rate from one of the very few which may still survive in the County", adding that Cave was "willing to dispose of this mask to a lover of objects of antiquarian interest".

At some point before 1897, another member of the family, the doctor Edward Cave, left Holt Farm and moved to <a href="Crewkerne">Crewkerne</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, taking the Ooser with him. In 1897, he relocated to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, leaving the Ooser with his family coachman; when Edward Cave subsequently tried to recover the head, he was informed that it had been "disposed of", with some suggestion that it had found its way to the United States. In 1935, a folklore collector named S. A. Ramsden undertook enquiries into the fate of the head at the prompting of the Egyptologist and folklorist <a href="Margaret%20Murray">Margaret Murray</a>. His enquiries led him to meet with Cave's coachman, Lawrence, who – after Cave left Crewkerne – had subsequently served as the coachman for Cave's replacement, a doctor by the name of Webber. Lawrence said that Cave left the head in his house in the village, where it was hung up in a loft and began to fall apart; Lawrence recalled wearing it to frighten people during a parade around 1900, at which time the hair was falling out. He said that the house was later pulled down, with the head probably still inside it, in order for a local post office to be constructed in its place.

In "Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries", May noted that "no recollection of its ever being made use of is retained", although thought that "it may plausibly be conjectured" that the Ooser was used in "village revels, and at similar times of rustic entertainment". The following year, a Dorchester-based writer, H. J. Moule, published a note in the same journal relating that their childhood nurse, who was from the village of <a href="Cerne%20Abbas">Cerne Abbas</a>, had talked about the head, and had referred to it as the "Wurser". Moule added that it was "surely" used in Mummers plays performed at <a href="Christmas%20traditions%23United%20Kingdom">Christmas</a> time.
Dewar, after subsequent research, reported the recollections of K. G. Knight—a member of the Melbury Estate staff—that inhabitants of Melbury Osmond associated the head with a folk custom known as "Skimity Riding" or "Rough Music". In this custom, someone accused of "husband-beating, scolding, sexual unfaithfulness or irregularity, and cuckoldry" were made to ride on a donkey or horse, facing the direction of the animal's tail, while the assembled crowd made much noise by beating frying pans, kettles, bull's horns, and bones. In Melbury Osmond, the Ooser was brought out into the crowd at such an occasion. Similar forms of "mob-punishment" were recorded in parts of neighbouring <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, where the act was termed "Skimmety Riding", "Skimmington", and "Skivetton". As he deemed it too heavy to be carried or worn by an individual, the historian of folklore Peter Robson later suggested that the Ooser might originally have been mounted in a carnival procession.

Dewar also recorded the villagers' claims that the Ooser was brought to the door of a <a href="wikt%3Atallat">tallet</a> in order to scare the local children, and that it was also used to scare adults on some occasions. Knight came across the claim that it was once used to frighten a stable hand, who jumped through a window to escape it, and in doing so "so injured himself that his life was despaired of". Dewar further drew comparisons with the horned masks sometimes worn during Mummers plays. He noted that in a case of a group of Christmas <a href="Wassailing">Wassailers</a> at <a href="Kingscote%2C%20Gloucestershire">Kingscote</a>, <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, a man was "dressed in a sack, his head in a real bull's face, head and horns complete". Another case highlighted by Dewar was taken from an account provided by G. W. Greening of Dorchester, in which a member of the Bradstock Mummers was dressed as <a href="Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a>. Given these similarities, Dewar ultimately suggested that the Ooser was "likely enough an off-shoot from the 14th century and later Mummers' plays". The antiquary <a href="Frederick%20Thomas%20Elworthy">Frederick Thomas Elworthy</a> expressed the view that the Dorset Ooser was "the probable head" of a <a href="hobby%20horse">hobby horse</a>. The folklorist E. C. Cawte, in his in-depth study of the hobby horse tradition in English folk culture, stated that although both entailed dressing up in an animalistic costume, the Ooser had no clear connection with this tradition.

Elworthy suggested that the Ooser was a depiction of the <a href="Devil">Devil</a>, an idea supported by Dewar, who believed that, as the Devil, its imagery was "intended to inspire terror in the minds of the foolish and the wicked". Conversely, others have suggested that it is a depiction of a pre-Christian god. In her 1931 book "The God of the Witches", Margaret Murray connected the Ooser to her version of the <a href="witch-cult%20hypothesis">witch-cult hypothesis</a>—the idea that those persecuted in the <a href="Witch%20trials%20in%20the%20early%20modern%20period">Early Modern witch trials</a> were adherents of a surviving pre-Christian fertility religion—claiming that the mask was a cult item that reflected continuing worship of the cult's <a href="Horned%20God">Horned God</a>. Murray's hypothesis is now discredited. The historians <a href="Jeffrey%20Burton%20Russell">Jeffrey B. Russell</a> and Brooks Alexander have stated that "today, scholars are agreed that Murray was more than just wrong [regarding the existence of the witch-cult] – she was completely and embarrassingly wrong on nearly all of her basic premises". The Ooser's pre-Christian origin theory was echoed in the "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" encyclopedia of British folklore, "Folklore, Myths and Legends of Britain", where it was described as "the idol of a former god of fertility". Although not believing that the Ooser was a specific depiction of a surviving pre-Christian deity, Dewar suggested that the imagery of the Devil, and thus of the Ooser, was originally drawn from the pre-Christian gods of "phallic or fertility worship".

In 1975 the local Morris dancer John Byfleet made a replica of the original Ooser, which he carved from a log using a penknife. This replica is on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. It is taken from the museum twice a year, on <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a> and <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Day">St. George's Day</a>, when it is used by the <a href="Wessex%20Morris%20Men">Wessex Morris Men</a> as part of their seasonal festivities. In 2005, a journalist from "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reported on a dawn ceremony performed by the troupe on May Day atop <a href="Cerne%20Abbas%20Giant">Giant Hill</a> near Cerne Abbas. The ceremony involved one member carrying the Dorset Ooser replica atop his head, with other Morris men dancing around him; after the rite they proceeded, still dancing, to a local pub, the Red Lion. In summer 2006, the Wessex Morris Men took the replica to Melbury Osmond for the first time, where they performed a dance in a local street.

Murray's interpretation of the Ooser was embraced by <a href="Doreen%20Valiente">Doreen Valiente</a>, an earlier practitioner of the <a href="Modern%20Paganism">modern Pagan</a> religion of <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>, who stated that the mask "is certainly connected with the Old Religion [i.e. the witch-cult], and that from a long way back". The <a href="Gardnerian%20Wicca">Gardnerian Wicca</a>n Melissa Seims suggested that the iconography of the Ooser was an influence on the design of the Head of Atho, a statue of the Wiccan Horned God created by <a href="Raymond%20Howard%20%28Wiccan%29">Raymond Howard</a> in mid-20th century England. Wiccans in the <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> area of the United States make use of a head with stag antlers that they term the Minnesota Ooser. Representing the religion's Horned God, it is kept on an altar and brought out for use in <a href="Wheel%20of%20the%20Year">Sabbat</a> rituals.

Hawksbill sea turtle

The hawksbill sea turtle ("Eretmochelys imbricata") is a <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a> belonging to the family <a href="Cheloniidae">Cheloniidae</a>. It is the only extant <a href="species">species</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> Eretmochelys. The species has a worldwide distribution, with <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>—"E. i. imbricata" and "E. i. bissa", respectively.

The hawksbill's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles. In general, it has a flattened body shape, a protective <a href="Carapace%23Turtles%20and%20tortoises">carapace</a>, and <a href="flipper%20%28anatomy%29">flipper</a>-like limbs, adapted for swimming in the open ocean. "E. imbricata" is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving <a href="beak">beak</a> with prominent <a href="tomium">tomium</a>, and the <a href="wikt%3Aserration">saw-like</a> appearance of its shell margins. Hawksbill shells slightly change colors, depending on water temperature. While this turtle lives part of its life in the open ocean, it spends more time in shallow <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s and <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s. The <a href="IUCN">World Conservation Union</a>, primarily as a result of Human fishing practices, classifies "E. imbricata" as <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a>. Hawksbill shells were the primary source of <a href="tortoiseshell%20material">tortoiseshell material</a> used for decorative purposes. The <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a> outlaws the capture and trade of hawksbill sea turtles and products derived from them.

Adult hawksbill sea turtles typically grow to in length, weighing around on average. The heaviest hawksbill ever captured weighed . The turtle's shell, or carapace, has an amber background patterned with an irregular combination of light and dark streaks, with predominantly black and mottled-brown colors radiating to the sides.

Several characteristics of the hawksbill sea turtle distinguish it from other sea turtle species. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and its beak is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on each flipper.

One of the hawksbill's more easily distinguished characteristics is the pattern of thick <a href="scute">scute</a>s that make up its carapace. While its carapace has five central scutes and four pairs of <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Relative%20directions">lateral</a> scutes like several members of its family, "E. imbricata"'s <a href="Anterior%20and%20posterior">posterior</a> scutes overlap in such a way as to give the rear margin of its carapace a <a href="wikt%3Aserration">serrated</a> look, similar to the edge of a <a href="saw">saw</a> or a steak knife. The turtle's carapace has been known to reach almost in length. The hawksbill appears to frequently employ its sturdy shell to insert its body into tight spaces in reefs.

Crawling with an alternating <a href="gait">gait</a>, hawksbill tracks left in the sand are asymmetrical. In contrast, the <a href="green%20sea%20turtle">green sea turtle</a> and the <a href="leatherback%20turtle">leatherback turtle</a> have a more symmetrical gait.

Due to its consumption of venomous <a href="cnidaria">cnidaria</a>ns, hawksbill sea turtle flesh can become <a href="toxicity">toxic</a>.

The hawksbill sea turtle has been shown to be <a href="biofluorescent">biofluorescent</a> and is the first reptile recorded with this characteristic. It is unknown if this is derived from the turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent organisms like the hard coral "<a href="Physogyra%20lichtensteini">Physogyra lichtensteini</a>". Males have more intense pigmentation than females, and a behavioural role of these differences is speculated.
Hawksbill sea turtles have a wide <a href="Range%20%28biology%29">range</a>, found predominantly in tropical reefs of the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian</a>, <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a>, and <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> Oceans. Of all the sea turtle species, "E. imbricata" is the one most associated with warm tropical waters. Two major <a href="subpopulation">subpopulation</a>s are known, in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific.

In the Atlantic, hawksbill populations range as far west as the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and as far southeast as the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. They live off the <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>ian coast (specifically <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a>) through southern <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and the waters off <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>.

In the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, the main nesting beaches are in the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>, <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, Guadeloupe, <a href="Tortuguero%20National%20Park">Tortuguero</a> in <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>, and in the <a href="Yucatan">Yucatan</a>. They feed in the waters off <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and around <a href="Mona%20Island">Mona Island</a> near <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> among other places.

In the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, hawksbills are a common sight along the east coast of Africa, including the seas surrounding <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> and nearby island groups, and all along the southern Asian coast, including the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, and the coasts of the <a href="Indian%20Subcontinent">Indian Subcontinent</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. They are present across the <a href="Malay%20Archipelago">Malay Archipelago</a> and northern <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Their <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a> range is limited to the ocean's tropical and subtropical regions. In the west, it extends from the southwestern tips of the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a> and the <a href="Japanese%20Archipelago">Japanese Archipelago</a> south to northern <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

The <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> hosts several nesting sites, including the island of <a href="Boracay">Boracay</a> and Punta Dumalag in <a href="Davao%20City">Davao City</a>. <a href="Dahican%20Beach">Dahican Beach</a> in <a href="Mati%20City">Mati City</a>, <a href="Davao%20Oriental">Davao Oriental</a> hosts one of the most important hatcheries of its kind along with Olive Riley Turtles in the archipelagic country of the Philippines. A small group of islands in the southwest of the <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> has been named the "<a href="Turtle%20Islands%2C%20Tawi-Tawi">Turtle Islands</a>" because two species of sea turtles nest there: the hawksbill and the green sea turtle. In January 2016, a juvenile was seen in <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a>. A 2018 article by <a href="The%20Straits%20Times">The Straits Times</a> reported that around 120 hawksbill juvenile turtles recently hatched at <a href="Pulau%20Satumu">Pulau Satumu</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. Commonly found in Singapore waters, hawksbill turtles have returned to areas such <a href="East%20Coast%20Park">East Coast Park</a> and Palau Satumu to nest. In Hawaii, hawksbills mostly nest on the "main" islands of <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, <a href="Maui">Maui</a>, <a href="Molokai">Molokai</a>, and <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">Hawaii</a>. In <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, hawksbills are known to nest on <a href="Milman%20Islet%20%28Queensland%29">Milman Island</a> in the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>. Hawksbill sea turtles nest as far west as <a href="Cousine%20Island">Cousine Island</a> in the <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a>, where the species has been legally protected since 1994, and the population is showing some recovery. The Seychelles' inner islands and islets, such as <a href="Aldabra">Aldabra</a>, are popular feeding grounds for immature hawksbills.

In the eastern Pacific, hawksbills are known to occur from the <a href="Baja%20Peninsula">Baja Peninsula</a> in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> south along the coast to southern <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. Nonetheless, as recently as 2007, the species had been considered largely extirpated in the region. Important remnant nesting and foraging sites have since been discovered in Mexico, <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, and <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, providing new opportunities for research and conservation. In contrast to their traditional roles in other parts of the world, where hawksbills primarily inhabit coral reefs and rocky substrate areas, in the eastern Pacific, hawksbills tend to forage and nest principally in mangrove estuaries, such as those present in the <a href="Jiquilisco%20Bay">Bahia de Jiquilisco</a> (El Salvador), <a href="Gulf%20of%20Fonseca">Gulf of Fonseca</a> (Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras), <a href="Estero%20Padre%20Ramos%20Natural%20Reserve">Estero Padre Ramos</a> (Nicaragua), and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guayaquil">Gulf of Guayaquil</a> (Ecuador). Multi-national initiatives, such as the <a href="http%3A//www.hawksbill.org/">Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative</a>, are currently pushing efforts to research and conserve the population, which remains poorly understood.

Adult hawksbill sea turtles are primarily found in tropical <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges in and around these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit a wide range of habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage "E. imbricata"; like other young sea turtles, they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.

While they are omnivorous, <a href="sea%20sponge">sea sponge</a>s are their principal food; they constitute 70–95% of the turtles' diets. However, like many <a href="spongivore">spongivore</a>s, they feed only on select species, ignoring many others. Caribbean populations feed primarily on the orders <a href="Astrophorida">Astrophorida</a>, <a href="Spirophorida">Spirophorida</a>, and <a href="Hadromerida">Hadromerida</a> in the class <a href="Demospongiae">Demospongiae</a>. 
Aside from sponges, hawksbills feed on <a href="algae">algae</a>, <a href="cnidaria">cnidaria</a>ns, <a href="Ctenophora">comb jellies</a> and other <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a>, and <a href="sea%20anemone">sea anemone</a>s. They also feed on the dangerous jellyfish-like <a href="hydrozoa">hydrozoa</a>n, the <a href="Portuguese%20man%20o%27%20war">Portuguese man o' war</a> ("Physalia physalis"). Hawksbills close their unprotected eyes when they feed on these cnidarians. The man o' war's <a href="cnidocyte">stinging cells</a> cannot penetrate the turtles' armored heads.

Hawksbills are highly resilient and resistant to their prey. Some of the sponges they eat, such as "<a href="Aaptos%20aaptos">Aaptos aaptos</a>", "<a href="Chondrilla%20nucula">Chondrilla nucula</a>", "<a href="Tethya%20actinia">Tethya actinia</a>", "<a href="Spheciospongia%20vesparium">Spheciospongia vesparium</a>", and "<a href="Suberites%20domuncula">Suberites domuncula</a>", are highly (often lethally) <a href="toxic">toxic</a> to other organisms. In addition, hawksbills choose sponge species with significant numbers of <a href="siliceous">siliceous</a> <a href="spicule%20%28sponge%29">spicule</a>s, such as "<a href="Ancorina">Ancorina</a>", "<a href="Geodia">Geodia</a>" ("<a href="Geodia%20gibberosa">G. gibberosa</a>"), "<a href="Ecionemia">Ecionemia</a>", and "<a href="Placospongia">Placospongia</a>".

Not much is known about the life history of hawksbills. Their life history can be divided into three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from hatching to about 20 cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, when they reach sexual maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20 cm in length in 1–3 years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40 cm (2–4 years).
Hawksbills show a degree of fidelity after recruiting to the benthic phase, however movement to other similar habitats is possible.

Hawksbills mate biannually in secluded lagoons off their nesting beaches in remote islands throughout their range. The most significant nesting beaches are in Mexico, the Seychelles, Indonesia, and Australia. Mating season for Atlantic hawksbills usually spans April to November. Indian Ocean populations, such as the <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> hawksbill population, mate from September to February. After mating, females drag their heavy bodies high onto the beach during the night. They clear an area of debris and dig a nesting hole using their rear flippers, then lay <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>es of eggs and cover them with sand. <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and <a href="Florida">Florida</a> nests of "E. imbricata" normally contain around 140 eggs. After the hours-long process, the female returns to the sea. Their nests can be found throughout beaches in about 60 countries.

The baby turtles, usually weighing less than hatch at night after around two months. These newly emergent <a href="hatchling">hatchling</a>s are dark-colored, with heart-shaped carapaces measuring around long. They instinctively crawl into the sea, attracted by the reflection of the moon on the water (possibly disrupted by light sources such as street lamps and lights). While they emerge under the cover of darkness, baby turtles that do not reach the water by daybreak are preyed upon by <a href="shorebirds">shorebirds</a>, <a href="Grapsidae">shore crabs</a>, and other predators.

Hawksbills evidently reach maturity after 20 years. Their lifespan is unknown. Like other sea turtles, hawksbills are solitary for most of their lives; they meet only to mate. They are highly <a href="Animal%20migration">migratory</a>. Because of their tough <a href="carapace%23Turtles%20and%20tortoises">carapaces</a>, adults' only predators are <a href="shark">shark</a>s, <a href="Saltwater%20Crocodile">estuarine crocodiles</a>, <a href="octopus">octopus</a>es, and some species of <a href="pelagic%20fish">pelagic fish</a>.

A series of biotic and abiotic cues, such as individual genetics, foraging quantity and quality, or population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs and the production of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.
Age at maturity has been estimated to occur between 10 and 25 years of age for Caribbean hawksbills. Turtles nesting in the Indo-Pacific region may reach maturity at a minimum of 30 to 35 years.

Within the sea turtles, "E. imbricata" has several unique <a href="anatomical">anatomical</a> and <a href="ecological">ecological</a> traits. It is the only primarily <a href="spongivore">spongivorous</a> reptile. Because of this, its evolutionary position is somewhat unclear. Molecular analyses support placement of "Eretmochelys" within the <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">taxonomic tribe</a> <a href="Loggerhead%20Sea%20Turtle">Carettini</a>, which includes the <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a> <a href="loggerhead%20turtle">loggerhead</a> and <a href="ridley%20sea%20turtle">ridley sea turtle</a>s, rather than in the tribe <a href="Chelonia%20%28genus%29">Chelonini</a>, which includes the <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a> <a href="green%20turtle">green turtle</a>. The hawksbill probably evolved from carnivorous ancestors.

Linnaeus originally described the hawksbill sea turtle as "Testudo imbricata" in 1766, in the <a href="12th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">12th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". In 1843, Austrian zoologist <a href="Leopold%20Fitzinger">Leopold Fitzinger</a> moved it into genus "Eretmochelys". In 1857, the species was temporarily misdescribed as "Eretmochelys imbricata squamata".

Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are accepted in "E. imbricata's" <a href="taxon">taxon</a>. "E. i. bissa" refers to populations that reside in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. The <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> population is a separate subspecies, "E. i. imbricata". The <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a> is the Atlantic taxon, because Linnaeus' <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> was from the Atlantic.

<a href="Leopold%20Fitzinger">Fitzinger</a> derived the genus' name, "Eretmochelys", from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> roots "eretmo" and "chelys", corresponding to "<a href="oar">oar</a>" and "turtle", respectively. The name refers to the turtles' oar-like front flippers. The species' name "imbricata" is <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>, corresponding to the English term <a href="wikt%3Aimbricate">imbricate</a>. This appropriately describes the turtles' overlapping posterior scutes. The Pacific hawksbill's subspecies name, "bissa", is Latin for "double". The subspecies was originally described as "Caretta bissa"; the term referred to the then-species being the second species in the genus. "Caretta" is the genus of the hawksbill's much larger relative, the <a href="loggerhead%20turtle">loggerhead turtle</a>.

Throughout the world, hawksbill sea turtles are taken by humans, though it is illegal to hunt them in many countries. In some parts of the world, hawksbill sea turtles are eaten as a delicacy. As far back as the fifth century BC, sea turtles, including the hawksbill, were eaten as delicacies in <a href="China">China</a>.

Many cultures also use turtles' shells for decoration. These turtles have been harvested for their beautiful shell since Egyptian times, and the material known as <a href="tortoiseshell">tortoiseshell</a> is normally from the hawksbill. In China, where it was known as "tai mei", the hawksbill is called the "tortoise-shell turtle", named primarily for its shell, which was used for making and decorating a variety of small items, as it was in the West. Along the south coast of Java, stuffed hawksbill turtles are sold in souvenir shops, though numbers have decreased in the last two decades. In <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, the turtles are also harvested for their shell <a href="scute">scute</a>s, which are called "bekko" in <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>. It is used in various personal implements, such as eyeglass frames and the "<a href="shamisen">shamisen</a>" (Japanese traditional three-stringed instrument) picks. In 1994, Japan stopped importing hawksbill shells from other nations. Prior to this, the Japanese hawksbill shell trade was around of raw shells per year. In the West, hawksbill sea turtle shells were harvested by the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a>s and <a href="ancient%20Roman">ancient Roman</a>s for jewellery, such as combs, brushes, and rings. The bulk of the world's hawksbill shell trade originates in the Caribbean. In 2006, processed shells were regularly available, often in large amounts, in countries including the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> and <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>.

The hawksbill sea turtle appears on the reverse side of the Venezuelan 20-<a href="Venezuelan%20bol%C3%ADvar">bolivar</a> and the Brazilian 2-<a href="Brazilian%20real">reais</a> banknotes. A much-beloved fountain sculpture of a boy riding a hawksbill, affectionately known as "<a href="Burnside%20Fountain">Turtle Boy</a>", stands in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester</a>, Massachusetts.

Consensus has determined sea turtles, including "E. imbricata" to be, at the very least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles have been killed by humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologists estimate that the hawksbill population has declined 80 percent in the past 100–135 years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the <a href="US%20Virgin%20Islands">US Virgin Islands</a>, <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as "<a href="Leatherback%20sea%20turtle">Dermochelys coriacea</a>") right after they are laid.

In 1982, the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> of Threatened Species first listed "E. imbricata" as <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a>. This endangered status continued through several reassessments in 1986, 1988, 1990, and 1994 until it was upgraded in status to "<a href="Critically%20endangered%20species">critically endangered</a>" in 1996. Two petitions challenged its status as an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> prior to this, claiming the turtle (along with three other species) had several significant stable populations worldwide. These petitions were rejected based on their analysis of data submitted by the <a href="Marine%20Turtle%20Specialist%20Group">Marine Turtle Specialist Group</a> (MTSG). The data given by the MTSG showed the worldwide hawksbill sea turtle population had declined by 80% in the three most recent generations, and no significant population increase occurred as of 1996. CR A2 status was denied, however, because the IUCN did not find sufficient data to show the population likely to decrease by a further 80% in the future.

The species (along with the entire family Cheloniidae) has been listed on Appendix I of the <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a>. It is illegal to import or export turtle products, or to kill, capture, or harass hawksbill sea turtles.

Local involvement in conservation efforts has also increased in the past few years.

The <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> and <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> have classified hawksbills as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1970. The US government established several recovery plans for protecting "E. imbricata".

Rotating locomotion in living systems

<a href="Terrestrial%20locomotion%23Rolling">Several organisms</a> are capable of <a href="rolling">rolling</a> locomotion; however, true <a href="wheel">wheel</a>s and <a href="propeller">propeller</a>s—despite their utility in human <a href="vehicle">vehicle</a>s—do not appear to play a significant role in the <a href="animal%20locomotion">movement of living things</a> (with the exception of certain <a href="flagellum">flagella</a>, which function like <a href="corkscrew">corkscrew</a>s). Biologists have expounded on the reasons for this apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in <a href="speculative%20fiction">speculative fiction</a>.

Given the ubiquity of the wheel in human technology, and the existence of biological analogues of many other technologies (such as <a href="wing">wing</a>s and <a href="lens%20%28optics%29">lenses</a>), the lack of wheels in the natural world would seem to demand explanation—and the phenomenon is broadly explained by two main factors. First, there are several <a href="developmental%20biology">developmental</a> and <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary obstacles to the advent of a wheel by <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, addressing the question "Why can't life evolve wheels?" Secondly, wheels are often at a competitive disadvantage when compared with other means of propulsion (such as <a href="walking">walking</a>, <a href="running">running</a>, or <a href="Terrestrial_locomotion%23Limbless_locomotion">slithering</a>) in natural environments, addressing the question "If wheels "could" evolve, why might they be rare nonetheless?" This environment-specific disadvantage also explains why at least one historical civilization abandoned the wheel as a mode of transport.

There exist two distinct modes of <a href="wikt%3Alocomotion">locomotion</a> using <a href="rotation">rotation</a>: first, simple <a href="rolling">rolling</a>; and second, the use of <a href="wheel">wheel</a>s or <a href="propeller">propeller</a>s, which spin on an <a href="axle">axle</a> or <a href="shaft%20%28mechanical%20engineering%29">shaft</a>, relative to a fixed body. While many creatures employ the former mode, the latter is restricted to microscopic, <a href="Unicellular%20organism">single-celled</a> organisms.

Some organisms use <a href="Terrestrial%20locomotion%23Rolling">rolling</a> as a means of locomotion. These examples do not constitute the use of a wheel, as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.

Several species of elongate organisms form their bodies into a loop to roll, including <a href="Patania%20ruralis">certain caterpillars</a> (which do so to <a href="Anti-predator%20adaptation">escape danger</a>), <a href="Cicindela%20dorsalis">tiger beetle</a> larvae, <a href="myriapoda">myriapods</a>, <a href="mantis%20shrimp">mantis shrimp</a>, <a href="Armadillidiidae">Armadillidiidae</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Lyell%20salamander">Mount Lyell salamander</a>s. Other species adopt more spherical postures, primarily to protect their bodies from predators; this posture has been seen in <a href="pangolin">pangolin</a>s, <a href="wheel%20spider">wheel spider</a>s, <a href="hedgehog">hedgehog</a>s, <a href="armadillo">armadillo</a>s, <a href="Armadillo%20girdled%20lizard">Armadillo girdled lizard</a>s, <a href="isopoda">isopods</a>, and <a href="fossil">fossil</a>ized <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a>s. Pangolins and wheel spiders have been observed to purposely roll away from predators. These species may roll passively (under the influence of gravity or wind) or actively, typically by altering their shape to generate a propulsive force.

<a href="Tumbleweed">Tumbleweed</a>s, which are the above-ground portions of certain plants, separate from their root structure and roll in the wind to <a href="Seed%20dispersal">distribute their seeds</a>. These plants are found especially in open <a href="plain">plain</a> environments. The most well-known of these include "<a href="Kali%20tragus">Kali tragus</a>" (also known as "Salsola tragus"), or prickly Russian thistle, which arrived in North America in the late 19th century, and gained a reputation as a <a href="noxious%20weed">noxious weed</a>. Fungi of the genus "<a href="Bovista">Bovista</a>" are known to use the same strategy to disperse their <a href="spore">spore</a>s.

<a href="Rotifers">Rotifers</a> are a phylum of microscopic but multi-celled animals, typically found in freshwater environments. Although the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> name "rotifer" means 'wheel-bearer', these organisms do not have any rotating structures, but rather a ring of rhythmically beating <a href="cilia">cilia</a> used for feeding and propulsion.

<a href="Keratinocyte">Keratinocyte</a>s, a type of skin cell, migrate with a rolling motion during the process of <a href="wound%20healing">wound healing</a>. These cells serve to form a barrier against <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s and moisture loss through wounded tissue.

<a href="Dung%20beetle">Dung beetle</a>s form spherical balls of animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, generally by walking backwards and pushing the ball with their rear legs. <a href="Phylogenetics">Phylogenetic</a> analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times. The behavior of these beetles was noted in <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ian culture, which imparted sacred significance to their activities. Although it is the dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face many of the same mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.

Among animals, there exists a single known example of an apparently freely-rotating structure, though it is used for <a href="digestion">digestion</a> rather than propulsion: the <a href="style%20%28zoology%29">crystalline style</a> of certain <a href="bivalvia">bivalves</a> and <a href="gastropoda">gastropods</a>. The style consists of a transparent <a href="glycoprotein">glycoprotein</a> rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of <a href="mucus">mucus</a>. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases <a href="digestive%20enzyme">digestive enzyme</a>s. Estimates of the speed of rotation of the style "in vivo" vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.

There are two known examples of molecular-scale rotating structures used by living cells. <a href="ATP%20synthase">ATP synthase</a> is an enzyme used in the process of energy storage and transfer. It bears some similarity to the <a href="flagellum">flagellar motors</a> discussed below. ATP synthase is thought to have arisen by <a href="mosaic%20evolution">modular evolution</a>, in which two subunits with their own functions have become associated and gained a new functionality.
The only known example of a biological "wheel"—a system capable of providing continuous propulsive <a href="torque">torque</a> about a fixed body—is the <a href="flagellum">flagellum</a>, a corkscrew-like tail used by single-celled <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s for propulsion. The <a href="bacterial%20flagellum">bacterial flagellum</a> is the best known example. About half of all known bacteria have at least one flagellum, indicating that rotation may in fact be the most common form of locomotion in living systems, though its use is restricted to the microscopic environment.

At the base of the bacterial flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a <a href="motor%20protein">motor protein</a> acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by <a href="proton%20motive%20force">proton motive force</a>, i.e. by the flow of <a href="proton">proton</a>s (<a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> <a href="ion">ion</a>s) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a <a href="concentration%20gradient">concentration gradient</a> set up by the cell's <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. (In species of the genus "<a href="Vibrio">Vibrio</a>", there are two kinds of flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a <a href="sodium">sodium</a> <a href="ion%20transporter">ion pump</a> rather than a <a href="proton%20pump">proton pump</a>.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60 cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at the base of the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. "<a href="Spiral_bacteria%23Spirillum">Spirillum</a>" bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.

<a href="Archaea">Archaea</a>, a group of prokaryotes separate from bacteria, also feature flagella – known as <a href="archaellum">archaella</a> – driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and <a href="homology%20%28biology%29">evolutionarily distinct</a> from bacterial flagella: whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial <a href="Type%20three%20secretion%20system">Type III secretion system</a>, archaella appear to have evolved from <a href="Pilus%23Type%20IV%20pili">type IV pili</a>.

Some <a href="eukaryotic">eukaryotic</a> cells, such as the protist "<a href="Euglena">Euglena</a>", also have flagella, but eukaryotic flagella do not rotate at the base; rather, they bend in such a way that the tip of the flagellum whips in a circle. The eukaryotic flagellum, also called a <a href="cilium">cilium</a> or <a href="undulipodium">undulipodium</a>, is structurally and evolutionarily distinct from prokaryotic flagella.

The absence of wheels in nature is frequently attributed to constraints imposed by biology: <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> constrains the <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary paths available to species, and the processes by which <a href="multicellular%20organism">multicellular organism</a>s grow and develop may not permit the construction of a functioning wheel.

The processes of evolution, as they are presently understood, can help explain why wheeled locomotion has not evolved in multicellular organisms: simply put, a complex structure or system will not evolve if its incomplete form provides no benefit to the organism.

According to <a href="neo-Darwinism">neo-Darwinism</a>, adaptations are produced incrementally through natural selection, so major genetic changes will usually spread within populations only if they do not decrease the <a href="Fitness%20%28biology%29">fitness</a> of individuals. Although <a href="Neutral%20mutation">neutral changes</a> (ones which provide no benefit) can spread through <a href="genetic%20drift">genetic drift</a>, and detrimental changes can spread under some circumstances, large changes that require multiple steps will occur only if the intermediate stages increase fitness. <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> describes the matter: "The wheel may be one of those cases where the engineering solution can be seen in plain view, yet be unattainable in evolution because it lies [on] the other side of a deep valley, cutting unbridgeably across the massif of <a href="Mount%20Improbable">Mount Improbable</a>." In such a <a href="fitness%20landscape">fitness landscape</a>, wheels might sit on a highly favorable "peak", but the valley around that peak may be too deep or wide for the <a href="gene%20pool">gene pool</a> to migrate across by genetic drift or natural selection. <a href="Stephen%20Jay%20Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> notes that biological adaptation is limited to working with available components, commenting that "wheels work well, but animals are debarred from building them by structural constraints inherited as an evolutionary legacy".

Natural selection therefore explains why wheels are an unlikely solution to the problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the <a href="evolution%20of%20flagella">evolution of flagella</a>, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called "<a href="exaptation">exaptation</a>".

Molecular biologist <a href="Robin%20Holliday">Robin Holliday</a> has written that the absence of biological wheels argues against <a href="creationism">creationist</a> or <a href="intelligent%20design">intelligent design</a> accounts of the diversity of life, because an intelligent creator—free of the limitations imposed by evolution—would be expected to deploy wheels wherever they would be of use.

Using human <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a> processes, wheeled systems of varying complexity have proven fairly simple to construct, and issues of power transmission and friction have proven tractable. It is not clear, however, that the vastly different processes of <a href="developmental%20biology">embryonic development</a> are suited to—or even capable of—producing a functioning wheel, for reasons described below.

The greatest anatomical impediment to wheeled multicellular organisms is the <a href="biointerface">interface</a> between the static and rotating components of the wheel. In either a passive or driven case, the wheel (and possibly <a href="axle">axle</a>) must be able to rotate freely relative to the rest of the machine or organism. Unlike animal <a href="joint">joint</a>s, which have a limited <a href="range%20of%20motion">range of motion</a>, a wheel must be able to rotate through an arbitrary angle without ever needing to be "unwound". As such, a wheel cannot be permanently attached to the axle or shaft about which it rotates (or, if the axle and wheel are fixed together, the axle cannot be affixed to the rest of the machine or organism). There are several functional problems created by this requirement.

In the case of a driven wheel, a <a href="torque">torque</a> must be applied to generate the locomotive force. In human technology, this torque is generally provided by a motor, of which there are many types, including <a href="Electric%20motor">electric</a>, <a href="Internal%20combustion%20engine">piston-driven</a>, <a href="Turbine">turbine-driven</a>, <a href="Pneumatic%20motor">pneumatic</a>, and <a href="Hydraulic%20motor">hydraulic</a>. (Torque may also be provided by <a href="human%20power">human power</a>, as in the case of a <a href="bicycle">bicycle</a>.) In animals, motion is typically achieved by the use of <a href="skeletal%20muscle">skeletal muscle</a>s, which derive their energy from the metabolism of nutrients from food. Because these muscles are <a href="connective%20tissue">attached</a> to both of the components that must move relative to each other, they are not capable of directly driving a wheel. In addition, large animals cannot produce high accelerations, as inertia increases rapidly with body size.

Reducing friction is vital for minimizing <a href="wear">wear</a> on mechanical components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. Various types of <a href="Bearing%20%28mechanical%29">bearing</a> and/or <a href="lubricant">lubricant</a> may be used to reduce friction at the interface between two components. In biological joints such as the human <a href="knee">knee</a>, friction is reduced by means of <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> with a very low <a href="Coefficient%20of%20friction">friction coefficient</a>, as well as lubricating <a href="synovial%20fluid">synovial fluid</a>, which has very low <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>. Gerhard Scholtz of <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Humboldt University of Berlin</a> asserts that a similar <a href="secretion">secreted</a> lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.

Another potential problem that arises at the interface between wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up a wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a>, composed of blood vessels, would not be able to provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to <a href="diffusion">diffuse</a> across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available <a href="partial%20pressure">partial pressure</a> and <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a>, in accordance with <a href="Fick%27s%20law%20of%20diffusion">Fick's law of diffusion</a>. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as <a href="keratin">keratin</a>, of which <a href="hair">hair</a> and <a href="Nail%20%28anatomy%29">nails</a> are composed.

Wheels incur mechanical and other disadvantages in certain environments and situations that would represent a decreased fitness when compared with <a href="Limb%20%28anatomy%29">limbed</a> locomotion. These disadvantages suggest that, even barring the biological constraints discussed above, the absence of wheels in multicellular life may not be the "missed opportunity" of biology that it first seems. In fact, given the mechanical disadvantages and restricted usefulness of wheels when compared with limbs, the central question can be reversed: not "Why does nature not produce wheels?", but rather, "Why do human vehicles not make more use of limbs?" The use of wheels rather than limbs in most <a href="engineering">engineered</a> vehicles can likely be attributed to the complexity of <a href="design">design</a> required to construct and <a href="control%20system">control</a> limbs, rather than to a consistent functional advantage of wheels over limbs.

Although stiff wheels are more <a href="Energy%20conversion%20efficiency">energy efficient</a> than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level <a href="terrain">terrain</a> (such as <a href="Road%20surface">paved roads</a>), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as <a href="soil">soil</a>, because they are vulnerable to <a href="rolling%20resistance">rolling resistance</a>. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the <a href="deformation%20%28engineering%29">deformation</a> of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their <a href="rut%20%28roads%29">entire path</a>, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.

Rolling resistance is also the reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During the time of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, wheeled <a href="chariot">chariot</a>s were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to <a href="dromedary">camel</a>s to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book "<a href="Hen%27s%20Teeth%20and%20Horse%27s%20Toes">Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes</a>", Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by <a href="ox">ox</a>en.

When moving through a fluid, rotating systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low <a href="Reynolds%20number">Reynolds number</a>s (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) such as those experienced by bacterial flagella, whereas <a href="oscillation">oscillating</a> systems have the advantage at higher (<a href="inertia">inertia</a>-dominated) Reynolds numbers. Whereas ship propellers typically have <a href="Energy%20conversion%20efficiency">efficiencies</a> around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered "<a href="Gossamer%20Condor">Gossamer Condor</a>"), much higher efficiencies, in the range of 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible <a href="foil%20%28fluid%20mechanics%29">foil</a> like a fish tail or bird wing.

Wheels are prone to <a href="Slip%20%28vehicle%20dynamics%29">slipping</a>—an inability to generate <a href="Traction%20%28engineering%29">traction</a>—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead to a loss of control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation of wheels can be seen in the realm of human technology: in an example of <a href="biologically%20inspired%20engineering">biologically inspired engineering</a>, <a href="Walker%20%28machine%29%23Real%20walking%20vehicles">legged vehicles</a> find use in the <a href="logging">logging</a> industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. <a href="Continuous%20track">Tracked</a> vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger <a href="turning%20radius">turning radii</a> than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.

Work by engineer <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20G.%20Bekker">Mieczysław G. Bekker</a> implies that the distribution of irregularities in natural terrains is <a href="Log-normal%20distribution">log-normal</a>; that is, small obstacles are far more common than larger ones. Thus, obstacle navigation presents a challenge to locomotion in natural terrains <a href="scale%20invariance">at all size scales</a>. The primary means of obstacle navigation are to go around obstacles and to go over them; each has its attendant challenges.

Anatomist Michael LaBarbera of the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> illustrates the poor maneuverability of wheels by comparing the turning radii of walking and <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a>-using humans. As <a href="Jared%20Diamond">Jared Diamond</a> points out, most biological examples of rolling are found in wide open, hard packed terrain, including the use of rolling by <a href="dung%20beetle">dung beetle</a>s and <a href="tumbleweed">tumbleweed</a>s.

Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles, especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself, and may be unable to climb vertical obstacles taller than about 40% of the wheel height. Because of this limitation, wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter.

In addition, without <a href="wikt%3Aarticulation">articulation</a>, a wheeled vehicle can become stuck on top of an obstacle, with the obstacle between the wheels, preventing them from contacting the ground. Limbs, in contrast, are useful for climbing and are equipped to deal with uneven terrain.

With unarticulated wheels, climbing obstacles will cause the body of a vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the <a href="wheelbase">wheelbase</a> or axle track, the vehicle becomes statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its static stability limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.

Limbs used by animals for locomotion over terrain are frequently also used for other purposes, such as <a href="prehensility">grasping</a>, <a href="fine%20motor%20skill">manipulating</a>, <a href="arboreal%20locomotion">climbing</a>, <a href="brachiation">branch-swinging</a>, <a href="aquatic%20locomotion%23Secondary%20evolution%20of%20swimming">swimming</a>, <a href="fossorial">digging</a>, <a href="jumping">jumping</a>, <a href="throwing">throwing</a>, <a href="kick">kick</a>ing, and <a href="personal%20grooming">grooming</a>. With a lack of articulation, wheels would not be as useful as limbs in these roles.

Legends and speculative fiction reveal a longstanding human fascination with rolling and wheeled creatures. Such creatures appear in mythologies from Europe, Japan, <a href="pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian</a> Mexico, the United States, and Australia.

The <a href="hoop%20snake">hoop snake</a>, a creature of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the "<a href="Tsuchinoko">Tsuchinoko</a>". <a href="Buer%20%28demon%29">Buer</a>, a <a href="demon">demon</a> mentioned in the 16th-century <a href="grimoire">grimoire</a> "<a href="Pseudomonarchia%20Daemonum">Pseudomonarchia Daemonum</a>", was described and illustrated in <a href="Jacques%20Collin%20de%20Plancy">Collin de Plancy</a>'s "<a href="Dictionnaire%20Infernal">Dictionnaire Infernal</a>" as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.

The Dutch graphic artist <a href="M.%20C.%20Escher">M. C. Escher</a> illustrated a rolling creature of his own invention in <a href="Curl-up">a 1951 lithograph</a>. Rolling creatures are also featured in works written by comic author <a href="Carl%20Barks">Carl Barks</a>, science fiction writers <a href="Fredric%20Brown">Fredric Brown</a>, <a href="George%20R.%20R.%20Martin">George R.

Toy animals with wheels dating from the Pre-Columbian era were uncovered by archaeologists in <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>, Mexico, in the 1940s. The indigenous peoples of this region did not use wheels for transportation prior to the arrival of Europeans.
Several twentieth-century writers explored possibilities of wheeled creatures. <a href="L.%20Frank%20Baum">L. Frank Baum</a>'s 1907 children's novel "<a href="Ozma%20of%20Oz">Ozma of Oz</a>" features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels are composed of <a href="keratin">keratin</a>, which has been suggested by biologists as a means of avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on firm open terrain, the Wheelers cannot cross sand, and are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs.

In the latter half of the twentieth century, wheeled or wheel-using creatures featured in works by fantasy and science fiction writers including <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a>, <a href="Piers%20Anthony">Piers Anthony</a>, <a href="David%20Brin">David Brin</a>, <a href="K.%20A.%20Applegate">K. A.

Some of these works address the developmental and <a href="biomechanics">biomechanical</a> constraints on wheeled creatures: Brin's creatures suffer from <a href="arthritis">arthritic</a> axles, and Pullman's <a href="Races%20and%20creatures%20in%20His%20Dark%20Materials%23Mulefa">Mulefa</a> are not born with wheels, but roll on seed pods with which they <a href="coevolution">coevolved</a>.

Tanks in the Spanish Army

Tanks in the Spanish Army have over 90 years of history, from the French <a href="Renault%20FT">Renault FT</a>s first delivered in 1919 to the <a href="Leopard%202">Leopard 2</a> and <a href="B1%20Centauro">B1 Centauro</a> models of the early 21st century. The FT took part in combat during the <a href="Rif%20War%20%281920%29">Rif War</a> and participated in the first amphibious landing with tanks in history, at <a href="Al%20Hoceima">Alhucemas</a>. In 1925, the Spanish Army began to undertake a program to develop and produce a Spanish tank, heavily based on the Renault FT, called the Trubia A4. Although the prototype performed well during testing, the tank was never put into mass production. Spain also experimented with the <a href="Italy">Italian</a> <a href="Fiat%203000">Fiat 3000</a>, acquiring one tank in 1925, and with another indigenous tank program called the Landesa. However, none of these evolved into a major armor program, and as a result the FT remained the most important tank, in numbers, in the Spanish Army until the beginning of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>.

Between July 1936 and April 1939, during the Spanish Civil War, the two opposing armies received large quantities of tanks from foreign powers. Spain's <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Republic</a> received tanks from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, many of which were captured by the <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">Nationalists</a> and pressed into service against their former masters, while the Nationalists were aided by the Germans and Italians. The Spanish Civil War, although the testing grounds for the nations which would ultimately take part in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, proved inconclusive with regard to the proof of mechanized warfare. Despite attempts by Soviet, German and Italian advisers and soldiers to use newly devised mechanized theories, the lack of quality crews and the tanks, and the insufficient number of tanks provided bad impressions on the usefulness of tanks on their own.

The Spanish Army ended the Spanish Civil War with a fleet of light tanks. Looking to field more modern and capable tanks, the Spanish government and army approved a venture to design and manufacture a better light tank, known as the <a href="Verdeja">Verdeja</a>. Although the tank proved extremely capable, a lack of raw materials and incentives doomed the program to failure. Furthermore, the army's requirements were temporarily satisfied by the procurement of <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a>s in late 1943. However, the failure to acquire more Panzer IVs led Spain to field a largely antiquated collection of light tanks and an insufficient number of medium tanks. In 1953, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and Spain signed a military aid program agreement which led to the supply of <a href="M47%20Patton">M47 Patton</a> and <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> tanks. The American decision to not allow Spain to deploy the new equipment during the <a href="Ifni%20War">war with Morocco</a> caused Spain to look elsewhere for a supplement to their fleet of Patton tanks, ending with the procurement of the <a href="AMX-30E">AMX-30E</a>, based on the <a href="France">French</a> <a href="AMX-30">AMX-30</a>.

Almost immediately after, the Spanish Army and the Spanish Ministry of Defense began to look for a future Spanish tank. This turned into the <a href="Lince%20%28tank%29">Lince</a> tank program. Despite numerous bids the Lince program failed, both for financial reasons and because of the decision to instead modernize the existing fleet of AMX-30Es, and to procure a large number of American <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tanks to replace the fleet of older <a href="Patton%20tank">Patton tank</a>s. Over half of the AMX-30Es were upgraded to a standard known as the AMX-30EM2, while the rest suffered a more finite modification known as the AMX-30EM1. However, the M60s and modernized AMX-30Es did not provide Spain with a sufficiently modern tank for the next century. In 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense began to negotiate with the German government over the purchase of the <a href="Leopard%202">Leopard 2</a>. Ultimately, 108 Leopard 2A4s were procured and integrated into the Spanish Army, while 219 <a href="Leopard%202E">Leopard 2E</a>s were built in Spain, based on the German Leopard 2A6. The Leopard 2E and Leopard 2A4 replaced the fleet of M60 Patton tanks, while Spain's AMX-30EM2s were replaced by Italian <a href="B1%20Centauro">B1 Centauro</a> anti-tank cavalry vehicles. Presently, the Spanish Army possesses 108 Leopard 2A4s and 219 Leopard 2Es.

Before the First World War, the Spanish Army bought a Schneider-Brillié in 1909 to be used in Melilla, where armed conflict with local tribes was going on. This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.

The <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> army's interest in the tank began near the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when a formal petition for one <a href="Renault%20FT">Renault FT</a> light tank was made to the <a href="France">French</a> government on 28 October 1918. This purchase, however, was not processed until 15 January 1919. Spain's "Comisión de Experiencias, Proyectos y Comprobación del Material de Guerra" (Experiences, Projects and Confirmation Commission) issued a formal order for an FT, armed with a <a href="cannon">cannon</a>, and days later extended the order to include another three cannon armed tanks, and another FT armed with a machine gun. On 5 March the order was authorized and then extended further to include two more FTs, armed with the cannon. On 20 March the French government declared that they could not process the sale, and on 12 April the process to acquire these vehicles began anew.

In May 1919, the French acceded to the sale of a single FT light tank to the Spanish Army, delivered the next month. This particular FT was armed with an <a href="Hotchkiss%20et%20Cie">Hotchkiss</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>, and was later re-armed with a Spanish machine gun. Upon inspection by the Spanish government, it was decided to procure another ten—including eight armed with machine guns and two armed with cannons. The French government declared that there were no vehicles available for sale, and later added that under no circumstances would they allow Spain to rearm these vehicles with the Spanish machine gun, and consequently denied the sale. As a result, Spain began to approach other governments, including <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, but with no success.

Following Spain's colonial defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Annual">Battle of Annual</a>, on 22 July 1921, another military envoy was sent to France to petition for more tanks. This time, the French government consented and agreed to the sale of ten machine gun armed FTs and a single command tank. The command tank was an FT chassis, with the turret replaced by a superstructure, carrying a single communications radio. These were presented to the third section of the "Escuela Central de Tiro", or the Central Shooting School, on 12 January 1922, and organized into a company of twelve light tanks. In September 1921, the Spanish government also procured six <a href="Schneider%20CA1">Schneider CA1</a> tanks and deployed these to <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> as early as 28 February 1922. On 13 March 1922, six FTs were unloaded at <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a>, as well.

On 18 March 1922, the company of FT light tanks took part in its first combat operation, during the <a href="Rif%20War%20%281920%29">Rif War</a>. Ordered to operate with the <a href="Spanish%20Legion">Spanish Legion</a>, the force was to capture the town of Tunguntz, in Northern Morocco. Surprising the defenders with their appearance, the armored company advanced, and the legionnaires behind, and captured the town of Anvar. Advancing towards Tunguntz, the tanks began to come under heavy fire, as their advance had isolated them from the legionnaires due to the speed. As a result, the tanks were forced to withdraw to Anvar to fall back on the protection of the infantry. Two FTs were abandoned by their crew because of mechanical problems and were later destroyed by the Moroccan defenders with dynamite. A post-action analysis of the action decided that the poor performance of the tanks company was a direct result of poor cooperation with the infantry, the lack of reliability of the tanks' machine guns and the lack of prior training before being rushed to the front. Thereafter, Spain's armored company was used almost continuously in small-scale operations between late 1922 and September 1925. On 8 September 1925, Spain's armor would take part in the first amphibious landing with tanks in history.

After being refitted with brand new FTs to replace losses incurred during the three years of operations in Morocco, the tank company was transferred to Ceuta to prepare for the amphibious operations planned to place in and around <a href="Al%20Hoceima">Al Hoceima</a> Bay. In the days previous to the <a href="Alhucemas%20landing">Alhucemas landing</a>, the armored company took part in a number of training exercises, with four K-type landing craft, specially modified to allow them to carry three tanks each. However, on the day of the landings the landing craft hit a shoal from the beach; as a result, the armored company was not able to land until the next day, on 9 September 1925. Upon landing, the vehicles were used to support the left flank of the Spanish attack and aided in the capture of the heights surrounding the beaches and controlling the exit points towards the inland.

The Rif War came to an end in May 1926, and the armored company was relocated to the Spanish mainland in July of that year.

With their experiences in Morocco, the Spanish Army decided to fund a development program for a new Spanish light tank. The new vehicle was to be based on the Renault FT, which was the most numerous armored vehicle in service with the Spanish Army at the time and one of the most widely used by foreign armies. The program was spearheaded by Captain of the Artillery Carlos Ruiz de Toledo, who had first commanded the battery of Schneider CA1 assault tanks in Morocco; Toledo felt that the tank would become an extremely important asset in future conflicts and felt that the Spanish Army required a Spanish-built model. As a result, he toured a number of European states in an effort to collect information on new trends in tank design and attempt to integrate these into the Spanish tank program. The resulting tank was known as the "Carro de Combate <a href="Trubia%20light%20tank">Trubia serie A</a>", or the "Series A Trubia Tank".

The first prototype development began in 1925. Produced in the Trubia Artillery Factory ("Fábrica de Artillería Trubia"), in <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>, the tank was powered by a four-cylinder <a href="Hispano-Suiza">Hispano-Suiza</a> 40/50 engine, the same engine the Spanish Army's military trucks had been equipped with since 1915. Given the Spanish Army's opinion that the FT was limited in firepower, the Trubia tank featured a special turret. The turret was designed in two articulated halves, which could traverse independently, each armed with a machine gun. Theoretically, if one of the machine guns jammed, the tank would still have another one to defend itself with. Furthermore, the vehicle's hull was provided with firing ports, to allow the crew to fire from within the tank. This prototype was put through a series of tests, and its success brought about the decision to continue development on a Spanish tank, leading to an improved Trubia tank design, known as the "Modelo Trubia 75HP, tipo rápido, serie A" (Model Trubia 75 hp, fast tank, series A).

While touring Europe for a second time, in an attempt to integrate foreign design trends into the new Trubia, Captain Ruiz de Toledo found a new type of track system in Germany. Designed to avoid having problems with the tracks coming off the vehicle, the new design substituted the traditional tracks with a system which was held together by a lateral metal wall, with the roadwheels suspended from the chassis. The track system was the most innovative and unique part of the new Trubia light tank. Apart from the new tracks, the Trubia was to have a greater velocity (at least ) and greater road range than the FT. While a new machine gun was installed on the <a href="Glacis">glacis plate</a>, the tank's crew was increased from two to three, which caused the hull to be enlarged; this also allowed the engine to be maintained from inside the vehicle, allowing the crew to fix small breakdowns in the field. To refrigerate the engine and the crew, a compressed air dispenser was installed inside the <a href="chassis">chassis</a>. This solved problems dealing with the crew's claustrophobia and the intake of gasses originating from the engine found in the FT, and made crewing the tank much more ergonomic. The original was replaced with a more powerful <a href="Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft">Daimler</a> four cylinder engine. The transmission had four forward gears and four reverse gears. The new tank proved satisfactory—and even bettered the FT in some aspects—and the Spanish Army ordered the construction of four prototypes.

The first prototype was manufactured in 1926. A total of four prototypes were ordered, but production was slow and by 1928 only one of the tanks had been completed, while the other three prototypes were not armed. The completed vehicle, called the Trubia A4, was sent to the Firing School where it was put through a series of tests. In 1931, a second prototype was completed, while the final two were completed in 1934. The original prototype was returned to the factory in 1935, to integrate a number of modernizations and to repair any damage which was done to the vehicle during the testing process. The other three tanks were issued to the Milan Infantry Regiment, in <a href="Oviedo">Oviedo</a>, where they continued testing.

While the Trubia was being developed, the Spanish Army acquired an <a href="Italy">Italian</a> <a href="Fiat%203000">Fiat 3000</a>A. Ordered in October 1924, it was received in January 1925, and assigned to the Central Firing School. There, it went through a series of experiments and tests. The tank was originally developed as a near copy of the Renault FT, of which Italy had previously attempted to procure one hundred units. It had a smaller chassis and was powered through a engine. The FIAT 3000A had a turret with two machine guns; this was later improved with a cannon and designated the FIAT 3000B.

In 1928, the Trubia Factory, under Major of the Artillery Victor Landesa Domenech, designed and began production of a prototype of a new armored tractor; these were named after him, as the Landesa. The unarmed tractor finished production in 1930 and went through a series of tests. Between 1931 and 1932 the vehicle went through a series of upgrades in the factory and was later sent to Madrid for further testing, where it passed satisfactorily in April 1932. Landesa, who had at this time been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, began a preseries of three vehicles, motored by the L-2000 engine, designed by <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a>. Ultimately, two were produced and set for testing with the <a href="Spanish%20Republican%20Army">Spanish Republican Army</a>, and another nine were ordered with the idea of using them to tow <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> cannons. All the while, the Trubia Factory began to plan an armored and armed version of the vehicle for the Spanish Army. Two were produced by 1934, although the Trubia Factory experienced troubles in producing the L-2000 engines; as a result, they were not powered by the beginning of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> in 1936. They were armed with a single machine gun.

At the start of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Army counted on a total of ten Renault FTs in working condition distributed equally amongst two light tank regiments; one in Madrid and the other in Sevilla. The former (1st Light Tank Regiment) fell under the control of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>'s army, while the 2nd Light Tank Regiment (in Zaragoza) was integrated into the <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">Nationalist</a> army. The lone Fiat 3000A is thought to have been in service at this time, but was cannibalized for parts. Spain's six Schneider CA1 assault tanks were put into service with the Republican Army, and saw combat around <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> before and during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Madrid">Siege of Madrid</a>, and during the <a href="Siege%20of%20the%20Alc%C3%A1zar">Siege of the Alcázar</a> in <a href="Toledo%2C%20Spain">Toledo</a>. They were destroyed during the Siege of Madrid. The three Trubia A4 prototypes issued to the Milan Infantry Regiment were turned over to the Nationalist uprising, while the fourth prototype located in the Trubia Factory was taken by the factory's workers and quickly repaired so that it could be pressed into service in the Republican Army.

Spain's Republican Forces fabricated a number of different armored vehicles throughout the war. Although serving little military purpose, due to the poor quality of their design and construction, they were important factors in lifting the Popular Front's military's morale. Factories in the northern areas of Spain produced a fair number of armored tractors and trucks; for example, sixteen armored vehicles, denominated Naval-Somua, were manufactured based on the chassis of the French Somua bus. The Trubia Factory, at this time working for the Republic, manufactured between 15 and 20 light tanks known as the Trubia-Naval, which were heavily influenced by the Landesa and the Trubia A4. However, most construction revolved around the armoring of trucks, known as "Tiznaos" for the grey color of their steel armor. Due to the weight of the armor and the low power output of their engines, many were not able to move more than without breaking down. These were mostly constructed in the heavily industrialized regions in northern Spain and in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. The factories of <a href="Levante%2C%20Spain">Levante</a> fabricated, under <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> guidance, what was considered to be one of the best armored trucks of the war—the UNL-35. These vehicles were based on the Soviet ZiS-5 truck, and were fabricated between early 1937 and March 1939 at a rate of no more than five per month. Also, based on other chassis, such as <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a>'s model 817T, around 120 UNL-35s were manufactured.

On 15 October 1936, the first shipment of 50 Soviet <a href="T-26">T-26</a> light tanks arrived at <a href="Cartagena%2C%20Spain">Cartagena</a>. These were put into combat as early as 26 October, under the leadership of Soviet Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Semyon%20Krivoshein">Semyon Krivoshein</a>, south of Madrid. The first combat operation in Spain for the T-26 was near the town of <a href="Sese%C3%B1a">Seseña</a>, when a Republican tank company counterattacked against the spearhead of the Nationalist's drive towards Madrid. The counterattack, although partially successful, did not hinder the Nationalist advance. By the beginning of the operation, the tanks had separated themselves from the infantry, following them. However, the Republican armor successfully surprised a company of Nationalist infantrymen, who had mistaken then for Italian allies, and routed them. The tank company then continued towards the town of <a href="Esquivias">Esquivias</a>, to the West, where they were counterattacked by cavalry from the Moroccan Legion and finally forced to withdraw. Lacking infantry support, a number of T-26s were knocked out by Nationalist infantrymen using wine bottles as bomblets. The tank company returned through Seseña, which had been reoccupied by Nationalist infantry, and came under heavy fire. Despite the withdrawal, the counterattack was heavily publicized in Madrid, by the Republic, as a victory. The lack of success is attributed to the lack of coordination between Republican tanks, infantry and artillery. Although it's commonly mentioned that Spain received 312 T-26s, this number includes 16 FTs, delivered by Poland, and 15 T-26s which never actually made it to Spain. Ultimately, 281 T-26s were delivered to Spain during the Spanish Civil War.

The Soviet Union also supplied Spain with 50 <a href="BT%20tank">BT-5</a> tanks. Although slightly heavier than the T-26, the BT-5 was faster; it was capable of reaching velocities of with tracks, on road, and with wheels. However, given the non-ideal nature of Spanish terrain, the BT-5 was rarely capable of taking advantage of its speed. The loss of many of the Republic's BT-5s during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ebro">Battle of the Ebro</a> caused them to retire the tank to their reserves. The BT-5 was a product improvement of <a href="J.%20Walter%20Christie">J. Walter Christie</a>'s fast tank concept, using <a href="Christie%20suspension">Christie suspension</a>, and was armed with a <a href="tank%20gun">tank gun</a>.

It must be taken into account that Soviet T-26 was one of the worlds most modern tanks when it arrived to Spain, and Soviet Army tank doctrine was very advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent the officers that he liked to Spain . This meant the Soviet tanks' potential was never as exploited in Spain as it could have been.

The first 50 T-26 tanks which arrived in Spain, under the command of Krivoshein, were crewed by Soviet personnel. Nevertheless, the Soviet lieutenant colonel opened a training school in the town of <a href="Archena">Archena</a>, near Cartagena, recruiting mainly truck and bus drivers from cities such as Madrid and <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. The next month, he opened a second school in <a href="Alcal%C3%A1%20de%20Henares">Alcalá de Henares</a>, north of Madrid. However, only Communist soldiers were allowed to crew Soviet tanks, and as a result the pool of soldiers to recruit from was narrow and often less adept drivers were picked over better ones, due to their political ideologies. For example, in one instance a tank commander broke contact with the enemy because he had not learned how to fire his main gun. Furthermore, at first, the Soviet trainers did not have interpreters to communicate with their Spanish students.

With training underway, and the tanks quickly put into combat, the first 50 vehicles were organized into the Popular Army's first tank <a href="battalion">battalion</a>. The battalion was equipped with three tank companies (each company containing ten tanks) and a headquarters company; each company had three platoons, with three tanks a piece, and a command tank. By mid-November a second battalion was organized. Later that month, Krivoshein and his deputy (Major Greisser) were recalled to the Soviet Union and replaced by General <a href="Dmitry%20Pavlov%20%28general%29">Dmitry Pavlov</a>. In December 1936, General Pavlov organized new Soviet armored vehicles into an armored brigade, made up of four tank battalions and a reconnaissance company. This brigade, known as "Brigada de Carros de Combate" (Tank Brigade), was composed of 56 tanks and 68 other armored vehicles, and immediately saw combat around Madrid, including in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Jarama">Jarama</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Guadalajara">Guadalajara</a>. However, the brigade was used to support Republican infantry forces and not as a mobile armored group, and as a result its strategic role during the war was limited by its misuse. In July 1937, the brigade took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunete">Battle of Brunete</a>, the largest tank battle to that date in the war, with some 150 Republican tanks taking part. The battle was also one of the few examples during the Spanish Civil War of the use of tanks to exploit a penetration along the front. However, the battle cost the Popular Army around 159 armored fighting vehicles.

After the Battle of Brunete, the brigade was reorganized into a new Spanish division, known as the "División de Ingenios Blindados" (Armored Vehicles Division). This was composed of a tank brigade and an armored brigade; the latter was made up of lighter armored fighting vehicles, such as the <a href="BA-6">BA-6</a>. It was put under the command of Spanish Colonel Sánchez Paredes. By this time, most of the Soviet tankers had returned to the Soviet Union to provide information on mechanized warfare in Spain. The only Soviet unit left was the heavy tank regiment, armed with brand new BT-5s which had not been used in combat yet. This regiment was crewed by both Soviet and veteran Spanish tankers, and was put under the command of Soviet Colonel Kondriatev. Finally, the division also disposed of an infantry brigade and an anti-tank artillery company. However, by this time the Republican military command had relegated the tank to the role of merely infantry support, dissuaded by the poor performance of Republican armor to that date. The last major battle Republican armor would take part in was the Battle of the Ebro, in 1938.

The Soviets deduced that although tank formations in Spain were not large enough to perform an ideal mechanized penetration of an enemy's lines, too large tank formations were also not ideal due to uneven terrain preventing their use en masse. As a result, armored commanders like Pavlov considered the tank's best role to be infantry support. The Republican use of armor during the Spanish Civil War was not a good demonstration of deep mechanized battle.

During the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist Army only developed a single tank, the "Carro de Infanteria modelo 1937" (Infantry Tank model 1937). Taking advantage of the capture of the Trubia Factory in the north, in 1937, the Nationalists-based it on the Republican Trubia-Naval, the <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Panzer%20I">Panzer I</a>, the <a href="T-26">T-26</a> and the <a href="Italy">Italian</a> <a href="L3/35">CV-33</a>. It was designed to unite the best of all three major light tanks used by the Nationalist Army during the war. However, it did not perform as well as expected, and it was not put into mass production. The Nationalist Army did manufacture a small number of armored trucks and tractors, as well as beginning the development of the <a href="Verdeja">Verdeja</a> light tank, but none of these contributed with distinction to the Nationalist effort against the Popular Army.

The first foreign tanks to enter service with the Nationalists were five Italian CV-33s, which arrived at the city of <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a> on 26 August 1936. These arrived with ten crewman, whom would serve as instructors. The tanks were armed with two machine guns and had a maximum of of steel armor. On 10 December 1936, Italian dictator <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> decided to send combat troops to Spain, in a bid to end the war as early as possible. These men were organized into the "Corpo Truppe Volontarie" (CTV; Volunteer Corps), and by the end of the year their ranks had swelled to an estimated 47,000 men; 20,000 of which came from the <a href="Italian%20Army">Italian Army</a>, and 27,000 of which originated from the <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a>. The corps was put under the command of Italian General Mario Roatta. The first major battle for the CTV came in March 1938, when it decided to engage Republican forces during the Battle of Guadalajara. A force of some 35,000 men, including 81 tanks, attacked on 8 March 1937. Failing to take into account the meteorological conditions of the battlefield, by the following day the Italian troops found themselves attacking over ground that had turned into mud due to the heavy rains. The slow speed of the advance allowed the Republican Air Force to persistently raid advancing Italian forces, dispersing entire columns off the main roads and forcing them to stall in the mud. A Republican counterattack on 18 March, led by Pavlov's armored brigade, forced the Italians to withdraw. Nationalist air support failed to provide close air support for Italian troops because runways had become water-logged, while Italian armor proved no match against the heavier and faster T-26 and BT-5 tanks. Officially, the Italians lost an estimated 2,700 soldiers during the campaigning around Guadalajara; the Republican Army lost an estimated 4,000. According to other sources, the CTV lost an estimated 5,000 casualties during the battle. However, armor losses were relatively low, as the Republicans lost 7 T-26s and the Italians lost 19 CV-33s. Despite this initial setback, the Italian government continued the supply of personnel and equipment to the CTV in Spain, and by late 1938 the Italian volunteer's corps was equipped with three tank battalions. By the end of the war, a total of 155 CV-33s were delivered to Spain.

The Germans delivered a total of 122 Panzer I light tanks to the Spanish Army over the course of the war. The first shipment arrived in October 1936, consisting of 41 tanks. These tanks would see combat as early as 30 October, around Madrid, when they engaged a column of Republican armored cars, which were able to knock out the German tanks at ranges of , with their larger guns. Although the use of armor penetrating ammunition fired from the Panzer I's machine guns could penetrate the armor of the T-26 at ranges of up to , Republican tankers simply began to engage from ranges of up to , using their heavier tank guns. Furthermore, the sights on the T-26 were calibrated for ranges far longer than those calibrated on German equipment. This disadvantage in firepower led the Nationalist Army to experiment with the adoption of the Italian Breda anti-aircraft gun for its fleet of Panzer Is. Firing a perforating projectile, this cannon could penetrate up to of steel armor at a range of . The installation of the gun required the top of the tank's turret to be cut off and extended upwards, increasing the vehicle's profile and decreasing the visibility of the crew. Furthermore, the new gun's sights were located within an open crease to the front of the new turret extension, forcing the gunner to aim and fire from a relatively unsafe position. Although originally the Nationalists were aiming to equip at least one Panzer I in each platoon of each battalion with the larger gun, only four prototypes were completed. The capture of Republican T-26s and their return to service with the Nationalist Army made the modification of the Panzer I unnecessary, while later attempts to up-gun the German light tank failed because of the lack of available Breda guns. There were also attempts to mount a anti-tank gun and a tank gun, taken from a captured Soviet vehicle, but these failed before any prototypes were completed.

The Nationalist's tank disparity with Republican forces caused Nationalist commanders to offer Spanish soldiers up to 500 <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a> for each captured T-26. Due to the number of T-26s captured and put back into service against their previous masters, the Soviet Union also inadvertently became the largest provider of armored fighting vehicles of the Nationalist Army. An estimated total of 178 T-26s were captured during the Spanish Civil War, including 98 put back into service, 30 irreparable vehicles used for spare parts, and 50 T-26s not pressed into service with the Nationalist Army. In May 1939, France turned over 10 T-26s, which had been interned after they had retreated across the border, to Nationalist Spain. The number of captured BT-5s amounted to much less. By May 1938, the Nationalist tank force had only put into service 4 BT-5s, as opposed to 39 T-26s. The first Nationalist tank company outfitted with T-26s entered combat during the Battle of Brunete, between 18–23 July 1937. Ultimately, the amount of captured equipment caused the Nationalists to organize a recuperation unit, designed to recuperate Soviet armor off the field and repair them so that they could return to combat.

At the end of the Spanish Civil War, the Spanish Army could count on 144 Panzer Is and CV-33s, and 139 T-26s. Panzer Is and CV-33s were organized as "light tanks", denominated Type Is, while the T-26s were considered "medium" tanks and categorized as Type IIs. These were organized into four armored regiments, including the 1st Tank Regiment (based in Madrid), the 2nd Tank Regiment (in <a href="Sevilla">Sevilla</a>) and the 3rd and 4th Tank Regiments. The 3rd's organization was based upon that used by Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War, while the 4th's was based on that used by the Italian CTV. In 1941, a fifth regiment was created in North Africa.

Between late 1937 and 1938, Captain <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Verdeja%20Bardales">Félix Verdeja Bardales</a> began to privately develop the concept for a new light tank. The new tank would take into consideration all the qualities and problems with existing tanks in service with the Nationalist Army, including the Panzer I and T-26, and combine a number of characteristics which would make it the best light tank in service at the time. His ideal light tank included a tank gun, with 360-degree traverse and an elevation of 72 degrees. At the same time, the vehicle was to have the lowest possible silhouette, and no less than of all-around armor, and on the front. Furthermore, the armor was to be sloped to maximize its efficiency and chance of an incoming projectile ricocheting. With a maximum velocity of , the light tank was to be powered by a engine. Furthermore, the vehicle's mechanical reliability was to improve upon that of the existing tanks in service with the Nationalist Army. Despite initial obstacles, including opposition to an indigenous Spanish tank program from German General <a href="Wilhelm%20Ritter%20von%20Thoma">Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma</a>, the first prototype was delivered in late 1938; this prototype was built from spare parts taken from a number of different tanks. The prototype performed well in testing and a new prototype was ordered.

The new prototype was much closer to what Captain Verdeja had originally planned. The chassis was enlarged, and the engine was moved to the left side of the front compartment of the hull. The volume of the fuel tanks and the thickness of the armor was also increased, while the height of the turret was decreased by sloping the turret's sides. One of the most unusual — at the time — developments for the tank were the tracks, designed to eliminate the possibility of having them slide off when the tank was moving. The tank had a sprocket to the front of the hull, on each side, and a tensioner to the rear. The tracks were guided by four return rollers and four roadwheels. The tracks had previously been tested on the original prototype; they were designed to fit around the roadwheel, and consequently lock themselves into place, avoiding the possibility of slipping off. The construction of the prototype was postponed until May 1940, due to a shortage of funds, and the tank was finally delivered to the proving grounds of Carabanchel for testing. The prototype was denominated the Verdeja 1, and competed against a T-26B in a number of different tests. Ultimately, the Verdeja scored a total of 243 points, as compared to 205 scored by the T-26. The testing resulted in a number of modifications, including higher suspension to allow climbing over taller obstacles, the increase in armor thickness, increase of the body width and the creation of an empty space at the rear, to allow for the future installation of a communications radio. After two months work, the Verdeja 1 was returned for testing and this time scored a total of 261.98 points. Although the success of this prototype persuaded the Spanish government to issue an order for the construction of 1,000 tanks, ultimately lack of incentives to develop the relevant industrial infrastructure; the poor economic situation after the Spanish Civil War and absence of foreign clients, soon caused the production program to collapse.

As the Verdeja 1 program dissolved, Captain Verdeja began to design a successor, taking into consideration the lessons learned during the opening campaigns of the Second World War. The new design featured a reorganized engine bay at the rear of the chassis, which meant moving the drive sprocket to the rear as well. The movement of the engine's location allowed for better cooling of the vehicle's motor and the fighting compartment, as well as allowing the turret to be moved forward. The vehicle's armor was also increased substantially. This new tank was not approved for production or further development, due to continued postponement of the production of the Verdeja 1 for reasons which included offers by the German government to supply the Panzer IV's engine for the Verdeja 1. Although production of the new vehicle finally began in 1942, it was not until August 1944 that the Verdeja 2 prototype was delivered. The decision to purchase a number of German armored vehicles delayed the decision to begin production of the Verdeja 2; ultimately the vehicle was left untouched until 1950, when there was a failed attempt to mount a new engine.

Beginning in 1945, the now-Major Verdeja was ordered to begin designing an artillery piece using a rapid-firing 75 millimeter L/40 howitzer designed by <a href="Navantia">"Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval"</a>, based on the Verdeja 1 chassis. The chassis' roof and rear wall were eliminated, and instead a gun shield placed over the front. A mechanical brake was installed next to the idler wheel, stopping rearwards movement of the artillery piece during the firing process. The availability of the required parts and the lack of complicated changes meant that the vehicle was quickly prepared and tested extensively. The fate of the self-propelled piece was much the same as that of the Verdeja 2, and the vehicle was left untouched at the proving grounds in Carabanchel until 1973, when it was moved to the Spanish base "Alfonso XIII", housing the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment "Wad Rass nº 55". It was soon moved to another base, and finally delivered to the base of "El Goloso", outside of Madrid, as a part of an armored vehicles museum.

In 1943, the Spanish Army and government decided to replace much of its armor, after studying war in Europe and North Africa. Tanks such as the Panzer I and T-26 were obsolete, as compared to newer tanks such as the Soviet <a href="T-34">T-34</a> and German <a href="Panther%20tank">Panther tank</a>. As a result, on 15 March 1943 Spain began to negotiate with the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> over the acquisition of modern materiel. The petition asked for 250 <a href="Panzer%20III">Panzer III</a>s and 100 <a href="Panzer%20IV">Panzer IV</a>s. In return, the Germans instead offered a sale of 20 Panzer IVs and 10 <a href="Sturmgesch%C3%BCtz%20III">Sturmgeschütz III</a>s. On 29 April, Spain accepted Germany's offer. The Panzer IVs sold were of the "Ausf." H variant, and arrived in Spain on 6 December 1943. The Panzer IV "Ausf." H included the longer tank gun, and the homogeneous steel plate on the glacis. 

As early as January 1944, Spain again began to negotiate with Germany for more equipment. The new program revolved around the sale of 33 Panzer IVs, three of which would be of the command variant. Another offer was made for 67 more Panzer IVs at a later date; a result, the two programs together summed up to a potential procurement of 100 Panzer IVs. Spain also suggested the purchase of a number of <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger tank</a>s, although this offer never amounted to anything serious. Regardless, the program to acquire another 100 Panzer IVs never materialized. The 20 Panzer IVs received in late 1943 were organized into two companies, distributed among two battalions in the armored regiment of the Brunete Armored Division.

At the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the Spanish Army counted on a tank force composed of 20 Panzer IVs, 10 StuG IIIs, 116 T-26s, 93 Panzer Is (including command vehicles), 60 CV-33s and 80 armored cars. In 1949 the armored regiment was reorganized into two battalions of 60 T-26s, with two command Panzer Is, six combat versions of the Panzer I and two CV-33, which were used for reconnaissance, each. A third battalion was composed of the 20 Panzer IVs, plus six Panzer Is. The regiment numbered an estimated 1,500 personnel and 100 tanks.

By the mid-1950s, the state of the Spanish Army's tanks was deteriorating. Spain's armored force composition remained the same until February 1954, when the United States delivered the first twelve <a href="M47%20Patton">M47 Patton</a> tanks to the Spanish Army. These were a product of a military aid program the United States had signed with Spain in 1953. By 1957, the Spanish Army had received a total of 29 M47 tanks. Over the course of the 1950s, Spain received a total of 389 M47 Patton tanks. Throughout the 1960s, Spain received 65 <a href="M48%20Patton">M48 Patton</a> tanks and 66 M48A1s. The M47 and M48 tanks were an important modernization of Spain's armored firepower. For example, while the T-26 was armed with a cannon, the American tanks were armed with the much more powerful tank gun. While a Panzer IV's ("Ausf." G) <a href="7.5%20cm%20KwK%2040">L/43 tank gun</a> could penetrate of steel armor at (using the "Panzergranate" 39), the M47 (using the M348 <a href="High%20explosive%20anti-tank%20warhead">HEAT</a> warhead) could penetrate from its tank gun. Furthermore, the M47's armor was thick on the glacis plate, and thick on the turret front. Spain also received a number of <a href="M41%20Walker%20Bulldog">M41 Walker Bulldog</a> light tanks. These were organized into the "Villaviciosa" Light Armored Cavalry Regiment, while four were also organized into the "Alcázar de Toledo" Armored Infantry Regiment as reconnaissance tanks.

Between 1953 and 1968, the Spanish Army received a total of 446 medium battle tanks (M47s and M48s), 123 light tanks (<a href="M24%20Chaffee">M24s</a> and M41s), as well as 30 <a href="armored%20recovery%20vehicle">armored recovery vehicle</a>s (the M74). In 1970, the United States agreed to extend the military aid program by another five years, giving Spain another 66 M48A2 tanks and 17 M41A3s.

The vehicles received were organized based on a reorganization of the "Brunete" Armored Division in 1965. This included the General Staff, based at <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20El%20Pardo">El Pardo</a>, and the "Nucleo de Tropas Divisionario" (Divisionary Troop Nucleus). The latter was formed by the "Villaviciosa" Light Armored Cavalry Regiment, the Campaign Artillery Regiment, the 1st Anti-Air Artillery Group, the 1st Engineering Regiment and the Divisionary Logistics Group. Also in the division was the XI Mechanized Infantry Brigade, which included the <a href="6th%20Mechanized%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%E2%80%9CSaboya%E2%80%9D">6th "Saboya" Motorized Infantry Regiment</a>, the 55th "Uad Ras" Mechanized Infantry Regiment, the XI Self-Propelled Artillery Group, the XI Engineering Battalion and the XI Logistics Group. Finally, the division also made use of the XII Armored Brigade, which was formed by the 61st "Alcázar de Toledo" Armored Infantry Regiment, the <a href="31st%20Mechanized%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%26quot%3BAsturias%26quot%3B">31st "Asturias" Mechanized Infantry Regiment</a>, the XII Self-Propelled Artillery Group, the XII Engineering Battalion and the XII Logistics Group. The majority of the division's armor was located in the "Alcázar de Toledo" Armored Infantry Regiment, which contained two regiments of 48 M48s and 54 M47s, respectively.

The United States' ban on the usage of American ordnance supplied as military aid to Spain during the 1957–58 <a href="Ifni%20War">Ifni War</a> pushed Spain to look for alternative equipment which could be freely employed in the <a href="Spanish%20Sahara">Spanish Sahara</a>. Throughout the 1960s, the Spanish government had approached the governments of France and West Germany, hoping to procure either the <a href="AMX-30">AMX-30</a> or the <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a>, respectively. Ultimately, the Germans were unable to sell the Leopard tank on account of the gun system being <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a>; at the time, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Labour Party</a> had decided not to sell to the government of <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> in Spain. As a result, in May 1970 Spain and France agreed to the sale of 19 AMX-30 main battle tanks. The first six AMX-30s were delivered in November 1970, and these were immediately issued to a new armoured company of the Spanish Legion, stationed in Spanish Sahara. All 19 AMX-30s purchased from France in 1970 were delivered to the Spanish Legion, in the Spanish Sahara. Beginning in 1974, Spain began to manufacture the AMX-30 (now denominated the <a href="AMX-30E">AMX-30E</a>), with production of the first batch of 180 tanks ending on 25 June 1979. The second batch, this time of 100 AMX-30Es, were produced between 1979 and 1983. This gave the Spanish Army a total of 299 AMX-30Es.

The AMX-30E was armed with the <a href="105%20mm%20Modele%20F1">modele F1</a> tank gun, and was powered by the HS-110 diesel engine. With a fuel tank of , the tank had a road range of and the fuel was, on average, sufficient for 18 hours of travel. The tracks had a life of at least . However, Spain's new tanks began to suffer a number of mechanical problems, dealing with the reliability of the original engine and transmission. Therefore, the Spanish Army and <a href="General%20Dynamics%20Santa%20B%C3%A1rbara%20Sistemas">Santa Bárbara Sistemas</a> (the vehicle's manufacturer in Spain) began to look into a series of modifications to improve the AMX-30. By this time, the Spanish Army had already begun upgrading its M47 and M48 Patton tanks to the M47E and M48E models, which made them equivalent to the <a href="M60%20Patton">M60 Patton</a> tank in capabilities.

From the late 1970's Spain had upgraded 330 M47 tanks to the M47E and E1 standard with AVDS-1790-2A diesel engines and CD-850-6A transmissions like those in the M60A1 and elimination of the bow gunners position. Another 46 were further upgraded to the M47E2 standard with a German Rheinmetall Rh-105-30 105 mm gun. Eighteen of the Spanish M48's were locally upgraded to the M48A5E standard, essentially matching the American M48A3 configuration for the Marines. Fifty four M48A2 tanks (1 battalion) acquired from Germany were locally upgraded to the M48A5E1 standard which was equivalent to the American M48A5, followed by and 108 from the United States upgraded to the M48A5E1 which provided a passive M35 periscope for the gunner, AM/VVS-2 passive periscope for the driver and the TEESS engine smoke laying system. From 1983 a further 54 tanks were upgraded to the M48A5E2 standard with a Hughes Mk 7 fire control system similar to that of the M60A3 featuring a passive night vision sight for the gunner, laser rangefinder, and analog electronic ballistic computer. A further 110 were upgraded in 1984. A further upgrade of these to the M48A5E3 standard from 1991 featuring a gun stabilization system and thermal gunners sight was cancelled with the availability of surplus American M60A3 TTS tanks retired under CFE.

While the army was studying a possible modernisation of its brand-new AMX-30E fleet, the Spanish Ministry of Defense had set aside 120 billion "<a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a>" (1.1 billion <a href="US%20Dollar">dollars</a>) for a future tank programme and attracted interest from five foreign companies. A bid by Krauss-Maffei's, known as the <a href="Lince%20%28tank%29">Lince</a>, provided the clearest technical designs. The tank would be and equipped with a <a href="Rheinmetall%20120%20mm%20gun">120-millimeter main gun</a>. It could fire this gun on the move and aim at targets with effectiveness in day and night operations. Fitted with a 1,200 horsepower (894.84 <a href="Watt">kW</a>) engine, the Lince could travel as fast as 70 kilometers per hour (43.50 mph) on the roads. Although heavily based on the Leopard 2A4, the Lince was smaller and lighter, trading protection for mobility. Specifically, the Lince prioritised enhanced mobility over the irregular Spanish terrain. Furthermore, size restrictions were imposed due to the existing capabilities of Spain's railroad and highway network. Although the reduced armor conflicted with the problems that the Spanish had with AMX-30E's thin armour, the Lince used a multi-layer armor similar to that of the German Leopard 2A4, providing greater protection than standard armour for a similar weight. The protection was further enhanced by the low profile turret, again similar to that of the Leopard 2A4. Despite the offer and ongoing collaboration with the Italians, Spanish investment in the German-Spanish Lince programme grew up to 200 billion pesetas (1.8 billion dollars). However, the Spanish government did not announce any winner for the contract. This indecision led Krauss-Maffei to freeze their bid for the Lince. Krauss-Maffei also cited the loss of millions of dollars due to failures on part of Santa Bárbara Sistemas, who would manufacture the Lince. In 1987, the Lince program was pushed aside and postponed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense's decision to instead go on with the modernisation of the Spanish Army's AMX-30E fleet. Ultimately, the purchase of a number of M60 Patton tanks, the modernisation of the AMX-30E and the continued fiscal problems finally caused the Spanish Ministry of Defense to cancel the Lince programme in 1989.

Between 1989 and 1993, 150 AMX-30Es were modernised to what would become known as the AMX-30EM2. The modernisation entailed the introduction of a new armour piercing discarding sabot round, the modification of the turret hatch to allow the installation of a larger anti-aircraft machine gun, and a brand new fire control system. Besides these modernisations of the tank's firepower, the mobility of the tank was improved through the exchange of the old engine and transmission for the more reliable <a href="MTU%20Friedrichshafen">MTU 833</a> Ka-501 diesel engine, producing , coupled with the German ZF LSG-3000. A new smoke machine, linked to the tank's new engine, was also installed. The other 149 AMX-30Es went through a less expensive and extensive modification, known as the AMX-30EM1. These received the American Allison CD-850-6A three speed transmission (two forward and one reverse); however, the new transmission caused extensive overheating in the engine compartment. These 149 AMX-30EM1s would eventually be replaced by US surplus M60A3 Patton tanks, purchased from the United States, in the early 1990s.

In the early 1990s, the Spanish Army received 244 M60 tanks to replace its aging fleet of M47Es and M48Es, and its troublesome AMX-30EM1s. However, these did not represent a great improvement over the existing fleet, and as a result as early as 1994 the Spanish government had already begun to negotiate for a future Spanish tank, which would replace the M60. Although the Germans offered Spain surplus <a href="Leopard%201">Leopard 1</a> tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the <a href="German%20Army">German Army</a> after the <a href="German%20reunification">reunification of Germany</a>, the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2. In March 1994, the Spanish Ministry of Defense created "Programa Coraza 2000" (Programme Armour 2000), which focused on the procurement and integration of new armament for the Spanish Army's modernisation. The program included the procurement and integration of a Spanish derivative of the German Leopard 2, known as the <a href="Leopard%202E">Leopard 2E</a> into the Spanish Army. The programme's scope extended to the integration of 108 Leopard 2A4s, which were leased to Spain in late 1995. Apart from procurement, "Programa Coraza" was meant to prepare the Spanish Army logistically for the introduction of new matériel.

A memorandum of understanding was signed on 1995 between the German and Spanish governments, setting the foundations for an acquisition of up to 308 brand-new Leopard 2Es. These were to be assembled in Spain by Santa Bárbara Sistemas, with 60–70 percent of the components manufactured by Spanish companies, and production taking place between 1998 and 2003. Furthermore, the German government agreed to lend the Spanish Army 108 for training purposes for a period of five years. These vehicles were delivered between November 1995 and June 1996. In 1998, Spain agreed to procure the ceded and reduce production of the brand-new Leopard 2E to 219 vehicles. In 2005 it was declared that the 108 Leopard 2A4s were to cost Spain 16.9 million <a href="euro">euro</a>s, to be paid by 2016. The Leopard 2Es, based on the German Leopard 2A6, were produced between 2003 and 2008.

While the M60s were replaced by the Leopard 2s, the AMX-30EM2s were replaced by the Italian <a href="B1%20Centauro">B1 Centauro</a> anti-tank vehicle in the early years of the 2000s (decade).

24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Karstjäger

The 24th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Karstjäger" was a <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger">mountain infantry</a> <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> of the <a href="Waffen-SS">"Waffen"-SS</a>, the armed wing of the German <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> that served alongside, but was never formally part of, the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Named "Karstjäger" ("<a href="Karst">Karst</a> Hunter"), it was one of the 38 divisions fielded by the "Waffen"-SS. Formed on 18 July 1944 from the SS Volunteer "Karstwehr" Battalion, its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the "Waffen" Mountain ("Karstjäger") Brigade of the SS. Throughout its existence as a battalion, division and brigade, it was primarily involved in fighting <a href="Partisan%20%28military%29">partisans</a> in the <a href="Karst%20Plateau">Karst Plateau</a> on the frontiers of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a>, and <a href="Austria%20in%20the%20time%20of%20National%20Socialism">Austria</a>; the mountainous terrain required specialised mountain troops and equipment.

Founded in 1942 as a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a>, the unit consisted mainly of <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche"</a> and recruits from <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>. Although focused on <a href="Anti-partisan%20operations%20in%20World%20War%20II">anti-partisan operations</a>, it also saw action in the wake of the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">Italian surrender</a> when it moved to disarm Italian troops in <a href="Tarvisio">Tarvisio</a> and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the <a href="British%206th%20Armoured%20Division">British 6th Armoured Division</a> on 9 May 1945. A joint Italian-German study implicated the division in 23 separate war crimes involving the killing of a total of 277 people between the Italian surrender and the end of the war.

In mid-1942, the <a href="Waffen-SS">"Waffen"-SS</a> formed a <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> intended for <a href="Anti-partisan%20operations%20in%20World%20War%20II">anti-partisan operations</a> in the rugged and high-altitude border region between <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Austria%20in%20the%20time%20of%20National%20Socialism">Austria</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> known as the "<a href="Karst%20Plateau">Karst</a>". SS-"<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" (Colonel) Hans Brand, a geologist and <a href="Speleology">speleologist</a>, suggested the creation of the unit. The company was formed at the SS training centre in <a href="Dachau">Dachau</a> on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the <a href="23rd%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Kama%20%282nd%20Croatian%29">23rd "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Kama" (2nd Croatian)</a>.

It was expanded to <a href="battalion">battalion</a> strength of around 500 troops in November 1942, and as the SS-"Freiwilligen-Karstwehr" Battalion, it spent the first six months of 1943 training in Austria. The unit drew its recruits mainly from among the <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Germans of Yugoslavia</a> ("Volksdeutsche") and <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>ians, with the officer <a href="cadre%20%28military%29">cadre</a> being drawn from SS geological detachments. The battalion-strength "Waffen"-SS Geological Corps (), from which such detachments were drawn, was formed in April 1941 and consisted mainly of engineers with a few geologists. They examined caves and natural obstacles, and determined whether off-road terrain was suitable for <a href="tank">tank</a>s. They were also responsible for locating sources of fresh water. Following the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Cassibile">Armistice of Cassibile</a> in September 1943, the battalion was tasked with disarming <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Army%20during%20World%20War%20II">Italian troops</a> around <a href="Tarvisio">Tarvisio</a> on the border between the three countries. It then moved on to protective duties for nearby "Volksdeutsche" communities. From October 1943 until June 1944, the battalion was based at <a href="Gradisca%20d%27Isonzo">Gradisca d'Isonzo</a> in Italy, and participated in anti-partisan operations in the areas of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, <a href="Udine">Udine</a> and the <a href="Istrian%20peninsula">Istrian peninsula</a>. On 10 October, a column of the battalion was ambushed at the <a href="Predil%20Pass">Predil Pass</a>, suffering three killed and eight wounded. The following day the battalion burned down the village of <a href="Strmec%20na%20Predelu">Strmec</a> and killed 16 local men in retaliation. Up to 19 October 1943, the battalion suffered a total of 18 killed and 45 wounded in a series of engagements near the village of <a href="Bovec">Bovec</a> (Flitsch). During the same period, the battalion captured two Italian <a href="Obice%20da%2075/18%20modello%2034">75 mm mountain guns</a>, which significantly increased its firepower.

During late October and November 1943, the battalion was engaged in anti-partisan operations around <a href="%C5%BDaga%2C%20Bovec">Žaga</a> (Saga) and <a href="Kobarid">Kobarid</a> (Karfreit), including Operation "Traufe" (Eaves). In late November, it was placed under the command of the <a href="SS%20and%20police%20leader">Supreme SS and Police Leader, Italy</a>, "<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS</a>" (Lieutenant General) <a href="Karl%20Wolff">Karl Wolff</a> for an operation. In February 1944, the battalion conducted Operation "Ratte" (Rat), during which it burned down the villages of <a href="Komen">Komen</a> and <a href="Branik">Branik</a> (Rihenberg), and interned the population of both villages in labour camps. Early in 1944, Brandt suggested that <a href="Slovenes">Slovene</a> nationalists be recruited into the battalion, but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a>. At this stage, it was estimated that there were about 20,000 communist partisans operating in the <a href="Province%20of%20Gorizia">Gorizia region</a>. During March 1944, the battalion was involved in a rapid series of operations, including "Zypresse" (Cypress), "Märzveilchen" (Violet), "Maulwurf" (Mole) and "Hellblau" (Light Blue), resulting in significant guerrilla casualties, as well as executions of captured partisans. In March and April, Operation "Osterglocke" (Daffodil) was conducted over 12 days, followed by Operation "Liane" in late May, and the long-running Operation "Annemarie" which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944. In June 1944, a patrol from the battalion failed to return from a task in the vicinity of <a href="Cividale%20del%20Friuli">Cividale del Friuli</a>. Two days later, they were found naked with their severed heads impaled on bayonets. The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans. While engaged in anti-partisan work, the battalion grew to a strength of around 1,000.

On 18 July 1944, "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer</a>"-SS <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> ordered that the battalion be expanded to <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisional</a> size, although the authorised strength was only 6,600 troops. The 24th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Karstjäger" was to be established by the Higher SS and Police Leader () for the <a href="Operational%20Zone%20of%20the%20Adriatic%20Littoral">Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral</a>, SS-"<a href="Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">Gruppenführer</a>" (Major General) <a href="Odilo%20Globocnik">Odilo Globocnik</a>. The name "Karstjäger" was derived from a combination of "Karst", denoting the region of operations, and "<a href="J%C3%A4ger%20%28infantry%29">Jäger</a>", the German military term for light infantry. The division was to consist of two "<a href="Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger">Gebirgsjäger</a>" (mountain infantry) regiments, with an artillery regiment, reconnaissance, "<a href="Panzerj%C3%A4ger">Panzerjäger</a>" (<a href="anti-tank">anti-tank</a>) and <a href="pioneer%20%28military%29">pioneer</a> battalions, as well as replacement and supply troops. The division was supplied with 14 captured Italian <a href="Carro%20Armato%20P%2040">Carro Armato P 40</a> tanks, but these proved unreliable, with only half being serviceable at any one time. In August 1944, the under-strength division participated in Operation "Dachstein" under the command of the <a href="188th%20Reserve%20Mountain%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">188th Mountain Division</a>. Between August and November 1944, the division continued performing anti-partisan duties in the same region, but its strength had only reached 3,000, less than half of its authorised establishment. It proved impossible to recruit sufficient troops for the division, and in December 1944 the division was downgraded to a <a href="brigade">brigade</a>.

During late 1944 and early 1945, the "Waffen" Mountain ("Karstjäger") Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the <a href="Julian%20Alps">Julian Alps</a>, and was then deployed to the coastal area around Trieste and the <a href="Marano-Grado%20Lagoon">Marano-Grado Lagoon</a>. In danger of being cut off by Allied forces, the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps, having to fight its way through the <a href="Tagliamento">Tagliamento</a> river valley between <a href="Osoppo">Osoppo</a> and <a href="Gemona%20del%20Friuli">Gemona</a>. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought <a href="British%20Army%20during%20the%20Second%20World%20War">British</a> and <a href="Military%20history%20of%20New%20Zealand%20during%20World%20War%20II%23Italy">New Zealand</a> forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps. The brigade replacement company, which had been sent to Cividale from its training centre at <a href="Pottenstein%2C%20Bavaria">Pottenstein, Bavaria</a>, managed to destroy a number of British tanks with <a href="panzerfaust">panzerfaust</a>s and the assistance of a tank company. In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a "<a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a>" (battlegroup) commanded by SS-"<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen</a>"-SS (Brigadier) <a href="Heinz%20Harmel">Heinz Harmel</a>, which was ordered to keep the <a href="Karawanks">Karawanks</a> passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The "Kampfgruppe" succeeded in its final task, and was one of the last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British <a href="6th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6th Armoured Division</a> on 9 May 1945.

A joint Italian-German study implicated members of the division in 23 different crimes involving the killing of 277 people in Italy between the Armistice of Cassibile and the end of World War II. The largest of these killings were:


On paper, the division's final order of battle was to consist of:

The division establishment also included supply units. However, only the 59th "Waffen Gebirgsjäger" Regiment, one battalion of the 24th SS Mountain Artillery Regiment, one company of the 24th SS Pioneer Battalion and a half-company of the divisional panzer company were ever established.

According to historian <a href="Gordon%20Williamson%20%28writer%29">Gordon Williamson</a>, three "Waffen"-SS officers commanded the division and subsequently the brigade:

In contrast, Roland Kaltenegger only lists Hahn as commanding the unit.

The unit insignia was a stylised <a href="Tiwaz%20rune">Týr rune</a> with arrows pointing to the left and right. A collar insignia was manufactured, but it is believed that these were never issued or worn, and the members of the division wore the standard SS <a href="Runic%20insignia%20of%20the%20Schutzstaffel">Sig runes</a>.

The Hunger Games (novel)

The Hunger Games is a 2008 <a href="dystopian">dystopian</a> novel by the American writer <a href="Suzanne%20Collins">Suzanne Collins</a>. It is written <a href="First-person%20narrative">in the voice of</a> 16-year-old <a href="Katniss%20Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a>, who lives in the future, <a href="post-apocalyptic">post-apocalyptic</a> nation of <a href="Panem">Panem</a> in North America. <a href="The%20Capitol%20%28Hunger%20Games%29">The Capitol</a>, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised <a href="Battle%20royal">Battle royal</a> to the death.

The book received critical acclaim from major reviewers and authors. It was praised for its plot and character development. In writing "The Hunger Games", Collins drew upon <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Roman <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>ial games, and contemporary <a href="reality%20television">reality television</a> for thematic content. The novel won many awards, including the <a href="California%20Young%20Reader%20Medal">California Young Reader Medal</a>, and was named one of "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>"s "Best Books of the Year" in 2008.

"The Hunger Games" was first published in hardcover on September 14, 2008, by <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic</a>, featuring a cover designed by <a href="Tim%20O%27Brien%20%28illustrator%29">Tim O'Brien</a>. It has since been released in paperback and also as an <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> and <a href="ebook">ebook</a>. After an initial print of 200,000, the book had sold 800,000 copies by February 2010. Since its release, "The Hunger Games" has been translated into 26 languages, and publishing rights have been sold in 38 territories. The novel is the first in <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20trilogy">"The Hunger Games" trilogy</a>, followed by "<a href="Catching%20Fire">Catching Fire</a>" (2009) and "<a href="Mockingjay">Mockingjay</a>" (2010). A <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%29">film adaptation</a>, directed by <a href="Gary%20Ross">Gary Ross</a> and co-written and co-produced by Collins herself, was released in 2012.

Collins has said that the inspiration for "The Hunger Games" came from <a href="channel%20surfing">channel surfing</a> on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a <a href="Reality%20television">reality show</a> and on another she saw footage of the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>. The two "began to blur in this very unsettling way" and the idea for the book was formed. The <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek myth</a> of <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a> served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>ial games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins. Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other "dark passages" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story. She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable.

In the nation of <a href="Panem">Panem</a>, established in the remains of <a href="North%20America">North America</a> after an unknown <a href="apocalypse">apocalyptic</a> event, the wealthy Capitol exploits the twelve surrounding districts for their natural resources and labour. <a href="District%2012%20%28Hunger%20Games%29">District 12</a> is in the <a href="coal">coal</a>-rich region that was once <a href="Appalachia">Appalachia</a>, while the Capitol is in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. As punishment for a past failed <a href="rebellion">rebellion</a> against the Capitol, which resulted in the obliteration of District 13, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the 12 remaining districts are selected by an annual <a href="lottery">lottery</a> to participate in the Hunger Games, a contest in which the "tributes" must fight to the death in an outdoor arena until only one remains.

The story is narrated by 16-year-old <a href="Katniss%20Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a> from District 12, who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her 12-year-old sister, <a href="Primrose%20Everdeen">Primrose</a>. The male tribute is <a href="Peeta%20Mellark">Peeta Mellark</a>, a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving. In the days leading up to the Games in the Capitol, they are given advice by their drunken mentor, <a href="Haymitch%20Abernathy">Haymitch Abernathy</a>, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; chaperone <a href="Effie%20Trinket">Effie Trinket</a>; and various stylists to enhance their public perception to get potential sponsors, who will send potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. Katniss's stylist, <a href="List%20of%20The%20Hunger%20Games%20characters%23Cinna">Cinna</a>, designed special costumes for Katniss and Peeta that set them apart from the tributes when introduced to the public. During their evaluation by the Gamemakers, Katniss unexpectedly gets the highest score among the others. Meanwhile, Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, follows Katniss and Peeta around during the training sessions. On the day before the games, in the televised interview with <a href="Caesar%20Flickerman">Caesar Flickerman</a>, Peeta reveals his long-unrequited love for Katniss; she is initially shocked by this and believes this is a ploy to gain sponsors, but later accepts this as sincere. Haymitch then promotes their image as "<a href="Star-crossed">star-crossed lovers</a>".

The Games begin, and nearly half the tributes are killed in the bloodbath at the start, fighting over the weapons and supplies throughout the arena. Katniss disregards Haymitch's earlier advice to flee immediately and nearly dies, but uses her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to hide in the woods. After a few days, an artificial fire drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the "Careers" tributes and Peeta, who seems to have allied with them. Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, silently alerts Katniss to a “tracker jacker” nest, which she sends it plummeting down, releasing the flying insects. Their venom kills one of the careers and drives the others away, but Katniss is stung and begins hallucinating. Peeta returns, but instead of killing her, tells her to run away. Katniss later forms an alliance with Rue, but Rue is fatally wounded by another tribute while Katniss destroys the careers' supplies. Katniss kills Rue's killer with an arrow, and accompanies Rue as she dies and spreads flowers over the body to show her defiance against the Capitol. In gratitude, Rue's district sends Katniss a loaf of bread.

A rule change is announced, allowing the tributes from the same district to win as a pair. Katniss finds and nurses a wounded Peeta (who later revealed that he formed an alliance with the careers to protect Katniss), acting the part of a girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers send a delivery of what each contestant needs most, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is intercepted by a career tribute Clove, who gloats over Rue's death and tries to kill Katniss, but is killed by Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, who spares Katniss for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life, and they both spend time hunting and collecting food.

Katniss and Peeta become the last two survivors, but the Gamemakers revoke the rule change to force one to kill the other for a dramatic finale. In defiance, Katniss prepares to consume the poisonous "nightlock" berries with Peeta. Realizing they intend to commit suicide so that there will not be a victor for the games, the Gamemakers declare Katniss and Peeta the victors. Although both of them receive a hero's welcome as a couple, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that the Capitol may take action against her for her defiance. Along the way back to District 12, Peeta is heartbroken to learn that Katniss' actions were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy. Katniss, however, is unsure of her own feelings and her future.

In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel "tackles issues like <a href="severe%20poverty">severe poverty</a>, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others." The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate. The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations. On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" writes that the book "is an incisive satire of reality television shows", and that the character of Cinna "almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of "<a href="Project%20Runway">Project Runway</a>", using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas."

The choices the characters make and the strategies they use are often morally complex. The tributes build a personality they want the audience to see throughout the Games. Library journal "<a href="Voice%20of%20Youth%20Advocates">Voice of Youth Advocates</a>" names the major themes of "The Hunger Games" as "government control, '<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%29">big brother</a>', and personal independence." The trilogy's theme of power and downfall, similar to that of Shakespeare's "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>", was pointed out by its publisher <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic</a>. Laura Miller of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" finds the author's stated premise of the Games –an exercise in propaganda and a "humiliating as well as torturous [...] punishment" for a failed uprising against the Capitol many years earlier– to be unconvincing. "You don't demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience." But the story works much better if the theme is vicissitudes of high school and "the adolescent social experience". Miller writes:
"The rules are arbitrary, unfathomable, and subject to sudden change. A brutal social hierarchy prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive you have to be totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some "phase"! Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades, but no one cares who you really are or how you really feel about anything."

Donald Brake from "<a href="The%20Washington%20Times">The Washington Times</a>" and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes, such as that of <a href="self-sacrifice">self-sacrifice</a>, which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a <a href="Substitutionary%20atonement">substitute</a> for the <a href="Atonement%20in%20Christianity">atonement of sins</a>. Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the story also revolves around the theme of <a href="hope">hope</a>, which is exemplified in the "incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose." Simpson also points to events similar to the <a href="Passion%20of%20Jesus">Passion of Jesus</a>; in the Games, "Christ figure" Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life, and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life. Further, she finds that the Christian image of the <a href="Bread%20of%20Life">Bread of Life</a> is used throughout "The Hunger Games"; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread, saving the girl and her family from starvation.

After writing the novel, Collins signed a six-figure deal for three books with Scholastic. First published as a hardcover in the United States on September 14, 2008, "The Hunger Games" had a first printing of 50,000 copies, which was bumped up twice to 200,000 copies. By February 2010, the book had sold 800,000 copies, and rights to the novel had been sold in 38 territories worldwide. A few months later, in July, the book was released in paperback. "The Hunger Games" entered the <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" Best Seller list</a> in November 2008, where it would feature for over 100 consecutive weeks. By the time the <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%29">film adaptation</a> of "The Hunger Games" was released in March 2012, the book had been on "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s best-sellers list for 135 consecutive weeks and has sold over 17.5 million copies.

The novel is the first in <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20trilogy">"The Hunger Games" trilogy</a>; it is followed by sequels "<a href="Catching%20Fire">Catching Fire</a>" (2009) and "<a href="Mockingjay">Mockingjay</a>" (2010). In March 2012, during the time of "The Hunger Games" film's release, Scholastic reported 26 million "Hunger Games" trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books. "The Hunger Games" (and its sequels) have sold exceptionally well in <a href="ebook">ebook</a> format. Suzanne Collins is the first children's or young adult author to sell over one million <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> ebooks, making her the sixth author to join the "Kindle Million Club". In March 2012, <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a> announced that Collins had become the best-selling Kindle ebook author of all time.

An <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> version of "The Hunger Games" was released in December 2008. Read by the actress <a href="Carolyn%20McCormick">Carolyn McCormick</a>, it has a total running time of eleven hours and fourteen minutes. The magazine "<a href="AudioFile%20%28magazine%29">AudioFile</a>" said: "Carolyn McCormick gives a detailed and attentive narration. However, she may rely too much on the strength of the prose without providing the drama young adult listeners often enjoy." "School Library Journal" also praised the audiobook, stating that "McCormick ably voices the action-packed sequences and Katniss's every fear and strength shines through, along with her doomed growing attraction to one of her fellow Tributes."

The <a href="Tim%20O%27Brien%20%28illustrator%29">Tim O'Brien</a>-designed cover features a gold "<a href="Mockingjays">mockingjay</a>" – a fictional bird in "The Hunger Games" born by crossbreeding female mockingbirds and genetically engineered male "<a href="jabberjays">jabberjays</a>" – with an arrow engraved in a circle. This is a depiction of the pin worn by Katniss into the arena, given to her by the District 12 mayor's daughter, <a href="List%20of%20characters%20in%20the%20Hunger%20Games%20trilogy%23In%20District%2012">Madge Undersee</a>. The image matches the description of the pin that is given in the novel, except for the arrow: "It's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips."

"The Hunger Games" has received critical acclaim. In a review for "The New York Times", <a href="John%20Green%20%28author%29">John Green</a> wrote that the novel was "brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced", and that "the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine." However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the <a href="Allegory">allegorical</a> potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing "described the action and little else." "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's review was also positive, stating that it "is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book" and praising what it called the "hypnotic" quality of the violence. In <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s review for "Entertainment Weekly", he compared it to "shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway." However, he stated that there were "displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults" and that the <a href="love%20triangle">love triangle</a> was standard for the genre. He gave the book a B grade. Elizabeth Bird of "<a href="School%20Library%20Journal">School Library Journal</a>" praised the novel, saying it is "exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns", and called it one of the best books of 2008. "<a href="Booklist">Booklist</a>" also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. "<a href="Kirkus%20Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>" gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that "poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers–a crying shame". <a href="Rick%20Riordan">Rick Riordan</a>, author of the "<a href="Percy%20Jackson%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Olympians">Percy Jackson & the Olympians</a>" series, claims it is the "closest thing to a perfect adventure novel" he has ever read. <a href="Stephenie%20Meyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> (author of the <a href="Twilight%20%28novel%20series%29">"Twilight" series</a>) endorsed the book on her website, saying, "I was so obsessed with this book ...
"The Hunger Games" is amazing."

"The Hunger Games" received many awards and honors. It was named one of "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" "Best Books of the Year" in 2008 and a "The New York Times" "Notable Children's Book of 2008". It was the 2009 winner of the <a href="Golden%20Duck%20Award">Golden Duck Award</a> in the Young Adult Fiction Category. "The Hunger Games" was also a "2008 Cybil Winner" for fantasy and science-fiction books along with "<a href="The%20Graveyard%20Book">The Graveyard Book</a>", one of "School Library Journal"s "Best Books 2008", and a "Booklist Editors' Choice" in 2008. In 2011, the book won the <a href="California%20Young%20Reader%20Medal">California Young Reader Medal</a>. In the 2012 edition of Scholastic's "Parent and Child" magazine, "The Hunger Games" was listed as the 33rd-best book for children, with the award for "Most Exciting Ending". The novel is one of the top 5 best selling <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">Kindle</a> books of all time. However, the novel has also been controversial with parents; it ranked in fifth place on the <a href="American%20Library%20Association">American Library Association</a>'s list of frequently <a href="challenge%20%28literature%29">challenged</a> books for 2010, with "unsuited to age group" and "violence" being among the reasons cited.

Similarities of "The Hunger Games" to <a href="Koushun%20Takami">Koushun Takami</a>'s 1999 novel "<a href="Battle%20Royale%20%28novel%29">Battle Royale</a>" have been noted. Collins stated that she "had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." Susan Dominus of "The New York Times" reports that "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" of "Battle Royale" but argued that "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> noted that the reality TV "badlands" were similar to "Battle Royale", as well as his own novels "<a href="The%20Running%20Man%20%28novel%29">The Running Man</a>" and "<a href="The%20Long%20Walk">The Long Walk</a>". The story has also been compared to the 1965 Italian cult film "<a href="The%2010th%20Victim">The 10th Victim</a>" by <a href="Elio%20Petri">Elio Petri</a>, based on <a href="Robert%20Sheckley">Robert Sheckley</a>'s 1953 short story "<a href="Seventh%20Victim">Seventh Victim</a>".

In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement for "The Hunger Games" with <a href="Nina%20Jacobson">Nina Jacobson</a>'s production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier. The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000 – one of its largest ever – for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that "they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us" to help secure the franchise. Intending the film to have a <a href="PG-Rating">PG-13</a> rating, Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he "felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective" in its presentation of events, echoing Collins' use of <a href="first%20person%20narrative">first person</a> <a href="present%20tense">present</a> in the novel.

Twenty-year-old actress <a href="Jennifer%20Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> was chosen to play Katniss Everdeen. Though Lawrence was four years older than the character when filming began, Collins felt the role demanded "a certain maturity and power" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. She added that Lawrence was the "only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book" and that she had "every essential quality necessary to play Katniss." Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production. <a href="Josh%20Hutcherson">Josh Hutcherson</a> and <a href="Liam%20Hemsworth">Liam Hemsworth</a> were later added to the cast, in the roles of Peeta and Gale, respectively. Production began in late spring 2011 and the film was released on March 23, 2012. The film's opening weekend brought in a non-sequel record $152.5 million (USD) in North America. "", based on the second novel in the series, was released the following year on November 22, 2013.

Albatrellus subrubescens

Albatrellus subrubescens is a species of <a href="polypore">polypore</a> <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Albatrellaceae">Albatrellaceae</a>. The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> (<a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s) of the fungus have whitish to pale <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a>-colored <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> that can reach up to in diameter, and <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> up to long and thick. On the underside of the caps are tiny light yellow to pale greenish-yellow pores, the site of <a href="spore">spore</a> production. When the fruit bodies are fresh, the cap and pores stain yellow where exposed, handled, or bruised.

The species is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows on the ground in <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous</a> or <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed woods</a>, usually in association with <a href="pine">pine</a> trees. It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common "<a href="Albatrellus%20ovinus">Albatrellus ovinus</a>", from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised, and microscopically by the <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a> (<a href="staining">staining</a> bluish-black to black with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of "A. subrubescens" contain scutigeral, a <a href="biological%20activity">bioactive</a> chemical that has <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> activity. "A. subrubescens" mushrooms are mildly <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a>, and consuming them will result in a short-term <a href="gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal illness</a>.

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> as "Scutiger subrubescens" by American <a href="mycology">mycologist</a> <a href="William%20Murrill">William Murrill</a> in 1940, based on collections that he found growing under <a href="oak">oak</a> near <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville, Florida</a>, in November 1938. In 1947 he transferred it to the genus "<a href="Polyporus">Polyporus</a>". <a href="Josiah%20Lincoln%20Lowe">Josiah Lincoln Lowe</a> examined Murrill's <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> material and thought that it did not differ from "<a href="Albatrellus%20confluens">Albatrellus confluens</a>". In 1965, <a href="Zden%C4%9Bk%20Pouzar">Zdeněk Pouzar</a> made collections from <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> (now the Czech Republic), and described it as a new species ("Albatrellus similis"), unaware of the similarity to Murrill's Florida specimens. Further study revealed that "A. similis" was identical to Murrill's "Scutiger subrubescens", and Pouzar transferred the latter <a href="botanical%20name">epithet</a> to "<a href="Albatrellus">Albatrellus</a>". In 1974, Pouzar recognized that Lowe's species "Albatrellus confluens" was distinct from "A. subrubescens". The specific epithet "subrubescens", "tinted reddish", is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "sub" ("less than") and "rubescens" ("growing red").

Four "Albatrellus" species were included in a large-scale <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis of the order <a href="Russulales">Russulales</a> published in 2003. Based on their <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> sequences, the four form a <a href="clade">clade</a>, or <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group (that is, they derived from a single ancestor). Of the four tested species, "A. ovinus" was most closely related to "A. subrubescens". The polypore "<a href="Wrightoporia%20lenta">Wrightoporia lenta</a>" (<a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Wrightoporia">Wrightoporia</a>") occurred on a single branch <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> to the albatrellus clade, implying that it shared with the "Albatrellus" species a <a href="Common%20descent">common ancestor</a> from which both were descended. In a more recent (2010) <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge Audet aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in "<a href="Scutiger%20%28fungus%29">Scutiger</a>", "A. subrubescens" grouped in a clade with "A. ovinus" and "A. citrinus". According to Audet, these species, in addition to "<a href="Albatrellus%20avellaneus">A. avellaneus</a>" and "<a href="Albatrellus%20piceiphilus">A. piceiphilus</a>", are the constituents of an "Albatrellus" with limits defined by molecular genetics. Other "Albatrellus" species were transferred to segregate genera: "<a href="Albatrellopsis%20flettii">A. fletti</a>" and "A. confluens" to "<a href="Albatrellopsis">Albatrellopsis</a>"; "<a href="Neoalbatrellus%20caeruleoporus">A. caeruleoporus</a>" and "<a href="Neoalbatrellus%20yasudae">A. yasudae</a>" to "<a href="Neoalbatrellus">Neoalbatrellus</a>"; "<a href="Scutiger%20pes-caprae">A. pes-caprae</a>" and "<a href="Scutiger%20ellisii">A. ellisii</a>" to an amended "Scutiger".

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of "A. subrubescens" is between in diameter, with a central, eccentric (away from the center), or rarely lateral (attached to the edge of cap) stem. Initially, the cap is convex with an <a href="wikt%3Ainvolute">involute</a> margin, flattening out with age. The cap margin may be folded or flat. The cap surface in young specimens is smooth but soon forms <a href="wikt%3Aappressed">appressed</a> scale-like spots, which may transform into scales in age. Initially, the cap has white margins and a brownish-violet center with scale-like spots; the center later becomes orange-brownish or <a href="Ochre">ochraceous</a> brown. According to Canadian mycologist James Ginns, who described North American "Albatrellus" species in 1997, some North American specimens may be covered with blackish-gray to purple-gray fibrils, but this characteristic is not seen in European collections. The cap discolors yellowish when bruised.

The stem is long and thick, cylindrical, irregular, and its base may be somewhat pointed, or bulbous. Initially white, the stem develops orange/violet spots and later brownish orange spots; in old specimens the stem may be brownish brick red. The tubes on the pore surface (underside of the cap) are about 2.5–3 mm long and <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> in attachment. The pores are small, measuring about 2–3 per millimeter. They are initially greenish-white, but later turn dark brown; dried specimens can have pores that are tinted green. Fruit bodies have a "faintly fragrant, pleasant" odor; in his original report on the species, Murrill noted that specimens left to dry in an oven developed a strong odor of burnt sugar. The taste of the mushroom has been described variously as indistinct, or "distinctly bitter". The type material was noted by Murrill to taste bitter, an observation later corroborated by Pouzar with European collections. "A. subrubescens" mushrooms are mildly <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">toxic</a>: consumption causes a <a href="gastroenteritis">gastrointestinal illness</a> that usually subsides one to four hours after ingestion.

In <a href="spore%20print">deposit</a>, the spores are white. The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are 3.4–4.7 by 2.2–3.4 <a href="micrometer%20%28unit%29">µm</a>, <a href="wikt%3Aellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> to <a href="wikt%3Aovoid">ovoid</a> in shape, and <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a> (absorbing <a href="iodine">iodine</a> when <a href="staining">stained</a> with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>). Most have a single large oil drop. The spore-bearing cells (the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>) are club-shaped, 12–16 µm long by 5.7–7.7 µm thick, and have four thin, slightly curved <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> that are 3.4–4.3 µm long. The hymenium lacks any <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a>. The hyphal system is monomitic, meaning that the <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">context</a> is made of thin-walled generative <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e. These hyphae have lengths in the range of 3.5–30 µm (most commonly 6–17 µm), with thin walls (up to 1 µm thick), and are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent). Although they are inamyloid, some hyphae have internal masses that are colored pale bluish-gray to black, which makes them appear collectively grayish-black under the <a href="light%20microscope">microscope</a>. Gloeoporous hyphae (wide and thin-walled with <a href="refraction">refractive</a> contents) are also scattered throughout the context, as well as some hyphae with expanded tips that are thick-walled and amyloid.

In general, "A. subrubescens" can be distinguished from other "Albatrellus" species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under <a href="pine">pine</a>s. In the field, "Albatrellus ovinus" is difficult to differentiate from "A. subrubescens" due to its similar appearance. "A. ovinus" usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of "A. subrubescens". Microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of "A. subrubescens" are amyloid, in contrast to those of "A. ovinus", and "A. ovinus" spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5 µm. Other similar species include "A. tianschanicus", described from the <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a> in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species "<a href="Albatrellus%20cantharellus">A. cantharellus</a>". Unlike "A. subrubescens", these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of "A. subrubescens" are not much darker than the area between the scales. Both of these Asian species have larger spores than "A. subrubescens": those of "A. cantharellus" are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5 µm, while those of "A. tianschanicus" are 5–7 by 4–5 µm.

"Albatrellopsis confluens" has caps that are pinkish-<a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> to pale orange, and white flesh that dries to a pinkish-buff; it has a taste that is bitter, or like cabbage. The spores of "A. confluens" are weakly amyloid. Additional differences distinguishing "Albatrellopsis confluens" from "A. subrubescens" include the presence of <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s in the context hyphae, and <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> on the base of the stem. The European fungus "A. citrinus", originally considered a <a href="morphotype">morphotype</a> of "A. subrubescens", was described as a new species in 2003. It is distinguished from "A. subrubescens" morphologically by its smaller caps (up to in diameter), the yellowish bruising of the caps with age or after handling, and the absence of violet spots on the cap. "A. citrinus" associates with <a href="spruce">spruce</a> rather than pine, and requires <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> (lime-rich) soil.

Fruit bodies of "A. subrubescens" are usually solitary, but sometimes several (typically between two and eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or on the sides of their caps. A strictly <a href="Terrestrial%20plant">terrestrial</a> species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with <a href="Abies%20alba">silver fir</a> in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine. It is suspected that "A. subrubescens" may be <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a>, wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in <a href="California">California</a> containing mostly <a href="knobcone%20pine">knobcone pine</a> (a three-needle pine), <a href="manzanita">manzanita</a>, <a href="huckleberry">huckleberry</a> and a few mandrones.

The species has been reported from a variety of locations in <a href="temperate">temperate</a> regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. In North America, its distribution includes <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, and the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a> in Canada. In the United States, it is found in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, California, Florida, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a>, and <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. The North American distribution extends south to Mexico, in <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>. In Asia, the fungus has been recorded from <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> in southwest China, and <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>. In Europe, collections have been reported from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and the Ukraine.

"Albatrellus subrubescens" contains the <a href="Bioactive%20compound">bioactive</a> compound scutigeral, which has <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> activity. This chemical—also found in the related species "A. ovinus"—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's <a href="intestinal%20flora">intestinal flora</a>. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the <a href="Dopamine%20receptor%20D1">dopamine receptor D subfamily</a> (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating <a href="neuron">neuron</a>al growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has <a href="agonist">agonist</a>ic activity at <a href="vanilloid%20receptor">vanilloid receptor</a>s (a <a href="receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptor</a> found on <a href="sensory%20nerve">sensory nerve</a>s in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of <a href="calcium">calcium</a> in the neurons of rat <a href="dorsal%20root%20ganglia">dorsal root ganglia</a>. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity.

1924 Rose Bowl

The 1924 Rose Bowl was a postseason American <a href="college%20football">college football</a> <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> played between the <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools">independent</a> <a href="Navy%20Midshipmen%20football">Navy Midshipmen</a> and the <a href="1923%20Washington%20Huskies%20football%20team">Washington Huskies</a>, a member of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Conference">Pacific Coast Conference</a> (PCC). The game took place on January 1, 1924, at the <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20%28stadium%29">Rose Bowl</a> stadium in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>, closing the <a href="1923%20college%20football%20season">1923 college football season</a>. The game opened in front of approximately 40,000 people and ended in a 1414 tie. It was the first post-season bowl game for both teams. The 1924 game was the tenth edition of the <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20Game">Rose Bowl</a>, which had first been played in 1902. Following the <a href="1902%20Rose%20Bowl">inaugural game's</a> <a href="Blowout%20%28sports%29">blowout</a> score, football was replaced with chariot races until 1916. The Rose Bowl stadium had been constructed in 1923, making this edition the second game played in the arena.

The game's organizers had previously selected a team from the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> and the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>, and asked the Washington Huskies to represent the West Coast. Washington requested that the Navy Midshipmen be their opponents, and Navy accepted. Washington selected Navy in favor of several teams from the east which had amassed better records. Both teams had suffered only a single loss during the season, but Washington had won eight games compared with Navy's five, although Navy had also amassed two ties. Predictions gave Washington a slight advantage in the game due to the weight difference between the teams: the Washington players were on average heavier than those of Navy.

The game kicked off in the afternoon; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before, causing a slight delay. The first quarter was scoreless, but Navy scored a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> on the first play of the second quarter. Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive. Near the end of the second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run, giving them a 147 halftime lead. The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored. Navy <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter. Four plays afterward, Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Navy threw an <a href="interception">interception</a> at midfield, and Washington drove down to the Navy 20-yard line before attempting a game-winning <a href="Field%20goal%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%20football%29">field goal</a>. The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards.

For his performance in the game, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was named the <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a>. Navy led in nearly every statistical aspect of the contest. Washington returned to the Rose Bowl at the end of the 1925 season, falling to the <a href="1925%20Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football%20team">Alabama Crimson Tide</a> 2019. Navy did not participate in another bowl game until 1955, when their squad, nicknamed the "team named desire", upset the <a href="Ole%20Miss%20Rebels%20football">Ole Miss Rebels</a> in the <a href="1955%20Sugar%20Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a>. Since the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy and Washington have met five more times; the Huskies won three of the games.

The Rose Bowl game was first played <a href="1902%20Rose%20Bowl">in 1902</a>, as a way to help fund the <a href="Rose%20Parade">Rose Parade</a>. Because of the first contest's lopsided score, a football game was not played again until 1916, having been replaced by chariot races. Between 1902 and 1947, the Rose Bowl was played between a team from the East Coast and a team from the West Coast. Until the construction of the Rose Bowl stadium, which began hosting the game in 1923, it was called the "Tournament East–West football game". Because the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) was the only conference with teams located in the Western United States, a school from the conference had been chosen for every Rose Bowl game. The tournament committee invited the University of Washington Huskies to participate in the 1924 game, and they accepted. Washington was then allowed by the organization to select its opponent for the gamethe first time a team was allowed to do so. Washington chose the Navy Midshipmen based on a suggestion from the committee, and Navy accepted the invitation.

The Navy Midshipmen entered the Rose Bowl under coach <a href="Bob%20Folwell">Bob Folwell</a> with five wins, one loss, and two ties (512). Navy's sole loss in the 1923 season came in their annual game against <a href="Penn%20State%20Nittany%20Lions%20football">Penn State</a>, which they lost 213. All five of Navy's wins came against eastern teams, including <a href="Colgate%20Raiders%20football">Colgate</a> and <a href="William%20and%20Mary%20Tribe%20football">William and Mary</a>, and two of Navy's wins were <a href="shutout">shutout</a>s, against Colgate and <a href="Saint%20Xavier%20University%23Athletics">Saint Xavier</a>. Navy tied 00 with Army in the 1923 <a href="Army%E2%80%93Navy%20Game">Army–Navy Game</a>, the last game of the season, played on November 23 in front of nearly 70,000 spectatorsincluding high-ranking military officials. Their other tie was a 33 game against <a href="Princeton%20Tigers%20football">Princeton</a>. Navy was selected by Washington to participate in the Rose Bowl, although several teams with better records were eligible. Both <a href="Cornell%20Big%20Red%20football">Cornell</a> and <a href="Yale%20Bulldogs%20football">Yale</a> finished the season with an undefeated 80 record. Eleven teams finished with only one loss, including <a href="Furman%20Paladins%20football">Furman</a> (101), <a href="Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football">Notre Dame</a> (91), and the <a href="VMI%20Keydets%20football">Virginia Military Institute (VMI)</a> (91).

The Washington Huskies entered the 1924 Rose Bowl with a record of eight wins and one loss (81) under coach <a href="Enoch%20Bagshaw">Enoch Bagshaw</a>. Washington opened their season with victories over teams from the <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and ; because these teams did not represent colleges, they were not considered an official part of Washington's schedule. Washington's first official game ended with a 340 shutout of <a href="Willamette%20University">Willamette</a>, which was followed by four more shutouts. Washington's next game was a 2614 victory over PCC opponent <a href="Montana%20Grizzlies%20football">Montana</a>the first points Washington allowed all season. The squad's following game was their sole loss: a 90 shutout by conference opponent <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears%20football">California</a>. Washington finished the regular season with two straight wins over conference opponents, including a victory in the <a href="Apple%20Cup">Apple Cup</a> over <a href="Washington%20State%20Cougars%20football">Washington State</a>.

The 1924 Rose Bowl was the first meeting between Navy and Washington, and was the first bowl game that either team participated in. The competitors were announced on November 30, 1923, and the teams arrived for the bowl in mid-December, holding practices until the evening before the game. Heavy rain fell the night before the competition; Bagshaw said, "Wet weather will not bother us", and Folwell said, "My men will know what to do in the mud and will be there doing it". However, because of the wet conditions, several football critics predicted that Washington would have a slight advantage in the game due to their larger size. It was estimated that 52,000 people would attend the game. For the first time, the participating teams were responsible for ticket sales, and as a result only 40,000 people actually attended; a large number of tickets were sold to a navy fleet which was called to service on December 31, the day before the game. The competition was the first Rose Bowl to be broadcast on radio, and was aired by a local Pasadena station.

During the 1923 football season, the Navy Midshipmen outscored their opponents 13343, led by <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> Ira McKee, who threw several touchdown passes throughout the year. Navy's other offensive strong point was <a href="running%20back">running back</a> Carl Cullen, who ran for several hundred yards during the season. The Navy <a href="American%20football%20positions%23Defense">defense</a> was considered weak by football critics, with an average player weight less than that of Washington. Navy's defense had stopped running plays successfully during the regular season, but had trouble defending pass plays. Navy's <a href="American%20football%20positions%23Special%20teams">special teams</a> were considered by critics to be decent, about even with those of Washington.

The Washington Huskies had outscored their opponents 20337 during the regular season, excluding the games against "New York" and "Mississippi". Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred <a href="Rush%20%28gridiron%20football%29">rushing</a> yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from <a href="boil">boil</a>s on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams <a href="Shutout">scoreless</a> and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams were considered to be average.

The <a href="Kickoff%20%28gridiron%20football%29">kickoff</a> for the Rose Bowl was originally scheduled for on January 1, 1924, but the night before the game, a meeting of the Rose Bowl organization rescheduled the kickoff time to the same day. This was likely due to poor field conditions caused by the previous night's rain. The opening ceremonies were the most elaborate of any bowl game up to that time, with numerous events held. Navy admiral <a href="Samuel%20Robison">Samuel Shelburne Robison</a> received an admiral's salute from <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy%20Band">Navy's band</a> when he took his seat. The Navy band and the color guard of the marines performed the <a href="National%20anthem%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Anthem</a>, then the marine <a href="color%20guard">color guard</a> hoisted the U.S. flag over the field. Both teams' <a href="mascot">mascot</a>s were walked around the field before the kickoff. The Tournament of Roses predicted that tickets would be sold out by the day of the game, but actual ticket sales were much lower than they had hoped. Still, sales were higher than those of several previous competitions.

The game began at the rescheduled time, with a temperature of and the field still wet. Because of the playing conditions, running plays were ineffective, which caused problems for the Washington offense. Navy instead used <a href="Forward%20pass">passing plays</a>, which the Washington defense had trouble stopping. Navy was <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23drive">driving</a> down to the 22-yard line of Washington when the first quarter ended. Navy controlled the first quarter, completing all six passing attempts and holding the Washington offense to under 100 yards gained.

On their first <a href="Play%20from%20scrimmage">play</a> of the second quarter, Navy scored a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> on a pass play from Ira McKee to Carl Cullen. McKee kicked the <a href="Conversion%20%28gridiron%20football%29">extra point</a> for Navy, giving them a 7–0 lead. In an attempt to trick Washington, Navy tried an <a href="onside%20kick">onside kick</a> on the next play, but Washington recovered the ball. After two short running plays, Washington quarterback <a href="Fred%20Abel">Fred Abel</a> completed a 23-yard pass to running back Kinsley Dubois, bringing Washington inside the 25-yard line. On the next play, running back George Wilson ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Washington's kicker converted the extra point to tie the game at 7–7. After several drives from each team that did not result in further scoring, Navy completed a 57-yard pass down to the Washington eight-yard line. Two plays later, Ira McKee ran the ball in from two yards out for a touchdown, then afterward converted the extra point. The first half ended with Navy leading by 147, having completed all 11 passes they attempted.

Both teams' defenses controlled the third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first <a href="Incomplete%20pass">incompletion</a>, which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little success in the third quarter, being held to only a few yards gained and <a href="Turnover%20%28gridiron%20football%29">turning the ball over</a> once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a> formation, and the <a href="Center%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%20football%29">center</a> <a href="Snap%20%28gridiron%20football%29">snapped</a> the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a <a href="fourth%20down">fourth down</a> from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their <a href="Guard%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%20football%29">left guard</a>, James Bryan, to become an <a href="eligible%20receiver">eligible receiver</a>. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a> for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.

Navy received the ball from Washington and began to throw it erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an <a href="interception">interception</a> near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30 yards. Washington brought out their <a href="placekicker">placekicker</a>, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%20football%29">field goal</a>, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.

For his performance in the 1924 Rose Bowl, Navy quarterback Ira McKee was awarded Most Valuable Player (MVP) honors. McKee completed 16 of 20 passes for a total of 175 yards, including one pass for a touchdown. McKee also had 85 rushing yards on twelve attempts. Washington running back Elmer Tesreau was given the game's Ironman Award, though he had little effect on the game. Against the urging of his coaches, Tesreau had played with boils completely covering one knee. He left near the end of the game, and was later discovered to have broken his previously unaffected leg in multiple places.

Navy's McKee threw for a perfect 11 of 11 passes during the first half, but completed just five of nine attempts during the second half. Two of these incompletions were interceptions. McKee outthrew Washington's Fred Abel by 110 yards. Carl Cullen was McKee's main receiver for the game, catching ten passes from him, one of which was taken for a touchdown. The other six passes were caught by other receivers. On the ground, Cullen rushed for the most <a href="yards">yards</a> of any player, gaining 102 throughout the course of the game. McKee was Navy's key runner, gaining 85 yards. Cullen, McKee, fullback Alan Shapley, and other team members rushed for a total of 187 yards during the game. McKee completed both extra point attempts, and the squad's punter kicked five times, for an average distance of 33.8 yards.

Abel attempted eight passes during the game, and completed just three for a total of 65 yards. Of Abel's five incompletions, two were interceptions. Kinsley Dubois caught two of Abel's completed passes, amassing 53 receiving yards. Guard James Bryan caught the other, a 12-yard touchdown pass. George Wilson led Washington in rushing yards, gaining 87 over the course of the game, and scoring Washington's only rushing touchdown. Kinsley Dubois came next, gaining 30 yards, followed by Abel, with 20. The remainder of the team's 137 rushing yards were amassed by others, including Tesreau. Washington's kicker Leonard Zeil was two for two on extra points, but missed his only field goal attempt. Washington punted nine times, averaging 33 yards per attempt.

The tie gave Washington an 811 record for the 1923 season, the second best in school history up to that point. It remained behind the 1916 season, when the squad went 601. Navy's record went to 513, a slight improvement from the previous year, when the team went 52. It became Navy's eighth straight winning season.

Washington went 811 in the 1924 season, remaining under the direction of coach Enoch Bagshaw. The team was invited to the <a href="1926%20Rose%20Bowl">1926 Rose Bowl</a> after completing an undefeated 1101 1925 season. They lost the game to the <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football">Alabama Crimson Tide</a> by a score of 2019. Washington finished the 1920s with an overall record of 65266; Bagshaw coached the team for every season except 1920, when they were under the leadership of <a href="Stub%20Allison">Stub Allison</a>. Navy finished the 1924 season with a 26 record, ending their number of consecutive winning seasons at eight. The Navy football team was not invited to participate in another bowl game until 1955, when the "team named desire", so named due to coach <a href="Eddie%20Erdelatz">Eddie Erdelatz</a> comparing the squad to the play <a href="A%20Streetcar%20Named%20Desire%20%28play%29">"A Streetcar Named Desire"</a>, defeated the <a href="Ole%20Miss%20Rebels%20football">Ole Miss Rebels</a> in the <a href="1955%20Sugar%20Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a> 210. Navy finished the 1920s with a record of 55228; nine of the ten seasons ended in winning records. Navy's coach, Bob Folwell, left the team after the 1924 season, to be replaced by <a href="Jack%20Owsley">Jack Owsley</a>. Navy and Washington have since met five times, with Washington currently leading the series 321.

Because the 1924 Rose Bowl and several later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the southern end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.

Project E

Project E was a joint project between the United States and the United Kingdom during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> to provide <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) until sufficient British nuclear weapons became available. It was subsequently expanded to provide similar arrangements for the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a>. A maritime version of Project E known as Project N provided <a href="nuclear%20depth%20bomb">nuclear depth bomb</a>s used by the RAF <a href="Coastal%20Command">Coastal Command</a>.

The British nuclear weapons project, <a href="High%20Explosive%20Research">High Explosive Research</a>, successfully tested a nuclear weapon in <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">Operation Hurricane</a> in October 1952, but production was slow and Britain had only ten atomic bombs on hand in 1955 and fourteen in 1956. The <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, approached the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, with a request that the US supply nuclear weapons for the <a href="strategic%20bombers">strategic bombers</a> of the <a href="V-bomber">V-bomber</a> fleet until sufficient British weapons became available. This became known as Project E. Under an agreement reached in 1957, US personnel had custody of the weapons, and performed all tasks related to their storage, maintenance and readiness. The bombs were held in secure storage areas (SSAs) on the same bases as the bombers.

The first bombers equipped with Project E weapons were <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a>s based in Germany and the UK that were assigned to <a href="NATO">NATO</a>. These were replaced by <a href="Vickers%20Valiant">Vickers Valiant</a>s in 1960 and 1961 as the long-range <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> and <a href="Handley%20Page%20Victor">Handley Page Victor</a> assumed the <a href="strategic%20nuclear%20weapon">strategic nuclear weapon</a> delivery role. Project E weapons equipped V-bombers at three bases in the UK from 1958. Due to operational restrictions imposed by Project E, and the consequential loss of independence of half of the British nuclear deterrent, they were phased out in 1962 when sufficient British <a href="TNT%20equivalent">megaton</a> weapons became available, but remained in use with the Valiants in the UK and <a href="RAF%20Germany">RAF Germany</a> until 1965.

Project E nuclear warheads were used on the sixty <a href="PGM-17%20Thor">Thor</a> <a href="Intermediate%20Range%20Ballistic%20Missile">Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile</a>s operated by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under <a href="Project%20Emily">Project Emily</a>. The British Army acquired Project E warheads for its <a href="MGM-5%20Corporal">Corporal missiles</a> in 1958. The US subsequently offered the <a href="Honest%20John%20missile">Honest John missile</a> as a replacement. They remained in service until 1977 when Honest John was in turn superseded by the <a href="MGM-52%20Lance">Lance missile</a>. Eight-inch and 155 mm nuclear artillery rounds were also acquired under Project E. The last Project E weapons were withdrawn from service in 1992.

During the early part of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Britain had a <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> project codenamed <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a>. At the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a> in August 1943, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, and the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a>, signed the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a>, which merged Tube Alloys with the American <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> to create a combined British, American and Canadian project. The September 1944 Hyde Park Aide-Mémoire extended commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period. Many of Britain's top scientists <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project">participated in the Manhattan Project</a>. The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July 1945, Field Marshal Sir <a href="Henry%20Maitland%20Wilson">Henry Maitland Wilson</a> agreed on Britain's behalf to the <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">use of nuclear weapons against Japan</a>.

The British government considered nuclear technology to be a joint discovery, and trusted that America would continue to share it. On 16 November 1945, President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> and Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> signed a new agreement that replaced the Quebec Agreement's requirement for "mutual consent" before using nuclear weapons with one for "prior consultation", and there was to be "full and effective cooperation in the field of atomic energy", but this was only "in the field of basic scientific research". The <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">United States Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a> (McMahon Act) ended technical cooperation. Its control of "restricted data" prevented US allies from receiving any information. Fearing a resurgence of <a href="United%20States%20non-interventionism">American isolationism</a>, and Britain losing its <a href="great%20power">great power</a> status, the UK government restarted its own development effort, now codenamed <a href="High%20Explosive%20Research">High Explosive Research</a>.

In 1949, the Americans offered to make atomic bombs in the US available for Britain to use if the British agreed to curtail their atomic bomb programme. This would have given Britain nuclear weapons much sooner than its own target date of late 1952. Only those bomb components required by war plans would be stored in the UK; the rest would be kept in the US and Canada. The offer was rejected by the <a href="British%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">British Chiefs of Staff</a> on the grounds that it was not "compatible with our status as a first class power to depend on others for weapons of this supreme importance". As a counter-offer, they proposed limiting the British nuclear weapons programme in return for American bombs. The opposition of key American officials, including the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United States Atomic Energy Commission</a>'s <a href="Lewis%20Strauss">Lewis Strauss</a>, and Senators <a href="Bourke%20B.%20Hickenlooper">Bourke B. Hickenlooper</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Vandenberg">Arthur Vandenberg</a>, coupled with security concerns aroused by the 2 February 1950 arrest of the British physicist <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a> as an <a href="atomic%20spy">atomic spy</a>, resulted in the proposal being dropped.

The first British atomic bomb was successfully tested in <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">Operation Hurricane</a>; it was detonated on board the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> anchored off the <a href="Monte%20Bello%20Islands">Monte Bello Islands</a> in Australia on 3 October 1952. The first <a href="Blue%20Danube%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Blue Danube</a> atomic bombs were delivered to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) <a href="Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> Armaments School at <a href="RAF%20Wittering">RAF Wittering</a> on 7 and 11 November 1953, but the RAF had no bombers capable of carrying them. The high priority accorded to the atomic bomb programme was not shared by the <a href="V-bomber">V-bomber</a> programme. The first production order for 25 <a href="Vickers%20Valiant">Vickers Valiant</a>s was issued on 9 February 1951, and they were not delivered until 8 February 1955.
Once V-bomber production ramped up, their numbers soon exceeded that of the available atomic bombs. Production of atomic bombs was slow, and Britain had only ten on hand in 1955, and fourteen in 1956. At this rate, there would not be sufficient bombs to equip all the V-bombers until 1961. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> in December 1953, Churchill suggested that the US allow Britain access to American nuclear weapons to make up the shortfall. There were several technical and legal issues. For American bombs to be carried in British aircraft, the US would have to disclose weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act. There would also be issues of custody, security and targeting.

In May 1954, the <a href="Vice%20Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force</a> (USAF), <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Thomas%20D.%20White">Thomas D. White</a>, approached the head of the <a href="British%20Joint%20Staff%20Mission">British Joint Staff Mission</a> (BJSM) in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> Sir <a href="John%20Whiteley%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Whiteley</a>, with an offer to provide the RAF with an interim force of up to 90 new <a href="Boeing%20B-47%20Stratojet">Boeing B-47 Stratojet</a> bombers. This represented about $400 million in equipment that would not be counted against the <a href="Mutual%20Defense%20Assistance%20Program">Mutual Defense Assistance Program</a>. The RAF was wary. The B-47 was judged inferior to the <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> although it had greater range and could carry a larger bomb load. It would require runways, and the RAF had had a bad experience with the last American-built bomber it operated, the <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing Washington</a>. Above all, there was the potential loss of prestige and independence. The head of RAF Bomber Command, Sir <a href="Hugh%20Pughe%20Lloyd">Hugh Lloyd</a>, favoured acceptance, but the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Air">Secretary of State for Air</a>, <a href="William%20Sidney%2C%201st%20Viscount%20De%20L%27Isle">Lord de L'Isle and Dudley</a>, and the <a href="Minister%20of%20Supply">Minister of Supply</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, advised Churchill against it. In June, the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Sir <a href="William%20Dickson%20%28RAF%20officer%29">William Dickson</a>, informed the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force</a>, General <a href="Nathan%20Twining">Nathan Twining</a>, that the RAF was declining the offer.

In the lead-up to Churchill's next meeting with Eisenhower in June 1954, the President's assistant for atomic energy, <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Howard%20G.%20Bunker">Howard G. Bunker</a>, discussed carriage of American atomic bombs in British aircraft with the BJSM. A detailed list of the equipment and technical data required was drawn up, and the USAF undertook to provide training and technical assistance, and to establish facilities to store, assemble and assist with loading the bombs. The <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201954">McMahon act was amended</a> in August 1954, and while it did not go nearly as far as the British government wanted—the transfer of information regarding the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons was still prohibited—it did now allow for the interchange of information on their use. This paved the way for the Agreement for Cooperation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes with Britain, which was signed on 12 June 1955. A colonel and two majors from the USAF and the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Special%20Weapons%20Project">Armed Forces Special Weapons Project</a> were given briefings on RAF aircraft to determine which US bombs could be carried. The Americans then wanted to know how many bombs would be required. The <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Minister of Defence</a>, <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>, determined that the V-bomber force would reach a strength of 240 aircraft during 1958. Each would carry one atomic bomb.

Dickson visited the US for talks with Twining in September 1955. A public announcement was made in the form of a <a href="news%20leak">news leak</a> published in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" on 8 June 1956, which was officially denied the following day. Agreement on the provision of American bombs—now called Project E—was reached, resulting in a detailed plan on 12 December 1956. This was then approved by the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">United States Secretary of Defense</a>, <a href="Charles%20Erwin%20Wilson">Charles E. Wilson</a>, and the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. The UK government notified Wilson of its approval on 30 January 1957. The agreement was confirmed by Eisenhower and Macmillan, now Prime Minister, during their March 1957 meeting in Bermuda to repair the damage done to Anglo-American relations by the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>. A formal <a href="Memorandum%20of%20Understanding">Memorandum of Understanding</a> was negotiated in Washington by the <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>, <a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Sir <a href="Geoffrey%20Tuttle">Geoffrey Tuttle</a>, on 21 May 1957.

In a letter to Macmillan on 25 March 1957, Eisenhower stated:

It fell to the commander of the UK-based US <a href="Third%20Air%20Force">Third Air Force</a>, Major General <a href="Roscoe%20C.%20Wilson">Roscoe C. Wilson</a>, to initiate Project E. Wilson had been liaison officer with the Manhattan Project, and Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and was very familiar with nuclear weapons. The first aircraft to be fitted for American atomic bombs were not V-bombers but 28 Canberra bombers earmarked as night <a href="interdictor">interdictor</a>s for the <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander%20Europe">Supreme Allied Commander Europe</a> (SACEUR) in 1957. These were new B(I)8 models, which came straight from the manufacturer for modification to carry the <a href="Mark%207%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 7 nuclear bomb</a>. The intention was that they would be able to carry either American or British bombs, but since the latter were not available, they were only fitted for American bombs. Later-model Canberras would be able to carry both. Since the specifications for the bomb bay doors said they opened wide, and the tail fins of the bombs were between wide, no problem was anticipated, but it turned out that the doors only opened between , depending on the aircraft, which meant that the bombs would have to be individually matched with aircraft. After some thought, was cut off each bomb fin.

Four squadrons of Canberras were based in Germany, their Mark 7 bombs being stored at <a href="RAF%20Germany">RAF Germany</a> bases at <a href="RAF%20Bruggen">RAF Bruggen</a>, <a href="RAF%20Geilenkirchen">RAF Geilenkirchen</a>, <a href="RAF%20Laarbruch">RAF Laarbruch</a> and <a href="RAF%20Wildenrath">RAF Wildenrath</a>. The crews practiced the <a href="Low%20Altitude%20Bombing%20System">Low Altitude Bombing System</a> (LABS) for tactical nuclear attacks. There were also four squadrons of nuclear-armed Canberras based in the UK at <a href="RAF%20Coningsby">RAF Coningsby</a> and <a href="RAF%20Upwood">RAF Upwood</a>; these were capable of using either the Mark 7 or the British <a href="Red%20Beard%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Red Beard</a> nuclear weapons. They too were assigned to the SACEUR in October 1960. The <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> decided to replace these Canberras with Valiants as the <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> and <a href="Handley%20Page%20Victor">Handley Page Victor</a> V-bombers became available and replaced the Valiants in the strategic role. A Valiant squadron at <a href="RAF%20Marham">RAF Marham</a> was assigned to SACEUR on 1 January 1961, followed by two more in July. The UK-based Canberra squadrons were then disbanded. Each of the 24 Valiants was equipped with two of the more powerful Project E <a href="B28%20nuclear%20bomb">B28 nuclear bomb</a>s. These were replaced by the newer <a href="B43%20nuclear%20bomb">B43 nuclear bomb</a>s, which were more suitable for <a href="laydown%20delivery">laydown delivery</a>, in early 1963. The availability of US bombs meant that more British bombs were available for use elsewhere. A permanent storage site for 32 Red Beards was opened at <a href="RAF%20Akrotiri">RAF Akrotiri</a> on Cyprus in November 1961, and one for 48 Red Beards at <a href="RAF%20Tengah">RAF Tengah</a> in Singapore. Only the aircraft on <a href="Quick%20Reaction%20Alert">Quick Reaction Alert</a> (QRA) were armed with a pair of live bombs. These aircraft were kept armed and fuelled on hardstands surrounded by high chain-link fences. The Valiants were taken out of service in 1965. The Canberras continued in service, with their Project E B43 bombs until the last was retired in June 1972. They were replaced by <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20Phantom%20in%20UK%20service">Phantom FGR.2s</a>, which carried Project E B43 and <a href="B57%20nuclear%20bomb">B57 nuclear bomb</a>s between June 1972 and October 1976, when they in turn were replaced in the tactical nuclear role by the <a href="SEPECAT%20Jaguar">Jaguar GR.1</a>, which carried British <a href="WE.177">WE.177</a> bombs.

Project E modifications to Valiants commenced at <a href="RAE%20Farnborough">RAE Farnborough</a> in February 1956. Crew training was carried out with American instructors at <a href="RAF%20Boscombe%20Down">RAF Boscombe Down</a>. The planned V-bomber force had now been reduced to 144 aircraft, and it was intended to equip half of them with Project E weapons. The first 28 Valiants were modified by October 1957; the remaining 20 Valiants, along with 24 Vulcans, were ready by January 1959. The Victors were also modified to carry US weapons.

Under the Project E Memorandum of Understanding, US personnel had custody of the weapons. That meant they performed all the tasks related to their storage, maintenance and readiness. The bombs were kept in secure storage areas (SSAs) on the same bases as the bombers. British staff were not permitted to enter the SSAs; it was therefore impossible to store British and Americans bombs in the same SSA. Bomber Command designated RAF Marham, <a href="RAF%20Waddington">RAF Waddington</a> and <a href="RAF%20Honington">RAF Honington</a> as bases with US SSAs. Another three sites had British SSAs. US custody created operational problems. The procedure for handing over the bombs added an extra ten minutes to the bombers' reaction time, and the requirement that US personnel had guardianship of the weapons at all times meant that neither they nor the bombers could be relocated to dispersal airfields as the RAF desired.

Initially, 72 <a href="Mark%205%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 5 nuclear bomb</a>s were supplied for the V-bombers. They had a yield of up to . The successful <a href="British%20hydrogen%20bomb%20programme">British development of the hydrogen bomb</a>, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the <a href="Sputnik%20crisis">Sputnik crisis</a>, led to the United States Atomic Energy Act being amended again in 1958, resulting in the long-sought resumption of the nuclear <a href="Special%20Relationship">Special Relationship</a> between Britain and the US in the form of the <a href="1958%20US%E2%80%93UK%20Mutual%20Defence%20Agreement">1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement</a>. The US now agreed to supply the V-bombers with megaton weapons in place of the Mark 5, in the form of <a href="Mark%2015%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 15</a> and <a href="Mark%2039%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 39 nuclear bomb</a>s.

<a href="HM%20Treasury">The Treasury</a> immediately inquired as to whether this meant that the British megaton bomb programme could be terminated. Project E was intended to be a stopgap measure, and while the RAF was impressed with the superior yield of US thermonuclear weapons, its Director of Plans noted that "by retaining Project E at its present strength the US may continue to underestimate the UK independent capability, so that the weight given to HM Government's influence on vital issues would be less than it might otherwise be." Both Sandys and the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir <a href="Dermot%20Boyle">Dermot Boyle</a> argued that the UK needed the capacity to initiate a nuclear war unilaterally, but this was not possible if US permission was required for half of the force. With sufficient British bombs becoming available, operational issues and the concept of an <a href="independent%20nuclear%20deterrent">independent nuclear deterrent</a> came to the fore.

The <a href="Air%20Council">Air Council</a> decided on 7 July 1960 that Project E weapons would be phased out by December 1962, by which time it was anticipated that there would be sufficient British megaton weapons to equip the entire <a href="strategic%20bomber">strategic bomber</a> force. Project E weapons were replaced by British <a href="Yellow%20Sun%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Yellow Sun</a> bombs at RAF Honington on 1 July 1961 and Waddington on 30 March 1962. Problems encountered in the development of Red Beard meant that the replacement of kiloton weapons took longer. The UK-based Valiants at Honington and Wittering were withdrawn in April and October 1962, and the last Valiants were retired from the V-bomber force in July 1965. The final practice loading at RAF Marham—with the Mark 43s—was in January 1965, and the last US personnel left the base in July.

Project E was expanded to encompass similar arrangements for providing nuclear weapons to the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a> (BAOR). <a href="NATO">NATO</a> began integrating <a href="tactical%20nuclear%20weapons">tactical nuclear weapons</a> into its war plans in 1954, and the BAOR adopted a doctrine under which it would be the dominant arm on the battlefield as NATO forces conducted a fighting withdrawal to the <a href="Rhine%20River">Rhine River</a>. In 1954, the British Army purchased 113 <a href="MGM-5%20Corporal">Corporal missiles</a> from the US. It was intended that they would be equipped with British warheads under a project codenamed Violet Vision, but Project E offered a quicker, simpler and cheaper alternative. Weapons were made available under the same terms as those of the RAF: US custody and dual control. The 27th Guided Weapons Regiment, Royal Artillery, based at the Napier Barracks in <a href="Dortmund">Dortmund</a>, Germany, became the first unit to equip with the Corporal in June 1960. A second Corporal regiment, the <a href="47th%20Regiment%20Royal%20Artillery">47th Guided Weapons Regiment, Royal Artillery</a>, was formed at the Napier Barracks in 1961. Between them they had about 100 Corporal missiles. The Mark 7 warheads had to be drawn from US Army storage sites in southern Germany until arrangements were made for local storage in August 1959.
The Corporal had several limitations. It was liquid-fuelled, and the <a href="hydrazine">hydrazine</a> fuel and <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> oxidiser were highly toxic and corrosive; it required several hours to fuel, so it could not engage <a href="targets%20of%20opportunity">targets of opportunity</a>; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. During test firings in the <a href="South%20Uist%23Missile%20testing">Outer Hebrides</a>, eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets; four fell short, a significant concern given the danger nuclear weapons posed to friendly troops. A new British project was begun to develop a better missile, codenamed <a href="Blue%20Water%20%28missile%29">Blue Water</a>, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead. The 47th Regiment gave up its Corporals in 1965, and returned to the UK, and the 27th followed in 1967. The British government's September 1965 announcement of the withdrawal of the Corporal missiles raised concerns in Germany that Britain might "de-denuclearise" the BAOR.

As an interim measure, the US offered the <a href="Honest%20John%20missile">Honest John missile</a>. The offer was accepted, and 120 Honest John missiles with <a href="W31">W31</a> warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments: the 24th at Assaye Barracks in <a href="Nienburg%2C%20Lower%20Saxony">Nienburg</a> from 1960 to 1962 and then at Barker Barracks in <a href="Paderborn">Paderborn</a> from 1962 to 1972; the 39th at Dempsey Barracks in <a href="Sennelager">Sennelager</a>; and the 50th at <a href="Menden">Menden</a>. Each regiment had two batteries of Honest Johns, and two of nuclear-capable eight-inch <a href="M115%20howitzer">M115 howitzer</a>s, which were later replaced by <a href="M110%20howitzer">M110 howitzer</a>s with <a href="W33%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">W33 nuclear warheads</a>. Yellow Anvil, a British nuclear artillery round project, was cancelled in 1958, and Blue Water met the same fate on 10 August 1962. The Honest Johns therefore remained in service until 1977. The 50th Missile Regiment was then re-equipped with the <a href="MGM-52%20Lance">Lance missile</a>, with its <a href="W70">W70</a> nuclear warhead. With four batteries, the 50th Missile Regiment had the same number of launchers as the three Honest John regiments. The <a href="W48">W48</a> was acquired for the 155 mm <a href="M109%20howitzer">M109 howitzer</a>s. Both it and the W33 remained in service until 1992. The British Army also considered acquiring the <a href="Davy%20Crockett%20%28nuclear%20device%29">Davy Crockett</a>, but had decided against it by February 1962.

In 1953, the US Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, raised the possibility of a joint <a href="ballistic%20missile">ballistic missile</a> programme with the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. This resulted in an agreement on collaboration being signed on 12 August 1954, and a British <a href="Medium%20Range%20Ballistic%20Missile">Medium Range Ballistic Missile</a> (MRBM) development project codenamed <a href="Blue%20Streak%20%28missile%29">Blue Streak</a>. The United States pursued two Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) projects in parallel to Blue Streak: the US Army's <a href="PGM-19%20Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and the USAF's <a href="PGM-17%20Thor">Thor</a>. When Sandys, now the Minister of Defence, visited the US in January 1957, he found the Americans anxious to deploy IRBMs in Britain. Macmillan and Eisenhower agreed to do so during their summit in Bermuda in March 1957, and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December; at the end of the month it was decided that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment was codenamed <a href="Project%20Emily">Project Emily</a>.

The RAF activated 20 squadrons between September 1958 and December 1959 to operate the 120 Thor missiles. They were located at 20 old wartime airfields so that the government did not have to purchase new land. Each missile was supplied with its own <a href="W49">Mark 49 warhead</a>, a variant of the Mark 28 with a thinner and lighter casing. While the Thor missile bases were manned by the RAF, the warheads were supplied under Project E. Each had a USAF authorisation officer. The missiles used a <a href="dual%20key">dual key</a> system, one of which was held by the authorisation officer. Occasionally a missile would be chosen for test firing, for which the missile and its RAF crew would be flown to <a href="Vandenberg%20Air%20Force%20Base">Vandenberg Air Force Base</a> in California. Twelve test firings were conducted between 6 October 1959 and 12 June 1962. Under the original agreement, the USAF paid the cost of maintenance for the missiles for five years. After a debate over costs and benefits, the Air Council decided on 31 May 1962 that Project Emily should be terminated by the end of 1963. The last Thor squadrons were inactivated on 23 August 1963. The missiles were returned to the United States.

A maritime version of Project E was created, known as Project N. Providing American atomic bombs for Royal Navy ships would have involved similar dual key arrangements and detachments of <a href="US%20Marines">US Marines</a> on board Royal Navy ships. This was deemed impractical even for ships and weapons dedicated to use in European waters. RAF <a href="Coastal%20Command">Coastal Command</a> acquired <a href="Mk%20101%20Lulu">Mk 101 Lulu</a> <a href="nuclear%20depth%20bomb">nuclear depth bomb</a>s (with the <a href="W34%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">W34 nuclear warhead</a>) for its <a href="Avro%20Shackleton">Avro Shackleton</a> and <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Nimrod">Hawker Siddeley Nimrod</a> maritime patrol aircraft from 1965 to 1971 under Project N. These were replaced by the more capable <a href="B57%20nuclear%20bomb">Mark 57</a>, which was stockpiled at <a href="RAF%20St%20Mawgan">RAF St Mawgan</a> and <a href="RAF%20Machrihanish">RAF Machrihanish</a> for US, Dutch and British aircraft.

As well as meeting the needs of the UK forces, Project E affected the design and development of British nuclear weapons. Interim designs like <a href="Violet%20Club">Violet Club</a> were no longer required, as Project E weapons could do the job pending the development of a British weapon. The British designers were particularly impressed by the Mark 28, which was not only lighter than the British <a href="Yellow%20Sun%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29%23Green%20Grass">Green Grass</a> warhead used in Yellow Sun, but considerably more economical in its use of expensive fissile material. An Anglicised version of the Mark 28 was developed, known as <a href="Red%20Snow">Red Snow</a>, and a Yellow Sun Mark 2 using Red Snow cost £500,000 compared with £1,200,000 for the Mark 1 with Green Grass.

When the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> ended in 1991, there were more than 500 US nuclear weapons in the UK. Of these, about 400 were bombs, 48 were <a href="Ground%20Launched%20Cruise%20Missile">Ground Launched Cruise Missile</a>s, and approximately 100 were B57 nuclear depth bombs. The BAOR still had about 85 Lance missiles, and more than 70 W33 eight-inch and W48 155 mm nuclear artillery shells. The cruise missiles were withdrawn in 1991 under the terms of the 1987 <a href="Intermediate-Range%20Nuclear%20Forces%20Treaty">Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty</a>. The United States then decided to withdraw its short-range nuclear weapons. The last US warheads, including the Mark 57 nuclear depth bombs and those used by the BAOR, were withdrawn in July 1992. The only American nuclear weapons then remaining in the UK were 110 or so <a href="B61%20nuclear%20bomb">B61 nuclear bomb</a>s stored at <a href="RAF%20Lakenheath">RAF Lakenheath</a> for USAF <a href="F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle">F-15E Strike Eagle</a>s, which were withdrawn by 2008. The British <a href="WE.177">WE.177</a> nuclear bombs used by the RAF and Royal Navy were withdrawn from service in August 1998, at which point the only remaining British nuclear weapons were the warheads on the <a href="UGM-133%20Trident%20II">Trident missiles</a> of the s.

U-1-class submarine (Austria-Hungary)

The "U-1" class (also called the Lake-type) was a <a href="ship%20class">class</a> of two <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s or <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s built for and operated by the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> (). The class comprised and . The boats were built to an American design at the <a href="Pula">Pola</a> Navy Yard after domestic design proposals failed to impress the Navy. Constructed between 1907 and 1909, the class was a part of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's efforts to competitively evaluate three foreign submarine designs.

Both "U-1"-class submarines were <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> in 1909. An experimental design, the submarines included unique features such as a <a href="diving%20chamber">diving chamber</a> and wheels for traveling along the <a href="seabed">seabed</a>. Extensive <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s were conducted in 1909 and 1910 to test these features as well as other components of the boats, including the <a href="ballast%20tank%23Submarines">diving tanks</a> and engines for each boat. Safety and efficiency problems related to the <a href="gasoline%20engine">gasoline engine</a>s of both submarines led to the Navy to purchase new propulsion systems prior to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The design of the "U-1" class has been described by naval historians as a failure, being rendered obsolete by the time both submarines were <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1911. Despite this, tests of their design provided information that the Navy used to construct subsequent submarines. Both submarines of the "U-1" class served as training boats through 1914, though they were <a href="mobilisation">mobilized</a> briefly during the <a href="Balkan%20Wars">Balkan Wars</a>.

At the outbreak of World War I, the "U-1"-class submarines were in <a href="drydock">drydock</a> in Pola awaiting the installation of <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>s. From 1915 to 1918, both boats conducted reconnaissance cruises out of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> and Pola, though neither sank any enemy vessels during the war. Declared obsolete in January 1918, both submarines were relegated to secondary duties and served as training boats at the Austro-Hungarian submarine base on <a href="Brioni%20Island">Brioni Island</a>, before being transferred back to Pola at the end of the war. When facing defeat in October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government transferred its navy to the newly formed <a href="State%20of%20Slovenes%2C%20Croats%20and%20Serbs">State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs</a> to avoid having to hand its ships over to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied Powers</a>. Following the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Villa%20Giusti">Armistice of Villa Giusti</a> in November 1918, the "U-1"-class submarines were seized by Italian forces and subsequently granted to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Kingdom of Italy</a> under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a> in 1920. Italy <a href="Ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> the submarines at Pola later that year.

With the establishment of the Austrian Naval League in September 1904 and the appointment of Vice-Admiral <a href="Rudolf%20Montecuccoli">Rudolf Montecuccoli</a> to the posts of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy (German: "Marinekommandant") and Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: "Chef der Marinesektion") the following month, the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> began an expansion program befitting a <a href="Great%20Power">Great Power</a>. Montecuccoli immediately pursued the efforts championed by his predecessor, Admiral <a href="Hermann%20von%20Spaun">Hermann von Spaun</a>, and pushed for a greatly expanded and modernized navy.

Montecuccoli's appointment as "Marinekommandant" coincided with the first efforts to develop submarines for <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>. Prior to 1904, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had shown little to no interest in submarines. In early 1904, after allowing the navies of other countries to pioneer submarine developments, Constructor General (German: "Generalschiffbauingenieur") of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, <a href="Siegfried%20Popper">Siegfried Popper</a>, ordered the Naval Technical Committee (German: "Marinetechnisches Kommittee", MTK) to produce a submarine design. Popper himself submitted his first design for a submarine shortly before Montecuccoli took office; technical problems encountered during the initial design phase delayed further proposals from MTK for nearly a year. By this time, Montecuccoli had begun to outline his plans for the future of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. 

Shortly after assuming command as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Montecuccoli drafted his first proposal for a modern Austrian fleet in early 1905. It was to consist of 12 <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, 4 <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s, 8 <a href="scout%20cruiser">scout cruiser</a>s, 18 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, 36 high seas <a href="torpedo%20craft">torpedo craft</a>, and 6 <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. While far more attention at the time was being placed upon the construction of battleships—particularly <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s—Montecuccoli remained interested in the development of a submarine fleet for the Austro-Hungarian Navy and encouraged further development of the program. 

Following up on Montecuccoli's initial naval expansion plan, MTK submitted its specifications for a class of submarines on 17 January 1905. The MTK design called for a single-hull boat with a <a href="waterline%20length">waterline length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of . The submarines were intended to <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">displace</a> when surfaced.

The Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: "Marinesektion") remained skeptical about the seaworthiness of this design. Further proposals submitted by the public as part of a design competition were all rejected by the Navy as impracticable. As a result, the Navy decided to purchase designs from three different foreign firms for a class of submarines. Each design was to be accompanied by two submarines to test each boat against the others. This was done to properly evaluate the various different proposals which would come forward.

<a href="Simon%20Lake">Simon Lake</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Krupp%20Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a>, and <a href="John%20Philip%20Holland">John Philip Holland</a> were each chosen by the Navy to produce a class of submarines for this competitive evaluation. The two Lake-designed submarines comprised the "U-1" class, the Germaniawerft design became the , and the Holland design became the . In 1906, the Navy formally ordered plans for the building of two boats—designated "U-1" and "U-2"—from the <a href="Lake%20Torpedo%20Boat%20Company">Lake Torpedo Boat Company</a> of <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Connecticut">Bridgeport, Connecticut</a>. The Austro-Hungarian Navy had contacted Lake Torpedo Boat Company as early as 1904 for a submarine design, but the decision to scrap the MTK proposal and initiate a competition among foreign builders led the Navy to formally petition a bid from the American company. In 1906, Lake traveled to Austria-Hungary to negotiate the details of the agreement and on 24 November, he signed the contracts with the Navy in <a href="Pula">Pola</a> to construct the "U-1"-class submarines.

Popper in particular had high praise for Lake's designs, telling the American naval architect, "When I saw your plans I recognized that you had introduced valuable features that were better than mine, and also that you had actual experience building and operating submarines, so I went to <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I">the Emperor</a> and asked his consent to substitute your type of boat for my own...Do you know, Mr. Lake, I have been responsible for the design of all other vessels built for the Austrian Navy during the [past] 25 years?"

Although intended to serve as an experimental design when initially ordered, the "U-1" class became the first submarines of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The boats proved to be a disappointment. The naval historians David Dickson, Vincent O'Hara, and Richard Worth described the "U-1" class as "obsolete and unreliable when completed and suffered from problems even after modifications". René Greger, another naval historian, wrote that "the type proved a total failure".

Despite these criticisms and shortcomings, the experimental nature of the submarines provided valuable information for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and Lake's designs addressed what the Navy was asking for when ordering the submarine class. John Poluhowich writes in his book "Argonaut: The Submarine Legacy of Simon Lake" that "the two submarines were completed to the satisfaction of Austrian officials".

Their design was initially in line with Austro-Hungarian naval policy, which stressed coastal defense and patrolling of the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>. Following the onset of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, it became clear that <a href="List%20of%20Austro-Hungarian%20U-boats">Austro-Hungarian U-boats</a> needed to be capable of offensive operations, namely raiding enemy shipping in the Adriatic and <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>s. 

The "U-1"-class submarines had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. They were designed to displace surfaced, but when submerged they displaced . The boats were also built with a <a href="double%20hull">double hull</a>, as opposed to the single-hull design initially proposed by the MTK. After their modernization, the length of the boats was increased to .

Derived from an earlier concept for a submarine intended for peaceful exploring of the sea, the "U-1"-class design had several features typical of Lake's designs. These including a <a href="diving%20chamber">diving chamber</a> under the bow and two variable pitch <a href="screw%20propeller">propellers</a>. The diving chamber was intended for manned underwater missions such as destroying ships with explosives and severing off-shore telegraph cables, as well as for exiting or entering the submarine during an emergency. This diving chamber proved its usefulness during the <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s of the "U-1" class when the crew of one submarine forgot to bring their lunches on-board before conducting an underwater endurance test. A diver from shore was able to transport lunch for the crew without the submarine having to resurface. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that, in theory, could allow travel over the <a href="seabed">seabed</a>. The design also placed the <a href="ballast%20tank%23Submarines">diving tanks</a> above the waterline of the cylindrical <a href="submarine%20hull">hull</a>, which necessitated a heavy <a href="keel">ballast keel</a> for vertical stability and required flooding to be done by pumps. 

The propulsion system for the "U-1" class consisted of two <a href="gasoline%20engine">gasoline engine</a>s for surface running and two <a href="electric%20motor">electric motor</a>s for running submerged. The gasoline engines could produce , while the electric motors had an output of . These engines could produce a speed of while surfaced, and when submerged. The boats had an operational range of while traveling at when surfaced, and while traveling at when submerged. For underwater steering, the design of the "U-1" class featured four pairs of <a href="diving%20plane">diving plane</a>s. These planes provided the submarines with a considerable amount of maneuverability.

Both of the submarines had three <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s—two in the bow, one in the stern—and could carry up to five torpedoes, but typically carried three. While no <a href="deck%20gun">deck gun</a>s were initially installed on the "U-1" class, in 1917 a gun was mounted on the deck of both boats. These guns were removed in January 1918 when the boats were declared obsolete and resumed training duties. The boats were designed for a crew of 17 officers and men.

"U-1" was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> on 2 July 1907 at the Pola Navy Yard (German:"Seearsenal") at Pola. She was followed by "U-2" on 18 July. Construction on the boats was delayed by the need to import the American-made engines for both submarines. "U-1" was the first boat <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 10 February 1908, and "U-2" was launched on 3 April 1909. 

Upon completion of the two boats, the Austro-Hungarian Navy evaluated the "U-1" class in trials during 1909 and 1910. These trials were considerably longer than other sea trials due to the experimental nature of the submarines and the desire by Austro-Hungarian naval officials to test every possible aspect of the boats. While the sea trials for both submarines were under way, efforts were being made to conceal their results from the general public, and especially from the navies of foreign powers. The Austro-Hungarian government attempted to keep the construction and testing of the boats a <a href="Classified%20information">state secret</a>, to the point of employing many of the same measures which the Navy was using with respect to the s. On 13 October 1909, as the "U-1"-class submarines were still undergoing sea trials, Montecuccoli addressed the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry about the urgent need to impose censorship restrictions on the publication of any sea trial results for Austria-Hungary's submarines. These measures were implemented and in February 1910 the level of secrecy surrounding the "U-1" class was so great that a Uruguayan naval officer conducting a visit to Austria-Hungary was shown all of the Navy's warships with the explicit exception of its submarines. 

During these trials, extensive technical problems with the gasoline engines of both submarines were revealed. Exhaust fumes and gasoline vapor frequently poisoned the air inside the boats and increased the risk of internal explosions, and the engines were not able reach the contracted speed, which was surfaced and submerged. Indeed, the engine problems for both submarines were so significant that on multiple occasions their crews had to conduct emergency resurfacing to bring fresh air into the boats. Because of the problems, the Austro-Hungarian Navy considered the engines to be unsuitable for wartime use and paid only for the hulls and armament of the two "U-1" boats. While replacement <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a>s were ordered from the Austrian firm "Maschinenfabrik" Leobersdorf, they agreed to a lease of the gasoline engines at a fee of $4,544 <a href="USD">USD</a> annually. On 5 April 1910, "U-1" suffered engine damage when her electric motors were disabled by an accidental flood.

Flooding the diving tanks, which was necessary to submerge the submarines, took over 14 minutes and 37 seconds in early tests. This was later reduced to 8 minutes. At a depth of the hulls began to show signs of stress and were in danger of being crushed. As a result, the commission overseeing the submarines' trials concluded that the maximum depth for the submarines should be set at and that neither boat should attempt to dive deeper. The four pairs of diving planes equipped on each submarine gave the boats exceptional underwater handling, and, when the boats were properly trimmed and balanced, the boats could be held within of the desired depth. While surfaced, the shape of the hull of each submarine resulted in a significant bow-wave, which resulted in the bow of the boat dipping under the water. This led to the deck and bow casing of both submarines to be reconstructed in January 1915. Other tests proved the use of the submarine's underwater wheels on the seabed to be almost impossible.

Ultimately, the experimental nature of the submarines resulted in a mixed set of sea trial results. Despite this, the "U-1"-class boats outperformed the Germaniawerft-built "U-3" class and the Holland-built "U-5" class in both diving and steering capabilities in the Austro-Hungarian Navy evaluations. After these sea trials, "U-1" was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> on 15 April 1911; "U-2" followed on 22 June.

Both submarines of the "U-1" class saw very limited service upon commissioning, as they were originally ordered and constructed for experimental purposes. After being commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy, both submarines were assigned as training boats, with each boat making as many as ten training cruises a month. 

Within five months of "U-1"s commissioning into the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the <a href="Italo-Turkish%20War">Italo-Turkish War</a> erupted in September 1911. Despite the fact that Austria-Hungary and Italy were nominal allies under the <a href="Triple%20Alliance%20%281882%29">Triple Alliance</a>, tensions between the two nations remained throughout the war. The Austro-Hungarian Navy was placed on high alert, and the Army was deployed to the Italian border. The war ultimately became localized at the request of Austria-Hungary to parts of the eastern Mediterranean and Libya, and the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a> broke out before Italy and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> were able to conclude a peace agreement. The Ottoman military proved insufficient to defeat its opponents and within a matter of weeks, the <a href="Balkan%20League">Balkan League</a> of Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro overran most of the Ottoman Empire's remaining European possessions. By November 1912, Serbia appeared poised to obtain a port on the Adriatic Sea. Austria-Hungary strongly opposed this, as a Serbian port on the Adriatic could drastically alter the balance of power in the region by serving as a Russian naval base. 

Austria-Hungary found Italy in opposition to a Serbian port on the Adriatic as well. Rome opposed Serbian access to the Adriatic on the belief that Russia would use any Serbian ports to station its Black Sea fleet. Italy also feared that Austria-Hungary would one day annex Serbia, and thus gain more Adriatic coastline without any exchange of Italian-speaking territories such as <a href="Trentino">Trentino</a> or <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>. Russia and Serbia both protested to Austria-Hungary regarding its objection to a potential Serbian port on the Adriatic. By the end of November 1912, the threat of conflict between Austria-Hungary, Italy, Serbia, and Russia, coupled with allegations of Serbian mistreatment of the Austro-Hungarian consul in <a href="Prizren">Prisrena</a> led to a war scare in the Balkans. Both Russia and Austria-Hungary began <a href="mobilisation">mobilizing</a> troops along their border, while Austria-Hungary began to mobilize against Serbia. During the crisis, the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy was also fully mobilized, including "U-1" and "U-2". They were ordered to join the rest of the fleet in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> in the event of a war with Serbia and Russia.

By December 1912, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had, in addition to "U-1" and "U-2", a total of seven battleships, six cruisers, eight destroyers, 28 torpedo boats, and four submarines ready for combat. The crisis eventually subsided after the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281913%29">Treaty of London</a>, which granted Serbia free access to the sea through an internationally supervised railroad, while at the same time establishing an independent Albania. The Austro-Hungarian Army and Navy were subsequently demobilized on 28 May 1913. After demobilization, both submarines of the "U-1" class resumed their duties as training vessels. During one of these training cruises on 13 January 1914 near <a href="Fasana">Fasana</a>, "U-1" was accidentally rammed by the Austro-Hungarian armored cruiser . The collision destroyed the submarine's <a href="periscope">periscope</a>.

At the outbreak of World War I, "U-1" and "U-2" were both in <a href="drydock">drydock</a> in Pola awaiting the installation of their new diesel engines, batteries, and periscopes. To accommodate the new engines, the boats were lengthened by about . These changes lowered the surface displacement to but increased the submerged displacement to . After these modernization efforts were completed, "U-1" returned to training duties until 4 October 1915. Meanwhile, "U-2" underwent a further refit in Pola starting on 24 January 1915. During this refit, she had a new <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> installed, which was completed on 4 June 1915.

"U-1" continued as a training boat for the Austro-Hungarian Navy for just over a month, before being relocated to Trieste on 11 November to conduct <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> patrols. "U-2" had already been relocated to Trieste on 7 August 1915 after her new conning tower had been installed. Both boats subsequently conducted reconnaissance cruises from 1915 onward out of Trieste. The relocation to Trieste was undertaken in part to dissuade Italian naval attacks or raids on the crucial Austro-Hungarian city. The "U-1"-class submarines were already outdated by 1915, but their relocation to Trieste helped to dissuade the Italians from their plans to bombard the port, as Italian military intelligence suggested the submarines were on regular patrol in the waters off Trieste.

After being stationed out of Trieste for just over two years, "U-1" was sent back to Pola on 22 December 1917, while "U-2" remained at Trieste until the end of the year. Despite being declared obsolete on 11 January 1918, both submarines remained in service as training boats at the submarine base at <a href="Brioni%20Island">Brioni Island</a>. In mid-1918, the "U-1"-class submarines were considered for service as minesweepers, as the diving chamber in the boats could allow divers to sever the anchoring cables of sea mines. The poor condition of the boats prevented the plan from being implemented. Near the war's end, both boats were once more taken to Pola. By October 1918 it had become clear that Austria-Hungary was facing defeat. With various attempts to quell nationalist sentiments failing, Emperor <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Austria">Karl I</a> decided to sever Austria-Hungary's alliance with Germany and appeal to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied Powers</a> in an attempt to preserve the empire from complete collapse. On 26 October, Austria-Hungary informed Germany that <a href="Dual%20Alliance%20%281879%29">their alliance</a> was over. In Pola, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was in the process of tearing itself apart along ethnic and nationalist lines.

On 29 October the <a href="State%20of%20Slovenes%2C%20Croats%20and%20Serbs%23National%20Council">National Council</a> in <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> announced Croatia's dynastic ties to Hungary had come to a formal conclusion. The National Council also called for Croatia and Dalmatia to be unified, with Slovene and Bosnian organizations pledging their loyalty to the newly formed government. This new provisional government, while throwing off Hungarian rule, had not yet declared independence from Austria-Hungary. Thus Emperor Karl I's government in Vienna asked the newly formed <a href="State%20of%20Slovenes%2C%20Croats%20and%20Serbs">State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs</a> for help maintaining the fleet stationed at Pola and keeping order among the navy. The National Council refused to assist unless the Austro-Hungarian Navy was first placed under its command. Emperor Karl I, still attempting to save the Empire from collapse, agreed to the transfer, provided that the other "nations" which made up Austria-Hungary could claim their fair share of the value of the fleet at a later time. All sailors not of Slovene, Croatian, Bosnian, or Serbian background were placed on leave for the time being; the officers were given the choice of joining the new navy or retiring.

The Austro-Hungarian government thus decided to hand over the bulk of its fleet to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs without a shot being fired. This was considered preferential to handing the fleet to the Allies, as the new state had declared its neutrality. Furthermore, the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs had also not yet publicly rejected Emperor Karl I, keeping the possibility of <a href="Trialism%20in%20Austria-Hungary">reforming the Empire into a triple monarchy</a> alive. The transfer to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs began on the morning of 31 October, with <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> (German: "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>") <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Miklós Horthy</a> meeting representatives from the <a href="South%20Slav">South Slav</a> nationalities aboard his flagship, . After "short and cool" negotiations, the arrangements were settled and the handover was completed that afternoon. The Austro-Hungarian Naval Ensign was struck from "Viribus Unitis", and was followed by the remaining ships in the harbor. Control over the ships in the harbor, and the head of the newly-established navy for the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, fell to Captain <a href="Janko%20Vukovi%C4%87">Janko Vuković</a>, who was raised to the rank of admiral and took over Horthy's old responsibilities as Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet.

Under the terms of the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Villa%20Giusti">Armistice of Villa Giusti</a>, signed between Italy and Austria-Hungary on 3 November 1918, this transfer was not recognized. Italian ships thus sailed into the ports of Trieste, Pola, and Fiume the following day. On 5 November, Italian troops occupied the naval installations at Pola. The State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs attempted to hold onto their ships, but lacked the men and officers to do so as most sailors who were not South Slavs had already gone home. The National Council did not order any men to resist the Italians, but they condemned Italy's actions as illegitimate. On 9 November, all remaining ships in Pola had the Italian flag raised. At a conference at <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, the Allied Powers agreed the transfer of Austria-Hungary's navy to the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs could not be accepted, despite sympathy from the United Kingdom. Faced with the prospect of being given an ultimatum to hand over the former Austro-Hungarian warships, the National Council agreed to hand over the ships beginning on 10 November 1918.

In 1920 the final distribution of the ships was settled among the Allied powers under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Saint-Germain-en-Laye%20%281919%29">Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye</a>. Both submarines of the "U-1" class were ceded to Italy as <a href="World%20War%20I%20reparations">war reparations</a> and scrapped at Pola in the same year. Due to the training and reconnaissance missions the submarines engaged in throughout the war, neither boat sank any ships during their careers.

Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series

The Fifth Test of the 1948 Ashes series, held at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> in London, was the final <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> in that <a href="1948%20Ashes%20series">cricket series</a> between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="England%20national%20cricket%20team">England</a>. The match took place on 14–18 August, with a rest day on 15 August. Australia won the match by an innings and 149 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">run</a>s to complete a 4–0 series win. It was the last Test in the career of Australian captain <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, generally regarded as the best batsman in the history of the sport. Going into the match, if Australia batted only once, Bradman needed only four runs from his final innings to have a Test <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of exactly 100, but he failed to score, <a href="bowled">bowled</a> second ball for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> by <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Eric%20Hollies">Eric Hollies</a>.

With the series already lost, the England selectors continued to make many changes, on this occasion, four. In all, they had used 21 players for the series and were severely criticised for failing to maintain continuity. England captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> won the toss, and elected to bat on a pitch affected by rain. After a delayed start due to inclement weather, the Australian pace attack, led by <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>, dismissed England within the first day for just 52. Lindwall was the main destroyer, taking six <a href="wicket">wicket</a>s for 20 runs (6/20). The English batsmen found it difficult to cope with his prodigious <a href="swing%20bowling">swing</a> and <a href="pace%20bowling">pace</a>; four of his wickets were either <a href="bowled">bowled</a> or <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a>. <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> was the only batsman to resist, making 30 before being the final man dismissed. In reply, Australia's opening pair of <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> and <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> passed England's score on the same afternoon with no loss of wickets. The <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">opening stand</a> ended at 117 when Barnes fell for 61 and Bradman came to the crease to a standing ovation and three cheers from his opponents. He fell second ball, but Australia reached 153/2 <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">at stumps</a> on the first day.

On the second day, Australian batsmen fell regularly once <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> was dismissed at 226/3, most of them being troubled by Hollies, who had been selected after taking 8/107 against Australia for <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>. Morris was an exception and he made 196, more than half his team's total, before being <a href="run%20out">run out</a> as Australia were dismissed for 389. Hollies took 5/131. England reached 54/1 at stumps and by lunch on the third day were 121/2, Hutton and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> batting steadily. However, they suffered a late collapse to be 178/7 when bad light and rain stopped the day's play. Hutton top-scored for the second time in the match for England, making 64. The next morning, <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> took the last three wickets as England were bowled out for 188, ending the match. Johnston ended with 4/40 and Lindwall 3/50.

The match was followed by speeches from both captains, after which the crowd sang "<a href="For%20He%27s%20a%20Jolly%20Good%20Fellow">For He's a Jolly Good Fellow</a>" in Bradman's honour. Having been undefeated in their matches up to this point, the Australians maintained their streak in the remaining fixtures, gaining them the sobriquet of "The Invincibles".

After the first four Tests, Australia led the series 3–0, having won all but the Third Test, which was rain-affected. They had taken an unlikely win in the <a href="Fourth%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Fourth Test</a> at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a>, scoring 404/3 in their second innings, the highest ever score in a successful Test runchase.

Australia had been unbeaten throughout the tour. Between the Fourth and Fifth Test, they played five tour matches. They defeated <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> by an innings, before having a washout against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>. The Australians then defeated <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> by nine wickets, before drawing with <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, who hung on with three wickets in hand on the final day. Australia's final lead-in outing was a two-day non-first-class match against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day.

With the series already lost, England made four changes to their team. <a href="John%20Dewes">John Dewes</a> replaced <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a>—who broke his thumb in a match for <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> against the Australians—at the top of the order. Dewes had gained attention after scoring 51 for <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> in the tour match against the Australians. In the three weeks between then and the Test, he had scored 105 and 89 against Lancashire and <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> respectively. However, he had averaged less than 40 for the season and made three consecutive scores below 20 leading into the Tests. The journalist and former Australian Test cricketer <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> condemned the decision, claiming that aside from defending the ball, Dewes was too reliant on <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">slogging towards the leg side with a horizontal bat</a>. O'Reilly claimed Dewes was not ready for Test cricket and that asking him to face the rampant Australians could have psychologically scarred him. He said the selection "was tantamount to asking a young first-year medical student to carry out an intricate operation with a butcher's knife."

<a href="Allan%20Watkins">Allan Watkins</a> replaced <a href="Ken%20Cranston">Ken Cranston</a> as the middle order batsman and pace bowler. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut, and the latter became the second <a href="Wales">Welshman</a> to play in an Ashes Test. Watkins had scored 19 and taken 1/47 for <a href="Glamorgan%20CCC">Glamorgan</a> in their match against Australia two weeks earlier, but had only scored 168 runs at 18.66 and taken 11 wickets in his last six matches. Cranston had made a duck and 10, and taken 1/79 on his debut in the previous Test. While acknowledging Cranston's poor performances and concluding that he had not been of international quality, O'Reilly said Watkins' performance in Glamorgan's match against the Australians "had not inspired anyone with his ability" to counter the tourists' bowling.

England played two spinners; <a href="left%20arm%20orthodox%20spin">left arm orthodox spin</a>ner <a href="Jack%20Young%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Young</a> replaced fellow <a href="finger%20spin">finger spin</a>ner <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a>, while the <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> of <a href="Eric%20Hollies">Eric Hollies</a> replaced the <a href="pace%20bowling">pace bowling</a> of <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a>. Hollies was brought into the team because he had caused the Australian batsmen difficulty in the tour match against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>. He took 8/107 in the first innings, the best innings figures against the Australians for the summer. His performance included bowling Bradman with a <a href="topspinner">topspinner</a> that went between bat and pad. It was part of a month-long run in which he took 52 wickets in seven matches, including two ten-wicket match hauls. Young had taken 12 and 14 wickets in consecutive matches against <a href="Northamptonshire%20CCC">Northamptonshire</a> and <a href="Surrey%20CCC">Surrey</a> since his omission following the <a href="Third%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Third Test</a>, while Pollard and Laker had managed totals of only 2/159 and 3/206 respectively in the Headingley Test.

Having made only 5 and 18 in the previous Test, <a href="Jack%20Crapp">Jack Crapp</a> was originally dropped from the team but was reprieved by Washbrook's injury. The England selectors were widely condemned for their decisions, which were seen as an investment in youth rather than necessarily picking the best players available at the time. Their frequent changes meant the home team had used a total of 21 players for the five Tests.

Australia made three changes. Having taken only seven wickets in the first four Tests at an average of 61.00, <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> was replaced by <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> was replaced by the opening batsman <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>, who had missed the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> from injury and the omission of his deputy <a href="Ron%20Saggers">Ron Saggers</a>.

The two nations had last met at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> in the Fifth Test of the 1938 Ashes series, during Australia's previous tour of England. On that occasion, England made a Test world record score of 903/7 <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a>, and <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> made 364, an individual Test world record. Australia batted in both innings with only nine men because of injuries sustained by Bradman and <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> during Hutton's 13-hour marathon effort. They collapsed to the heaviest defeat in Test history, by an innings and 579 runs. It was Australia's last Test before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and they had not lost a Test since then.

Hundreds of spectators had slept on wet pavements outside the stadium in rainy weather on the eve of the Test to queue for tickets. Bradman had announced his forthcoming retirement at the end of the season, so the public were anxious to witness his last appearance at Test level.

English skipper <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week leading up to the match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's decision was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, a former Test teammate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce slowly from the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.

Dewes and <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> opened for England, a move that attracted criticism of Yardley for exposing the debutant Dewes to the new ball bowling of Lindwall and <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>. After Hutton opened the scoring with a single from the second ball of the day, Dewes was on strike. The single had almost turned into a five when <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> fired in a wide return, but <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> managed to prevent from going for four <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23O">overthrows</a>. Dewes took a single from the opening over—bowled by Lindwall—and thus faced the start of the second over, which was delivered by Miller. Dewes had been troubled by Miller in the past. During the <a href="Victory%20Tests">Victory Tests</a> in 1945, Miller had repeatedly dismissed the batsman, and during a match for <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> against the Australians earlier in the tour, Dewes had used towels to pad his torso against Miller's <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short balls</a>. During his short innings, Dewes was also visibly nervous and kept on moving around, unable to stand still.

Miller caused a stoppage after his first ball in order to sprinkle sawdust on the crease. With the second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 2/1. However, despite the early wicket, the bowlers appeared to lack confidence in their run-up on the soggy ground. Bradman made an early bowling change and brought Johnston into the attack to replace Miller after the latter had bowled three overs for the concession of two runs. At this time, Bradman adopted relatively defensive field settings despite the early breakthrough. <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a> joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook</a> a short ball from Johnston. He failed to get the ball in the middle of the bat and it looped up and travelled around . <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> took the catch just <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">behind square leg</a>, diving sideways and getting two hands to the ball. This left England at 10/2 as <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> came to the crease. Lindwall bounced Compton, drawing an edge that flew towards the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slips cordon</a>. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball narrowly evade the slips catchers and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">third man</a>, who stopped the ball and waited for Compton to regain his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to <a href="run%20out">run him out</a>. However, this sporting gesture did not cost Australia many runs because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton went for a hook shot and <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch. Bradman later said he had remembered how Compton had been out in exactly the same position in the corresponding match at the same ground during the 1938 series. Fingleton described Morris's effort as "one of the catches of the season". England were 17/3, and Crapp came in to join Hutton. At this point, Bradman began to put in place more attacking field settings. Johnston then hit Hutton on the fingers with a ball that rose sharply after pitching. Bradman took Lindwall off after 50 minutes and replaced him with Miller, who then removed Crapp, caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>, leaving England at 23/4. When play was adjourned for lunch with England on 29/4, Hutton was 17 while Yardley was on four. According to Fingleton, Hutton "had never been in the slightest difficulty". He had played cautiously but did not seem hurried by the bowling. Miller had taken 2/3 from six overs.

After the lunch break, England added six runs to be 35/4, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging <a href="yorker">yorker</a>. The debutant Watkins came in, having earned a reputation in Glamorgan's match against Australia for hooking. He made several attempts at the shot in his innings of 16 balls. He attempted a hook shot from a short ball and missed before being hit on the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer, having tried to hook the ball downwards in an unorthodox manner akin to a tennis serve. He was then dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> by Johnston for a duck to leave England at 42/6. For his troubles, Watkins also collected a bruise from the hit to the shoulder, which inhibited his bowling later in the match. Lindwall then removed <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a>, <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> and Young, all yorked by swinging deliveries in the space of two runs, as England fell from 45/6 to 47/9. This brought Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who then hit the only <a href="boundary%20%28cricket%29">boundary</a> of the innings, lofting Lindwall for a straight drive back over his head. The ball almost went for <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a>, landing just short of the boundary. The innings ended at 52 when Hutton—who never appeared troubled by the bowling—<a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">leg glanced</a> Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a>, who caught the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen, while O'Reilly called it "extraordinarily good".

The match saw Lindwall at his best. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs, taking five wickets for eight runs, and finishing with 6/20 from 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as "the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket". Fingleton, who played against the "<a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>" attack in 1932–33, said "I was watching a man almost the equal of <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Larwood</a> [the "Bodyline" spearhead] in pace ... Truly a great bowler". O'Reilly wrote Lindwall's "magnificent performance must go down as one of the greatest bowling efforts in Anglo-Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever." Hutton was the only batsman to resist the Lindwall-led attack, scoring 30 in 124 minutes and surviving 147 deliveries. The next most resilient display was from Yardley, who scored seven runs in 31 minutes of resistance, facing 33 balls. Miller and Johnston took 2/5 and 2/20 respectively, and Australia's pace trio removed all the batsmen without Bradman having to call upon Ring's <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>.

In contrast, Australia batted with apparent ease, as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out. The debutant Watkins sent down four overs for 19 runs with his bruised shoulder and did not bowl again. He was in much pain and his limp bowling did little to trouble the Australian openers. Morris and Barnes batted comfortably and passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking less than an hour to push the Australians into the lead. O'Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". Australia reached 100 at 17:30 with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. The score had reached 117 after only 126 minutes, when Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The right-handed Australian opener stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the leather. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00, late on the first day. As Bradman had already announced the tour would be his last at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat; Yardley led the Englishmen and the crowd in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers, before shaking Bradman's hand. With 6,996 Test career runs, Bradman needed only four runs to average exactly 100 in Test cricket. Bradman took guard and played the first ball from Hollies, a leg break, from the back foot. The leg spinner pitched the next ball up, bowling Bradman for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> with a <a href="googly">googly</a> that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned by what had happened and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large round of applause. It was claimed by many, including Hollies, that Bradman became emotional and had tears in his eyes at the ovation given to him by the crowd and the English players, and that this hampered his ability to see and hit the ball. Bradman admitted to being moved by the applause, but always denied shedding tears, saying "to suggest I got out, as some people did, because I had tears in my eyes while I was looking at the bowler was quite untrue. Eric Hollies deceived me and he deserves full credit."

Hassett came in at 117/2 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four. Hassett was on 10.

15 August was a Sunday, and thus a rest day. Play resumed on Monday, the second morning, and Morris registered his third <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> of the Test series and his sixth in ten Ashes matches. Overall, it was his seventh century in 14 Tests. It had taken him 208 minutes and he had hit four fours. Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped Hassett lbw for 37 after 134 minutes of batting. As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply on the first day and were already well in the lead, they had plenty of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace. The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller came in and tried to attack, but made only five before overbalancing and stumbling forward out of his crease, allowing Evans to <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">stump</a> him from the bowling of Hollies. Harvey, the youngest player in the Australian squad at the age of 19, came to the crease at 243/4 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another boundary, but the attacking strokeplay did not last. Harvey succumbed to Hollies, hitting him to Young. The young batsman was having trouble against the turning ball, so he decided to use his feet and step towards the pitch of the ball. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a <a href="topspinner">topspinner</a> that dipped more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Hollies' success against the middle-order prompted Yardley to opt to continue with the older ball even when a replacement was available, a move that was rarely made throughout the series as the pacemen dominated the bowling. Hollies did not spin the ball significantly but relied on variations in flight to defeat his opponents.

Loxton came in with the score at 265/5 and accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before he fell to the new ball. He appeared uncomfortable with the outswingers and <a href="leg%20cutter">leg cutter</a>s of Bedser, and was beaten several times, before Edrich had him caught behind for 15. Lindwall came in and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 332/7. Morris was then finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for its numerous <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Types%20of%20batting%20shots">hooks and off-drives</a>. It took a <a href="run%20out">run out</a> to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through from the non-striker's end by Tallon, but was too slow for the substitute fielder <a href="Reg%20Simpson">Reg Simpson</a>'s arm. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Ring, before both were out with Australia's score on 389, ending the tourists' innings. Both were caught by Crapp in slips from the bowling of Hollies and Bedser respectively. Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies, who took 5/131. England had relied heavily on <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowling</a>; Young took 2/118 and of the 158.2 overs bowled, 107 were delivered by the two slow men. Hollies pitched the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into playing front-foot shots from balls that spun after pitching on off stump.

England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears. Dewes took strike and got off the mark from Lindwall when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer rose over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Soon after, Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England 20/1. Dewes had often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty. This was because of his habit of leaning his weight onto his back foot as the ball was being bowled, which meant that a forward lean would instinctively result. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the England innings, which reached 54/1 at the close at the second day's play, which was hastened by bad light.

Early on the third day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—between bat and pad for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards, leaving the score at 64/2, before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings and took the score to 121 at lunch without further loss. Hutton and Compton were 42 and 37 respectively. Compton started slowly but had accelerated as the adjournment approached. The morning's batting had been relatively slow, with only 67 runs scored in 100 minutes, of which Hutton added only 23. The morning session also featured a tight spell of 13 overs by Ring. The leg spinner did not bowl consistently or accurately, and although the batsman hit him regularly, they did not place their shots, which often went to the fielders. At the other end, Johnston bowled his finger spin from around the wicket with a well-protected off side. There were four men in the off side ring and they had much work to do as Hutton hit the ball there repeatedly. The English batsmen progressed steadily and both Johnston and Ring had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were no other scares. Towards the end of the morning session, the second new ball became available but Bradman decided to bide his time. He allowed Johnston to rest after his morning spell and used Lindwall and Miller—delivering off spinners—to bowl with the old ball for the last half hour before lunch break so that the trio could use the adjournment to recuperate before attacking with the new ball.

After lunch, Lindwall and Johnston took the new ball, and the partnership progressed only four further runs to 61 in 110 minutes. On 39, Compton aimed a hard <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut shot</a> from Johnston's bowling, which flew into Lindwall's left hand at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">second slip</a> for a "freak slip catch". Hutton managed to continue resisting the Australians before Miller struck Crapp in the neck with a bouncer. The batsman did not react to the blow and did not bother to rub the point of impact. After hitting a series of <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">cover drive</a>s for boundaries, Hutton edged Miller to Tallon and was out for 64, having top-scored in both innings. He had batted for over four hours and left England at 153/4. Thereafter, the home side collapsed. Crapp was bowled by Miller for nine, and two runs later, Ring dismissed debutant Watkins for two, his only wicket for the match. Watkins swung Ring to the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> and the ball went straight into the hands of Hassett, who did not need to move from his position on the boundary, leaving England at 167/6. Lindwall returned and yorked Evans, who appeared to not detect the delivery in the poor light, for eight. The umpires thus called off play after Yardley appealed against the light. The ground was then hit by rain, resulting in a premature end to the day's play with England at 178/7, having lost 4/25.

England resumed on the fourth morning with only three wickets in hand and they were still 159 runs in arrears. Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs. Only ten runs were added; the match ended when Hollies fell for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">golden duck</a> after skying a ball to Morris, immediately after Yardley's departure. Johnston ended with 4/40 from 27.3 overs while Lindwall took 3/50 from 25 overs. Miller claimed 2/22 while Ring bowled the most overs, 28, to finish with 1/44. Given the time lost to inclement weather on the first day, Australia had won the match in less than three days of playing time.

This result sealed the series 4–0 in favour of Australia. The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches. Bradman began with:

Yardley spoke after Bradman:

Bradman was then given three cheers and the crowd sang "<a href="For%20He%27s%20a%20Jolly%20Good%20Fellow">For He's a Jolly Good Fellow</a>" before dispersing.

The win brought Australia closer to Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and Australia only had seven further matches to negotiate. They secured three consecutive innings victories against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>, the <a href="Gentlemen%20of%20England">Gentlemen of England</a> and <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>. They then took first innings leads of more than 200 against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a> and <a href="HDG%20Leveson-Gower">Leveson-Gower's XI</a>, but both matches were washed out. The last two matches were two-day non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>, both won by an innings. Bradman's men thus completed the tour undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet "The Invincibles".

Jesus nahm zu sich die Zwölfe, BWV 22

The work, which is in five <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movement</a>s, begins with a scene from the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a> reading in which Jesus <a href="Jesus%20predicts%20his%20death">predicts his suffering</a> in Jerusalem. The unknown poet of the cantata text took the scene as a starting point for a sequence of <a href="aria">aria</a>, <a href="recitative">recitative</a>, and aria, in which the contemporary Christian takes the place of the disciples, who do not understand what Jesus is telling them about the events soon to unfold, but follow him nevertheless. The closing <a href="chorale">chorale</a> is a <a href="stanza">stanza</a> from <a href="Elisabeth%20Cruciger">Elisabeth Cruciger</a>'s <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "". The music is scored for three vocal soloists, a four-part <a href="choir">choir</a>, <a href="oboe">oboe</a>, <a href="String%20instrument">strings</a> and <a href="basso%20continuo">continuo</a>. The work shows that Bach had mastered the composition of a dramatic scene, an expressive aria with <a href="obbligato">obbligato</a> oboe, a recitative with strings, an exuberant dance, and a chorale in the style of his predecessor in the position as Thomaskantor, <a href="Johann%20Kuhnau">Johann Kuhnau</a>. Bach directed the first performance of the cantata during a church service, together with another audition piece, . He performed the cantata again on the last Sunday before Lent a year later, after he had taken up office.

The cantata shows elements which became standards for Bach's Leipzig cantatas and even the <a href="Passions%20%28Bach%29">Passions</a>, including a "frame of biblical text and chorale around the operatic forms of aria and recitative", "the fugal setting of biblical words" and "the biblical narrative ... as a dramatic ".
As far as we know, the earliest cantatas of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> were performed in <a href="M%C3%BChlhausen">Mühlhausen</a> from 1706 to 1708. He was employed as an organist there, but he occasionally composed cantatas, mostly for special occasions. The cantatas were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns, such as (a psalm setting), and the Easter <a href="Chorale%20cantata%20%28Bach%29">chorale cantata</a> .
Bach was next appointed organist and chamber musician in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> on 25 June 1708 at the court of the co-reigning dukes in <a href="Saxe-Weimar">Saxe-Weimar</a>, <a href="William%20Ernest%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar">Wilhelm Ernst</a> and his nephew <a href="Ernest%20Augustus%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Ernst August</a>. He initially concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the , the <a href="Toccata%20and%20Fugue%20in%20D%20minor%2C%20BWV%20565">Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565</a>, and the <a href="Prelude%20%28Toccata%29%20and%20Fugue%20in%20E%20major%2C%20BWV%20566">Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566</a>. He was promoted to on 2 March 1714, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the . The first cantatas he composed in the new position were , for <a href="Palm%20Sunday">Palm Sunday</a>, for <a href="Jubilate%20Sunday">Jubilate Sunday</a>, and , for <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a>. Mostly inspired by texts by the court poet, <a href="Salomo%20Franck">Salomo Franck</a>, they contain recitatives and arias. When <a href="Johann%20Samuel%20Drese">Johann Samuel Drese</a>, the (director of music), died in 1716, Bach hoped in vain to become his successor. Bach looked for a better position and found it as at the court of <a href="Leopold%2C%20Prince%20of%20Anhalt-K%C3%B6then">Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen</a>. However, the duke in Weimar did not dismiss him and arrested him for disobedience. He was released on 2 December 1717.

In <a href="K%C3%B6then%20%28Anhalt%29">Köthen</a>, Bach found an employer who was an enthusiastic musician himself. The court was <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a>, therefore Bach's work from this period was mostly secular, including the <a href="Orchestral%20suites%20%28Bach%29">orchestral suites</a>, the <a href="Cello%20Suites%20%28Bach%29">cello suites</a>, the <a href="Sonatas%20and%20partitas%20for%20solo%20violin%20%28Bach%29">sonatas and partitas for solo violin</a>, and the "<a href="Brandenburg%20Concertos">Brandenburg Concertos</a>". He composed secular cantatas for the court for occasions such as New Year's Day and the prince's birthday, including . He later <a href="Parody%20music">parodied</a> some of them as church cantatas without major changes, for example .
Bach composed <a href="Bach%20cantata">his cantata</a> as part of his application for the position of in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, the official title being (Cantor and Director of Music). As cantor, he was responsible for the music at four <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> churches, the main churches <a href="Thomaskirche">Thomaskirche</a> (St. Thomas) and the <a href="Nikolaikirche%2C%20Leipzig">Nikolaikirche</a> (St. Nicholas), but also the <a href="St.%20Matthew%2C%20Leipzig">Neue Kirche</a> (New Church) and the <a href="St.%20Peter%2C%20Leipzig">Peterskirche</a> (St. Peter). As director of music, the Thomaskantor was Leipzig's "senior musician", responsible for the music on official occasions such as town council elections and homages. Functions related to the university took place at the <a href="Paulinerkirche%2C%20Leipzig">Paulinerkirche</a>. The position became vacant when Johann Kuhnau died on 5 June 1722. Bach was interested, mentioning as one reason that he saw more possibilities for future academic studies of his sons in Leipzig: "... but this post was described to me in such favorable terms that finally (particularly since my sons seemed inclined to [university] studies) I cast my lot, in the name of the Lord, and made my journey to Leipzig, took my examination, and then made the change of position."

By August 1722, the town council had already chosen <a href="Georg%20Philipp%20Telemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a> as Kuhnau's successor, but he declined in November. In a council meeting on 23 November, seven candidates were evaluated, but no agreement was reached on whether to prefer a candidate for academic teaching abilities or musical performance. The first council document with Bach named as a candidate dates from 21 December, together with <a href="Christoph%20Graupner">Christoph Graupner</a>. Of all candidates, Bach was the only one without a university education.

The decision to invite Bach was made by the council on 15 January 1723. The council seemed to have preferred Bach and Graupner because they were invited to show two cantatas each, while other candidates were requested to show only one. Two candidates even had to present their work in the same service. Graupner's performance took place on the last Sunday after <a href="Epiphany%20%28holiday%29">Epiphany</a>, 17 January 1723. Two days before the event, the town council already agreed to offer him the position.

<a href="Christoph%20Wolff">Christoph Wolff</a> assumes that Bach received an invitation for the audition together with the texts, probably prescribed to the candidates and drawn from a printed collection, only weeks before the date. In Köthen Bach composed two cantatas on two different themes from the prescribed Gospel for the Sunday, , on the topic of <a href="healing%20the%20blind%20near%20Jericho">healing the blind near Jericho</a> and about Jesus announcing his suffering, which the disciples do not understand.

Bach had to travel to Leipzig early because he was not familiar with the location and the performers. Wolff assumes that Bach was in Leipzig already on 2 February for the Marian feast of <a href="Presentation%20of%20Jesus%20at%20the%20Temple">Purification</a> when candidate Georg Balthasar Schott presented his audition piece at the Nikolaikirche. Bach brought the scores and some parts, but additional parts had to be copied in Leipzig by students of the <a href="Thomasschule">Thomasschule</a>. Bach led the first performance of the two audition cantatas on 7 February 1723 as part of a church service at the Thomaskirche, this cantata before the sermon, and after the sermon. The score of BWV 22 bears the note "This is the Leipzig audition piece" ().

Wolff notes that Bach employed the three lower voices in BWV 22 and the upper three voices in BWV 23, and presents a list of the different composition techniques Bach employed in the two audition cantatas; they displayed "a broad and highly integrated spectrum of ... vocal art".

A press review reads: "On Sunday last in the morning the Hon. Capellmeister of Cöthen, Mr. Bach, gave here his test at the church of St. Thomas's for the hitherto vacant cantorate, the music of the same having been amply praised on that occasion by all knowledgeable persons ...".

Bach left Leipzig without hope for the position because it had been offered to Graupner, but he was not dismissed by his employer, <a href="Ernest%20Louis%2C%20Landgrave%20of%20Hesse-Darmstadt">Ernst-Ludwig of Hesse-Darmstadt</a>. After a meeting on 9 April 1723, with incomplete documentation containing "... since the best could not be obtained, a mediocre one would have to be accepted ...", Bach received an offer to sign a preliminary contract.

Bach assumed the position of on 30 May 1723, the first Sunday after <a href="Trinity%20Sunday">Trinity</a>, performing two ambitious cantatas in 14 movements each: , followed by . They form the beginning of his attempt to create several annual cycles of cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year.

He performed again on 20 February 1724, as a printed <a href="libretto">libretto</a> shows, and probably did so again in later years.

Bach composed his cantata in 1723 for the Sunday <a href="Church%20cantata%23Last%20Sunday%20before%20Lent%20%28Estomihi%29">Estomihi</a> (Quinquagesima), the last Sunday before <a href="Lent">Lent</a>. In Leipzig, "<a href="tempus%20clausum">tempus clausum</a>" was observed during Lent, therefore it was the last Sunday with a cantata performance before a celebration of the <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a>, Palm Sunday and the <a href="Vespers%20in%20Lutheranism">vespers service</a> on <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> and Easter. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the <a href="First%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a>, "praise of love" (), and from the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a>, healing the blind near Jericho (). The Gospel also contains the announcement by Jesus of his future suffering in Jerusalem, and that the disciples do not understand what he is saying.

The <a href="Bach%20cantata%23Text%20of%20Bach%27s%20sacred%20cantatas">cantata text</a> is the usual combination of Bible quotation, free contemporary poetry and as closing chorale a <a href="stanza">stanza</a> from a <a href="hymn">hymn</a> as an affirmation. An unknown poet chose from the Gospel verses 31 and 34 as the text for movement 1, and wrote a sequence of <a href="aria">aria</a>, <a href="recitative">recitative</a> and aria for the following movements. His poetic text places the Christian in general, including the listener at Bach's time or any time, in the situation of the disciples: he is pictured as wanting to follow Jesus even in suffering, although he does not comprehend. The poetry ends on a prayer for "denial of the flesh". The closing <a href="chorale">chorale</a> is stanza 5 of <a href="Elisabeth%20Cruciger">Elisabeth Cruciger</a>'s "", intensifying the prayer, on a melody from the "<a href="Lochamer-Liederbuch">Lochamer-Liederbuch</a>".

Stylistic comparisons with other works by Bach suggest that the same poet wrote the texts for both audition cantatas and also for the two first cantatas which Bach performed when taking up his office. The poetry for the second aria has an unusually long first section, which Bach handled elegantly by repeating only part of it in the <a href="da%20capo">da capo</a>.

Bach structured the cantata in five movements, and scored it for three vocal soloists (an <a href="alto">alto</a> (A), <a href="tenor">tenor</a> (T) and <a href="Bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a> (B)), a four-part choir (<a href="SATB">SATB</a>), and for a <a href="Baroque%20instruments">Baroque orchestra</a> of an oboe (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and <a href="Baroque%20instruments%23Basso%20continuo">basso continuo</a>. The duration is given as .

In the following table of movements, the scoring, divided in voices, <a href="Wind%20instrument">winds</a> and <a href="String%20instrument">strings</a>, follows the <a href="Neue%20Bach-Ausgabe">Neue Bach-Ausgabe</a>. The continuo group is not listed, because it plays throughout. The <a href="Key%20%28music%29">keys</a> and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s are taken from <a href="Alfred%20D%C3%BCrr">Alfred Dürr</a>. The symbol is used to denote <a href="common%20time">common time</a> (4/4).

The text of the first movement, "" (Jesus gathered the Twelve to Himself) is a quotation of two verses from the prescribed Gospel for the Sunday (). The movement is a scene with different actors, narrated by the <a href="Evangelist%20%28Bach%29">Evangelist</a> (tenor), in which Jesus (bass, as the or voice of Christ) and his disciples (the chorus) interact. An "ever-ascending" instrumental "evokes the image of the road of suffering embodied by going up to Jerusalem". The Evangelist begins the narration (). Jesus announces his future suffering in Jerusalem, "" ("Behold, we go up to Jerusalem"). He sings, while the ritornello is played several times. After another repeat of the ritornello as an interlude, a choral <a href="fugue">fugue</a> illustrates the reaction of the disciples, following verse 34 from the Gospel (): "" ("However they understood nothing"). The voices are first accompanied only by the continuo, then doubled by the other instruments. Bach marks the voices in the <a href="autograph">autograph</a> score as "concertists" for the first section and "ripienists" when the instruments come in.
The movement is concluded by an instrumental <a href="postlude">postlude</a>. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes that the fugue deviates from the "traditional alternating of <a href="tonic%20%28music%29">tonic</a> and <a href="dominant%20%28music%29">dominant</a> entries ... as a rather abstruse indication of the lack of clarity and expectation amongst the disciples, Bach is hinting at this in musical terms by having each voice enter on a different note, B-flat, F, C and G and briefly touching upon various related keys. The music is, as always, lucid and focussed but the departure from traditional fugal procedure sends a fleeting message to those who appreciate the subtleties of the musical processes".

The musicologist Richard D. P. Jones points out that "the biblical narrative is set as a dramatic worthy of the <a href="Passions%20%28Bach%29">Bach Passions</a>" and that the "vivid drama of that movement has no real counterpart in Bach's Cycle I cantatas."

In the first aria, "" ("My Jesus, draw me after You"), the alto voice is accompanied by an <a href="obbligato">obbligato</a> oboe, which expressively intensifies the text.
An aria is, according to <a href="Johann%20Mattheson">Johann Mattheson</a> in "Der vollkommene Capellmeister" (Part II, chapter 13, paragraph 10), "correctly described as a well-composed song, which has its own particular key and meter, is usually divided into two parts, and concisely expresses a great affection. Occasionally it closes with a repetition of the first part, occasionally without it."

In this aria, an individual believer requests Jesus to make him follow, even without comprehending where and why. Mincham observes a mood or <a href="affekt">affekt</a> of "deep involvement and pensive commitment", with the oboe creating "an aura of suffering and a sense of struggling and reaching upwards in search of something indefinable in a way that only music can suggest."

The recitative "" ("My Jesus, draw me, then I will run") is not a simple <a href="secco%20recitative">secco recitative</a>, but is accompanied by the strings and leans towards an <a href="arioso">arioso</a>, especially near the end. It is the first movement in a <a href="major%20mode">major mode</a>, and illustrates in rapid runs the motion and the running mentioned.

The second aria, "" ("My all in all, my eternal good"), again with strings, is a dance-like movement in free da capo form, A B A'. The unusually long text, of four lines for the A section and two for the B section, results in Bach's solution to repeat the end of the first line (my eternal good) after all text of A, and then after the middle section B repeat only the first line as A', thus ending A and A' the same way. In this modified repeat, the voice holds a long note on the word "" ("peace"), after which the same theme appears in the orchestra and again in the continuo. The musicologist Tadashi Isoyama notes the <a href="passepied">passepied</a> character of the music, reminiscent of secular Köthen cantatas. Mincham describes: "Bach's expression of the joy of union with Christ can often seem quite worldly and uninhibited", and summarises: "The 3/8 time signature, symmetrical phrasing and rapid string skirls combine to create a sense of a dance of abandonment."

The closing chorale is "" ("Kill us through your goodness" or "Us mortify through kindness"), the fifth stanza of Elisabeth Cruciger's "". Its melody is based on one from Wolflein Lochamer's "Lochamer-Liederbuch", printed in <a href="N%C3%BCrnberg">Nürnberg</a> around 1455. It first appears as a sacred tune in <a href="Johann%20Walter">Johann Walter</a>'s Wittenberg hymnal (1524).

The usual four-part setting of the voices is brightened by continuous runs of the oboe and violin I. Isoyama thinks that Bach may have intentionally imitated the style of his predecessor <a href="Johann%20Kuhnau">Johann Kuhnau</a> in the "elegantly flowing obbligato for oboe and first violin". <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a> describes the movement's bass line as a "<a href="walking%20bass">walking bass</a> as a symbol of the disciples' journey to fulfilment. Mincham comments that Bach "chose to maintain the established mood of buoyancy and optimism with a chorale arrangement of almost unparalleled energy and gaiety" and concludes:

Jones summarises: "The audition cantatas ... show Bach feeling his way towards a compromise between the progressive, opera-influenced and the conservative, ecclesiastical styles." He acknowledges the standard BWV 22 sets for later church cantatas: Isoyama points out: "BWV 22 incorporates dance rhythms, and is written with a modern elegance." Mincham interprets Bach's approach in both audition works as "a fair example of the range of music which is suitable for worship and from which others might learn", explaining the "sheer range of forms and musical expression in these two cantatas".
Gardiner, who conducted the <a href="Bach%20Cantata%20Pilgrimage">Bach Cantata Pilgrimage</a> with the <a href="Monteverdi%20Choir">Monteverdi Choir</a> and wrote a diary on the project, comments on the disciples' reaction ("and they understood none of these things, neither knew they the things which were spoken"): 
The entries of the following table follow the selection on the Bach Cantatas Website. Ensembles playing period instruments in <a href="historically%20informed%20performance">historically informed performance</a> are marked by green background.

In the 1930s <a href="Harriet%20Cohen">Harriet Cohen</a>'s piano arrangement of the cantata's closing chorale was published by <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> under the title "Sanctify us by the goodness".

Microsoft Security Essentials

Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is <a href="antivirus%20software">antivirus software</a> (AV) that provides protection against different types of <a href="malicious%20software">malicious software</a>, such as <a href="computer%20virus">computer virus</a>es, <a href="spyware">spyware</a>, <a href="rootkit">rootkit</a>s, and <a href="Trojan%20horse%20%28computing%29">trojan horses</a>. Prior to version 4.5, MSE ran on , <a href="Windows%20Vista">Windows Vista</a>, and <a href="Windows%207">Windows 7</a>, but not on <a href="Windows%208">Windows 8</a> and later, which have built-in AV components known as <a href="Windows%20Defender">Windows Defender</a>. MSE 4.5 and later versions do not run on Windows XP. The <a href="end-user%20license%20agreement">license agreement</a> allows home users and small businesses to install and use the product <a href="freeware">free-of-charge</a>. It replaces <a href="Windows%20Live%20OneCare">Windows Live OneCare</a>, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free <a href="Windows%20Defender">Windows Defender</a>, which only protected users from spyware until Windows8.

Built upon the same scanning engine and virus definitions as other Microsoft antivirus products, it provides real-time protection, constantly monitoring activities on the computer, scanning new files as they are created or downloaded, and disabling detected threats. It lacks the OneCare <a href="personal%20firewall">personal firewall</a> and the <a href="Forefront%20Endpoint%20Protection">Forefront Endpoint Protection</a> centralized management features.

Microsoft's announcement of its own AV software on November 18, 2008 was met with mixed reactions from the AV industry. <a href="Symantec">Symantec</a>, <a href="McAfee">McAfee</a> and <a href="Kaspersky%20Lab">Kaspersky Lab</a>—three competing <a href="independent%20software%20vendor">independent software vendor</a>s—dismissed it as an unworthy competitor, but <a href="AVG%20Technologies">AVG Technologies</a> and <a href="Avast%20Software">Avast Software</a> appreciated its potential to expand the consumers' choice of AV software. AVG, McAfee, <a href="Sophos">Sophos</a> and <a href="Trend%20Micro">Trend Micro</a> claimed that the integration of the product into Microsoft Windows would be a violation of <a href="competition%20law">competition law</a>.

The product received generally positive reviews praising its <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a>, low resource usage and freeware license. It secured <a href="AV-TEST">AV-TEST</a> certification in October 2009, having demonstrated its ability to eliminate all widely encountered malware. It lost that certification in October 2012; in June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. However, Microsoft significantly improved this product during the couple of years preceding February 2018, when MSE achieved AV-TEST's "Top Product" award after detecting 100% of the samples used during its test. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist <a href="OPSWAT">OPSWAT</a>, MSE was the most popular AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several <a href="rogue%20antivirus">rogue antivirus</a> programs that try to impersonate it.

Microsoft Security Essentials automatically checks and downloads the latest virus definitions from <a href="Microsoft%20Update">Microsoft Update</a> which is updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On September 30, 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag <a href="Google%20Chrome">Google Chrome</a> as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on <a href="Windows%20XP">Windows XP</a>, <a href="Windows%20Vista">Windows Vista</a> and <a href="Windows%207">Windows 7</a>, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing automatic definition updates for Windows XP on July 14, 2015 (however, manual definition updates are still available for Windows XP users who run older versions of MSE).

MSE is built upon the same foundation as other Microsoft security products; they all use the same anti-malware engine known as "Microsoft Malware Protection Engine" ("MSMPENG") and <a href="virus%20definition">virus definition</a>s. It does not have the <a href="personal%20firewall">personal firewall</a> component of OneCare and the centralized management features of <a href="Microsoft%20Forefront">Forefront Endpoint Protection</a>.

MSE provides <a href="real-time%20protection">real-time protection</a>, constantly monitoring activities on the computer, scanning new files as they are created or downloaded from the Internet. It quarantines detected threats and prompts for user input on how to deal with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create <a href="System%20Restore">System Restore</a> checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, formerly <a href="Microsoft%20SpyNet">Microsoft SpyNet</a>) by default. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition will be downloaded to remove the threat.

Hardware requirements for the product depend on the <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>; on a computer running Windows Vista or Windows 7, it requires a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, a <a href="computer%20monitor">computer monitor</a> with a <a href="display%20resolution">display resolution</a> of at least 800 × 600 <a href="pixel">pixel</a>s, 200MB of free <a href="hard%20disk">hard disk</a> space and a stable Internet connection.

On November 18, 2008, Microsoft announced plans for a free consumer security product, <a href="List%20of%20Microsoft%20codenames">codenamed</a> "Morro". This development marked a change in Microsoft's consumer AV marketing strategy: instead of offering a subscription-based security product with a host of other tools, such as <a href="backup">backup</a> and a <a href="personal%20firewall">personal firewall</a>, "Morro" would offer free AV protection with a smaller impact on system resources. Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, announced that "Morro" would not directly compete with other commercial AV software; rather it was focused on the 50 to 60 percent of PC users who did not have or would not pay for AV protection. By 17 June 2009, the official name of "Morro" was revealed: Microsoft Security Essentials.

On June 23, 2009, Microsoft released a <a href="Betaware">public beta</a> to 75,000 users in the United States, Israel, China and Brazil. Anticipated to be available in 20 markets and 10 languages, the product was scheduled for release before the end of 2009; the <a href="Release%20to%20manufacturing">final build</a> was released on 29 September 2009.

Almost a year after the initial release, Microsoft quietly released the second <a href="software%20versioning">version</a>. It entered the <a href="technical%20preview">technical preview</a> stage on July 19, 2010, and the final build was released on December 16, 2010. It includes "Network Inspection System" (NIS), a <a href="network%20intrusion%20detection%20system">network intrusion detection system</a> that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs <a href="Heuristics%23Computer%20science">heuristics</a> in malware detection. Version 2.0 integrates with Internet Explorer to protect users against web-based threats. NIS requires a separate set of definition updates.

Sixteen months after the release of version 2.0, Microsoft skipped version 3.0 and released Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0. A public beta program started on November 18, 2011, when Microsoft sent out invitations to potential participants without announcing a version number. The first beta version was released on November 29, 2011, and the final build on 24 April 2012. Microsoft subsequently initiated a pre-release program that provides volunteers with the latest beta version and accepts feedback.

On February 21, 2014, version 4.5 entered beta stage. On the same day, Microsoft announced that starting with this version, Windows XP would not be supported. Older versions would continue to receive automatic virus definition updates until July 14, 2015 (afterwards the users of older versions may continue to manually update definitions using Microsoft's site).

The latest version of 4.10 was released on November 29, 2016. It was version 4.10.209.0 for Windows Vista and Windows 7. This update fixes a bug that was introduced earlier in version 4.10.205.0 which removed the “Scan with Microsoft Security Essentials" entry from the right-click context menu on files and folders.

Support for MSE has officially ended for Windows Vista and Windows XP . Older versions still function on those systems and definition updates remain available. It is still supported on Windows 7 until January 14, 2020. 

Microsoft Security Essentials does not run on Windows 8 and later, which has its own security subsystem, Windows Defender. On September 13, 2011, at the <a href="Build%20%28developer%20conference%29">Build conference</a> in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim, California</a>, Microsoft unveiled the developer preview of Windows 8, which had a security component capable of preventing an infected <a href="USB%20flash%20memory">USB flash memory</a> from compromising the system during the boot process. On September 15, Windows 8 developer's blog confirmed that Windows Defender in Windows 8 would take over the role of virus protection. In an included video, Jason Garms of Microsoft showed how Windows Defender is registered with <a href="Action%20Center">Action Center</a> as an AV and spyware protection tool, and how it blocks drive-by malware. On March 3, 2012, "<a href="Softpedia">Softpedia</a>" reviewed the <a href="betaware">consumer preview</a> of Windows 8 and noted the similarity in appearance of Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0 Beta. According to "Softpedia", Windows 8 Setup requires Microsoft Security Essentials to be uninstalled before upgrading Windows 7.

The product's <a href="license%20agreement">license agreement</a> allows home users to download, install and use it on an unlimited number of computers in their households free of charge, as long as each computer has a legitimately licensed copy of Microsoft Windows. Since October 2010, small businesses have also been allowed to install the product on up to 10 devices, but use in academic institutions and governmental locations is forbidden, as is reverse-engineering, decompiling or disassembling the product or working around its designed limitations.

MSE requires no registration or personal information to be submitted during installation; however, the validity of the operating system's license is verified during and after installation using the <a href="Windows%20Genuine%20Advantage">Windows Genuine Advantage</a> system. If said license is found to be invalid, the software will notify the user and will cease to operate after a period of time.

The announcement and debut of Microsoft Security Essentials was met with mixed responses from the AV industry. <a href="Symantec">Symantec</a>, <a href="McAfee">McAfee</a> and <a href="Kaspersky%20Lab">Kaspersky Lab</a>, three competing vendors, claimed it to be inferior to their own software. Jens Meggers, Symantec's vice president of engineering for Norton products, dismissed it as "very average – nothing outstanding". Tom Powledge of Symantec urged his customers to be mindful of what protection they chose, bearing in mind that OneCare offered "substandard protection" and an "inferior user experience". Joris Evers, director of worldwide public relations for McAfee stated "with OneCare's market share of less than 2%, we understand Microsoft's decision to shift attention to their core business." Justin Priestley of Kaspersky stated that Microsoft "continued to hold a very low market share in the consumer market, and we don't expect the exit of OneCare to change the playing field drastically."

<a href="Avast%20Software">Avast Software</a> said that it had an ambivalent view towards the product. Vincent Steckler, Avast Software CEO said "MSE is not the silver bullet but it is also not the bad sequel to One Care that some claim." A representative of <a href="AVG%20Technologies">AVG Technologies</a> stated, "We view this as a positive step for the AV landscape. AVG has believed in the right to free antivirus software for the past eight years." However, AVG raised the issue of distributing the software product and said, "Microsoft will have to do more than simply make the product available," adding that integration of Microsoft Security Essentials with <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> would be a violation of <a href="competition%20law">competition law</a>. McAfee, <a href="Sophos">Sophos</a> and later <a href="Trend%20Micro">Trend Micro</a> affirmed that an antitrust lawsuit would surely have followed if Microsoft had bundled the product with Windows.

The announcement of Microsoft Security Essentials affected the <a href="stock">stock</a>s of AV vendors. On November 19, 2008, after Microsoft announced codename "Morro", Symantec and McAfee <a href="share%20%28finance%29">shares</a> fell 9.44 and 6.62 percent respectively. On 10 June 2009, after announcing an upcoming beta version, Microsoft shares rose 2.1 percent. Symantec and McAfee shares, however, fell 0.5 and 1.3 percent respectively. Daniel Ives, an analyst with <a href="FBR%20Capital%20Markets">FBR Capital Markets</a>, said that Microsoft Security Essentials would be a "long-term competitive threat", although near-term impact would be negligible.

The public beta version received several reviews, citing its low resource usage, straightforward <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a> and <a href="price%20point">price point</a>. <a href="Brian%20Krebs">Brian Krebs</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" reported that a quick scan on a <a href="Windows%207">Windows 7</a> computer took about 10 minutes and a full scan about 45 minutes. <a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a> reviewed it positively, citing its organized interface, low resource usage, and its status as <a href="freeware">freeware</a>.

Nick Mediati of "<a href="PCWorld%20%28magazine%29">PCWorld</a>" noted MSE's "clear-cut" and "cleanly designed" tabbed <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a>. He did, however, find some of the settings to be cryptic and confusing, defaulting to "recommended action", with the only explanation of what that action is to be found in the help file. He was also initially confused because the user interface failed to mention that Microsoft Security Essentials automatically updates itself, rather than having to be manually updated via the "Update" tab; an explanation of this feature was included in the final release.

Neil Rubenking of "<a href="PC%20Magazine">PC Magazine</a>" successfully installed the beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, depending on the operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets <a href="Windows%20Update">Windows Update</a> into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through <a href="Control%20Panel%20%28Windows%29">Windows Control Panel</a>. Some full scans took more than an hour on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of <a href="rootkits">rootkits</a>, but only half of the <a href="scareware">scareware</a> samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.

On 7 January 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials won the "Best Free Software" award from "<a href="PC%20Advisor">PC Advisor</a>". In December the same year, it secured the "Bronze" award from "<a href="AV-Comparatives">AV-Comparatives</a>" for proactive detection of 55 percent of new or unknown malware, the Silver award for low false-positives (six occurrences) and the Bronze award for overall performance.

In October 2009, <a href="AV-TEST">AV-TEST</a> conducted a series of trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 <a href="computer%20virus">computer virus</a>es, <a href="computer%20worms">computer worms</a> and <a href="Trojan%20horse%20%28computing%29">software Trojan horses</a> as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 <a href="spyware">spyware</a> and <a href="adware">adware</a> samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no <a href="false-positive">false-positive</a>s. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified on March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a usability score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks <a href="personal%20firewall">personal firewall</a> and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability. In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and usability.

In AV-TEST's 2011 annual review, Microsoft Security Essentials came last in protection, seventh in repair and fifth in usability. In the 2012 review, it came last in protection and best in usability; however, having lost its certificate, it was not qualified for the usability award. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. 

Microsoft has drastically improved MSE's detection over time and in the very latest tests done by AV-TEST during February 2018 MSE has achieved 100% detection of all malware samples in both the "Protection against 0-day malware attacks, inclusive of web and e-mail threats (Real-World Testing)" and "Detection of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last 4 weeks (the AV-TEST reference set)" categories, earning it AV-TESTS's "Top Product" award.

On 29 September 2010, a year after its initial release, Microsoft announced that MSE had more than 30 million users. The "Security Industry Market Share Analysis" report of June 2011, published by OPSWAT, describes it as one of the most popular AV products in the world, with 10.66 percent of the global market and 15.68 percent of the North American market. The same report shows Microsoft as the number one AV vendor in North America with 17.07 percent market share, and the number four AV vendor worldwide.

John Dunn of "PCWorld", who analyzed the report, noted that the tendency to use free AV software is something new: "After all, free antivirus suites have been around for years but have tended to be seen as the poor relations to paid software." He named Microsoft Security Essentials as an influence on PC users to adopt free AV software.

A September 2011 OPSWAT report found that MSE had further increased its market share to become the second most popular AV product in the world, and remained the most popular in North America. OPSWAT reported in March 2012 that the product had maintained its position, and that Microsoft's market share had improved by 2 percent worldwide and 3 percent in North America. Seth Rosenblatt of "CNET News" commented on how the product's share rose from 7.27 in 2010 to 10.08 in 2012, stating that "use of the lightweight security suite exploded last year".

The popularity of Microsoft Security Essentials has led to the appearance of malware abusing its name. In February 2010, a <a href="rogue%20security%20software">rogue security package</a> calling itself "Security Essentials 2010" appeared on the Internet. Designated "TrojanDownloader:Win32/Fakeinit" by Microsoft, it bears no visual resemblance to the Microsoft product. It reappeared in November 2010, this time calling itself "Security Essentials 2011". A more dangerous rogue appeared in August 2010. Designated "Rogue:Win32/FakePAV" or "Unknown Win32/Trojan", it closely resembles Microsoft Security Essentials and uses sophisticated <a href="social%20engineering%20%28security%29">social engineering</a> to deceive users and infect their systems, under the guise of five different fictional anti-malware products. It also terminates and prevents the launch of 156 different programs, including <a href="Registry%20Editor">Registry Editor</a>, <a href="Windows%20Command%20Prompt">Windows Command Prompt</a>, <a href="Internet%20Explorer">Internet Explorer</a>, <a href="Mozilla%20Firefox">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="Opera%20%28web%20browser%29">Opera</a>, <a href="Safari%20%28web%20browser%29">Safari</a>, and <a href="Google%20Chrome">Google Chrome</a>.

Sadie Harris

Sadie Harris is a fictional character from the American television <a href="medical%20drama">medical drama</a> "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>", which airs on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer <a href="Shonda%20Rhimes">Shonda Rhimes</a> and portrayed by actress <a href="Melissa%20George">Melissa George</a>. Introduced as a <a href="Internship%20%28medicine%29">surgical intern</a> who has an old companionship with the series' protagonist <a href="Meredith%20Grey">Meredith Grey</a> (<a href="Ellen%20Pompeo">Ellen Pompeo</a>), she eventually forms a friendship with <a href="Lexie%20Grey">Lexie Grey</a> (<a href="Chyler%20Leigh">Chyler Leigh</a>), and departs after it is revealed she cheated her way into the surgical program.

George was invited to meet with "Grey's Anatomy" executive producers after the show's casting agents saw her in the 2008 television drama, "<a href="In%20Treatment%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">In Treatment</a>". The actress' original contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances in <a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy%20%28season%205%29">season five</a>, with the possibility of becoming a series regular. She was originally planned to be a romantic foil for <a href="Erica%20Hahn">Erica Hahn</a> (<a href="Brooke%20Smith%20%28actress%29">Brooke Smith</a>) and <a href="Callie%20Torres">Callie Torres</a> (<a href="Sara%20Ramirez">Sara Ramirez</a>), but the role was retooled after the former departed in November 2008.

After speculation as to whether the character would become a series regular, it was confirmed that George's character would not be joining the series and would soon depart. George explained that it was her own decision to leave the show, in response to the assertions that her departure was done to "de-gay" "Grey's Anatomy". The character has received mixed feedback from critics, and has been characterized as "naughty", "mischievous", and "nutty".

Sadie Harris first appears in the <a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy%20%28season%205%29">season five</a> episode "These Ties That Bind", in which it is made known that she was once a very close friend of <a href="Meredith%20Grey">Meredith Grey</a> (<a href="Ellen%20Pompeo">Ellen Pompeo</a>). Harris and Meredith Grey had given each other nicknames during an extended vacation in Europe: "Die" and "Death", respectively. Meredith Grey's best friend is <a href="Cristina%20Yang">Cristina Yang</a> (<a href="Sandra%20Oh">Sandra Oh</a>); Yang becomes jealous of the friendship between Meredith Grey and Harris. Having joined Seattle Grace Hospital as a <a href="Internship%20%28medicine%29">surgical intern</a>, Harris begins a friendship with fellow intern <a href="Lexie%20Grey">Lexie Grey</a> (<a href="Chyler%20Leigh">Chyler Leigh</a>), Meredith Grey's sister. The hospital's interns are frustrated with their lack of surgical opportunities, so Harris cuts her own shoulder and then lets the interns stitch it back together.

Harris later volunteers herself to have an <a href="appendectomy">appendectomy</a> to help the interns learn that surgical procedure, on the condition that she gets a chance to perform one afterwards. The interns make a mistake in the surgery, and Harris is seriously endangered, but is rescued by the <a href="Residency%20%28medicine%29">residents</a>. The interns are put on probation and rebuked by Meredith Grey, although Harris tells Lexie Grey that she is not apologetic. Following the surgery fiasco, Harris approaches the hospital's chief of surgery <a href="Richard%20Webber">Richard Webber</a> (<a href="James%20Pickens%2C%20Jr.">James Pickens, Jr.</a>), and claims responsibility for the incident. He informs her that the reason she has not been fired is because of his personal friendship with her father.

Later, she flirts with <a href="Callie%20Torres">Callie Torres</a> (<a href="Sara%20Ramirez">Sara Ramirez</a>), although the relationship is never pursued. Harris continues to pursue a friendship with Lexie Grey, even going as far as to help her cover up Lexie Grey's blooming relationship with <a href="Mark%20Sloan%20%28Grey%27s%20Anatomy%29">Mark Sloan</a> (<a href="Eric%20Dane">Eric Dane</a>). In "Before and After", during a competition among the interns set up by <a href="Izzie%20Stevens">Izzie Stevens</a> (<a href="Katherine%20Heigl">Katherine Heigl</a>), <a href="George%20O%27Malley">George O'Malley</a> (<a href="T.R.%20Knight">T.R. Knight</a>) notices Harris' lack of medical knowledge. Although he offers to tutor Harris, she declines and chooses not to tell Webber, which O'Malley does instead. When Harris comes out from a talk with Webber, she tells Meredith Grey that she has decided to quit, and that she did not qualify for the surgical program. When she tries to get Meredith Grey to go back to vacationing in Europe, Meredith Grey declines and Harris departs.

<a href="Melissa%20George">Melissa George</a> received an invitation to meet the show's executive producers, <a href="Shonda%20Rhimes">Shonda Rhimes</a> and <a href="Betsy%20Beers">Betsy Beers</a>, from "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>" casting agents after they saw her recurring guest performances in the television drama "<a href="In%20Treatment%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">In Treatment</a>" (2008). George explained that after meeting with the producers, she was set to begin working.

George's initial contract included eight to eleven episodes of recurring appearances, with the possibility of becoming a series regular. However, according to George's representative, she did not intend to do more than eight episodes. Harris was first planned to have a romance with Torres, but Rhimes eventually changed that after George started filming. She was initially written as a lesbian, but was revised as bisexual.

In January 2009, George confirmed her departure from "Grey's Anatomy", and several reasons were cited for her leaving. George said she had decided to leave to pursue another project, and offered praise to the cast members. However, a representative of the show claimed the actress' departure was due to a mutual agreement between "Grey's Anatomy" and George, explaining that the character's storyline "came to a natural end", but that everyone was upset with her departure. Following <a href="Erica%20Hahn">Erica Hahn</a> (<a href="Brooke%20Smith%20%28actress%29">Brooke Smith</a>)'s departure, "<a href="E%21%20Online">E! Online</a>" <a href="Kristin%20Dos%20Santos">Kristin Dos Santos</a> asserted that Smith's dismissal from the show, and the rewrite of Harris' storyline, was enforced by the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC), as part of an attempt to "de-gay" "Grey's Anatomy", but these claims were rebuked by Rhimes.

George's character has been described as "naughty" and "mischievous", as well as "nutty". She added that Harris' sexuality is not the main aspect of her personality. George called her character "broken", and opined that her outgoing personality is meant to cover up something else. George stated that the way she portrayed Harris was influenced by the outspokenness of Lisa Rowe, a <a href="Psychopathy">sociopathic</a> character from "<a href="Girl%2C%20Interrupted%20%28film%29">Girl, Interrupted</a>" (1999) played by <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>.

Peter Nowalk, one of the show's writers, characterized Harris as "quite a flirty gal". Other "Grey's Anatomy" cast members have also commented on the character of Harris; <a href="Chandra%20Wilson">Chandra Wilson</a> stated that Harris is fast-paced, whereas Leigh said that the character is there to "wreak havoc on Seattle Grace". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" <a href="Michael%20Ausiello">Michael Ausiello</a> said that Harris is "an intern with an open mind towards sexuality".

Debbie Chang, writing for <a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a>, and Jonathan Toomey of "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" also cast ideas about Harris' self-incision in the episode "In the Midnight Hour", wondering if she "has a death wish" and "what is wrong with her". Stacy McKee, a primary writer for the show, said Harris is Meredith Grey's "pre-Cristina Cristina" and that she shares "a history with Meredith that Cristina can't".

Throughout her run on "Grey's Anatomy", the character received mixed feedback among critics. Jon Caramanica of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" was critical of her character development, calling George "woefully misused". Writing for "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>", Michael Idato opined that the storyline between Harris and Yang was "frosty", adding that the writing was in a "true soap fashion".

Darren Devlyn of the "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" wondered if the producers brought in George to "shake up the show", and found the character's bisexual storyline similar to Hahn's. Speaking of George's exit, Kris De Leon of BuddyTV noted that she departed on the "best of terms" in comparison with <a href="Isaiah%20Washington">Isaiah Washington</a> (<a href="Preston%20Burke">Preston Burke</a>), Smith, and Knight—former cast members who had "rocky" exits.

Erin McWhirter of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" called George's character "outrageous" in response to the appendectomy. Former "<a href="Star-Ledger">Star-Ledger</a>" editor <a href="Alan%20Sepinwall">Alan Sepinwall</a> was critical of the character, saying he rolled his eyes in regard to her letting the interns perform procedures on her, sarcastically writing: "Ooooh, she's damaged! And sexy! She takes off her top and then eagerly cuts herself for the other interns! That's hot!" "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" Erin Lulevitch referred to her as a "masochist" due to her self-incision.

Scott Ellis of "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" enjoyed the character, calling her "intriguing". "Entertainment Weekly" Jennifer Armstrong enjoyed Harris in "Sympathy for the Devil", finding it "sweet" when she took the blame for causing Sloan's <a href="penile%20fracture">penile fracture</a>, to avoid Lexie Grey being embarrassed. Chang of BuddyTV claimed that Harris is "kind of a rebel", and the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" Lauren Johnston deemed her personality "brash".

Yttrium

Yttrium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Y and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 39. It is a silvery-metallic <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a> chemically similar to the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s and has often been classified as a "<a href="rare-earth%20element">rare-earth element</a>". Yttrium is almost always found in combination with lanthanide elements in <a href="rare-earth%20mineral">rare-earth mineral</a>s, and is never found in nature as a free element. Y is the only stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, and the only isotope found in the <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">Earth's crust</a>.

In 1787, <a href="Carl%20Axel%20Arrhenius">Carl Axel Arrhenius</a> found a new mineral near <a href="Ytterby">Ytterby</a> in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and named it "<a href="gadolinite">ytterbite</a>", after the village. <a href="Johan%20Gadolin">Johan Gadolin</a> discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and <a href="Anders%20Gustaf%20Ekeberg">Anders Gustaf Ekeberg</a> named the new <a href="oxide">oxide</a> "<a href="yttria">yttria</a>". Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a>.

The most important uses of yttrium are <a href="LED">LED</a>s and <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a>s, particularly the red phosphors in television set <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a> (CRT) displays. Yttrium is also used in the production of <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s, <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>s, <a href="electronic%20filters">electronic filters</a>, <a href="laser">laser</a>s, <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a>s, various medical applications, and <a href="Trace%20element">tracing</a> various materials to enhance their properties.

Yttrium has no known <a href="Biology">biological</a> role. Exposure to yttrium compounds can cause <a href="Respiratory%20disease">lung disease</a> in humans.

Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a> in <a href="group%203%20element">group 3</a>. As expected by <a href="periodic%20trend">periodic trend</a>s, it is less <a href="electronegativity">electronegative</a> than its predecessor in the group, <a href="scandium">scandium</a>, and less electronegative than the next member of <a href="period%205%20element">period 5</a>, <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>; additionally, it is more electronegative to its successor in its group, <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a>, surpassing in electronegativity to the later <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s due to the <a href="lanthanide%20contraction">lanthanide contraction</a>. Yttrium is the first <a href="d-block">d-block</a> element in the fifth period.

The pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form, due to <a href="Passivation%20%28chemistry%29">passivation</a> of a protective oxide () film that forms on the surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10 <a href="micrometre">µm</a> when yttrium is heated to 750 °<a href="Celsius">C</a> in <a href="water%20vapor">water vapor</a>. When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or <a href="swarf">turnings</a> of the metal can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400 °C. <a href="Yttrium%20nitride">Yttrium nitride</a> (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000 °C in <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>.

The similarities of yttrium to the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s are so strong that the element has historically been grouped with them as a <a href="rare-earth%20element">rare-earth element</a>, and is always found in nature together with them in <a href="rare-earth%20mineral">rare-earth mineral</a>s. Chemically, yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, <a href="scandium">scandium</a>, and if physical properties were plotted against <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>, it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides <a href="gadolinium">gadolinium</a> and <a href="erbium">erbium</a>.

It often also falls in the same range for reaction order, resembling <a href="terbium">terbium</a> and <a href="dysprosium">dysprosium</a> in its chemical reactivity. Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves as if it were one of them. Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the <a href="lanthanide%20contraction">lanthanide contraction</a>.

One of the few notable differences between the chemistry of yttrium and that of the lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively <a href="valency%20%28chemistry%29">trivalent</a>, whereas about half the lanthanides can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen lanthanides are these other valences important in aqueous solution (<a href="cerium">Ce</a>, <a href="samarium">Sm</a>, <a href="europium">Eu</a>, and <a href="ytterbium">Yb</a>).

As a trivalent transition metal, yttrium forms various <a href="inorganic%20chemistry">inorganic compounds</a>, generally in the oxidation state of +3, by giving up all three of its <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s. A good example is <a href="yttrium%28III%29%20oxide">yttrium(III) oxide</a> (), also known as yttria, a six-<a href="coordinate%20covalent%20bond">coordinate</a> white solid.

Yttrium forms a water-insoluble <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a>, <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a>, and <a href="oxalate">oxalate</a>, but its <a href="bromide">bromide</a>, <a href="chloride">chloride</a>, <a href="iodide">iodide</a>, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a> and <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a> are all <a href="solubility">soluble</a> in water. The Y <a href="ion">ion</a> is colorless in solution because of the absence of electrons in the d and f <a href="electron%20shell">electron shell</a>s.

<a href="Water">Water</a> readily reacts with yttrium and its compounds to form . Concentrated <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric</a> and <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a>s do not rapidly attack yttrium, but other strong acids do.

With <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s, yttrium forms <a href="halide">trihalides</a> such as <a href="yttrium%28III%29%20fluoride">yttrium(III) fluoride</a> (), <a href="yttrium%28III%29%20chloride">yttrium(III) chloride</a> (), and <a href="yttrium%28III%29%20bromide">yttrium(III) bromide</a> () at temperatures above roughly 200 °C. Similarly, <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, <a href="silicon">silicon</a> and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> all form <a href="binary%20compound">binary compound</a>s with yttrium at elevated temperatures.

<a href="Organoyttrium%20chemistry">Organoyttrium chemistry</a> is the study of compounds containing carbon–yttrium bonds. A few of these are known to have yttrium in the oxidation state 0. (The +2 state has been observed in chloride melts, and +1 in oxide clusters in the gas phase.) Some <a href="trimerization">trimerization</a> reactions were generated with organoyttrium compounds as catalysts. These syntheses use as a starting material, obtained from and concentrated <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> and <a href="ammonium%20chloride">ammonium chloride</a>.

<a href="Hapticity">Hapticity</a> is a term to describe the coordination of a group of contiguous atoms of a <a href="ligand">ligand</a> bound to the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character "eta", η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where <a href="carborane">carboranyl</a> ligands were bound to a d-metal center through a η-hapticity. Vaporization of the <a href="graphite%20intercalation%20compound">graphite intercalation compound</a>s graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of <a href="endohedral%20fullerene">endohedral fullerene</a>s such as Y@C. <a href="Electron%20spin%20resonance">Electron spin resonance</a> studies indicated the formation of Y and (C) ion pairs. The <a href="carbide">carbide</a>s YC, YC, and YC can be hydrolyzed to form <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s.

Yttrium in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> was created through <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>, mostly by the <a href="s-process">s-process</a> (≈72%), but also by the <a href="r-process">r-process</a> (≈28%). The r-process consists of rapid <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> of lighter elements during <a href="supernova">supernova</a> explosions. The s-process is a slow <a href="neutron">neutron</a> capture of lighter elements inside pulsating <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> stars.
Yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> of uranium in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In the context of <a href="nuclear%20waste">nuclear waste</a> management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are Y and Y, with half-lives of 58.51 days and 64 hours, respectively. Though Y has a short half-life, it exists in <a href="secular%20equilibrium">secular equilibrium</a> with its long-lived parent isotope, <a href="strontium-90">strontium-90</a> (Sr) with a half-life of 29 years.

All group 3 elements have an odd <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>, and therefore few stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s. <a href="Scandium">Scandium</a> has one <a href="stable%20isotope">stable isotope</a>, and yttrium itself has only one stable isotope, Y, which is also the only isotope that occurs naturally. However, the lanthanide <a href="rare%20earths">rare earths</a> contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 is thought to be more abundant than it otherwise would be, due in part to the s-process, which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by <a href="beta%20decay">electron emission</a> (neutron → proton). Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with <a href="atomic%20mass%20number">atomic mass number</a>s (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nuclei</a> with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively. Y has a mass number close to 90 and has 50 neutrons in its nucleus.

At least 32 synthetic isotopes of yttrium have been observed, and these range in <a href="atomic%20mass%20number">atomic mass number</a> from 76 to 108. The least stable of these is Y with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of >150 <a href="SI%20prefix">ns</a> (Y has a half-life of >200 ns) and the most stable is Y with a half-life of 106.626 days. Apart from the isotopes Y, Y, and Y, with half-lives of 58.51 days, 79.8 hours, and 64 hours, respectively, all the other isotopes have half-lives of less than a day and most of less than an hour.

Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or below 88 decay primarily by <a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a> (proton → neutron) to form <a href="strontium">strontium</a> (<a href="atomic%20number">Z</a> = 38) isotopes. Yttrium isotopes with mass numbers at or above 90 decay primarily by electron emission (neutron → proton) to form <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a> (Z = 40) isotopes. Isotopes with mass numbers at or above 97 are also known to have minor decay paths of β delayed <a href="neutron%20emission">neutron emission</a>.

Yttrium has at least 20 <a href="metastable%20isomer">metastable ("excited") isomers</a> ranging in mass number from 78 to 102. Multiple excitation states have been observed for Y and Y. While most of yttrium's isomers are expected to be less stable than their <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a>, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, Y, and Y have longer half-lives than their ground states, as these isomers decay by beta decay rather than <a href="isomeric%20transition">isomeric transition</a>.

In 1787, army lieutenant and part-time chemist <a href="Carl%20Axel%20Arrhenius">Carl Axel Arrhenius</a> found a heavy black rock in an old quarry near the Swedish village of <a href="Ytterby">Ytterby</a> (now part of the <a href="Stockholm%20Archipelago">Stockholm Archipelago</a>). Thinking that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, he named it "ytterbite" and sent samples to various chemists for analysis.
<a href="Johan%20Gadolin">Johan Gadolin</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20%C3%85bo">University of Åbo</a> identified a new oxide (or "<a href="Earth%20%28chemistry%29">earth</a>") in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794. <a href="Anders%20Gustaf%20Ekeberg">Anders Gustaf Ekeberg</a> confirmed the identification in 1797 and named the new oxide "yttria". In the decades after <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> developed the first modern definition of <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been "yttrium".

In 1843, <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Mosander">Carl Gustaf Mosander</a> found that samples of yttria contained three oxides: white <a href="yttrium%20oxide">yttrium oxide</a> (yttria), yellow <a href="terbium%28III%2CIV%29%20oxide">terbium oxide</a> (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored <a href="erbium%20oxide">erbium oxide</a> (called 'terbia' at the time). A fourth oxide, <a href="ytterbium%20oxide">ytterbium oxide</a>, was isolated in 1878 by <a href="Jean%20Charles%20Galissard%20de%20Marignac">Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac</a>. New elements were later isolated from each of those oxides, and each element was named, in some fashion, after Ytterby, the village near the quarry where they were found (see <a href="ytterbium">ytterbium</a>, <a href="terbium">terbium</a>, and <a href="erbium">erbium</a>). In the following decades, seven other new metals were discovered in "Gadolin's yttria". Since yttria was found to be a mineral and not an oxide, <a href="Martin%20Heinrich%20Klaproth">Martin Heinrich Klaproth</a> renamed it <a href="gadolinite">gadolinite</a> in honor of Gadolin.

<a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a> mistakenly thought he had isolated the metal in 1828 from a volatile chloride he supposed to be yttrium chloride, but <a href="Heinrich%20Rose">Heinrich Rose</a> proved otherwise in 1843 and correctly isolated the element himself that year.

Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol Yt was used for the element, after which Y came into common use.

In 1987, <a href="yttrium%20barium%20copper%20oxide">yttrium barium copper oxide</a> was found to achieve <a href="high-temperature%20superconductivity">high-temperature superconductivity</a>. It was only the second material known to exhibit this property, and it was the first known material to achieve <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a> above the (economically important) boiling point of nitrogen.

Yttrium is found in most <a href="rare-earth%20mineral">rare-earth mineral</a>s, it is found in some <a href="uranium">uranium</a> ores, but is never found in the Earth's crust as a free element. About 31 <a href="Parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> of the Earth's crust is yttrium, making it the 28th most abundant element, 400 times more common than <a href="silver">silver</a>. Yttrium is found in soil in concentrations between 10 and 150 ppm (dry weight average of 23 ppm) and in sea water at 9 <a href="Parts%20per%20trillion">ppt</a>. Lunar rock samples collected during the <a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="Apollo%20Project">Apollo Project</a> have a relatively high content of yttrium.
Yttrium has no known biological role, though it is found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. Normally, as little as 0.5 milligrams is found in the entire human body; human <a href="breast%20milk">breast milk</a> contains 4 ppm. Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20 ppm and 100 ppm (fresh weight), with <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a> having the largest amount. With as much as 700 ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.

"This REY-rich mud has great potential as a rare-earth metal resource because of the enormous amount available and its advantageous mineralogical features," the study reads. The study shows that more than 16 million tons of rare-earth elements could be "exploited in the near future."

Including ytrrium (Y), which is used in products like camera lenses and mobile phone screens, the rare-earth elements found are: Europium (EU), Terbium (Tb) and Dysprosium (Dy).

Since yttrium is chemically so similar to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores (<a href="rare-earth%20mineral">rare-earth mineral</a>s) and is extracted by the same refinement processes. A slight distinction is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but the distinction is not perfect. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group because of its ion size, though it has a lower <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a>.
Rare-earth elements (REEs) come mainly from four sources:

One method for obtaining pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to dissolve the oxide in <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> and fractionate it by <a href="ion%20exchange">ion exchange</a> <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a>. With the addition of <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a>, the yttrium oxalate precipitates. The oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen. By reacting the resulting yttrium oxide with <a href="hydrogen%20fluoride">hydrogen fluoride</a>, <a href="yttrium%20fluoride">yttrium fluoride</a> is obtained. When quaternary ammonium salts are used as extractants, most yttrium will remain in the aqueous phase. When the <a href="Counterion">counter-ion</a> is nitrate, the light lanthanides are removed, and when the counter-ion is thiocyanate, the heavy lanthanides are removed. In this way, yttrium salts of 99.999% purity are obtained. In the usual situation, where yttrium is in a mixture that is two-thirds heavy-lanthanide, yttrium should be removed as soon as possible to facilitate the separation of the remaining elements.

Annual world production of yttrium oxide had reached 600 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s by 2001; by 2014 it had increased to 7,000 tons. Global reserves of yttrium oxide were estimated in 2014 to be more than 500,000 tons. The leading countries for these reserves included Australia, Brazil, China, India, and the United States. Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing <a href="Yttrium%28III%29%20fluoride">yttrium fluoride</a> to a <a href="metal%20sponge">metal sponge</a> with <a href="calcium">calcium</a> <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> alloy. The temperature of an <a href="arc%20furnace">arc furnace</a> of greater than 1,600 °C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.

The red component of <a href="color%20television">color television</a> <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a>s is typically emitted from an <a href="Yttrium%28III%29%20oxide">yttria ()</a> or yttrium oxide sulfide () host lattice <a href="Doping%20%28semiconductor%29">doped</a> with <a href="Europium">europium (III)</a> cation (Eu) <a href="phosphor">phosphor</a>s. The red color itself is emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects energy from the <a href="electron%20gun">electron gun</a> and passes it to the phosphor. Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a> cations. <a href="terbium">Tb</a> can be used as a doping agent to produce green <a href="luminescence">luminescence</a>. As such yttrium compounds such as yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) are useful for phosphors and are an important component of white <a href="LED">LED</a>s.

Yttria is used as a <a href="sintering">sintering</a> additive in the production of porous <a href="silicon%20nitride">silicon nitride</a>. It is used as a common starting material for <a href="material%20science">material science</a> and for producing other compounds of yttrium.

Yttrium compounds are used as a <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a> for <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a>. As a metal, yttrium is used on the electrodes of some high-performance <a href="spark%20plugs">spark plugs</a>. Yttrium is used in <a href="gas%20mantle">gas mantle</a>s for <a href="propane">propane</a> <a href="lantern">lantern</a>s as a replacement for <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, which is <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>.

Currently under development is yttrium-stabilized zirconia as a solid electrolyte and as an <a href="oxygen%20sensor">oxygen sensor</a> in automobile exhaust systems.

Yttrium is used in the production of a large variety of <a href="garnet%23Synthetic%20garnets">synthetic garnets</a>, and yttria is used to make <a href="yttrium%20iron%20garnet">yttrium iron garnet</a>s (, also "YIG"), which are very effective <a href="microwave">microwave</a> <a href="electronic%20filter">filters</a>. Yttrium, <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, and <a href="gadolinium">gadolinium</a> garnets (e.g. Y(Fe,Al)O and Y(Fe,Ga)O) have important <a href="magnetism">magnetic</a> properties. YIG is also very efficient as an acoustic energy transmitter and transducer. <a href="Yttrium%20aluminium%20garnet">Yttrium aluminium garnet</a> ( or YAG) has a <a href="Mohs%20scale%20of%20mineral%20hardness">hardness</a> of 8.5 and is also used as a <a href="gemstone">gemstone</a> in jewelry (simulated <a href="diamond">diamond</a>). <a href="Cerium">Cerium</a>-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Ce) crystals are used as phosphors to make white <a href="LED">LED</a>s.

<a href="YAG">YAG</a>, yttria, <a href="yttrium%20lithium%20fluoride">yttrium lithium fluoride</a> (), and <a href="yttrium%20orthovanadate">yttrium orthovanadate</a> () are used in combination with <a href="dopant">dopant</a>s such as <a href="neodymium">neodymium</a>, <a href="erbium">erbium</a>, <a href="ytterbium">ytterbium</a> in near-<a href="infrared">infrared</a> <a href="laser">laser</a>s. YAG lasers can operate at high power and are used for drilling and cutting metal. The single crystals of doped YAG are normally produced by the <a href="Czochralski%20process">Czochralski process</a>.

Small amounts of yttrium (0.1 to 0.2%) have been used to reduce the grain sizes of <a href="chromium">chromium</a>, <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, and <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>. Yttrium is used to increase the <a href="strength%20of%20materials">strength</a> of aluminium and <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> alloys. The addition of yttrium to alloys generally improves workability, adds resistance to high-temperature recrystallization, and significantly enhances resistance to high-temperature <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> (see graphite nodule discussion below).

Yttrium can be used to <a href="Deoxidizer">deoxidize</a> <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a> and other <a href="non-ferrous%20metal">non-ferrous metal</a>s. <a href="Yttria">Yttria</a> stabilizes the <a href="cubic%20zirconia">cubic form of zirconia</a> in jewelry.

Yttrium has been studied as a nodulizer in <a href="nodular%20cast%20iron">ductile cast iron</a>, forming the <a href="graphite">graphite</a> into compact nodules instead of flakes to increase <a href="ductility">ductility</a> and fatigue resistance. Having a high <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a>, yttrium oxide is used in some <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> and <a href="glass">glass</a> to impart <a href="shock%20%28mechanics%29">shock</a> resistance and low <a href="thermal%20expansion">thermal expansion</a> properties. Those same properties make such glass useful in <a href="camera%20lens">camera lens</a>es.

The radioactive isotope <a href="yttrium-90">yttrium-90</a> is used in drugs such as <a href="Yttrium%20Y%2090-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide">Yttrium Y 90-DOTA-tyr3-octreotide</a> and <a href="Yttrium%20Y%2090%20ibritumomab%20tiuxetan">Yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan</a> for the treatment of various <a href="cancer">cancer</a>s, including <a href="lymphoma">lymphoma</a>, <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a>, liver, ovarian, colorectal, pancreatic and bone cancers. It works by adhering to <a href="monoclonal%20antibody">monoclonal antibodies</a>, which in turn bind to cancer cells and kill them via intense <a href="beta%20particle">β-radiation</a> from the yttrium-90 (see <a href="Monoclonal%20antibody%20therapy">Monoclonal antibody therapy</a>).

A technique called <a href="Selective%20internal%20radiation%20therapy">radioembolization</a> is used to treat <a href="hepatocellular%20carcinoma">hepatocellular carcinoma</a> and <a href="Metastatic%20liver%20disease">liver metastasis</a>. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe at a time and may require multiple procedures.

Also see Radioembolization in the case of combined cirrhosis and Hepatocellular carcinoma.

Needles made of yttrium-90, which can cut more precisely than scalpels, have been used to sever pain-transmitting <a href="nerve">nerve</a>s in the <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a>, and yttrium-90 is also used to carry out radionuclide <a href="synovectomy">synovectomy</a> in the treatment of inflamed joints, especially knees, in sufferers of conditions such as <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>.

A neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser has been used in an experimental, robot-assisted radical <a href="prostatectomy">prostatectomy</a> in canines in an attempt to reduce collateral nerve and tissue damage, and erbium-doped lasers are coming into use for cosmetic skin resurfacing.

Yttrium is a key ingredient in the <a href="yttrium%20barium%20copper%20oxide">yttrium barium copper oxide</a> (YBaCuO, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a> developed at the <a href="University%20of%20Alabama">University of Alabama</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Houston">University of Houston</a> in 1987. This superconductor is notable because the operating superconductivity temperature is above <a href="liquid%20nitrogen">liquid nitrogen</a>'s boiling point (77.1 K). Since liquid nitrogen is less expensive than the <a href="liquid%20helium">liquid helium</a> required for metallic superconductors, the operating costs for applications would be less.

The actual superconducting material is often written as YBaCuO, where "d" must be less than 0.7 for superconductivity. The reason for this is still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.

The theory of low temperature superconductivity has been well understood since the <a href="BCS%20theory">BCS theory</a> of 1957. It is based on a peculiarity of the interaction between two electrons in a crystal lattice. However, the BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials must be precisely controlled for superconductivity to occur.

This superconductor is a black and green, multi-crystal, multi-phase mineral. Researchers are studying a class of materials known as <a href="perovskite">perovskite</a>s that are alternative combinations of these elements, hoping to develop a practical <a href="high-temperature%20superconductor">high-temperature superconductor</a>.
Yttrium currently has no biological role, and it can be highly <a href="Toxicity">toxic</a> to humans and other animals.

Water-soluble compounds of yttrium are considered mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic. In experiments on animals, yttrium and its compounds caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused <a href="pulmonary%20edema">pulmonary edema</a> and <a href="dyspnea">dyspnea</a>, while inhalation of <a href="yttrium%20chloride">yttrium chloride</a> caused liver edema, <a href="pleural%20effusion">pleural effusion</a>s, and pulmonary hyperemia.

Exposure to yttrium compounds in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and upper respiratory tract irritation—though this may be caused by the <a href="vanadium">vanadium</a> content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and <a href="cyanosis">cyanosis</a>. The <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) <a href="Permissible%20exposure%20limit">limits</a> exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1 mg/m over an 8-hour workday. The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> (REL) is 1 mg/m over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500 mg/m, yttrium is <a href="IDLH">immediately dangerous to life and health</a>. Yttrium dust is flammable.

Saxbe fix

The Saxbe fix , or salary rollback, is a mechanism by which the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, in appointing a current or former member of the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> whose elected term has not yet expired, can avoid the restriction of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>'s <a href="Ineligibility%20Clause">Ineligibility Clause</a>. That clause prohibits the President from appointing a current or former member of Congress to a civil office position that was created, or to a civil office position for which the pay or benefits (collectively, "emoluments") were increased, during the term for which that member was elected until the term has expired. The rollback, first implemented by an <a href="Act%20of%20Congress">Act of Congress</a> in 1909, reverts the emoluments of the office to the amount they were when that member began his or her elected term.

To prevent ethical conflicts, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> proposed language at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Convention">Constitutional Convention</a> that was adopted as the Ineligibility Clause after debate and modification by other <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Fathers</a>. Historically, a number of approaches have been taken to circumvent or adhere to the restrictions; these have included choosing another nominee, allowing the desired nominee's elected term of office to expire, ignoring the clause entirely, or reducing the offending emoluments to the level prior to when the nominee took office. Although Congress passed the mechanism reducing emoluments in 1909, the procedure was named "Saxbe fix" after Senator <a href="William%20Saxbe">William Saxbe</a>, who was confirmed as <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> in 1973 after Congress reduced the office's salary to the level it had been before Saxbe's term commenced. The Saxbe fix has subsequently become relevant as a successful—though not universally accepted—solution for appointments by presidents of both parties of sitting members of the United States Congress to the <a href="United%20States%20Cabinet">United States Cabinet</a>. Members of Congress have been appointed to <a href="United%20States%20federal%20judge">federal judgeships</a> without any fix being enacted; court challenges to such appointments have failed.

There were four Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. The first two rollbacks concerned appointees of <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> and <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, and the last two were implemented for appointees of <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> and <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to the conclusion of the term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected members of Congress are ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.

In his notes of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Convention">Philadelphia Convention</a> in 1787, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> expressed the fear that members of Congress would create new federal jobs, or increase the salaries for existing jobs, and then take those jobs for themselves. Madison wrote that corrupt legislative actions, in the form of the unnecessary creation of offices and the increase of salaries for personal benefit, were one of his greatest concerns. The delegates who were present agreed that no member of Congress should be eligible to be appointed to an executive position while serving in Congress. Madison originally proposed a one-year length on such a bar. However, <a href="Nathaniel%20Gorham">Nathaniel Gorham</a>, <a href="James%20Wilson">James Wilson</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> wanted no bar at all at the conclusion of congressional service. Eventually, Madison proposed a compromise: "that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature"; this led to extensive debate.

The delegates eliminated the prohibition on a member of Congress's assuming holding "state" office based on the rationale that there might be times when it might be in the best interest of the nation to allow such service. They eliminated the one-year ban because they judged it to be ineffective in protecting the Constitution. <a href="Charles%20Cotesworth%20Pinckney">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney</a> moved that the states vote and the prohibition carried by vote of 8 states to 3. <a href="Robert%20Yates%20%28politician%29">Robert Yates</a> noted that the clause "which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased" was an amendment passed in his absence, and that he did not place much faith in it as he felt unscrupulous politicians would circumvent it by creating new positions for persons who would subsequently place a member of Congress in a vacancy that they and not Congress created. Madison moved that the phrase "or the Emoluments whereof shall have been augmented by the legislature of the United States, during the time they were members thereof, and for one year thereafter." This motion failed 2–8, with one state divided. The clause was limited to "civil" offices so as not to restrict military service. Accordingly, the clause was passed in its current form without an explicit time consideration.

The Ineligibility Clause has interfered with appointments as far back as 1793. <a href="United%20States%20President">President</a> <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> attempted to appoint <a href="William%20Paterson%20%28judge%29">William Paterson</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a> on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Associate Justice</a> <a href="Thomas%20Johnson%20%28jurist%29">Thomas Johnson</a>. However, Paterson, who was serving as <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Jersey">Governor of New Jersey</a>, had previously been elected to serve a Senate term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793. Washington withdrew the nomination and withheld it until the afternoon of March 4, when the term for the disqualifying office had expired.

In 1882, a formal opinion by the <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> concluded that resignation from Congress does not free a member to be appointed to civil office because the Clause speaks to the "term" for which a member was elected, and that term still exists, even if a member resigns. Therefore, as in the Paterson matter nine decades earlier, <a href="Iowa%20Governor">Iowa Governor</a> <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Kirkwood">Samuel J. Kirkwood</a>, who had resigned a Senate seat with a term that did not expire until March 1883, was ineligible for appointment to the position of <a href="United%20States%20International%20Trade%20Commission">United States Tariff Commissioner</a>. In 1896, the <a href="Comptroller%20of%20the%20Treasury">Comptroller of the Treasury</a> determined, after the fact, that former Senator <a href="Matthew%20Ransom">Matthew Ransom</a>'s appointment as Minister to Mexico was invalid, as that office's salary had been increased during Ransom's term; the belated discovery precluded Ransom from drawing a salary.

The practice of barring members of Congress from serving in other civil offices was not without exception. Ransom, after all, was in fact appointed. In another case, there may have been an inadvertent Saxbe fix. Senator <a href="Lot%20M.%20Morrill">Lot M. Morrill</a> began serving a six-year term in 1871, and in 1873, as part of the <a href="Salary%20Grab%20Act">Salary Grab Act</a>, Congress increased Cabinet officers' salaries from $8,000 to $10,000; it repealed the increase in 1874, and two years later—before the end of his term—Morrill was appointed <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">United States Secretary of the Treasury</a>. The repeal of the "salary grab" was motivated by reaction to public outrage rather than concerns about a member's eligibility for office, but Acting United States Attorney General <a href="Robert%20Bork">Robert Bork</a> would later cite the Morrill case in his opinion about the Saxbe appointment.

In 1909, <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a> Taft announced his <a href="Philander%20C.%20Knox%23Nomination%20controversy">intent to nominate</a> Senator <a href="Philander%20C.%20Knox">Philander C. Knox</a> to be <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>. Shortly after the announcement, the Clause emerged as a problem that caught those involved by surprise: Knox had been elected to serve a term that would not end until 1911, and during that term Congress had voted to increase executive branch pay. Members of Congress considered reverting the fix after the appointed nominee had resigned and assumed the post so that Knox would not have to forgo any emoluments. Members of Congress also discussed reverting the salaries of all United States Cabinet members. At the suggestion of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Judiciary">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>, Congress passed a bill reducing only the Secretary of State's salary to the level it had been at before Knox's term began, believing this would cure the problem. The Senate passed the bill unanimously, but there was much more opposition in the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, where the same measure failed to get a required two-thirds vote under a motion to <a href="Suspension%20of%20the%20rules%20in%20the%20United%20States%20Congress">suspend the rules</a> and pass, a procedure normally reserved for uncontroversial matters. After a different procedural rule was applied, it passed by a 173–115 majority vote and <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">President Roosevelt</a> subsequently signed the bill. On March 4, the first Saxbe fix became effective when the salary of the Secretary of State (but not that of other Cabinet members) was reverted from $12,000 to $8,000. The Senate confirmed all of Taft's Cabinet appointees on March 5, and Knox took office on March 6.

In 1922, the boundaries of the Clause were further defined when Senator <a href="William%20S.%20Kenyon%20%28Iowa%20politician%29">William S. Kenyon</a> was allowed to accept an appointment by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> as circuit judge for the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Eighth%20Circuit">Eighth Circuit</a>. Attorney General <a href="Harry%20M.%20Daugherty">Harry M. Daugherty</a> concluded that no disqualifying event had occurred because the increase in emoluments to that office had occurred in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving at the time of the nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed by the <a href="Clinton%20administration">Clinton administration</a> when Representative <a href="Bill%20Richardson">Bill Richardson</a> was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No rollback was attempted when Senator <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a> was appointed to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>, and in "<a href="Ex%20parte%20Levitt">Ex parte Levitt</a>", the court rejected, for lack of <a href="legal%20standing">legal standing</a>, an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections. The <a href="movant">movant</a> in the Black case, <a href="Albert%20Levitt">Albert Levitt</a>, only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.

The <a href="Nixon%20administration">Nixon administration</a> skirted the Ineligibility Clause during its first year, when Nixon named Representative <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> as Director of the <a href="Office%20of%20Economic%20Opportunity">Office of Economic Opportunity</a> in 1969. Although the salary for that office had been increased to $42,500 during Rumsfeld's term in Congress, Rumsfeld was not paid a salary for the position. Rather, Rumsfeld was dually employed as <a href="Assistant%20to%20the%20President">Assistant to the President</a> at the same $42,500 salary, a position presumably outside the scope of the Clause.

The rollback device gained its name when President Richard Nixon sought to appoint Senator William Saxbe as Attorney General following the <a href="Saturday%20Night%20Massacre">Saturday Night Massacre</a>. <a href="Elliot%20Richardson">Elliot Richardson</a> resigned on October 20, 1973 and Nixon nominated Saxbe on November 1. Saxbe was chosen in large part because, despite the confrontations of the ongoing <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a>, Nixon felt the Senate would want to confirm one of their own. Saxbe had been a senator in 1969 when the Congress passed a pay increase from $35,000 to $60,000 for Cabinet members. According to , "After considering the report and recommendations of the Commission submitted under section 357 of this title, the President shall transmit to Congress his recommendations with respect to the exact rates of pay, for offices and positions within the purview of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of section 356 of this title, which the President considers to be fair and reasonable ..." The President transmitted "Salary Recommendations For 1969 Increases" to Congress on January 15, 1969 following the first Commission Report submitted to him under in December 1968. (34 F.R. 2241; ). Saxbe had become a Senator on January 3, 1969 and on February 14 the legislation became law when Congress took no action to <a href="legislative%20veto">veto</a> the proposal that raised the salary of top executive branch officials, the judicial branch and members of Congress.

As with the Knox instance, the Clause complication caught both Saxbe and the Nixon administration by surprise after the nomination had been announced. In early November 1973 Nixon requested a reduction in emoluments to pre-1969 levels as a remedy to the problem. The <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> held several days of hearings on how to properly interpret the Ineligibility Clause, with conflicting opinions being given by constitutional law professors about whether the proposed remedy was constitutional. The Senate then acted upon the advice of acting Attorney General <a href="Robert%20Bork">Robert Bork</a> that reducing the Attorney General's salary to its pre-1969 level by enacting () would cure the ineligibility. passed in the Senate by a 75–16 roll-call vote on November 28 after it was approved by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Post%20Office%20and%20Civil%20Service">Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee</a> and sharply criticized by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Although passage in the House was less controversial than it was in the Senate because the constitutional issues did not dominate consideration, the bill met with other procedural obstacles. At the time, Congress was under siege for what was widely perceived as abuse of members' <a href="franking">franking</a> privileges. In April, the House had approved H.R. 3180 to clarify what was and was not proper use of franking, and the Senate amended the bill on October 11. The House requested a conference, but the Senate delayed. Supposedly, Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee Chairman <a href="Gale%20McGee">Gale McGee</a> was delaying the franking bill until the Senate-passed post card voter registration bill () was put to a House vote. Thus, at first the House inserted franking language in its Saxbe fix bill. On December 3, it suspended its rules to pass the bill 261–129. The Senate then passed the Saxbe fix bill () on December 6 without the franking language. The House agreed to the amended bill on December 7. On December 10, Nixon officially submitted the Saxbe nomination. The Judiciary Committee approved Saxbe on December 13 and the full senate confirmed him on December 17 by a 75–10 vote. Ten <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> senators cited constitutional concerns in opposing this move. Senator <a href="Robert%20C.%20Byrd">Robert C. Byrd</a>, who felt the bar was not avoidable by legislation, explained his position at the time: "[The Clause is] so clear that it can't be waived. ... We should not delude the American people into thinking a way can be found around the constitutional obstacle." Saxbe did not resign his Senate seat until January 4, 1974, when his wife became eligible for survivor benefits after the completion of his fifth year of service. This delayed his transition to the Cabinet because the Clause expressly prohibits dual service. Saxbe later wrote that although he needed the additional salary he lost (he was earning $42,500 per year as a senator), he was still willing to serve as Attorney General and would get by financially. His biggest fear was that the fix would be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court several months after he had been in office, and he would have to repay salary already spent.

Subsequently, Jimmy Carter became the first Democratic president to use a Saxbe fix when he appointed Senator <a href="Edmund%20Muskie">Edmund Muskie</a> as his Secretary of State. Cyrus Vance had resigned on April 28, 1980. (Ironically, Muskie had been one of the ten senators voting against Saxbe's confirmation.) Carter nominated Muskie on April 29, and the Senate confirmed Muskie on May 7 by a 94–2 vote. Unlike the Knox and Saxbe fixes, the salary reduction to allow Muskie's appointment was temporary, reducing the salary only for the duration of Muskie's tenure. When Carter appointed Representative <a href="Abner%20Mikva">Abner Mikva</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20Circuit">D.C. Circuit</a>, a lawsuit challenging the appointment based on Ineligibility Clause objections again failed for lack of standing.

Upon the retirement of Supreme Court Justice <a href="Lewis%20F.%20Powell%2C%20Jr.">Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</a> in 1987, President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> considered appointing Senator <a href="Orrin%20Hatch">Orrin Hatch</a> to fill his seat. But Congress had, during the term which he was still serving, enacted a salary increase for the judiciary. In July 1987, Bork was nominated instead, although it is not clear how important a role the Ineligibility Clause issue played in the selection. Two months later, Assistant Attorney General <a href="Charles%20J.%20Cooper">Charles J. Cooper</a> rejected the Saxbe fix in a written opinion, concluding that it did not resolve the Ineligibility Clause issue. (The Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate, and the seat ultimately went to <a href="Anthony%20Kennedy">Anthony Kennedy</a>.) According to <a href="Jan%20Crawford%20Greenberg">Jan Crawford Greenberg</a>, the Justice Department had previously done the same to Senator Hatch the year prior when Hatch put forth his name as a replacement for retiring Chief Justice <a href="Warren%20Burger">Warren Burger</a>. According to Greenburg, <a href="Michael%20Carvin%20%28lawyer%29">Michael Carvin</a> used the Ineligibility Clause as a pretext to allow the White House to quietly say no to Hatch.

On January 5, 1993, , a bill to reduce the salary of the Treasury Secretary from $148,400 to $99,500 (the pre-1989 level), passed by a voice vote in the Senate and by the House on January 6. On January 19, President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> signed a bill enacting a temporary Saxbe fix so that Senator <a href="Lloyd%20Bentsen">Lloyd Bentsen</a> could move from the Senate to take the job of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> during the newly elected Clinton administration. S.J. RES. 1 (1993), which canceled emolument increases for the remainder of Bentsen's term, a term set to expire at noon on January 3, 1995, had been passed by both Houses without objection. However, in a law review article, <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota%20Law%20School">University of Minnesota Law School</a> Professor <a href="Michael%20Stokes%20Paulson">Michael Stokes Paulson</a> rejected the Bentsen fix as unconstitutional. In 1994, President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> received approval to use a Saxbe fix to appoint <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Majority%20Leader">United States Senate Majority Leader</a> <a href="George%20J.%20Mitchell">George J. Mitchell</a> to the Supreme Court, but Mitchell withdrew his name from consideration for reasons unrelated to his eligibility.

The term "Saxbe fix" reentered the public lexicon in 2008 with the speculation that Senator <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> was President-elect <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s preferred nominee to be <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>, fueled by Obama's confirmation of his intent to nominate Clinton December 1, 2008. Clinton's relevant Senate term began with the seating of the <a href="110th%20United%20States%20Congress">110th United States Congress</a> on January 3, 2007, following her <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20New%20York%2C%202006">2006 re-election</a>. During that time, United States Cabinet salaries were increased from $186,600 to $191,300 in January 2008, and to $196,700 in January 2009. These pay raises were by <a href="executive%20order%20%28United%20States%29">executive order</a> in accordance with <a href="cost%20of%20living%20adjustment">cost of living adjustment</a> statutes, as noted by legal scholar <a href="Eugene%20Volokh">Eugene Volokh</a> on his blog, <a href="The%20Volokh%20Conspiracy">The Volokh Conspiracy</a>. Before the January 2009 pay increases, secretaries made $191,300 compared to Members of Congress who earned $169,300.

Without a Saxbe fix, Clinton would have been ineligible to serve in the Cabinet until the conclusion of the <a href="112th%20United%20States%20Congress">112th United States Congress</a> in January 2013, near the end of Obama's elected term. The Senate passed Saxbe-fix legislation on December 10, 2008, acting by <a href="unanimous%20consent">unanimous consent</a> to reduce the Secretary of State's salary back to its January 1, 2007 level of $186,000, taking effect at 12:00 noon on January 20, 2009. President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> signed the resolution into law on December 19, cancelling all emolument increases made or to be made during Clinton's Senate term between noon of January 3, 2007, and noon of January 3, 2013.

The conservative advocacy group <a href="Judicial%20Watch">Judicial Watch</a> announced after the nomination that it believed a Saxbe fix was unconstitutional and that Clinton could not become Secretary of State until 2013 at the earliest. After the Saxbe fix was passed, Judicial Watch said it might seek to halt Clinton's appointment via litigation. On January 29, 2009, a week after Clinton had been sworn into the position, Judicial Watch filed the lawsuit "Rodearmel v. Clinton" in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">United States District Court for the District of Columbia</a>, on behalf of David Rodearmel, a U.S. <a href="Foreign%20Service%20Officer">Foreign Service Officer</a> and <a href="United%20States%20State%20Department">State Department</a> employee. The suit claims that Clinton is "constitutionally ineligible" to serve as Secretary of State due to the Ineligibility Clause and that Rodearmel cannot be forced to serve under her, as it would violate the oath he took as a Foreign Service Officer in 1991 to "support and defend" and "bear true faith and allegiance" to the U.S. Constitution. On February 6, a panel of three judges was appointed to hear the case. On May 20, the Obama administration <a href="Office%20of%20Legal%20Counsel">Office of Legal Counsel</a> filed an opinion with the district court saying that Clinton's appointment did not violate the Ineligibility Clause, and that an "on net" view of the Clause "presents an entirely natural interpretation of the [Constitution's] language." On October 30, 2009, the District Court dismissed the case, stating "Because Rodearmel has failed to allege that Clinton has taken any action—much less an action that has aggrieved him—he does not come within the 'zone of interests' protected by the Secretary of State Emoluments Act."

Senator <a href="Ken%20Salazar">Ken Salazar</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>, also required a Saxbe fix by the <a href="111th%20United%20States%20Congress">111th United States Congress</a>. Salazar was given a temporary Saxbe fix on January 6, 2009 as part of . This resolution rolled back the salary of the Secretary of the Interior to the January 1, 2005 level, effective January 20, 2009. The resolution canceled all emolument increases for this office made or to be made between noon of January 3, 2005, and ending at noon of January 3, 2011. The bill was sponsored by Senate Majority Leader <a href="Harry%20Reid">Harry Reid</a>, was introduced on January 6, 2009, and became the first public law enacted by the 111th Congress (). During Obama's first term there were three Cabinet members serving who were sitting members of the House or Senate when appointed, two of whom (Clinton and Salazar) have required Saxbe fixes. The May 2009 Office of Legal Counsel brief also asserted the constitutionality of Salazar's appointment.

Over time, the Saxbe fix has become politically uncontroversial. Both Democratic and Republican Presidents have used the fix, and indeed Republican outgoing President George H. W. Bush helped Democratic incoming President Bill Clinton execute the fix by signing it into law on the eve of <a href="Bill%20Clinton%201993%20presidential%20inauguration">Clinton's inauguration</a>. The fixes that have been enacted for Obama's cabinet have passed in both the House and the Senate without amendment and by unanimous consent. Outgoing Republican President George W. Bush signed the Saxbe fixes for both Hillary Clinton and Ken Salazar into law for the incoming Democratic Obama administration.

The constitutionality of the fix has been much debated, however, and the U.S. Supreme Court has never directly ruled on it. Critical review of the clause begins with a study of the terms in the plain language of the clause: "No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time . ... " All of the terms have been at issue in past controversies and many of the terms have been well-settled. Historically, the excluded class of individuals affected by the clause has not been an issue: all scholars have agreed that the clause refers exclusively to all members of Congress. The clause uses the verb "elected". If a senator serving under an appointment to fill a vacancy in an unexpired term accepted a nomination to federal office before the expiration of his or her term, this might be an issue.

The phrase "During the time for which he was elected" has not been controversial. <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Justice</a> <a href="Joseph%20Story">Joseph Story</a> has expounded in his "Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States" that the disqualifying event expires at the conclusion of the elected term in which it occurred. This view is commonly accepted. Moreover, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> memoranda, outlining official opinions by United States Attorney General, hold that "the Ineligibility Clause covers only increases during the term that a Member of Congress is [or would be] currently serving". This principle was applied, for example, to the question of whether President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Clinton</a> could appoint Representative <a href="Bill%20Richardson">Bill Richardson</a> as <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Nations">Ambassador to the United Nations</a> despite a salary increase prior to his current term, and whether President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Harding</a> could appoint Senator <a href="William%20Squire%20Kenyon">William Kenyon</a> as a <a href="United%20States%20Circuit%20Court">Judge</a> despite the Congressional increase of judicial salaries during his previous term. Opinions issued by the Clinton administration <a href="Office%20of%20Legal%20Counsel">Office of Legal Counsel</a> often presupposed the application of the clause, and conceded that "[t]he tradition of interpreting the Clause has been 'formalistic' rather than 'functional". Another clarification came in 1969, when newly re-elected Representative <a href="Melvin%20Laird">Melvin Laird</a> was President-elect Nixon's choice for <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> and Congress was expected to raise the pay of Cabinet members in the new term. Attorney General <a href="Ramsey%20Clark">Ramsey Clark</a> gave an official opinion, which Laird followed, that Laird could be sworn in and serve in the new term from January 3 to January 20 (when Nixon would take office) without running afoul of the Clause, as long as he joined the cabinet before the pay raise went into effect.

One way to interpret the clause is by the <a href="intentionalist">intentionalist</a> view. As stated by <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20School%20of%20Law">University of North Carolina School of Law</a> professor Michael J. Gerhardt, this is the position that "the critical inquiry is not whether the <a href="letter%20of%20the%20law">letter of the law</a> has been broken (it has) but rather whether the problem that the clause exists to preclude—conflicts of interest in nominating a member of Congress who has been able to vote himself or herself a raise—has been avoided". The commonly used term for this <a href="spirit%20of%20the%20law">spirit of the law</a> argument is "net increases". According to conservative constitutional law attorney <a href="Bruce%20Fein">Bruce Fein</a>, "The so-called fix fits the purpose of the clause like a glove."

If the Saxbe fix is a solution for the primary problem of self-dealing, a relevant fact is that Congress has not voted to increase any Cabinet salary or benefits since the 1990s, when it granted that power to the president in the form of an across-the-board <a href="cost%20of%20living%20adjustment">cost of living adjustment</a> by executive order. However, the Ineligibility Clause does not distinguish between increases in emoluments by legislation, and increases by executive order. Perhaps the most lenient interpretation of self-dealing was made during the 1973 Saxbe hearings by <a href="Duke%20University%20School%20of%20Law">Duke University School of Law</a> professor William Van Alstyne, who argued that the ineligibility clause only applied to new offices created during a congressional term, not to appointments to existing offices.

Some scholars think that the phrase "shall have been increased during such time" is ambiguous and allows different interpretations. For instance, it could be interpreted as meaning either "shall have been increased at least once" or "shall have been increased on net". In the latter case the Saxbe fix would be constitutional.

Another way to interpret the clause is through the lens of <a href="textualism">textualism</a>, that is, giving primary consideration to what the law says rather than to its purpose. Most legal scholars who take this view argue that the Saxbe fix does not address the constitutional problem. Because to textualism believers the language of the rule is an absolute prohibition, law professor and textualist Michael Paulsen has said, a "'fix' can rescind the salary, ... but it cannot repeal historical events. The emoluments of the office had been increased. The rule specified in the text still controls." Most textualists agree that the spirit of the Ineligibility Clause would be addressed by a Saxbe fix, but they dispute that a clause's "spirit" overrides its text.

This view is not confined to textualists; for example, law professors <a href="Jack%20Balkin">Jack Balkin</a> and <a href="Mark%20Tushnet">Mark Tushnet</a> share it, with Tushnet observing that the Saxbe fix "smacks of clever manipulation" and does not adequately address the issue because "rescinding the increase does not mean that the salary 'shall not have been increased'; it simply means that the salary shall have been both increased and reduced during the term." Some intentionalists interpret the Ineligibility Clause as a safeguard against escalation of the size and scope of the federal government and its corresponding budget, in addition to being a safeguard against self-enrichment. They argue that reverting salary increases does not prevent members of congress from engaging in conduct that would bloat the government.

Another argument presented during the Saxbe nomination hearings was that the constitutional framers wrote the Ineligibility Clause to prevent Congress from enacting laws to benefit one of its own members. Any Saxbe fix is such a law and should be disallowed based on this fact alone.

Once Congress approves a salary reduction and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice it is unlikely that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been adversely affected by a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a <a href="passport">passport</a>. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have <a href="standing%20%28law%29">standing</a> to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20SCRAP">United States v. SCRAP</a>". In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.

It has already proven difficult to be recognized as having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a> ("<a href="Ex%20parte%20Levitt">Ex parte Levitt</a>", 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge <a href="Abner%20Mikva">Abner Mikva</a> ("<a href="McClure%20v.%20Carter">McClure v. Carter</a>", 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.

There are several nuances to the Ineligibility Clause that determine the necessity of fixes in specific situations:

Also disputed is their geographic origin, with <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and the Eastern <a href="Baltic%20region">Baltic</a> all put forward as candidates. Whether the name Kylfing denotes a particular tribal, socio-political, or economic grouping is also a matter of much debate.

They are mentioned in <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> <a href="runestone">runestone</a> inscriptions, <a href="Icelandic%20sagas">sagas</a> (most notably in "<a href="Egil%27s%20Saga">Egil's Saga</a>"), and <a href="Old%20Norse%20poetry">poetry</a> (such as <a href="Thorbjorn%20Hornklofi">Thorbjorn Hornklofi</a>'s poem "<a href="Haraldskv%C3%A6%C3%B0i">Haraldskvæði</a>"), as well as <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> records and <a href="Rus%27%20people">Rus'</a> law-codes. According to the sagas, the Kylfings opposed the consolidation of <a href="Norway">Norway</a> under <a href="Harald%20I%20of%20Norway">Harald Fairhair</a> and participated in the pivotal late ninth century <a href="Battle%20of%20Hafrsfjord">Battle of Hafrsfjord</a>. After Harald's victory in that battle, they are described in the sagas as having raided in <a href="Finnmark">Finnmark</a> and elsewhere in <a href="northern%20Norway">northern Norway</a> and having fought against Harald's lieutenants such as <a href="Thorolf%20Kveldulfsson">Thorolf Kveldulfsson</a>.

The exact etymology of the word "kylfing" is disputed and many different theories have been put forward as to its ultimate origin. The general trend has been to trace "kylfing" to the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> words "kylfa" and "kolfr", but scholars disagree as to the meaning of these words as well. Cleasby notes that in Old Norse, "kylfa" can mean a <a href="Club%20%28weapon%29">club or cudgel</a>. Thus the national Icelandic antiquarian Barði Guðmundsson translated "Kylfing" to mean "club-wielders". As Foote points out, it can also mean a smaller stick, such as a tally-stick or wooden token used by merchants, and, according to Jesch, it can also mean the "highest and narrowest part" of a <a href="Stem%20%28ship%29">ship's stem</a>. Holm discussed the term "kylfa" in connection with the word "hjúkolfr" which means "meeting" or "guild"; according to Holm, the second element "kolfr" could refer to a <a href="fiery%20cross">symbolic arrow</a> traditionally used as a device to summon people for a meeting.

These varied derivations have led to a number of interpretations. Holm offers two meanings: "archer" and "man armed with a <a href="Club%20%28weapon%29">cudgel</a>". A number of historians have asserted that "Kylfing" referred to a member of a "<a href="Club%20%28organization%29">club</a> in the social or Anglo-American sense", a "brotherhood" or a member of a Norse <a href="f%C3%A9lag">félag</a>. In a number of minor Icelandic manuscripts on mathematics and geography, "Kylfingaland" is identified as <a href="Gar%C3%B0ar%C3%ADki">Garðaríki</a>, "i.e." <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a>, but the sources are unclear as to whether Kylfingaland is named for the Kylfings or vice versa, or whether, indeed, there is any connection at all.

The <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> <a href="cognate">cognate</a> of "Kylfing" is "Kolbjag", following the pattern of development <a href="Asterisk%23Historical%20linguistics">*</a>"kolƀing" (*"kulƀing") > *"kolƀęg" > "kolbjag". The "Kolbiagi" were a group of foreign merchant-venturers and mercenaries mentioned in a number of <a href="Old%20Russian">Old Russian</a> sources. They are often mentioned together with the <a href="Varangians">Varangians</a>, a term used in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> to describe traders and pirates of the Baltic sea. In Byzantine Greek, they were named "koulpingoi" and they served as a unit of the Byzantine army listed alongside the <a href="Varangian%20Guard">Varangian Guard</a>, which was of Scandinavian origin.

A very different derivation was put forward by the Russian scholar B. Briems. He hypothesised that "Kylfingr" was a direct Norse translation of the <a href="Votic%20language">Votic</a> self-designation "Vatjalaiset" and "Vatja" (or "Vadjalaiset" and "Vadja") used by the <a href="Votes">Votes</a>, a Finnic tribe residing in <a href="Ingria">Ingria</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. A non-Norse origin was also proposed by <a href="Julius%20Brutzkus">Julius Brutzkus</a>, who argued that both "Varangian" and "Kylfing" derived from the <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic languages</a>, particularly the <a href="Bulgar%20language">Bulgar</a> and <a href="Khazar%20language">Khazar language</a>s. Brutzkus asserted that "Varangian" came from the Turkic root "varmak" ("to walk, travel") while "Kylfing" was a Norse pronunciation of the <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> "kolbiagi", itself deriving from the Turkic phrase "köl-beg" ("sea-king"); under this interpretation the word "Kylfing" would be more or less synonymous with "<a href="Viking">Viking</a>".

According to "Egil's Saga", the Kylfings were trading and plundering in <a href="Finnmark">Finnmark</a> around the year 900. Thorolf Kveldulfsson, King Harald's tax agent in northern Norway, engaged <a href="Sami%20people">Saami</a> scouts to monitor the Kylfings' movements and report back to him. Countering their raids, he is reported to have killed over a hundred Kylfing marauders.

Some scholars see them as Scandinavians while others consider them to have been a <a href="Finnic%20peoples">Finnic</a> tribe, and assert a connection between the word Kylfing and the <a href="Finland">Finnish</a>, Saami, and Karelian myths of <a href="Kalevi%20%28mythology%29">Kaleva</a>. Elsewhere they are described as a mixture of <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> and <a href="Finns">Finnish</a> people who were employed as <a href="mercenaries">mercenaries</a> and tax-agents by Scandinavian rulers; in this context Ravndal interpreted the "kylfa" element to refer to a "club" in the sense of organization. Arbman argues that the Kolbiagi were a separate <a href="fur%20trade">fur-trading</a> guild. Postan "et al.", on the other hand, hypothesize that Kolbiag denoted a junior participant in a Varangian trade guild, rather than a separate group.

Holm (1992) considers Egil's saga to equate the Kylfings with the <a href="Finnic%20languages">Finnic</a> <a href="Karelians">Karelians</a>. In the 14th century, when the Swedish kings began to direct their attention northwards and encourage Swedish colonization in <a href="Norrbotten">Norrbotten</a>, there were regulations that the <a href="Birkarls">Birkarls</a> and the <a href="Saami%20peoples">Saami peoples</a> were not to be interrupted in their traditional activities. A large part of the Karelians were under Novgorod which was included in what Icelandic sources called "Kylfingaland", and thus the Kylfings could have been Baltic Finnish tribes under Novgorod.

Both <a href="East%20Slavs">East Slavs</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Greeks">Byzantines</a> consistently made a clear distinction between Varangians and Kylfings, and Byzantines distinguished between them in the same manner as they separated <a href="Franks">Franks</a> from <a href="Saracen">Saracen</a>s. According to Holm such separations are indicative of clear ethnic differences between the two groups. Additionally, both East Slavic and Byzantine sources explicitly associate the Varangians with Baltic region, which they called "Varangia", and in Arabic, the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> was called "Bahr Varank", "i.e." the "Varangian Sea". There are no comparable connections when they mention the Kylfings. Another difference is the fact that the Byzantine sources connect the word "varangoi" with "rhōs" in order to make it clear that the "rhōs-varangoi" and the "varangoi" originate in Baltic just like the "rhōs", but do not establish the same associations for the "koulpingoi".

The Kylfings have also been identified with the <a href="Votes">Votic people</a>. <a href="Carl%20Christian%20Rafn">Carl Christian Rafn</a>, <a href="Edgar%20V.%20Saks">Edgar V. Saks</a>, B. Briem and <a href="Sigur%C3%B0ur%20Nordal">Sigurður Nordal</a> have proposed Kylfings to have been the Norse name for the Votes. The reason is that the <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> "Vadja(laiset)" can be associated with the word "vadja" (modern Estonian "vai"') which means "stake", "wedge" or "staff", which corresponds to Old Norse "kolfr". "Vadjalaiset" would consequently be translated into Old East Norse as "kolfingar", which in Old West Norse (Old Icelandic) would be <a href="Germanic%20umlaut">umlaut</a>ed as "kylfingar". Whereas some native names were Scandinavized, as "<a href="Rostov">Rostov</a>" into "Ráðstofa", the Norse learned of the meaning of other names and translated them, which they did at <a href="Volkhov">Volkhov</a>, and in the case of some of the Dniepr rapids. The theory that the Kylfings were Votes has been opposed by Max Vasmer and Stender-Petersen, whereas Holm finds it likely. Holm considers it apparent that the Varangians and the Finnic tribes were able to cooperate well, and he points to the relative ease and stability with which Finland was later integrated as a part of the Swedish kingdom. Jorma Koivulehto, a Finnish linguist, disagrees with the Vote theory and maintains that the Votic name or any other Finnic ethnonym is not etymologically connected with the name Kylfingar.

Estonians have also been identified as Kylfings.

Barði Guðmundsson identified the Kylfings as an East Scandinavian, possibly <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a>, tribe that infiltrated northern <a href="Norway">Norway</a> during the late ninth century. Guðmundsson connects the Kylfings with the Germanic <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a> who were active throughout northern Europe and in <a href="Italy">Italy</a> during the fifth and sixth centuries. According to Guðmundsson, many of these Kylfings may ultimately have emigrated to <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> during the ninth and tenth centuries. Other scholars have assigned a <a href="Danish%20people">Danish</a> origin to this tribe.

Some scholars have considered the Kylfings of "Egil's Saga" to be a "conquering Germanic people", or the Swedish king's tax collectors. Holm (1992) considers such suggestions to be anachronistic because the Swedish kings lacked any interest in northern <a href="Fenno-Scandia">Fenno-Scandia</a> during the ninth and tenth centuries, and not even the later <a href="Medieval%20Scandinavian%20laws%23Swedish%20provincial%20laws">law of Hälsingland</a> mentions any Swedish settlement north of <a href="Bygde%C3%A5">Bygdeå</a> in southern <a href="V%C3%A4sterbotten">Västerbotten</a>.

Pritsak identified the Kylfings as a "professional trading and mercenary organization" that organized expeditions northward, into the Saami lands, as distinct from other <a href="Varangian">Varangian</a> and <a href="viking">viking</a> groups whose expeditions focussed on lands to the west and east of Scandinavia. This interpretation is supported by such historians as Stender-Petersen.

A number of runestones in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> contain the <a href="personal%20name">personal name</a> "Kylfingr", which may or may not be connected to the Kylfings as a group.

A few historians have hypothesized that the Kylfings were a <a href="West%20Slav">West Slav</a>ic people related to the <a href="Pomeranians%20%28Slavic%20tribe%29">Pomeranians</a>. Under this interpretation, the Slavic term "Kolbiag" may share common origins with such place-names as <a href="Ko%C5%82obrzeg">Kołobrzeg</a> (formerly Kolberg), a town on the <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>n Baltic coast, and <a href="Kolpino">Kolpino</a>, a settlement near modern <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>.

Eleventh-century <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> sources refer to Kylfings (Κουλπίγγοι, "Koulpingoi"; often attested in the <a href="genitive">genitive</a> plural "Κουλπίγγων", "Koulpingon") as being among the foreigners serving as mercenaries in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, but appear to distinguish between them and the Varangians. For instance, an imperial <a href="chrysobull">chrysobull</a>, an edict bearing a golden seal, issued in 1073 exempts certain <a href="monasteries">monasteries</a> from being forced to <a href="billet">billet</a> soldiers of specific "<a href="ethne">ethne</a>": Varangians, <a href="Rus%27%20%28people%29">Rus'</a>, <a href="Saracen">Saracen</a>s, <a href="Franks">Franks</a> and "Koulpingoi". In previous edicts issued in 1060 and 1068 the Koulpingoi had not been separately delineated. Similar edicts were issued in 1082, 1086, and 1088. The edict issued by <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> 1088, for instance, reads:

The Kylfings were also active in the eastern Baltic and northern Russia. "Kylfingaland" may have been used to refer to <a href="Karelia">Karelia</a>; on some runestones it has been interpreted as a synonym for <a href="Gar%C3%B0ariki">Garðariki</a>, the Old Norse name for <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. The eleventh-century "<a href="Ruskaya%20Pravda">Ruskaya Pravda</a>", the <a href="law%20code">law code</a> of the <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a>, grants certain privileges to Kylfings ("Колбяги" or "Kolbiagi") in addition to Varangians ("Varyagi"). For instance, Varangians and Kylfings were entitled to press charges with an oath without relying on any witnesses. In addition, in order to swear innocence, they needed only two witnesses, whereas a native Slav needed as many as seven. Moreover, the Varangians and the Kylfings were entitled to give shelter to a fugitive for as many as three days, whereas Slavs and others had to hand him over directly.

A military organization called "Kölpények" is reported to have existed in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Medieval Hungary</a> during the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries. Hungarian scholars have proposed that the "Kölpények" were identical with the Kylfings/Kolbiagi. Hungarian sources regard the "Kölpények" as being of Scandinavian origin. They were hired by the early rulers of the <a href="House%20of%20Arpad">House of Arpad</a>, particularly <a href="Taksony%20of%20Hungary">Taksony of Hungary</a> in the 950s, to serve as frontier guards. They fought with their <a href="Hungarian%20people">Magyar</a> employers alongside <a href="Sviatoslav%20I%20of%20Kiev">Sviatoslav I of Kiev</a> against <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and the Byzantine Empire. Alternatively, the "Kölpények" may have been of <a href="Pecheneg">Pecheneg</a> origin, as there was a Pecheneg tribal group called "Külbej" during roughly the same period.

The <a href="skald">skald</a>ic poet <a href="Thorbjorn%20Hornklofi">Thorbjorn Hornklofi</a> wrote about "Austkylfur", or "East-Kylfings", in his epic poem "<a href="Haraldskv%C3%A6%C3%B0i">Haraldskvæði</a>". In some manuscripts the name was, probably erroneously, rendered "auðkylfur" or "rich men". Some <a href="philologist">philologist</a>s, using the nautical meaning of the word "kylfa", interpret the phrase as "eastern ships". Others, such as F. Jonsson, interpreted "Austkylfur" to mean "eastern logs", while Vigfusson believed that the phrase properly meant simply "men of the east". Another interpretation of the term used in "Haraldskvæði" is the derogatory "eastern oafs".

Guðmundsson specifically identified the "Austkylfur" of Hornklofi's poem with the Kylfings mentioned elsewhere in Scandinavian and Eastern European sources, and interpreted the phrase "Austkylfur" to mean "eastern club-wielding men".

In "Haraldskvæði" as recorded by <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a> in the "<a href="Heimskringla">Heimskringla</a>", the Austrkylfur were described as being opponents of Harald Fairhair at the Battle of Hafrsfjord. As such they formed part of the force, led by <a href="Kjotve%20the%20Rich">Kjotve the Rich</a> of <a href="Agder">Agder</a> and the kings and <a href="Jarl%20%28title%29">jarls</a> of <a href="Hordaland">Hordaland</a>, <a href="Rogaland">Rogaland</a>, and <a href="Telemark">Telemark</a>, that came to Hafrsfjord to fight Harald's encroaching <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a>. The exact relationship between the "Austkylfur" and the anti-Harald coalition is unknown. Nora Chadwick identifies the "Austkylfur" as the part of the force opposing Harald that came from Agder and Telemark. These districts lie further east than the other kingdoms opposing Harald's rule. After their defeat by Harald and his army, the Kylfings' property was plundered and their womenfolk, described as "eastern maidens", were distributed by the victorious king among his warriors.

2006 Westchester County tornado

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest <a href="tornado">tornado</a> in <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County, New York</a> since the <a href="1904%20Chappaqua%20tornado">1904 Chappaqua tornado</a>. It touched down there on Wednesday, July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EDT</a> (19:30 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>) on the shore of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> before becoming a <a href="waterspout">waterspout</a> and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a> and struck the town of <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%2C%20New%20York">Sleepy Hollow</a> at <a href="Fujita%20scale%23Parameters">F1</a> intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of <a href="Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut">Greenwich</a> at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million.

On July 12 a <a href="supercell">supercell</a> <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a> developed over eastern <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> in association with a <a href="Low%20pressure%20area">surface low-pressure area</a> in southwestern <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. Daytime heating in the <a href="Tri-State%20Region">Tri-State Region</a> led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">showers and thunderstorms</a>. With conditions favorable for the development of a <a href="tornado">tornado</a>, the <a href="Storm%20Prediction%20Center">Storm Prediction Center</a> issued a <a href="tornado%20watch">tornado watch</a> at 12:40 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EDT</a> (16:40 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a <a href="funnel%20cloud">funnel cloud</a> near <a href="Carlstadt%2C%20New%20Jersey">Carlstadt</a> at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. About 15 minutes later, a <a href="tornado%20warning">tornado warning</a> was issued for southern Rockland and <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester</a> counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an <a href="Fujita%20scale%23Parameters">F1</a> tornado touched down near <a href="Grand%20View-on-Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Grand View-on-Hudson</a> along the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> in <a href="Rockland%20County%2C%20New%20York">Rockland County</a>. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a <a href="waterspout">waterspout</a> as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the <a href="Tappan%20Zee%20Bridge%20%281955%E2%80%932017%29">Tappan Zee Bridge</a> before crossing into <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%2C%20New%20York">Sleepy Hollow, New York</a>, around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%209A">New York State Route 9A</a>, it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the <a href="Kensico%20Reservoir">Kensico Reservoir</a> in <a href="Valhalla%2C%20New%20York">Valhalla</a> as the tornado neared the New York–<a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into <a href="Fairfield%20County%2C%20Connecticut">Fairfield County, Connecticut</a>, it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in <a href="Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut">Greenwich</a> after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the <a href="Merritt%20Parkway">Merritt Parkway</a>. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through <a href="Rockland%20County%2C%20New%20York">Rockland</a>, <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester</a>, and <a href="Fairfield%20County%2C%20Connecticut">Fairfield</a> counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%2C%20New%20York">Sleepy Hollow</a>, damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of <a href="Pocantico%20Hills%2C%20New%20York">Pocantico Hills</a> was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby <a href="Comfort%20Inn">Comfort Inn</a> had part of its roof torn off. After a <a href="tornado%20warning">tornado warning</a> was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.
As the tornado crossed <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%209A">New York State Route 9A</a>, it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of <a href="Mount%20Pleasant%2C%20New%20York">Mount Pleasant</a> and <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20New%20York">Hawthorne</a>, damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the <a href="Saw%20Mill%20River%20Parkway">Saw Mill River Parkway</a> prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting <a href="Metro-North%20Railroad">Metro-North Railroad</a> service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the <a href="Kensico%20Reservoir">Kensico Reservoir</a> in <a href="Valhalla%2C%20New%20York">Valhalla</a>, the tornado crossed into <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of <a href="Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut">Greenwich</a>. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a state of emergency for the entire village. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. <a href="Consolidated%20Edison">ConEdison</a> crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester</a>. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in <a href="Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York">Tarrytown, New York</a>, was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. <a href="Metro-North%20Railroad">Metro-North Railroad</a> suspended trains on the northern part of the Harlem Line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks.

2009 Orange Bowl

The 2009 <a href="FedEx">FedEx</a> <a href="Orange%20Bowl">Orange Bowl</a> was the 75th edition of the annual American <a href="college%20football">college football</a> <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> known as the <a href="Orange%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Orange Bowl</a>. It pitted the 2008 <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) champion <a href="2008%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> against the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a> champion <a href="2008%20Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football%20team">Cincinnati Bearcats</a> on January 1, 2009, at <a href="Dolphin%20Stadium">Dolphin Stadium</a> in <a href="Miami%20Gardens%2C%20Florida">Miami Gardens, Florida</a>. Virginia Tech defeated Cincinnati, 20–7. The game was the second contest in the 2008–2009 <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) of the <a href="2008%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season</a> and was the concluding game of the season for both teams. The game was televised in the United States on <a href="Fox%20Sports%20%28USA%29">FOX</a>, and an estimated 9.3 million viewers watched the broadcast live.

Virginia Tech was selected to participate in the Orange Bowl after a 9–4 season that culminated in a 30–12 victory in the <a href="2008%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2008 ACC Championship Game</a>. Cincinnati was selected as the other half of the matchup after an 11–2 season that ended with a 29–24 win against <a href="2008%20Hawaii%20Warriors%20football%20team">Hawaii</a>. In the weeks between the teams' selection and the playing of the game, media attention focused on the nature of Cincinnati's first BCS game appearance and Virginia Tech's attempt to win its first BCS game since 1995. Attention also focused on Cincinnati's proficient offense and Virginia Tech's highly rated defense.

The game <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kicked off</a> at 8:47 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a> in warm weather, and Cincinnati scored first, converting the game's opening possession into a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> and a 7–0 lead in the first quarter. Virginia Tech responded in the second quarter, tying the game at seven before taking a 10–7 lead with a <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> as time expired in the first half. In the third quarter, the two teams battled defensively, with only the Hokies able to score any points as Tech extended its lead to 13–7. During the final quarter, Virginia Tech scored its second touchdown of the game, giving the Hokies a 20–7 lead that lasted until time expired.

In recognition of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech <a href="running%20back">running back</a> <a href="Darren%20Evans">Darren Evans</a> was named the game's <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a>. He set a Virginia Tech bowl-game record for <a href="Rush%20%28American%20football%29">carries</a> and tied the Tech record for rushing yards in a bowl game. Cincinnati replaced two coaches after the loss, and three months after the game, players from each team entered the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) via the <a href="2009%20NFL%20Draft">2009 NFL Draft</a>. Cincinnati had six players selected in the draft, while Virginia Tech had one.

The <a href="Orange%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Orange Bowl</a> is one of five <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a>s that have been played at the conclusion of every college football season since 2006. As defined by contract, the bowl matches the champion of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) against an at-large pick chosen by a special committee. On December 6, 2008, the <a href="2008%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> defeated the <a href="2008%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team">Boston College Eagles</a> in the <a href="2008%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2008 ACC Championship Game</a>, thus winning an automatic bid to the 2009 Orange Bowl Game.

The at-large spot in the Orange Bowl was filled via a <a href="Round-robin%20tournament">round-robin</a> selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the <a href="Sugar%20Bowl">Sugar</a>, <a href="Fiesta%20Bowl">Fiesta</a>, and <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20%28game%29">Rose</a> bowls) and the automatic bids. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls. In 2009, the Fiesta Bowl picked first, followed by the Sugar Bowl, then the Orange Bowl. The <a href="2009%20Fiesta%20Bowl">Fiesta Bowl</a> picked <a href="2008%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team">Ohio State</a>, while the <a href="2009%20Sugar%20Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a> selected <a href="2008%20Utah%20Utes%20football%20team">Utah</a>. The Orange Bowl was thus left to select <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a> champion <a href="2008%20Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football%20team">Cincinnati</a>, fulfilling the BCS' contractual obligation to provide a game for the conference's champion.

The Cincinnati Bearcats ended the <a href="2007%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2007 college football season</a> with a 10–2 record, including a win in the <a href="2007%20PapaJohns.com%20Bowl">2007 PapaJohns.com Bowl</a> over <a href="2007%20Southern%20Miss%20Golden%20Eagles%20football%20team">Southern Miss</a>, 31–21. It was only the second time in school history that Cincinnati had won 10 games in a season. Before the 2008 season, the Bearcats hoped <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Ben%20Mauk">Ben Mauk</a> would be allowed to play an unusual sixth year of college football, a possibility created by a year lost to injury and a <a href="Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> year. After Mauk's request was denied by the NCAA, the annual poll of media covering Big East football picked Cincinnati to finish fifth in the eight-team Big East.

The Bearcats opened the <a href="2008%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2008 college football season</a> against , winning 40–7 in an offensive effort led by senior quarterback Dustin Grutza, who was named the team's starter at that position following Mauk's dismissal. For its second game of the season, Cincinnati traveled to <a href="Norman%2C%20Oklahoma">Norman</a>, <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, to face the <a href="2008%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team">Oklahoma Sooners</a> for the first time. In a 52–26 loss to a team that would play for the national championship that season, Grutza broke his ankle and was replaced by <a href="Junior%20%28education%29">junior</a> <a href="Tony%20Pike">Tony Pike</a>.

For their third game of the season, the Bearcats returned to <a href="Nippert%20Stadium">Nippert Stadium</a>—their home field—to play the first of two <a href="Mid-American%20Conference">Mid-American Conference</a> (MAC) opponents, in-state rival <a href="2008%20Miami%20RedHawks%20football%20team">Miami</a>. In the 113th Battle for the <a href="Victory%20Bell%20%28Miami-Cincinnati%29">Victory Bell</a>, Cincinnati won, 45–20. Following the victory against Miami, the Bearcats traveled to <a href="Akron%2C%20Ohio">Akron</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> to play the <a href="2008%20Akron%20Zips%20football%20team">Akron Zips</a>. Against the Zips, Pike broke his arm and was replaced by <a href="Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> <a href="freshman">freshman</a> <a href="Chazz%20Anderson">Chazz Anderson</a>, who was also injured during the game. Fellow redshirt freshman <a href="Zach%20Collaros">Zach Collaros</a> then entered the game and led the Bearcats to a 17–15 victory. The close win against Akron was followed by a 33–10 win over <a href="2008%20Marshall%20Thundering%20Herd%20football%20team">Marshall</a>, the Bearcats' final nonconference game before beginning Big East play.

At the start of conference play, the Bearcats were 4–1, and their only loss was against top-five opponent Oklahoma. With Pike still injured, Cincinnati beat <a href="2008%20Rutgers%20Scarlet%20Knights%20football%20team">Rutgers</a>, 13–10, in the Bearcats' first Big East game of the season. The Bearcats suffered their second defeat of the season in the following week, however, losing to the <a href="2008%20Connecticut%20Huskies%20football%20team">UConn Huskies</a>, 40–16. Pike returned from the injury and had the Bearcats leading at halftime, but he left the game at the half when numbness in his non-throwing hand prevented him from being able to take the <a href="Snap%20%28football%29">snap</a>. In the two weeks that followed the loss to the Huskies, Cincinnati recovered to beat two top-25 opponents: No. 23 <a href="2008%20South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football%20team">South Florida</a> and No. 20 <a href="2008%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football%20team">West Virginia</a>. The two victories pushed the Bearcats to a 3–1 conference record and the No. 22 position in the <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a> before Cincinnati's annual rivalry game against <a href="2008%20Louisville%20Cardinals%20football%20team">Louisville</a>. That game, also known as the Battle for <a href="The%20Keg%20of%20Nails">The Keg of Nails</a>, ended in a Cincinnati victory for the first time since 2002.

Following the rivalry game win, Cincinnati played the <a href="2008%20Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football%20team">Pittsburgh Panthers</a> in a game for control of first place in the Big East. In front of a record crowd at Cincinnati's home field, the Bearcats claimed first place with a 28–21 win. Heading into its game against the <a href="2008%20Syracuse%20Orange%20football%20team">Syracuse Orange</a>, Cincinnati was assured at least a share of the Big East Championship, but a 30–10 win over Syracuse gave the Bearcats sole possession of the championship, the first Big East title in school history. After clinching the Big East Championship and a bid to a BCS bowl, Cincinnati ended the regular season with a game in Hawaii against the <a href="2008%20Hawaii%20Warriors%20football%20team">Hawaii Warriors</a>. Despite trailing for much of the game, the Bearcats scored 19 unanswered points and ended the regular season with a 29–24 victory. Already assured a BCS berth by virtue of their Big East championship, on December 7, 2008, the Bearcats were selected to participate in the 2009 Orange Bowl.

The Virginia Tech Hokies entered the 2008 season after an 11–3 overall 2007 record that included a win in the <a href="2007%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2007 ACC Championship Game</a> and a loss to the <a href="2007%20Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football%20team">Kansas Jayhawks</a> in the <a href="2008%20Orange%20Bowl">2008 Orange Bowl</a>. Although the Hokies won the ACC for the second time in less than four years, fans and analysts anticipated Virginia Tech would spend 2008 rebuilding a team that saw 12 <a href="Starting%20lineup">starters</a> graduate or enter the <a href="NFL%20Draft">National Football League (NFL) Draft</a>. Though picked in a preseason poll to win the Coastal Division of the ACC, the Hokies were upset in their season opener by <a href="2008%20East%20Carolina%20Pirates%20football%20team">East Carolina University</a>.

Following the loss, Virginia Tech head coach <a href="Frank%20Beamer">Frank Beamer</a> announced that backup quarterback <a href="Tyrod%20Taylor">Tyrod Taylor</a>, who had previously been expected to redshirt and sit out the season, would play in the Hokies' second game, against . Both Taylor and <a href="Sean%20Glennon">Sean Glennon</a> performed well against Furman, and Tech won, 24–7. Tech's third game of the season came against the <a href="2008%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets</a>, who were debuting a new offensive system the spread option under first-year head coach <a href="Paul%20Johnson%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">Paul Johnson</a>. Unlike the game against Furman, Taylor started the game and remained at quarterback throughout, guiding the Hokies to their first ACC victory of the season, 20–17. The win gave Tech the tiebreaker against the Yellow Jackets in the event of a tie in the division standings at the end of the season. The Hokies' fourth game of the season came against the <a href="2008%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football%20team">North Carolina Tar Heels</a>, who were defeated by the same margin of victory as Tech's win against Georgia Tech, 20–17.

The twin conference victories were followed by two out-of-conference wins: at <a href="Big%2012">Big 12</a> opponent <a href="2008%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team">Nebraska</a> and against <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20independent%20schools">independent</a> <a href="2008%20Western%20Kentucky%20Hilltoppers%20football%20team">Western Kentucky</a>. At the end of the four-game winning streak, the Hokies had a 4–1 record, 2–0 in conference, and were ranked No. 17 in the country. On October 18, however, the Hokies lost to unranked <a href="2008%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team">Boston College</a> in Boston, 28–23. The game was a rematch of the previous year's ACC Championship Game and was a preview of the <a href="2008%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">2008 ACC Championship Game</a> matchup. The loss was the start of a skid that saw Tech lose three of four games, only managing a victory against <a href="2008%20Maryland%20Terrapins%20football%20team">Maryland</a>, 23–13. The final contest of that four-game stretch was a 16–13 loss to Coastal Division rival <a href="2008%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami</a>, which then held the tiebreaker over the Hokies in the event of any head-to-head tie.

During the last two games of the regular season, however, the Hokies managed two victories: a 14–3 win against last-place ACC team <a href="2008%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football%20team">Duke</a>, and a 17–14 triumph over traditional rival <a href="2008%20Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football%20team">Virginia</a>. Miami, meanwhile, lost its final two games of the season: against Georgia Tech and <a href="2008%20NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20football%20team">North Carolina State</a>. These losses dropped Miami to a 4–4 record in the ACC, one game behind the Hokies, who were tied with Georgia Tech at 5–3 following the end of the regular season. By virtue of the Hokies' head-to-head win against the Yellow Jackets, Virginia Tech won the Coastal Division and a spot in the ACC Championship Game. When Tech won the championship game against Atlantic Division champion Boston College, 30–12, it was awarded the ACC's automatic bid to the Orange Bowl.

Pregame media coverage of the game focused on the fact that the 2009 Orange Bowl was Cincinnati's first Bowl Championship Series game in school history. For Virginia Tech, coverage focused on the Hokies' winless history in BCS games since 1995, as Tech had lost all four of its appearances in a BCS game since an upset win over <a href="Texas%20Longhorns%20football">Texas</a> in the <a href="1995%20Sugar%20Bowl%20%28December%29">1995 Sugar Bowl</a>. Also mentioned was the fact that the two teams had faced each other in the <a href="1947%20Sun%20Bowl">1947 Sun Bowl</a>, which had been each school's first bowl game. The low win rate of ACC teams in general was another point of interest. Teams from the conference had won just one of their ten appearances in a BCS bowl before the Orange Bowl. Before the Orange Bowl matchup, the two teams last played in 2006, when the Hokies defeated the Bearcats, 29–13, at Virginia Tech's home field, <a href="Lane%20Stadium">Lane Stadium</a>. For the Orange Bowl, <a href="Spread%20betting">spread bettors</a> favored a reversal of that 2006 final, as Cincinnati was initially favored by one point. This expanded to 1.5 points by December 9. The trend toward Cincinnati continued, and on December 27, betting organizations gave Cincinnati the edge by two or two and a half points.

The game featured two teams both ranked lower than the two teams playing in a non-BCS bowl, a first in BCS history. The <a href="2008%20Poinsettia%20Bowl">2008 Poinsettia Bowl</a> featured the No. 9 <a href="2008%20Boise%20State%20Broncos%20football%20team">Boise State Broncos</a> against the No. 11 <a href="2008%20TCU%20Horned%20Frogs%20football%20team">TCU Horned Frogs</a>. In Miami, Virginia Tech and Cincinnati each made preparations to switch accommodations to a different hotel on the day before the game to better simulate the feel of a regular-season game. Cincinnati's move was accelerated a day when <a href="rapper">rapper</a> <a href="Sean%20Combs">Sean "Diddy" Combs</a> moved into the hotel and coaches, seeking to avoid a distraction, moved up the date of the team's departure.

The pace of ticket sales for the Orange Bowl varied wildly between the two schools. Each team received an allotment of 17,500 tickets to sell to its fans, and each school sold about 4,000 tickets in the two days immediately following the announcement. Media covering Virginia Tech considered the rate of ticket sales to be slow because the Hokies had sold 50 percent more during a similar timeframe the previous year. Media following Cincinnati ticket sales considered the pace to be fast, calling the Orange Bowl game a "hot ticket". The $125 tickets sold by Cincinnati generated the largest amount of ticket sale revenue ever recorded by the Cincinnati Athletics Department, netting the school more than $500,000 in the first day of sales. Travel agencies offered packages including game tickets, airfare, and a hotel room to fans of both teams. Owing to the demand, fans were warned against the danger of counterfeit tickets.

In the days immediately following the announcement of the matchup, ticket sales diverged. By December 12, Cincinnati sold about 9,000 tickets. This total increased to approximately 13,000 tickets by December 20, and the school prepared multiple tour buses for a student convoy to the game. At Virginia Tech, meanwhile, sales lagged. In an effort to spur sales, Tech administrators had head football coach Frank Beamer star in a video asking Hokies fans to buy tickets to the game. Owing to limited demand for tickets, prices in the <a href="secondary%20market">secondary market</a> plunged.

As late as December 31, neither team had sold its entire allotment of 17,500 tickets. Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were large numbers of fans who avoided paying <a href="face%20value">face value</a> for tickets—<a href="US%20Dollar">US$</a>125—by buying them on the secondary market, often for as little as 99 <a href="Cent%20%28currency%29">cent</a>s.

Before the Orange Bowl, Cincinnati was ranked 50th (of 119 <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29%23Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision">Division I FBS</a> teams) in <a href="total%20offense">total offense</a>. The team was ranked 24th in passing offense, with the five quarterbacks pressed into service during the season averaging 254.1 passing yards per game. By the end of the season, Tony Pike emerged as Cincinnati's sole starting quarterback. He finished the regular season having completed 183 of 291 pass attempts for 2,168 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions. He ranked second in the Big East and 29th nationally in passing efficiency with a <a href="passer%20rating">passer rating</a> of 141.07.

Among Cincinnati receivers, there was none of the uncertainty that afflicted the Bearcats' quarterbacks. <a href="Wide%20receiver">Wide receiver</a> <a href="Mardy%20Gilyard">Mardy Gilyard</a> caught 74 passes during the regular season, setting a Cincinnati record with 1,118 receiving yards. He also had 10 touchdowns during the season, leading all Cincinnati players. Gilyard also played as the Bearcats' primary <a href="Kickoff%20returner">kick returner</a>. He returned 32 kicks, accumulating a school-record 897 yards and 2 touchdowns. Fellow wide receiver Dominick Goodman outpaced Gilyard in receptions with 78, but he had only 977 receiving yards and 7 touchdowns. On the first play of Cincinnati's game against Hawaii, Dominick injured his shoulder and his ability to play in the Orange Bowl was in doubt.

Cincinnati's ground offense was less statistically significant than its passing offense. It was led by <a href="running%20back">running back</a> Jacob Ramsey, who carried the ball 148 times for 630 yards and two touchdowns. Backup running back John Goebel had 124 rushing attempts for 581 yards and 7 touchdowns.

At the conclusion of the regular season before the Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech's offense was ranked among the worst in Division I, 107th among 119 teams. The Hokies averaged just 296 yards per game during the regular season, and during the ACC Championship Game—the last Tech game before the Orange Bowl—had created a season-low 234 yards of offense. Starting left <a href="Guard%20%28American%20football%29">guard</a> Nick Marshman was not expected to play after becoming academically ineligible following the fall semester, and was replaced by redshirt freshman Jaymes Brooks.

On the field, the Hokies' offense was led by quarterback <a href="Tyrod%20Taylor">Tyrod Taylor</a>, who completed 86 of his 151 pass attempts for 896 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions in the season before the Orange Bowl. He also carried the ball 132 times for a total gain of 691 yards and 6 touchdowns on the ground. As successful as Taylor was rushing the ball, Virginia Tech's offense on the ground was led by freshman running back <a href="Darren%20Evans">Darren Evans</a>, who set a Virginia Tech freshman record for rushing yards by accumulating 1,112 during the regular season. He also scored 10 touchdowns, was named a second-team All-ACC player, and finished second in the voting for the ACC's rookie of the year award. Evans became the sixth freshman in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference to rush for more than 1,000 yards and set a Virginia Tech single-game record for rushing yards when he ran for 253 yards in Tech's game against Maryland.

Entering the Orange Bowl, the Bearcats were ranked 26th in total defense, allowing an average of 316 yards per game to opposing offenses. Cincinnati was 26th in scoring defense, permitting an average of 20.2 points per game. The Bearcats were No. 1 in sacks among Big East teams, recording 35 during the season.

<a href="Defensive%20end">Defensive end</a> <a href="Connor%20Barwin">Connor Barwin</a> led the Bearcats' defense in sacks with 11, a figure that also was the highest in the Big East and No. 14 nationally. He finished the regular season with 48 tackles, a figure that included the 11 sacks. In recognition of his performance, he was named a first-team All-Big East selection, signifying his status as the best player at his position in the conference.

In the defensive secondary, the Bearcats were led by cornerback <a href="Mike%20Mickens">Mike Mickens</a> and safety <a href="Brandon%20Underwood">Brandon Underwood</a>. Mickens was a second-team All-Big East selection, and Underwood was a first-team All-Big East selection. Mickens was Cincinnati's career leader in interceptions and interception return yardage, and had 65 tackles (third on the team) despite missing three games due to injury. Underwood was fifth on the team in tackles with 60, and had 3 interceptions and 6 pass breakups.

The most notable player for Cincinnati, however, was <a href="Punter%20%28American%20football%29">punter</a> <a href="Kevin%20Huber">Kevin Huber</a>, who was named an Associated Press All-American and became the first player in Bearcats history to earn that honor in two consecutive years. Thanks to Huber's performance during the regular season, Cincinnati led the country in punting average (41.5 yards per kick) and was No. 1 in the Big East for the second consecutive year.

Virginia Tech's defense was considered among the best in Division I before the Orange Bowl. The Hokies were ranked seventh in total defense, allowing just 277.08 yards per game on average. Virginia Tech also was highly ranked in several other defensive categories: eighth in turnovers gained (30), 13th in scoring defense (17.46 points per game), 15th in pass defense (170.08 yards per game), and 19th in rushing defense (107.00 yards per game). The Hokies' defense also scored five defensive touchdowns during the regular season.

Tech's defense was led on the field by senior <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> <a href="Macho%20Harris">Victor "Macho" Harris</a>. During the regular season, Harris tied for fifth in the country in <a href="interception">interception</a>s with six, including two returned for touchdowns. He also had 44 tackles, and was named the top defensive player in the state of Virginia. At <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a>, Tech featured <a href="Orion%20Martin">Orion Martin</a>, a former <a href="Walk-on%20%28sport%20term%29">walk-on</a> who rose to a starting position and had 7.5 sacks, 13 tackles for loss, and 53 tackles during the regular season. Heading into the Orange Bowl, the Hokies' defense was afflicted by injuries. Defensive end <a href="Jason%20Worilds">Jason Worilds</a> had a shoulder injury. Starting <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> Brett Warren, who had 86 tackles, with 5 tackles for loss, 2 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions during the regular season, suffered a torn <a href="anterior%20cruciate%20ligament">anterior cruciate ligament</a> and was expected to miss the game.

The 2009 Orange Bowl <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kicked off</a> at 8:47 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Standard Time</a> (EST) at <a href="Dolphin%20Stadium">Dolphin Stadium</a> in <a href="Miami%20Gardens%2C%20Florida">Miami Gardens</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. An estimated total of 73,602 tickets were sold for the game, but bowl officials estimated 15,781 sold tickets went unused, giving a <a href="turnstile">turnstile</a> attendance of 57,821. The game was televised on <a href="Fox%20Sports%20%28USA%29">FOX</a>, and the <a href="Sportscaster">announcers</a> were <a href="Thom%20Brennaman">Thom Brennaman</a>, <a href="Charles%20Davis%20%28defensive%20back%29">Charles Davis</a>, and <a href="Chris%20Myers">Chris Myers</a>. An estimated 9.3 million viewers watched the broadcast, earning it a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 5.4. Figures on the total payout vary, but Virginia Tech and Cincinnati each received between $17 million and $18 million for playing in the Orange Bowl, an amount that was shared with the other teams in each school's athletic conference.

The ceremonial performance of the <a href="Star%20Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a> was played on trumpet by <a href="Arturo%20Sandoval">Arturo Sandoval</a>. At the start of the game, the weather was clear, with an air temperature of and relative humidity of 69 percent. The wind was from the northeast at . J. O'Neill was the referee, B. Neale was the umpire, and the linesman was J. Quinn. Orange Bowl Committee chairman Daniel Ponce performed the ceremonial pre-game <a href="Coin%20flipping">coin toss</a> to determine first possession. The toss was won by Virginia Tech, which elected to receive the ball to begin the second half, ensuring Cincinnati the right to receive the ball to begin the game.

Virginia Tech's opening kickoff was returned to the Cincinnati 28-yard line, where the Bearcats executed the game's first play, a five-yard run by <a href="running%20back">running back</a> John Goebel. On the next play, the Bearcats earned the game's initial first down with a 13-yard pass from <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> Tony Pike to <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> Dominick Goodman. Now at their 46-yard line, Pike then threw his second-longest completed pass of the game, a 38-yard pass to wide receiver Mardy Gilyard. The play advanced the Bearcats' offense to the Virginia Tech 16-yard line, and three plays later, Pike completed a 15-yard pass to Gilyard for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> and the game's first points. The <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a> kick by Cincinnati <a href="Placekicker">kicker</a> Jake Rogers was good, and with 13:08 remaining in the opening quarter, the Bearcats took a 7–0 lead over Virginia Tech.

Cincinnati's kickoff after the touchdown was returned to the Virginia Tech 24-yard line, and the Hokies prepared for their first offensive possession of the game. That play was a 27-yard run by wide receiver Dyrell Roberts, who ran an <a href="end-around">end-around</a> for the big gain. Now on the Cincinnati side of the field, Virginia Tech running Back Darren Evans ran for one yard, then Hokies quarterback Tyrod Taylor completed a 34-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale. The catch gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Cincinnati 14-yard line. On the first play following the long completion, Evans was tackled for a six-yard loss, pushing the Hokies back to the Bearcats' 20-yard line. On the next two plays, Tyrod Taylor rushed for a total of 11 yards, but was unable to gain another first down. Facing fourth down, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent kicker Dustin Keys into the game to attempt a 26-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a>. The kick sailed right of the uprights, however, and Virginia Tech was denied a scoring opportunity.

After the missed kick, Cincinnati's offense took to the field at their 20-yard line. The Bearcats were not able to gain a first down, however, and went <a href="three%20and%20out">three and out</a> before <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a>ing back to Virginia Tech. Following the kick, the Hokies started at their 16-yard line. Tech's first play of the drive was a 14-yard pass from Taylor to wide receiver Jarrett Boykin for a first down, but the Hokies were unable to gain another first down. Tech punted back to Cincinnati, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. The first play of the drive resulted in a short loss, but on the second play, Pike completed a 39-yard pass to Gilyard. The play advanced the Bearcats deep into Virginia Tech territory and gave them a first down. Despite the long play, Cincinnati was unable to gain another first down, and Rogers entered the game to attempt a 44-yard field goal. The kick was partially blocked and fell short, denying the Bearcats three points. With 3:07 remaining in the quarter, Cincinnati still held a 7–0 lead.

Following the missed field goal, Virginia Tech's offense took over at their 27-yard line, the spot from which the kick had been missed. Taylor completed a 12-yard pass to Coale, then Evans ran 11 yards, advancing the ball to the 50-yard line. After a pass from Taylor fell incomplete, he completed his next two attempts for a total gain of 19 yards and a first down. Virginia Tech then committed a five-yard <a href="False%20start%23American%20and%20Canadian%20football">false start penalty</a>, pushing the Hokies back to the Cincinnati 26-yard line. With time running out in the quarter, however, Virginia Tech running back Josh Oglesby made good the penalty with a 13-yard run to the Cincinnati 23-yard line. At the end of the first quarter, Cincinnati still led, 7–0.

The second quarter began with Virginia Tech in possession of the ball and facing a second down and two at the Cincinnati 24-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Cincinnati committed an <a href="Penalty%20%28American%20football%29%23List%20of%20penalties">offsides penalty</a>, giving the Hokies five yards and a first down. From the Bearcats' 19-yard line, Taylor completed a two-yard pass. On the next play, Taylor attempted to run forward with the ball, but <a href="Fumble%20%28American%20football%29">fumble</a>d before recovering the loose football. Now facing third down, Taylor scrambled 18 yards to the goal line for Virginia Tech's first touchdown of the game. The extra point kick by Keys was good, and with 13:00 remaining in the quarter, the game was tied at 7–7.

Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was returned to the Cincinnati 28-yard line, and the Bearcats' offense began its first possession of the second quarter. Pike threw an incomplete pass, then connected on a 10-yard throw for a first down. That gain was countered on the next play by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Bearcats. Cincinnati was unable to regain the yardage lost to the penalty and punted. Following the kick, Virginia Tech was similarly stymied by consecutive penalties and a <a href="Quarterback%20sack">sack</a> of Taylor by Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd. Tech punted, and the kick was returned by Cincinnati wide receiver D.J. Woods to the Virginia Tech 45-yard line. Despite starting in Virginia Tech's half of the field, Cincinnati was unable to capitalize and went three and out. The Bearcats' punt was downed at the Virginia Tech three-yard line, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field.

Despite being pinned against their own <a href="Goal%20line%20%28American%20football%29">goal line</a>, the Hokies initially had some success moving the ball. Taylor completed a two-yard pass, Evans ran for six yards, and Taylor ran for two yards on third down to earn a first down at the Tech 13-yard line. After a Tech <a href="Time-out%20%28sport%29%23Gridiron%20football">timeout</a>, Darren Evans ran for five yards. On the next play, he broke free for a 32-yard run, advancing the ball to the 50-yard line. The Hokies were unable to capitalize on Evans' run, however, as on the next play, a pass from Taylor was <a href="Interception">intercepted</a> by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood at the Cincinnati 28-yard line.

Cincinnati's offense took over at the spot of the interception and immediately began moving down the field. Pike completed three consecutive passes: a five-yard pass to Gilyard, a 10-yard throw to Goodman, then a 31-yard toss to Gilyard. After the long throw, Cincinnati had a first down at the Virginia Tech 26-yard line. The Bearcats continued their drive after an incomplete pass by Pike with an 18-yard completion to Goebel that gave the Bearcats a first down at the Virginia Tech eight-yard line. Two plays later, however, Cincinnati's drive came to an end when Virginia Tech defender Stephan Virgil intercepted a pass from Pike to a player in the <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a>, denying the Bearcats a chance to score. Virgil was downed in the end zone for a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>, and Virginia Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line after the turnover.

Tech's drive began with a completed pass for no gain to Evans. This was followed by a five-yard run by Evans and a 23-yard pass from Taylor to <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> Greg Boone for a first down at the Tech 48-yard line. Taylor then completed a nine-yard pass to Boone. After two plays were stopped for no gain, Taylor ran two yards for a first down, keeping the drive alive. With time running out in the first half, Taylor completed a nine-yard pass to Boone, then ran six yards for a first down at the Cincinnati 26-yard line. The Hokies then called another timeout to stop the clock with three seconds remaining in the quarter. Tech kicker Dustin Keys returned to the game, and as time expired in the first half, he kicked a 43-yard field goal that gave the Hokies a 10–7 lead.

Following a <a href="halftime">halftime</a> musical performance by <a href="The%20Doobie%20Brothers">The Doobie Brothers</a>, the second half began. Because Cincinnati received the ball to begin the game, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half.

The Bearcats' kickoff was returned to the Tech 14-yard line, and the Hokies began the first drive of the third quarter. Evans rushed for four yards, but Oglesby lost four yards on a run during the next play. Facing third and ten, Taylor picked up the first down with an 11-yard run, but fumbled the ball at the end of the play. The loose ball was scooped up by Boone, who kept the Hokies' drive going at the Tech 30-yard line. After the fumble, Evans ran for seven yards and Taylor completed a 10-yard pass to Roberts for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Coale then rushed for seven yards on an end-around, and his run was followed by one by Boone, who ran for 16 yards and a first down at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. Two more rushes by Roberts and Evans resulted in another first down, but once the Hokies passed the Cincinnati 20-yard line, the Bearcats' defense stiffened and denied the Hokies another first down. Facing fourth down, Tech again sent in Keys, who kicked a 35-yard field goal. The kick extended Tech's lead to 13–7 with 8:32 remaining in the quarter.

Following Virginia Tech's kickoff, Cincinnati began its first drive of the second half at its 36-yard line. Pike was stopped for no gain on a rushing attempt, then attempted a long pass downfield. The ball was intercepted by Virginia Tech defender <a href="Kam%20Chancellor">Kam Chancellor</a>, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field after just two Cincinnati plays. Tech's first play after the interception resulted in Taylor being sacked by Cincinnati defender Brandon Underwood for a loss of three yards, but Darren Evans made up the lost yardage by rushing 14 yards to the Tech 43-yard line for a first down. Taylor and Evans alternated short rushes, then Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale for another first down, this one at the Cincinnati 47-yard line. Once in Cincinnati territory, however, the Hokies' offense faltered. Evans was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Taylor was sacked again, this time by John Hughes. A long pass attempt fell incomplete, and Tech punted for the first time in the second half. Returner Danny Milligan fumbled the ball, but he recovered the loose ball and returned it to the Cincinnati 20-yard line.

The Bearcats' second possession of the second half was more successful than their first. On the first play of the drive, running back Jacob Ramsey broke free of the Tech defense for a 25-yard run, the longest run of any Cincinnati player in the game. He followed that first-down run by gaining eight more yards on consecutive runs. Pike then ran three yards for a first down at the Tech 44-yard line. There, however, Cincinnati's offense sputtered and could not gain another first down. The Bearcats' punted, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Tech 14-yard line with six seconds remaining in the quarter. The Hokies had time for one play, a 21-yard run by Evans to the Tech 35-yard line. With one quarter remaining, Virginia Tech had a 13–7 lead over Cincinnati.

The fourth quarter began with Virginia Tech in possession of the ball and facing a first down at their 35-yard line. The first play of the quarter resulted in a 20-yard gain by Evans on a running play. After that, however, the Hokies did not gain another first down and punted to Cincinnati. Following the kick, the Bearcats started their first possession of the fourth quarter at their 14-yard line. Running back <a href="Isaiah%20Pead">Isaiah Pead</a> ran for three yards, but then a pass by Pike was intercepted at the 10-yard line by Tech defender Orion Martin. Three rushing plays later, Evans ran six yards for a touchdown. The extra point kick was good, and with 11:29 remaining in the game, Virginia Tech took a 20–7 lead.

The Tech kickoff was returned 17 yards by Gilyard to the Cincinnati 40-yard line, giving the Bearcats good field position to start their drive. Two rushes by Goebel resulted in 11 yards and a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. This success on the ground was followed by more through the air, as Pike completed three consecutive passes: a 16-yarder to Gilyard, a 3-yarder to Goodman, and a 14-yarder to Gilyard. Goebel then ran five yards to the Tech 11-yard line. Two Pike passes fell incomplete, setting up fourth down. Rather than attempt to kick a field goal, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly ordered the offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. This was done when Pike completed a seven-yard pass to Goodman for a first down at the Virginia Tech four-yard line. Two more Pike passes fell incomplete before Goebel rushed three yards to the Virginia Tech one-yard line. Cincinnati again faced a fourth down, and again, Kelly elected to attempt to score a touchdown rather than kick a field goal. Pike attempted to cross the goal line on a running play, but was stopped by the Virginia Tech defense. With 7:25 remaining in the game, Cincinnati <a href="Turnover%20on%20downs">turned the ball over on downs</a> to the Virginia Tech offense, which returned to the field.

With a firm lead and now in possession of the ball, Virginia Tech began to <a href="Running%20out%20the%20clock%23American%20football">run out the clock</a> by executing short rushing plays up the center of the field. Since the game clock does not stop in American college football if a player remains in bounds short of the first down marker, the Hokies could hasten the end of the game and preserve their lead by following this strategy. From their one-yard line, Taylor ran the ball for a one-yard gain, followed by two rushes by Evans for another four yards. The Hokies prepared to punt the ball, but during the kick, Cincinnati committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty by tackling Tech <a href="Punter%20%28American%20football%29">punter</a> <a href="Brent%20Bowden%20%28American%20football%29">Brent Bowden</a>. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down and kept their drive going. From the Tech 21-yard line, Evans was stopped for a loss of one yard, but broke free for an 11-yard gain and a first down on the next play. As the clock continued to tick down, Cincinnati began to use its timeouts in an effort to stop the clock after each play. This strategy was partially successful, as Tech was denied another first down and punted with 2:31 remaining in the game.

The kick was returned to the Cincinnati 48-yard line, and the Bearcats prepared for a desperation drive in hopes of narrowing the Hokies' lead. On the first play after the punt, however, Pike threw an interception to Virginia Tech defender Cody Grimm. Back in possession of the ball, Taylor <a href="Quarterback%20kneel">kneeled on the ball</a> four times to wind down the game clock. After the final kneeldown, Virginia Tech secured the 20–7 win.

In recognition of his performance during the game, Virginia Tech running back Darren Evans was named the game's most valuable player. Evans finished the game with 28 carries for 158 yards and a touchdown. He also caught two passes for five yards, set a Virginia Tech bowl-game record for carries, and tied the Tech record for rushing yards. Evans finished the season with 1,265 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns–both marks were Virginia Tech records for a freshman. On the opposite side of the ball, Cincinnati's rushing offense was led by Jacob Ramsey, who finished the game with 4 carries for 34 yards. Cincinnati's John Goebel had nine carries but only accumulated 26 rushing yards.

Most of the Bearcats' offense came through the air, however. Cincinnati quarterback Tony Pike finished the game having completed 16 of his 33 pass attempts, resulting in 239 passing yards, 1 touchdown, and 4 interceptions. Pike also ran the ball five times for four yards. Pike's four interceptions were a career-high and marked only the second time he threw more than one interception in a game. For Virginia Tech, quarterback Tyrod Taylor finished the game with 13 completions from 22 pass attempts, resulting in 140 passing yards and 1 interception. In addition to his passing, Taylor ran with the ball 15 times, gaining 47 yards and a touchdown in the process.

Taylor's favorite passing targets were wide receiver Danny Coale, who finished the game having caught three passes for 52 yards, and tight end Greg Boone, who caught 3 balls for 41 yards. On the Bearcats' side of the field, Cincinnati's Mardy Gilyard led all receivers with 7 catches for 158 yards and a touchdown. Gilyard's receiving total was his best of the season and set a new Cincinnati bowl-game record. He also set a Bearcat bowl-game record for kickoff return yardage, recording 97 yards in that category. Fellow Cincinnati receiver Dominick Goodman caught 6 passes for 51 yards, in the process becoming Cincinnati's all-time leader in career receiving yards.

The two teams' defenses also performed statistically well during the game. Cincinnati's Terrill Byrd led all defenders by recording 11 tackles during the game. Included in that total were four tackles for loss, including one sack. That performance was his best in terms of quantity during the season, and his four tackles for loss moved him into sixth place on Cincinnati's list of career tackles for loss leaders. For the Hokies, Dorian Porch had eight tackles, leading all Tech players. Cody Grimm, Orion Martin, Stephan Virgil, and Kam Chancellor each recorded one interception. The four interceptions were a Tech bowl-game record, and Chancellor's catch gave him six for the season, tying him with Victor Harris for the most on the team. It was the first time since 1968 that two Virginia Tech players had six interceptions apiece. Cincinnati's sole interception came at the hands of Brandon Underwood, who tallied his third of the season.

Each team found success on <a href="special%20teams">special teams</a> as well. Cincinnati punter Kevin Huber, a first-team All-American, kicked the ball four times, averaging 45.8 yards per punt. A 56-yard punt in the first quarter marked the ninth consecutive game he had a kick of at least 50 yards. Virginia Tech placekicker Dustin Keys missed his first field goal attempt of the game but successfully converted his next two kicks, giving him 23 field goals and the Tech single-season record in that category.

Virginia Tech's victory raised it to a final record of 10–4, while Cincinnati's loss dropped it to a record of 11–3. The Hokies' 10-win season was the fifth consecutive year in which Tech recorded at least 10 wins, a feat matched only by the <a href="USC%20Trojans%20football">University of Southern California</a> and the <a href="Texas%20Longhorns%20football">University of Texas</a> during the same time period. As a reward for coaching the Hokies to an ACC Championship and an Orange Bowl championship, Virginia Tech coaches were given hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses.

In Miami, hoteliers and Dolphins Stadium had to quickly prepare for the arrival of <a href="2008%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team">Oklahoma</a> and <a href="2008%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team">Florida</a>, the two teams that played in the <a href="2009%20BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">2009 BCS National Championship Game</a> one week after the Orange Bowl. Signs were changed, the playing field was repainted, and accommodations were prepared for the thousands of expected spectators. In total, South Florida's economy received an estimated $220 million boost from visitors who arrived to watch the two games.

In the postseason that followed the Bearcats' loss to Virginia Tech, Cincinnati assistant head coach and defensive line coach Keith Gilmore resigned to accept the position of defensive line coach at the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois">University of Illinois</a>. To replace Gilmore, Cincinnati promoted special teams coach Mike Elston, who assumed assistant coaching and defensive line duties. In February, Cincinnati defensive coordinator Joe Tresey was fired by the school. He subsequently was hired by the <a href="USF%20Bulls%20football">University of South Florida</a> to fill that school's vacant defensive coordinator position. Replacing Tresey is Virginia defensive coordinator <a href="Bob%20Diaco">Bob Diaco</a>.

As the final game of the 2008–2009 regular season, the 2009 Orange Bowl gave Virginia Tech and Cincinnati players a chance to show their skills before the <a href="2009%20NFL%20Draft">2009 NFL Draft</a>. Cincinnati had six players selected in the draft. Defensive end Connor Barwin was the first Bearcats player taken. He was picked in the second round, 46th overall. He was followed by punter Kevin Huber (142nd overall), cornerback <a href="DeAngelo%20Smith">DeAngelo Smith</a> (143rd), cornerback <a href="Brandon%20Underwood">Brandon Underwood</a> (187th), cornerback <a href="Mike%20Mickens">Mike Mickens</a> (227th), and guard <a href="Trevor%20Canfield">Trevor Canfield</a> (254th). Several Cincinnati players were signed as <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a>s after the draft. These included defensive tackle Adam Hoppel, linebacker Corey Smith, and offensive lineman Khalil El-Amin.

Virginia Tech had just one player taken in the 2009 draft: cornerback Victor Harris, who was picked by the Philadelphia Eagles with the 157th overall selection. Four Hokies were taken as free-agent selections after the draft. Defensive end Orion Martin, quarterback Sean Glennon, center Ryan Shuman, and fullback Devin Perez were signed to try out for various NFL teams.

Alister Murdoch

<a href="Air%20Marshal%20%28Australia%29">Air Marshal</a> Sir Alister Murray Murdoch, (9 December 1912 – 29 November 1984) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) from 1965 to 1969. Joining the Air Force in 1930, Murdoch trained as a seaplane pilot, and participated in an <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> rescue mission for lost explorers in 1935. During World War II, he commanded <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B221%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 221 Squadron RAF</a> in Europe and the Middle East, and later occupied senior positions on the staff of RAAF formations in the South West Pacific. His post-war appointments included Commandant of <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a> from 1952 to 1953, <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Training Command</a> from 1953 to 1955, <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1958 to 1959, and AOC <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Operational Command</a> from 1962 to 1965.

As AOC Training Command in 1954, Murdoch headed a program to determine aircraft purchases for the RAAF; his recommendations included the <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> transport, considered one of the most important acquisitions in the Air Force's history. His term as CAS coincided with increased commitment to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, and he came into conflict with <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> commanders over the employment of helicopters in battle. He was also involved in assessing the readiness of the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> for RAAF service. Appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1960 and <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1966, Murdoch was the fourth in a series of CASs who had been cadets at the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>. He retired from the Air Force in December 1969, and died in 1984.

Alister Murdoch was born on 9 December 1912 in <a href="Elsternwick%2C%20Victoria">Elsternwick</a>, Victoria, the son of engineer <a href="Thomas%20Murdoch%20%28engineer%29">Thomas Murdoch</a> and his wife Kathleen. A <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Commonwealth Military Forces</a> at the time of Alister's birth, Thomas was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> in World War I, and rose to the rank of <a href="brigadier%20%28Australia%29">brigardier</a> as Director General of Engineer Services in World War II. Educated at <a href="Caulfield%20Grammar%20School">Caulfield Grammar School</a>, Alister entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1929, following his elder brother <a href="Ian%20Thomas%20Murdoch">Ian</a> (later a <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">major general</a>). Alister was one of four cadets sponsored that year by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), which did not at that stage have its own officer training college. Budgetary constraints imposed during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> necessitated the transfer of these cadets out of Duntroon midway through their four-year course. Although offered positions in the <a href="Australian%20Public%20Service">Australian Public Service</a> or nominations for short-term commissions with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, all were determined to serve with the RAAF and were more than pleased with the prospect of entering their chosen service early.

Murdoch enlisted in the Air Force on 10 December 1930, and completed his pilot training the following year. He was commissioned in 1932 and later qualified as a flying instructor and seaplane pilot, undertaking <a href="Navy">navy cooperation</a> and <a href="maritime%20patrol">maritime patrol</a> operations. In December 1935, <a href="Flying%20Officer">Flying Officer</a> Murdoch was selected to join an RAAF rescue mission for explorer <a href="Lincoln%20Ellsworth">Lincoln Ellsworth</a> and his pilot, <a href="Herbert%20Hollick-Kenyon">Herbert Hollick-Kenyon</a>, who were presumed lost while journeying across the <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a>. Flying a <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland Gipsy Moth</a>, Murdoch located Hollick-Kenyon near the <a href="Bay%20of%20Whales">Bay of Whales</a>. Hollick-Kenyon led the search party to Ellsworth, who protested that he was not lost and did not need rescuing. Murdoch was posted to England in 1936–37 to undertake a course in long <a href="navigation">navigation</a> at <a href="RAF%20Manston">RAF Manston</a> and serve on attachment with <a href="No.%20114%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 114 Squadron</a>. Returning to Australia, he married Florence Miller on 27 December 1937; the couple had a daughter. Murdoch spent the next two years on the staff of the Directorate of Operations and Intelligence at Air Force Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. In June 1938, he helped inaugurate RAAF instruction in long navigation, with a nine-month course in the discipline.

Ranked <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> at the outbreak of World War II, Murdoch took charge of <a href="List%20of%20British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan%20facilities%20in%20Australia%23Air%20Observer%20Schools">No. 1 Air Observer School</a> at <a href="Cootamundra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cootamundra</a>, New South Wales, from April 1940 until mid-1941. Following this posting he was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> and sent to the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European Theatre</a>. In August 1941, he became <a href="Commanding%20Officer">Commanding Officer</a> of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B221%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 221 Squadron RAF</a>, a <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">Coastal Command</a> unit flying <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a>s on reconnaissance and <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine</a> patrols out of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>. The next year, Murdoch accompanied the squadron to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20Theatre">Middle East</a>, where it carried out anti-submarine and maritime strike operations. He also served as Staff Officer Operations with No. 235 Wing RAF. Back in London in July 1942, Murdoch was assigned to <a href="Combined%20Operations%20Headquarters">Combined Operations Headquarters</a>, where he assisted in planning the <a href="Dieppe%20Raid">Dieppe Raid</a> before returning to Australia in 1943.

Promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, Murdoch was appointed Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO) at <a href="Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Eastern Area Command</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, in July 1943. In January 1944, he became SASO at <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Command</a>, which controlled thirteen Australian, British, Dutch, and American squadrons from its headquarters in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. Murdoch planned many of the command's bombing and mining operations in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Theatre</a>, and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for his "distinguished service" in the role. He was posted as SASO to the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> (No. 1 TAF) in April 1945, replacing Group Captain William Gibson after the latter's dismissal in the wake of the "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>", when the threatened resignations of eight of the RAAF's leading <a href="Flying%20ace">fighter aces</a> caused a crisis in the formation's leadership. Delegated operational responsibility by No. 1 TAF's new <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a>, Air Commodore <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, Murdoch received much of the credit for the "excellent" planning of the RAAF's role in Operation Oboe Six, the <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">invasion of Labuan</a>. He accompanied Scherger ashore on the afternoon of the landings on 10 June 1945. Murdoch was also praised for his staff work during Operation Oboe Two, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29">Battle of Balikpapan</a>, in July.

Murdoch was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) on 25 June 1946 for "conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese" during World War II. One of a small coterie of officers earmarked for top positions in the post-war Air Force, he was Director of Personnel Services in 1946–47 before attending the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a>, London, in 1948. Returning to Australia, he served as Director of Air Staff Policy and Plans at Air Force Headquarters between 1949 and 1952. In February 1951, he led a team to the Middle East, where the possibility of Australia contributing a garrison force to the region was first raised. Two years later, <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a> was deployed to Malta to fulfil this role, operating leased RAF <a href="de%20Havilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jet fighters. Murdoch became Commandant of <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a> in June 1952, gaining promotion to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>. In December 1953, he was raised to acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> and appointed <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Training Command</a>.
In 1954, Murdoch led a mission to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft for the RAAF, following a shift in defence funding towards the Air Force. He advocated the <a href="Lockheed%20F-104%20Starfighter">F-104 Starfighter</a> as a replacement for the <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a>, two years before the Sabre entered squadron service with the RAAF, as well as <a href="Nuclear%20warfare">nuclear-capable</a> British <a href="V%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bbomber">V bomber</a> strike aircraft to augment Australia's <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">Canberra</a> jet bombers, and <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> transports to replace the <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">C-47 Dakota</a>. Although his proposals for V bombers and the F-104 were not taken up, the Australian government acquired the C-130 in 1958. Described as second only to the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111">General Dynamics F-111</a> as the "most significant" purchase by the RAAF, the Hercules gave the Air Force its first <a href="Airlift%23Strategic%20airlift">strategic airlift</a> capability, which in years to come would provide a "lifeline" for Australian forces deployed to <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malaya</a>, <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a>, and other parts of South East Asia. Murdoch also recommended the locally built Vampire as a jet trainer for <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Applied Flying Training School</a>; sixty-nine were later delivered as T35s by the <a href="de%20Havilland">de Havilland</a> factory in <a href="Bankstown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bankstown</a>, New South Wales.

Murdoch was seconded to the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a> in January 1956 as Deputy Secretary (Military). By February 1958, he had been made a substantive air vice marshal and appointed <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>. In October 1959, Murdoch was posted to London as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff, and appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the 1960 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. He returned to Australia in June 1962, when he became AOC <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Operational Command</a>. His tenure in the position coincided with the deployment of the first RAAF aircraft to <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>, seven <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">DHC-4 Caribou</a>s, commencing in August 1964. Murdoch was promoted <a href="air%20marshal">air marshal</a> and appointed <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS) on 1 June 1965, succeeding Air Marshal <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Sir Valston Hancock</a>. He was the last of a quartet of army-trained CASs; from 1954 to 1969 inclusive, every RAAF chief—<a href="John%20McCauley%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">John McCauley</a>, Scherger, Hancock, and Murdoch—had been a cadet at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, prior to serving with the Air Force. With this pedigree, Murdoch was described by Air Chief Marshal Scherger as "the last of the professionals". The new CAS was raised to <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) in the 1966 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>.

Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF through the build-up of Australia's commitment to the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS), Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28Australian%20Army%20officer%29">Sir John Wilton</a>, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two <a href="Bell%20UH-1%20Iroquois">UH-1 Iroquois</a> helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact that two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation.
He further contended that helicopter operations in Malaysia had afforded the RAAF sufficient experience in the type of conditions they might face in Vietnam, though Australia's senior UH-1 pilot at the time considered that the former theatre offered "little if any hostile opposition, and there was none of the insertion and extraction of <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">SAS</a> patrols which was to become such an important part of the RAAF's Vietnam operations". Air Commodore <a href="Brian%20Eaton">Brian Eaton</a>, as Director-General of Operational Requirements, advised Murdoch that if the Air Force did not more fully satisfy the ground support requirements of the Army, then the Army itself would seek to take control of this sphere of operations, undermining the RAAF's position as the main provider of Australia's air power. Murdoch's reluctance to deploy the helicopters was eventually overridden by the Australian government, and <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 9 Squadron</a>'s UH-1s were in action in Vietnam less than a year later. When Murdoch visited the combat zone himself in August 1966, he was informed by Brigadier <a href="Oliver%20David%20Jackson">David Jackson</a> that the squadron was not performing the role the Army expected of it.
Wilton's successor as CGS, Lieutenant General <a href="Thomas%20Daly%20%28general%29">Sir Thomas Daly</a>, urged Murdoch to procure specialised <a href="Attack%20helicopter">helicopter gunship</a>s such as the <a href="Bell%20AH-1%20Cobra">AH-1 HueyCobra</a> for Vietnam, to support the more vulnerable troop-carrying "slicks". Murdoch largely ignored the suggestion, telling his staff to treat the Army's recommendation with a lesser priority than "anything we now have on our 'shopping list. His preference was for <a href="Vertical/Short%20Takeoff%20and%20Landing">V/STOL</a> fixed-wing aircraft like the <a href="Harrier%20Jump%20Jet">Harrier Jump Jet</a>, which he thought would open a "new era in <a href="close%20air%20support">close support</a> aircraft". In the event, the Federal government earmarked eleven AH-1G HueyCobras for purchase in 1971, though the deal never went ahead due to Australia's withdrawal from South East Asia. Murdoch's failure to appreciate the need for cooperation with land forces has been blamed for fostering long-running enmity between the services, which twenty years later would contribute to the government's decision to transfer the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to the Army. Air Force historian Alan Stephens contended that despite Murdoch's "competence" and "good mind", his "comprehension of air power in its fullest sense and handling of inter-service politics were respectively inadequate and disastrous ... A generation of lieutenant-colonels and majors had come to believe that the RAAF did not care about army support, and they were to carry that belief into the 1970s and beyond". Murdoch also opposed sending Canberra jet bombers to Vietnam on what were later described in the official post-war history of the RAAF as "misleading" grounds that the type was unsuitable for low-level strike and close support; their deployment went ahead in April 1967.

In 1963, Australia had selected the F-111 <a href="Variable-sweep%20wing">swing-wing</a> bomber as a replacement for the Canberra. Murdoch attended the much-anticipated official hand-over ceremony for the aircraft on 4 September 1968 at <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth</a>, Texas, with Defence Minister <a href="Allen%20Fairhall">Sir Allen Fairhall</a>, various US dignitaries, and RAAF F-111 crews. Within eight days a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a> F-111B crashed, followed by a <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF</a> F-111A twelve days later, creating a "public relations disaster", and contributing to the type's entry into RAAF service being delayed until 1973. In late 1969, Murdoch accompanied Secretary of Defence Sir Henry Bland to the United States to gain assurance of an adequate "safe life" for the F-111's swing-wing mechanism, amid the Australian government giving serious consideration to abandoning the program.

Murdoch retired from the military on 31 December 1969 after completing his term as CAS, which the government had extended for a further twelve months beyond its original three years. He was succeeded by Air Marshal <a href="Colin%20Hannah">Colin Hannah</a>, whom Murdoch had earlier recommended for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam (the role went to an Army officer, as had been previous practice). In 1971, Murdoch joined the board of directors of Meggitt Limited, an <a href="Vegetable%20fats%20and%20oils">oilseed-crushing</a> firm that was chaired by World War II fighter ace <a href="Nicky%20Barr">Nicky Barr</a>. Murdoch continued to exercise his interest in Australia's defence after he left the Air Force, joining in 1975 a group of pundits, including retired Air Vice Marshal <a href="Ian%20Dougald%20McLachlan">Ian McLachlan</a>, who promoted augmenting the country's arsenal with <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>ry. He also followed sport, including horse racing. A resident of <a href="Church%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Church Point</a>, New South Wales, Sir Alister Murdoch died on 29 November 1984.

Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3

Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was a <a href="rubble%20masonry">rubble masonry</a> stone <a href="arch%20bridge">arch bridge</a> over <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20%28Loyalsock%20Creek%29">Plunketts Creek</a> in <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plunketts Creek Township</a>, <a href="Lycoming%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lycoming County</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. It was built between 1840 and 1875, probably closer to 1840, when the road along the creek between the <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> villages of Barbours and Proctor was constructed. Going upstream from the mouth, the bridge was the third to cross the creek, hence its name.

The bridge was long, with an arch that spanned , a deck wide, and a roadway width of . It carried a single lane of traffic. In the 19th century, the bridge and its road were used by the <a href="logging">lumber</a>, <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">leather</a>, and <a href="bituminous%20coal">coal</a> industries active along the creek. By the early 20th century, these industries had almost entirely left, and the villages declined. The area the bridge served reverted mostly to <a href="secondary%20forest">second growth forest</a> and it was used to access <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> and a state <a href="common%20pheasant">pheasant</a> farm.

Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was considered "significant as an intact example of mid-19th century stone arch bridge construction", and was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) on June 22, 1988. Although it was repaired after a major flood in 1918, a record flood on January 21, 1996, severely damaged the bridge, and it was demolished in March 1996. Before the 1996 flood about 450 vehicles crossed it each day. Later that year, a replacement bridge was built and the old stone structure was documented by the <a href="Historic%20American%20Buildings%20Survey">Historic American Engineering Record</a>. It was removed from the NRHP on July 22, 2002.

Plunketts Creek is in the <a href="West%20Branch%20Susquehanna%20River">West Branch Susquehanna River</a> <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a>, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a>, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. The West Branch Susquehanna River valley was subsequently under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who invited displaced tribes, including the <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> (Delaware) and <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> to live in the lands vacated by the Susquehannocks. The <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> (1754–1763) led to the migration of many <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> westward to the Ohio River basin. On November 5, 1768, the <a href="British%20Empire">British</a> acquired the <a href="New%20Purchase%20%281768%29">New Purchase</a> from the Iroquois in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a>, including what is now Plunketts Creek. The first settlement along the creek by European colonists took place between 1770 and 1776.

Plunketts Creek is named for <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> William Plunkett, a <a href="physician">physician</a>, who was the first <a href="Chief%20Justice">president judge</a> of <a href="Northumberland%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland County</a> after it was formed in 1772. During conflicts with Native Americans, he treated wounded <a href="American%20pioneer">settlers</a> and fought the natives. Plunkett led a Pennsylvania expedition in the <a href="Pennamite-Yankee%20War">Pennamite-Yankee War</a> to forcibly remove settlers from <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, who had claimed and settled on lands in the <a href="Wyoming%20Valley">Wyoming Valley</a> also claimed by Pennsylvania. For his services, Plunkett was granted six tracts of land that totaled on November 14, 1776, although the land was not actually surveyed until September 1783. Plunkett's land included the creek's <a href="river%20delta">mouth</a>, so Plunketts Creek was given his name. He died in 1791, aged about 100, and was buried in <a href="Northumberland%2C%20Pennsylvania">Northumberland</a> without a grave marker or monument (except for the creek that bears his name).

Lycoming County was formed from Northumberland County in 1795. When <a href="Plunketts%20Creek%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plunketts Creek Township</a> was formed in Lycoming County in 1838, the original name proposed was "Plunkett Township", but Plunkett's lack of active support for the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> some years earlier had led some to believe his loyalty lay with the British Empire. The lingering suspicion of his <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">loyalist</a> sympathies led to the proposed name being rejected. Naming the township for the creek rather than its namesake was seen as an acceptable compromise.

In 1832, John Barbour built a <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> on Loyalsock Creek near the mouth of Plunketts Creek. This developed into the village of Barbours Mills, today known as Barbours. In the 19th century, Barbours had several <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a>s, a <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a> hotel, <a href="post%20office">post office</a>, many sawmills, a school, store and wagon maker. In 1840, a road was built north from Barbours along Plunketts Creek, crossing it several times. This is the earliest possible date for construction of the bridge, but the surviving county road docket on the construction mentions neither bridges nor <a href="ford%20%28river%29">fords</a> for crossing the creek.
The bridge is at the mouth of Coal Mine <a href="Valley%23Hollows">Hollow</a>, and the road it was on was used by the <a href="logging">lumber</a> and <a href="bituminous%20coal">coal</a> industries that were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Creeks in the township supplied <a href="hydropower">water power</a> to 14 mills in 1861, and by 1876 there were 19 sawmills, a <a href="shake%20%28shingle%29">shingle</a> mill, a <a href="wool">wool</a>en factory, and a <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tannery</a>. By the latter half of the 19th century, these industries supported the inhabitants of two villages in Plunketts Creek Township.

In 1868 the village of Proctorville was founded as a <a href="company%20town">company town</a> for Thomas E. Proctor's tannery, which was completed in 1873. Proctor, as it is now known, is north of Barbours along Plunketts Creek, and the main road to it crossed the bridge. The bark from <a href="Tsuga%20canadensis">eastern hemlock</a> trees was used in the tanning process, and the village originally sat in the midst of vast forests of hemlock. The tannery employed "several hundred" workers at wages between 50 cents and $1.75 a day. These employees lived in 120 company houses, which each cost $2 a month to rent. In 1892, Proctor had a barber shop, two blacksmiths, cigar stand, <a href="Independent%20Order%20of%20Odd%20Fellows">Independent Order of Odd Fellows</a> hall, leather shop, news stand, a post office (established in 1885), a two-room school, two stores, and a wagon shop.

The road between Barbours and Proctor crosses Plunketts Creek four times and the four bridges are numbered in order, starting from the southernmost in Barbours near the mouth and going upstream. While evidence such as maps indicates that the third bridge was constructed close to 1840, the first definitive proof of its existence is a survey to relocate the road between the second and third bridges in 1875. The first bridge over Plunketts Creek was replaced with a <a href="covered%20bridge">covered bridge</a> in 1880, and the second bridge was replaced in 1886. That same year, the road between the second and third bridges was moved again, returning to its original position on the west side of the creek.

Finished sole leather was hauled over the bridge by horse-drawn wagon south about to Little Bear Creek, where it was exchanged for "green" <a href="Hide%20%28skin%29">hides</a> and other supplies brought north from <a href="Montoursville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Montoursville</a>. These were then hauled north across the bridge into Proctor. The hides, which were tanned to make leather, came from the United States, and as far away as <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, and <a href="China">China</a>. Hemlock bark, used in the tanning process, was hauled to the tannery from up to away in both summer and winter, using wagons and sleds. The lumber boom on Plunketts Creek ended when the virgin timber ran out. By 1898, the <a href="old%20growth%20forest">old growth hemlock</a> was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk Tanning Company, was closed and dismantled.

Small-scale lumbering continued in the watershed in the 20th century, but the last logs were floated under the bridge down Plunketts Creek to Loyalsock Creek in 1905. In 1918, a flood on the creek damaged the road for on both sides of the bridge, and caused "settling and cracking of the bridge itself". The bridge had needed repairs and reconstruction. In 1931, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed legislation that gave the state responsibility for the costs of road and bridge maintenance for many highways belonging to local municipalities. This took effect in 1932, relieving Plunketts Creek Township and Lycoming County of the responsibility.

Without timber and the tannery, the populations of Proctor and Barbours declined, as did traffic on the road and bridges between them. The Barbours post office closed in the 1930s and the Proctor post office closed on July 1, 1953. Both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses. Proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968, and a 1970 newspaper article on its 39th annual "Proctor Homecoming" reunion called it a "near-deserted old tannery town". In the 1980s, the last store in Barbours closed, and the former hotel (which had become a hunting club) was torn down to make way for a new bridge across Loyalsock Creek.

Plunketts Creek has been a place for lumber and tourism since its villages were founded, and as industry declined, nature recovered. <a href="secondary%20forest">Second growth forests</a> have since covered most of the clear-cut land. Pennsylvania's state legislature authorized the acquisition of abandoned and clear-cut land for <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20Game%20Lands">Pennsylvania State Game Lands</a> in 1919, and the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Game%20Commission">Pennsylvania Game Commission</a> (PGC) acquired property along Plunketts Creek for State Game Lands Number 134 between 1937 and 1945. The main entrance to State Game Lands 134 is just north of the bridge site, on the east side of the creek.

The PGC established the Northcentral State Game Farm in 1945 on part of State Game Lands 134 to raise wild turkey. The farm was converted to <a href="common%20pheasant">ringneck pheasant</a> production in 1981, and, as of 2007, it was one of four Pennsylvania state game farms that produced about 200,000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting. The Northcentral State Game Farm is chiefly in the Plunketts Creek valley, just south of Proctor and north of the bridge. The opening weekend of the trout season brings more people into the village of Barbours at the mouth of Plunketts Creek than any other time of the year.

On June 22, 1988, the bridge was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP), as part of the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%23Multiple%20Property%20Submission">Multiple Property Submission</a> (MPS) of Highway Bridges Owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, TR. The MPS included 135 bridges owned by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> (PennDOT), 58 of which were of the stone arch type. While the individual NRHP form for the bridge cites a 1932 inspection report (the year that the state took over its maintenance), the MPS form mistakenly gives the bridge's date of construction as 1932.

In January 1996, there was major flooding throughout Pennsylvania. The 1995–1996 early winter was unusually cold, and considerable ice buildup formed in local streams. A <a href="North%20American%20blizzard%20of%201996">major blizzard</a> on January 6–8 produced up to of snow, which was followed on January 19–21 by more than of rain with temperatures as high as and winds up to . The rain and snowmelt caused flooding throughout Pennsylvania and <a href="Ice%20jam">ice jams</a> made this worse on many streams. Elsewhere in Lycoming County, flooding on <a href="Lycoming%20Creek">Lycoming Creek</a> in and near <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Pennsylvania">Williamsport</a> killed six people and caused millions of dollars in damage.

On Plunketts Creek, ice jams led to record flooding, which caused irreparable major damage to the mid-19th century stone arch bridge. Downstream in Barbours, the waters were deep in what was then called the village's "worst flood in history". Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was one of two destroyed in Lycoming County, and on January 31 a photograph of the damaged bridge was featured on the front page of the "<a href="Williamsport%20Sun-Gazette">Williamsport Sun-Gazette</a>" with the caption "This old stone arch bridge over Plunketts Creek must be replaced." In neighboring <a href="Sullivan%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sullivan County</a>, the <a href="Sonestown%20Covered%20Bridge">Sonestown Covered Bridge</a>, also on the NRHP, was so damaged by the flood that it remained closed for repairs until late December 1996. Throughout Pennsylvania, these floods led to 20 deaths and 69 municipal- or state-owned bridges being either "destroyed or closed until inspections could verify their safety".

When it became clear that the bridge could not be repaired, PennDOT awarded an emergency contract for a temporary bridge before the end of January, citing "emergency vehicles that can no longer travel directly from Barbours" to Proctor and beyond. The temporary bridge cost $87,000 and was wide. The photographs for the bridge's inclusion in the <a href="Historic%20American%20Buildings%20Survey">Historic American Engineering Record</a> (HAER) were taken in January, and the HAER "documentation package was prepared as mitigation for the emergency demolition" of the bridge, which was collapsed in March. The permanent replacement bridge was completed in 1996, and the old bridge was removed from the NRHP on July 22, 2002.

Plunketts Creek Bridge No. 3 was a <a href="rubble%20masonry">rubble masonry</a> stone <a href="arch%20bridge">arch bridge</a>, oriented roughly east–west over Plunketts Creek. Its overall length was and its single semi-circular arch spanned . The bridge deck width was , and its roadway was wide, which could accommodate only a single lane of traffic. Just before the flood that led to the bridge's destruction, about 450 vehicles crossed the bridge daily. The outside corners of the <a href="wing%20wall">wing wall</a>s were apart, which combined with the overall length of led to a total area of being listed on the NRHP.

The bridge rested on <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s which had been jacketed with concrete after its original construction. The arch was supported by <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s made of "irregular rubble stone", without a <a href="keystone%20%28architecture%29">keystone</a>. There was also no stone giving the date or other construction information. The approaches were flanked by wing walls constructed of <a href="riprap">riprap</a> stones, and the <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a> walls were topped by <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s made of "rough, crenellated stones". The bridge's road deck rested directly on the top of its arch. This led to a "narrow wall at the arch crown" and a "protruding rock parapet" atop this spandrel wall on either side. Most stone arch bridges have solid parapets without decoration; this bridge's parapet <a href="crenellation">crenellation</a> was an ornamental feature. The parapet construction and appearance made the bridge unique among the 58 Pennsylvania stone arch bridges with which it was nominated for the NRHP.

Pennsylvania has a long history of stone arch bridges, including the oldest such bridge in use in the United States, the 1697 <a href="Frankford%20Avenue%20Bridge">Frankford Avenue Bridge</a> over <a href="Pennypack%20Creek">Pennypack Creek</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Such bridges typically used local stone, with three types of finishing possible. Rubble or third-class masonry construction used stones just as they came from the quarry; squared-stone or second-class masonry used stones that had been roughly dressed and squared; and <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> or first-class masonry used stones which had been finely dressed and carefully squared. Rubble masonry was the quickest and cheapest for construction, and had the largest <a href="Engineering%20tolerance">tolerances</a>. Many of the oldest stone bridges in Pennsylvania were built using rubble masonry techniques.

Stone bridge construction started with the excavation of foundations for the abutments. Then a temporary structure known as a center or centering would be built of wood or iron. This structure supported the stone arch during construction. Once the stone arch was built, the spandrel walls and wing walls could be added. Then the road bed was built, with fill (loose stones or dirt) added to support it as needed. Wall and arch stones were generally set in place dry to ensure a good fit, then set in <a href="mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a>. Once the bridge was complete and the mortar had properly hardened, the center was gradually lowered and then removed. In March 1996, after standing for between 156 and 121 years, the arch of Bridge No. 3 finally collapsed.

2009 International Bowl

The 2009 International Bowl was a postseason <a href="college%20football">college football</a> <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> between the <a href="Connecticut%20Huskies%20football">Connecticut Huskies</a> (UConn) and the <a href="Buffalo%20Bulls%20football">Buffalo Bulls</a> at <a href="Rogers%20Centre">Rogers Centre</a> in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, on January 3, 2009. The game was the final contest of the <a href="2008%20NCAA%20Division%20I-FBS%20football%20season">2008 NCAA Division I-Football Bowl Subdivision (Division I-FBS) football season</a> for both teams, and ended in a 38–20 victory for Connecticut. UConn represented the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a> (Big East) in the game; Buffalo entered as the <a href="Mid-American%20Conference">Mid-American Conference</a> (MAC) champion.

Connecticut was selected as a participant in the 2009 International Bowl following a 7–5 <a href="Season%20%28sports%29">regular season</a> where they won their first five games, only to lose five of their last seven contests. Facing the Huskies were the Buffalo Bulls with a regular season record of 8–5, highlighted by an upset win over then-No. 12 and undefeated <a href="2008%20Ball%20State%20Cardinals%20football%20team">Ball State</a> in the <a href="2008%20MAC%20Championship%20Game">2008 MAC Championship Game</a>. Pre-game media coverage focused on the legacy of the <a href="1958%20Buffalo%20Bulls%20football%20team">1958 Buffalo Bulls</a>, the first team from the university to be invited to a bowl game. When told that the two <a href="African-American">African-American</a> members of the team would not be allowed to play because of <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">segregation</a>, the team elected to refuse the bowl bid. Buffalo would not play in a bowl until this game, 50 years later.

The game began at 12:00 PM <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>. Connecticut, led by <a href="running%20back">running back</a> <a href="Donald%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29">Donald Brown's</a> 208 yards rushing, dominated the first half statistically, but found themselves down 20–10 midway through the second quarter because they committed six <a href="fumbles">fumbles</a>, five of which were recovered by Buffalo. UConn would close the gap to 20–17 by halftime, and take the lead for good late in the third quarter off a 4-yard <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> <a href="Forward%20pass">pass</a> from <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Tyler%20Lorenzen">Tyler Lorenzen</a> to <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> Steve Brouse. The Connecticut victory was sealed when, late in the fourth quarter, Buffalo quarterback <a href="Drew%20Willy">Drew Willy</a> threw a pass that was <a href="interception">intercepted</a> by UConn <a href="safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29">safety</a> Dahna Deleston and returned 100 yards for a touchdown.

UConn junior running back <a href="Donald%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29">Donald Brown</a> was named <a href="player%20of%20the%20game%23United%20States%20college%20basketball%20and%20football">player of the game</a>. He finished with 261 rushing yards and one touchdown; his 2,083 rushing yards for the 2008 season was best in the NCAA. Following the game, Brown declared his eligibility for the <a href="2009%20NFL%20Draft">2009 NFL Draft</a>; he would become the first Connecticut player ever drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round.

The International Bowl had contracts with the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East</a> and <a href="Mid-American%20Conference">Mid-American Conference</a>s that allowed them to select one team from each conference to participate in their annual game. By virtue of being the Big East champion <a href="2008%20Cincinnati%20Bearcats%20football%20team">Cincinnati</a> was awarded an automatic <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> berth; they would play in the <a href="2009%20Orange%20Bowl">2009 Orange Bowl</a>. The <a href="2009%20Gator%20Bowl">Gator Bowl</a> and <a href="2008%20Sun%20Bowl">Sun Bowl</a> shared the second pick of Big East teams; after the Gator Bowl opted to select <a href="Big%2012">Big 12</a> member <a href="2008%20Nebraska%20Cornhuskers%20football%20team">Nebraska</a> and the Sun Bowl learned that they would not be allowed to select <a href="2008%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team">Notre Dame</a>, <a href="2008%20Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football%20team">Pittsburgh</a> received the Sun Bowl invitation. The <a href="2008%20Meineke%20Car%20Care%20Bowl">Meineke Car Care Bowl</a>, which had the third selection, picked <a href="2008%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football%20team">West Virginia</a>. The fourth, fifth, and sixth selections of Big East teams belonged collectively to the International Bowl, <a href="2008%20PapaJohns.com%20Bowl">PapaJohns.com Bowl</a>, and <a href="2008%20St.%20Petersburg%20Bowl">St. Petersburg Bowl</a>, which, in consultation with the Big East, decided which schools were the best fit for each bowl. There were three remaining bowl-eligible Big East teams: Connecticut, <a href="2008%20Rutgers%20Scarlet%20Knights%20football%20team">Rutgers</a>, and <a href="2008%20South%20Florida%20Bulls%20football%20team">South Florida</a>. The previous season, Rutgers had played in the International Bowl and South Florida had appeared in the PapaJohns.com Bowl; bowls in general dislike inviting the same team in consecutive years, on the theory that fans are less likely to want to travel to the same destination they were at the year before. Additionally, the St. Petersburg Bowl, in its inaugural year, sought to have local team South Florida play in their game to drive local attendance. Therefore, the teams were apportioned among the bowls as follows: South Florida to the St. Petersburg Bowl, Rutgers to the PapaJohns.com Bowl, and Connecticut to the International Bowl. On December 7, 2008, UConn formally accepted the bowl invitation, the third in their history.

Buffalo accepted an invitation to the International Bowl following their victory over then-undefeated <a href="2008%20Ball%20State%20Cardinals%20football%20team">Ball State</a> in the <a href="2008%20MAC%20Championship%20Game">2008 MAC Championship Game</a>. Although in past years the MAC champion had been invited to the <a href="Motor%20City%20Bowl">Motor City Bowl</a>, Buffalo preferred to go to the International Bowl due to Toronto being closer to the school than <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, the home of the Motor City Bowl. The game marked the first bowl for the Bulls after their first MAC Championship since moving to <a href="Division%20I-A">Division I-A</a> and joining the MAC in 1999.

The Bulls and Huskies had been frequent opponents during the previous decade as both programs made the transition from <a href="Division%20I-AA">Division I-AA</a> to Division I-A. The two teams played each other in six consecutive seasons from 1999 to 2005, with Connecticut winning five of the six contents. The 2005 game, won by UConn 38–0, was the most recent meeting between the two teams. Overall, the Huskies and Bulls had played each other 16 times since their first meeting in 1939, with Connecticut holding a 12–4 advantage in the all-time series. Prior to the 2008 season, Buffalo and UConn had signed a contract to play a four-game, home-and-home series beginning in 2010.

Entering 2008, the Bulls sought to build off of their <a href="2007%20Buffalo%20Bulls%20football%20team">2007 season</a>, where they shared the MAC East championship but did not appear in the championship game due to a 31–28 loss to fellow division co-champion <a href="2007%20Miami%20RedHawks%20football%20team">Miami (Ohio)</a>. Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to <a href="Bowl%20eligibility">qualify</a> for a bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.

Buffalo opened the season stronger than expected, with a dominant home win over the <a href="2008%20UTEP%20Miners%20football%20team">University of Texas-El Paso</a> (UTEP), 42–17. This was followed by a closer-than-predicted loss at heavily favored Pittsburgh, 27–16. Buffalo's third game and conference opener, versus <a href="2008%20Temple%20Owls%20football%20team">Temple</a>, was a back-and-forth contest that came down to the final play of the game. Keeping the game within seven points for the first three quarters, the Bulls first took the lead with 2:27 left in the fourth quarter, on a 25-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28American%20football%29">field goal</a> by A.J. Principe. Temple responded with a nine-play, 74-yard drive capped by an 11-yard touchdown catch by wide receiver Bruce Francis, his second score of the game, to take a 28–24 lead with only 38 seconds remaining. Taking over at their own 40-yard line after the kickoff went out of bounds, the Bulls drove down the field, scoring the game-winning touchdown on a 35-yard desperation heave from Drew Willy to wide receiver <a href="Naaman%20Roosevelt">Naaman Roosevelt</a> with no time remaining on the clock. Buffalo's record following the last-second win was 2–1, marking the first time since 1969 that the Bulls had a record over .500 beyond Week 1 as a Division I-A team. The last time the Bulls had started a season 2–1 was 1998, while they were still played in Division I-AA.

The Bulls proceeded to lose their next three games. Buffalo was unable to keep up with No. 5-ranked <a href="2008%20Missouri%20Tigers%20football%20team">Missouri</a>, losing 42–21 in a game that Missouri saw as a tuneup for their later season. In the next contest, against MAC opponent <a href="2008%20Central%20Michigan%20Chippewas%20football%20team">Central Michigan</a>, down nine points with under three minutes left Buffalo scored on a 65-yard pass to James Starks, recovered an <a href="onside%20kick">onside kick</a> to retain possession, and attempted a game-winning field goal—but A.J. Principe's 46-yard kick hit the right goalpost to give Central Michigan the victory. In the next game, against the <a href="2008%20Western%20Michigan%20Broncos%20football%20team">Western Michigan Broncos</a>, also in the MAC, Buffalo squandered a two-touchdown advantage with just over five minutes left, allowing the Broncos to win the game in <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23College%2C%20high-school%2C%20and%20Canadian%20football">overtime</a>. Buffalo's overall record fell to 2–4, 1–2 in the MAC.

Bouncing back, Buffalo won their next five games. Against <a href="2008%20Army%20Black%20Knights%20football%20team">Army</a>, Buffalo reversed the result of the Western Michigan game, coming back from a two-touchdown deficit to win in overtime. Handling conference opponents <a href="2008%20Ohio%20Bobcats%20football%20team">Ohio</a> and <a href="2008%20Miami%20RedHawks%20football%20team">Miami (Ohio)</a> with relative ease, Buffalo continued conference play by beating <a href="2008%20Akron%20Zips%20football%20team">Akron</a> in a four-hour, four-overtime slugfest, 43–40, in Akron's final football game at the <a href="Rubber%20Bowl">Rubber Bowl</a>. In their next game, against <a href="2008%20Bowling%20Green%20Falcons%20football%20team">Bowling Green</a>, the Bulls found themselves down 21–0 midway through the third quarter, but still managed to come back for their third overtime win of the season. With the win, Buffalo clinched the MAC East championship and ensured that they would have their first winning regular season since moving to Division I-A; the final regular season game, a 24–21 loss to <a href="2008%20Kent%20State%20Golden%20Flashes%20football%20team">Kent State</a>, was only a formality. The Bulls finished the regular season with an overall record of 7–5, 5–3 within the conference.

Buffalo's opponent in the 2008 MAC Championship Game would be the No. 12-ranked <a href="2008%20Ball%20State%20Cardinals%20football%20team">Ball State Cardinals</a>, who had gone undefeated in winning the MAC West. Ball State was a two-touchdown favorite entering the game; Buffalo in its history was 0–5 against the Cardinals. The Bulls struck first with a touchdown late in the first quarter; Ball State responded with a touchdown and a field goal in the second quarter to take a 10–7 lead at the half. The two teams traded touchdowns early in the third quarter. Disaster then struck for Ball State: on two consecutive possessions late in the third quarter, after having driven into the <a href="Red%20zone%20%28football%29">red zone</a>, the Cardinals fumbled the ball. Buffalo returned both of these fumbles for touchdowns and took a lead they would not surrender. The Bulls won the game 42–24, earning their first-ever MAC Championship as well as their first-ever win over a ranked opponent in nine attempts.

The Huskies entered 2008 seeking to prove their success <a href="2007%20Connecticut%20Huskies%20football%20team">the previous season</a> was no fluke. In 2007, Connecticut earned their first Big East co-championship, albeit after losing to their fellow co-champion, <a href="2007%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football%20team">West Virginia</a>, 66–21. A loss to <a href="2007%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football%20team">Wake Forest</a> in the <a href="2007%20Meineke%20Car%20Care%20Bowl">2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl</a>—the team's second bowl appearance all-time—gave the Huskies a final 2007 record of 9–4. In the Big East preseason media poll, UConn was picked to finish 6th overall in the conference.

UConn started the season strong, winning their first five games. The Huskies easily won their first game 35–3 against Division I-Football Championship Subdivision (Division I-FCS) opponent <a href="Hofstra%20University">Hofstra</a>. The second game, at Temple, was played as the remnants of <a href="Hurricane%20Hanna%20%282008%29">Hurricane Hanna</a> hit Philadelphia. UConn won 12–9 in overtime as Donald Brown ran for a then-career high 214 yards and scored the game-winning touchdown. Connecticut next avenged their loss to <a href="2008%20Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football%20team">Virginia</a> from 2007, winning the rematch 45–10. <a href="2008%20Baylor%20Bears%20football%20team">Baylor</a> was next on the schedule; the Huskies pulled out the win in a back-and-forth game, 31–28. Connecticut opened Big East conference play in their next game against <a href="2008%20Louisville%20Cardinals%20football%20team">Louisville</a>. The game was not decided until UConn <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a> <a href="Lawrence%20Wilson">Lawrence Wilson</a> returned an interception for a touchdown with 2:45 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Huskies a 26–21 lead they would not relinquish. This was the second straight season where Connecticut won their first five games; before 2007, they had not opened a season so successfully since 1995, when they won their first six straight. Following the game, UConn achieved their first and only ranking of the year, appearing at No. 24 in the <a href="AP%20Poll">Associated Press</a> (AP) and <a href="Harris%20poll">Harris</a> polls and No. 23 in the <a href="Coaches%27%20poll">Coaches' poll</a>. However, starting quarterback <a href="Tyler%20Lorenzen">Tyler Lorenzen</a> broke his foot in the Louisville game; the Huskies would be forced to rely on backup <a href="Zach%20Frazer">Zach Frazer</a> for the next few games.

The Huskies were unable to match their early success in the second half of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at <a href="2008%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football%20team">North Carolina</a>, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as <a href="Placekicker">kicker</a> Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, including one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40–16. While not ranked in any of the polls, after the win Connecticut found itself No. 25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller <a href="2008%20Syracuse%20Orange%20football%20team">Syracuse</a>, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No. 23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.

In the weeks leading up to the game, media coverage focused on the achievements of the Buffalo Bulls. Buffalo had been one of the least successful programs in college football from their transition to Division I-A in 1999 to 2006, during which they had a cumulative record of 12–79. In 2008, the Bulls had their first winning season since 1996, won five games in a row for the first time since 1986, beat a ranked team for the first time in program history with their upset victory over Ball State in the MAC Championship Game, and would be making the first bowl appearance in school history. The turnaround of the Buffalo program brought acclaim to Bulls head coach <a href="Turner%20Gill">Turner Gill</a>, who had taken over the team in 2007.

Comparatively, Connecticut was an afterthought heading into the game. Pre-bowl coverage of UConn focused on NCAA rushing leader Donald Brown, who was considering foregoing his senior season to enter the 2009 NFL Draft. Brown indicated before the game that he had decided to return to UConn for the 2010 season.

Following the regular season, speculation surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He was identified as a candidate at two schools: <a href="Syracuse%20Orange%20football">Syracuse</a> and <a href="Auburn%20Tigers%20football">Auburn</a>. In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted for <a href="New%20Orleans%20Saints">New Orleans Saints</a> <a href="offensive%20coordinator">offensive coordinator</a> <a href="Doug%20Marrone">Doug Marrone</a>, while Auburn passed him over in favor of <a href="Iowa%20State%20Cyclones%20football">Iowa State</a> head coach <a href="Gene%20Chizik">Gene Chizik</a>, a move that prominent former <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA) player, <a href="Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Basketball Hall-of-Famer</a>, and Auburn alumnus <a href="Charles%20Barkley">Charles Barkley</a> claimed was due to racism. Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.

UConn head coach <a href="Randy%20Edsall">Randy Edsall</a>, who had been with the Huskies since 1999, was also rumored to be a candidate for the Syracuse job. Edsall, a Syracuse alumnus, denied any interest. <a href="Offensive%20coordinator">Offensive coordinator</a> <a href="Rob%20Ambrose">Rob Ambrose</a> accepted the head coaching position at <a href="Towson%20Tigers%20football">Towson</a>, his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>; he would stay to coach UConn during the bowl game, however.

While the 2009 International Bowl marked the first appearance of the Buffalo Bulls in a bowl game, it was not the first time the school had been invited to a bowl. Fifty years earlier, the <a href="1958%20Buffalo%20Bulls%20football%20team">1958 Buffalo Bulls team</a> finished with a record of 8–1. They were awarded the <a href="Lambert%20Cup">Lambert Cup</a>, given to the best small college team in the eastern US, and received a bid to play in the <a href="1958%20Tangerine%20Bowl%20%28December%29">1958 Tangerine Bowl</a>, where they would face <a href="Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football">Florida State</a>. There was one catch: the team's <a href="African-American">African-American</a> players—starting running back <a href="Willie%20Evans%20%28running%20back%29">Willie Evans</a> and backup defensive end Mike Wilson—would not be allowed to play. The <a href="Tangerine%20Bowl%20%28stadium%29">Tangerine Bowl</a> stadium was controlled by the Orlando High School Athletic Association, who prohibited <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">integrated</a> football games. University officials and the coaching staff decided to allow the team to vote on whether they would accept the bowl bid. Before secret ballots could be passed out, the players unanimously decided to reject the bid.

Surviving members of the 1958 Bulls team were invited to the 2009 International Bowl and were honored before the game. The Reverend <a href="Jesse%20Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a> spoke at the kickoff luncheon prior to the game, paying tribute to the legacy of the 1958 team.

Buffalo featured a high-powered, high-tempo, balanced offense that was good at not committing turnovers. During the regular season the Bulls averaged 380.5 offensive yards per game, 45th best in the nation, and scored an average of 31.3 points per game, 31st best. Buffalo's <a href="turnover%20%28football%29">turnover</a> margin was 6th best in the nation, at +1.15.

The Bulls were led offensively by the triple threat of quarterback <a href="Drew%20Willy">Drew Willy</a>, running back <a href="James%20Starks">James Starks</a>, and wide receiver <a href="Naaman%20Roosevelt">Naaman Roosevelt</a>. The three combined to break 14 single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404). Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25 touchdowns against only five interceptions. Starks, while not seen as the same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300 yards and caught 41 passes for 340 yards, scoring 16 touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt was seen as the top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last five games and scoring at least once in his last seven.

Especially compared to Buffalo, the UConn offense was extremely unbalanced; the Huskies ranked 19th in the nation in running, averaging 204.6 yards per game, but only 106th in the nation in passing, averaging 147.3 yards per game. Connecticut's offense was centered around running back <a href="Donald%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29">Donald Brown</a>. Described as "the ultimate workhorse", Brown led the NCAA in rushing going into the game with 1,822 yards. He had already tied the school single-season rushing touchdown record with 17 scores. His dominant performance led to him being named the Big East offensive player of the year as well as an <a href="College%20Football%20All-America%20Team">All-American</a> by multiple organizations. Somewhat surprisingly, he was not a finalist for the <a href="Doak%20Walker%20Award">Doak Walker Award</a>, annually given to the best running back in college football; the award was eventually won by <a href="Shonn%20Greene">Shonn Greene</a> of <a href="Iowa%20Hawkeyes%20football">Iowa</a>. UConn's rushing attack was supplemented by the efforts of quarterback Tyler Lorenzen and running back <a href="Jordan%20Todman">Jordan Todman</a>.

The Huskies struggled to pass the ball all season, only completing four touchdown passes as a team heading into the International Bowl. Lorenzen completed under half of his passing attempts on the season. He threw for 820 yards with more interceptions (eight) than touchdowns (two). Nevertheless, before the game Randy Edsall confirmed that Lorenzen would be the starting quarterback for UConn in the International Bowl. This would be his ninth appearance at quarterback on the season; he missed four games with a broken right foot.

The Buffalo defense was described as "among the worst in the MAC, meaning it's among the worst in college football". In Division I-FBS, the Bulls ranked 84th in total defense, allowing an average of 408 yards per game. Buffalo's run defense was 83rd in the country, allowing 141.1 yards per game; their pass defense was ranked 97th, allowing almost 250 yards per game. The Bulls allowed other teams to score an average of 27 points against them per game, which ranked 73rd in the country.

Buffalo did have one strength on defense: forcing turnovers. The Bulls recovered 20 fumbles and caught eight interceptions on the year. Buffalo's turnover margin of +1.15 was 6th best in the nation.

Conversely, UConn boasted one of the better defenses in the country. The Huskies allowed the 10th-fewest yards per game in the nation with 281 yards allowed. Connecticut was especially good against the pass; they allowed an average of only 165 yards per game, seventh-best in the country. No UConn opponent passed for more than 259 yards during the regular season.

The Huskies had several standout players on defense. One was <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> <a href="Cody%20Brown">Cody Brown</a>, who led UConn with 14 tackles for a loss (TFL) and nine <a href="Quarterback%20sack">sacks</a> while also being named to the All-Big East first team. <a href="Cornerback">Cornerback</a> <a href="Jasper%20Howard">Jasper Howard</a> was another standout player: he had 37 tackles and four interceptions on the year while also leading the Big East in punt returns.

The 2009 International Bowl kicked off on January 3, 2009, at 12:00 PM in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Official attendance was listed at 40,184, the highest in the history of the International Bowl. The attendance record was largely due to Buffalo fans; an estimated 30,000 attended the game. <a href="John%20Saunders%20%28journalist%29">John Saunders</a>, <a href="Jesse%20Palmer">Jesse Palmer</a>, and <a href="Doug%20Flutie">Doug Flutie</a>, all with ties to Canada, were the announcers for the television broadcast, which aired on <a href="ESPN2">ESPN2</a>. The game was watched by over 2 million households with a rating of 2.12, both the highest in International Bowl history. Prior to the game, <a href="spread%20betting">spread bettors</a> favored Connecticut to win by four and a half points.

Buffalo received the ball first to begin the game, and returned the opening <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a> to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in three plays, and <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punted</a> the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by <a href="running%20back">running back</a> <a href="Donald%20Brown%20%28American%20football%29">Donald Brown</a> and <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Tyler%20Lorenzen">Tyler Lorenzen</a>, earning two <a href="first%20downs">first downs</a>. On 2nd down and 5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was <a href="Quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d; the ball was recovered by UConn <a href="right%20tackle">right tackle</a> <a href="Mike%20Hicks%20%28American%20football%29">Mike Hicks</a>, allowing the Huskies to retain possession. A <a href="Holding%20%28American%20football%29">holding penalty</a> on the next play called on UConn <a href="left%20tackle">left tackle</a> <a href="William%20Beatty%20%28American%20football%29">William Beatty</a> set up 3rd-and-24. Donald Brown rushed for fifteen yards but was unable to reach the first-down marker, forcing UConn to punt.

Buffalo took over at their own 19-yard line and promptly earned their 1st first down of the game on a 10-yard pass from quarterback <a href="Drew%20Willy">Drew Willy</a> to <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> <a href="Naaman%20Roosevelt">Naaman Roosevelt</a>. The Bulls' drive stalled from there, forcing them to punt. The punt struck the ground and hit UConn's Jonathan Jean-Louis, who was attempting to block for the punt return; Buffalo recovered the loose ball, giving them back possession at the Connecticut 23-yard line. The Bulls were unable to move the ball any closer to the <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a>, and settled for a 38-yard <a href="Field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> by <a href="Placekicker">kicker</a> A. J. Principe, giving them a 3–0 lead with 4:26 remaining in the first quarter.

The ensuing kickoff was returned by UConn running back Jordan Todman 45 yards to the Buffalo 45-yard line. On the first play from <a href="Line%20of%20scrimmage">scrimmage</a>, Donald Brown broke through the Buffalo defense and ran the length of the field for the first <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> of the day. UConn kicker Dave Teggart's <a href="conversion%20%28gridiron%20football%29">extra point attempt</a> was good, giving UConn their first lead of the day, at 7–3.

Buffalo got the ball back at their own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting the ball back to Connecticut. UConn <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> <a href="Jasper%20Howard">Jasper Howard</a> returned the ball 26 yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing the ball to the Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At the end of the first quarter, UConn held a 7–3 lead and looked to be in position to score more when the second quarter began.

UConn began the second quarter by having Tyler Lorenzen rush the ball for four yards. On 3rd and 7, Lorenzen attempted his first pass of the game, which was behind Husky wide receiver Michael Smith. Dave Teggart kicked a 32-yard field goal to increase Connecticut's lead to 10–3.

The Bulls began their next drive at their own 26-yard line, but went <a href="three-and-out">three-and-out</a>. Buffalo <a href="Punter%20%28football%29">punter</a> Peter Fardon kicked the ball over the head of UConn returner Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he <a href="Muffed%20punt">muffed</a> the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The <a href="special-teams">special-teams</a> miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.

UConn's turnover woes continued on their next possession when, on their second play from scrimmage after receiving Buffalo's kickoff, Tyler Lorenzen was sacked, causing him to fumble the ball. The Bulls recovered and drove down the field to the UConn 12-yard line where they were stopped. Principe kicked a 29-yard field goal giving Buffalo back the lead, at 13–10.

The ensuing kickoff saw yet another Connecticut special-teams blunder. UConn running back Robbie Frey misplayed the ball off of the kickoff, letting it roll back into the end zone. Frey recovered the loose ball; if he had simply taken a knee, by rule it would have been a <a href="touchback">touchback</a> and the Huskies would have gotten the ball at their own 20-yard line. Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull running back <a href="James%20Starks">James Starks</a>, giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.

Connecticut fumbled the ball for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was responsible for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, but was unable to score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13 yards out. Neither team scored for the remainder of the first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.

Connecticut received the ball to start the third quarter and drove down the field on rushing plays by Donald Brown, Jordan Todman and Tyler Lorenzen, before the drive stalled at the Buffalo 36-yard line. UConn punter Desi Cullen's punt was downed at the Buffalo 1-yard line, pinning them against their own end zone. The Bulls were unable to move the ball, punting the ball back to UConn after three plays. Starting from their own 44-yard line, the Huskies drove to within the Buffalo 10-yard line; an <a href="Offside%20%28American%20football%29">offside penalty</a> on Buffalo's Jerry Housey gave UConn a 1st-and-goal at the Buffalo 4-yard line. Connecticut used a <a href="play-action%20pass">play-action pass</a>, only their second pass attempt of the game, to fool the Bulls; UConn <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> Steve Brouse was wide open in the end zone, catching the ball for the touchdown and giving Connecticut back the lead at 24–20 with 5:22 left in the third quarter.

Buffalo received the ball off the kickoff on their own 28-yard line. Losing eight yards on their three plays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and attempted a 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got the ball back with less than a minute left in the quarter and completed two passes, moving the ball 13 yards down the field before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24–20.

Buffalo began the final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 situation and were unable to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also unable to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls. On their next possession Buffalo managed to get a first down off of a Drew Willy pass to tight end Jesse Rack, but were unable to move the ball further than UConn's 49-yard line and punted again.

Connecticut took over at their own 32-yard line and, after throwing only two passes in the first three quarters, completed three passes over 10 yards apiece to move down the field. On a 2nd-and-5 from the Buffalo 15-yard line, Tyler Lorenzen scored his second rushing touchdown of the game. UConn's lead was extended to 31–20 with less than five minutes left in the game.

Receiving the ball at their own 8-yard line following a penalty on the kickoff return, Buffalo began to move down the field, with Drew Willy completing a 38-yard pass to wideout Brett Hamlin and a 29-yard pass to Naaman Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-4 from the Connecticut 19-yard line, Willy completed a ten-yard pass to James Starks, giving the Bulls a 1st-and-goal. Starks rushed for four yards on first down; on second down, Willy threw an incomplete pass intended for Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-goal from the Husky 5-yard line, Willy attempted a pass that was deflected and <a href="Interception">intercepted</a> by UConn <a href="Safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29">safety</a> Dahna Deleston, who returned the ball 100 yards for the game-sealing touchdown. UConn won the game 38–20.

For his performance in the 2009 International Bowl, Connecticut running back Donald Brown was named the player of the game. Brown rushed for 261 yards and one touchdown on 29 attempts. He finished the 2008 college football season with 2,083 rushing yards which led the nation. Brown set several new UConn school records, including the single-season records for rushing yards (2,083), attempts (367), and yards per game (160.2), the career records for rushing yards (3,800) and attempts (698), and the record for consecutive games with at least 100 yards rushing (8). His performance did not break the International Bowl rushing record, however; <a href="2008%20International%20Bowl">the previous year</a> <a href="2007%20Rutgers%20Scarlet%20Knights%20football%20team">Rutgers</a> running back <a href="Ray%20Rice">Ray Rice</a> ran for 280 yards and four touchdowns.

Brown's dominant rushing performance was supplemented by RB Jordan Todman's 62 yards on seven attempts, QB Tyler Lorenzen's 32 yards on twelve attempts, including two touchdowns, and <a href="fullback%20%28American%20football%29">fullback</a> Anthony Sherman's three yards on one attempt; in total Connecticut ran for 358 yards. The Huskies attempted to pass only six times during the game; Lorenzen completed four of them for 49 yards and a touchdown. Four different UConn receivers caught one pass each: wide receiver Kashif Moore (18 yards), cornerback and sometime wide receiver Darius Butler (16 yards), fullback Anthony Sherman (11 yards), and tight end Steve Brouse (4 yards and a touchdown).

Buffalo's offensive performance was in some ways the opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated on the ground and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a good day passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24 yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25 yards on thirteen carries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran three times for five yards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost six yards on three rushing attempts. Willy had a much more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43 passes for 213 yards and one interception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90 yards on eight catches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught four passes for 54 yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22 yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21 yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17 yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9 yards.

Connecticut dominated Buffalo statistically in the first half, gaining 225 yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208 yards rushing. Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20 points off UConn turnovers in the first half, but were held scoreless in the second half when the Huskies stopped turning the ball over.

Connecticut's win gave the team a final record of 8–5 and back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 2003–04. Buffalo's final record fell to 8–6, which still marked the first winning season for the Bulls since transitioning to Division I-A football in 1999.

In a press conference after the game, Brown announced that he would not return for his senior season and enter the NFL Draft, saying he told the media he said he was staying to take the focus off of himself prior to the game. Brown was drafted 27th overall by the <a href="Indianapolis%20Colts">Indianapolis Colts</a>, becoming the first UConn player ever drafted in the first round. Three other UConn players were drafted in the second round: <a href="Darius%20Butler">Darius Butler</a> 41st overall by the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>, <a href="Will%20Beatty">Will Beatty</a> 60th overall by the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a>, and <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> <a href="Cody%20Brown">Cody Brown</a> 63rd overall by the <a href="Arizona%20Cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>. Tight end <a href="Martin%20B%C3%A9dard">Martin Bédard</a> was drafted 15th overall in the second round of the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a>'s (CFL) <a href="2009%20CFL%20Draft">2009 Draft</a>. Buffalo did not have any players drafted by either league in 2009; in the <a href="2010%20NFL%20Draft">2010 NFL Draft</a> <a href="James%20Starks">James Starks</a> was selected in the sixth round, 193rd overall, by the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a>. UConn cornerback <a href="Robert%20McClain">Robert McClain</a> was also drafted by the NFL in 2010, in the seventh round, 249th overall, by the <a href="Carolina%20Panthers">Carolina Panthers</a>.

In the offseason Connecticut hired <a href="Joe%20Moorhead">Joe Moorhead</a> as their new offensive coordinator, replacing the departed <a href="Rob%20Ambrose">Rob Ambrose</a>. Turner Gill returned to coach Buffalo in <a href="2009%20Buffalo%20Bulls%20football%20team">2009</a>. Following that season, however, he left to take over the football program at the <a href="Kansas%20Jayhawks%20football">University of Kansas</a>.

Connecticut and Buffalo resumed their rivalry on September 25, <a href="2010%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS%20football%20season">2010</a>, playing a regular season game at UConn's <a href="Rentschler%20Field%20%28stadium%29">Rentschler Field</a>. Although the score was tied 14–14 at halftime, the Huskies pulled away in the second half after changing quarterbacks, winning the rematch 45–21.

2008 Humanitarian Bowl

The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl was a postseason <a href="college%20football">college football</a> <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> between the <a href="2008%20Maryland%20Terrapins%20football%20team">Maryland Terrapins</a> and the <a href="2008%20Nevada%20Wolf%20Pack%20football%20team">Nevada Wolf Pack</a> on December 30, 2008. It was the two teams' first meeting. The game featured two conference <a href="Automatic%20bids%20to%20college%20bowl%20games">tie-ins</a>: the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland</a> represented the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) and the <a href="University%20of%20Nevada%2C%20Reno">University of Nevada</a> represented the <a href="Western%20Athletic%20Conference">Western Athletic Conference</a> (WAC). The game was played at <a href="Bronco%20Stadium">Bronco Stadium</a> in <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a> and was the 12th edition of the <a href="Humanitarian%20Bowl">Humanitarian Bowl</a>. It was sponsored by the <a href="New%20Plymouth%2C%20Idaho">New Plymouth, Idaho</a>-based company <a href="Roady%27s%20Truck%20Stops">Roady's Truck Stops</a>, which claims to be the largest chain of <a href="truck%20stop">truck stop</a>s in the United States.

The featured match-up was between what was called a "wildly inconsistent" Maryland team and the third-best rushing defense and fifth-best <a href="total%20offense">total offense</a> of Nevada. The result was an offensive shoot-out. The final score of 42–35 in favor of Maryland exceeded total-points predictions by as much as 17 and tied the all-time Humanitarian Bowl record.

Before the kickoff, seven Maryland players, including six <a href="Starting%20lineup">starters</a>, received partial-game suspensions for violating the team's curfew. Maryland took a quick lead within the first two minutes of play, but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times. In the second quarter, Nevada's <a href="Quarterback%23Dual%20threat%20quarterbacks">dual-threat quarterback</a>, <a href="Colin%20Kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a>, was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the complexion of the game. Nevertheless, Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety and was able to <a href="quarterback%20scramble">scramble</a> for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>. Halfway through the third quarter, Maryland's leading <a href="running%20back">running back</a>, <a href="Da%27Rel%20Scott">Da'Rel Scott</a>, made his first appearance of the game. He had been one of the suspended players, but scored twice in the final quarter to help secure a victory for the Terrapins.

The ACC had a contractual tie-in with the Humanitarian Bowl that afforded the bowl organizing committee the eighth pick of the conference's <a href="bowl%20eligible">bowl-eligible</a> teams. An ACC team participated in the game every year from 2003 to 2008. Before the selections, the ACC announced that 2008 would be the final year of its tie-in with the game due to travel and cost considerations.

The other conference tie-in was with the WAC, which has generally fielded its champion in the game. The WAC has provided a team for the Humanitarian Bowl every year since 2001. Initially, it was speculated that the WAC championship team, <a href="2008%20Boise%20State%20Broncos%20football%20team">Boise State</a>, would make its fifth appearance in the bowl played in its home stadium.

At the end of the regular season, there were three undefeated teams from non-<a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) conferences, and <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) rules required only one to be given a berth in a BCS game. These three non-BCS teams were <a href="2008%20Ball%20State%20Cardinals%20football%20team">Ball State</a>, Boise State, and <a href="2008%20Utah%20Utes%20football%20team">Utah</a>. The Utes were considered heavy favorites for that berth. In a preemptive move, Humanitarian Bowl officials conducted negotiations with Ball State of the <a href="Mid-American%20Conference">Mid-American Conference</a> (MAC) in an effort to arrange a "Battle of the Unbeatens" with Boise State. If Ball State accepted, presumably with the consent of the ACC, it would have forced a team from the ACC to find an <a href="at-large%20bid">at-large bid</a>. However, Ball State officials were unhappy with the <a href="home%20advantage">home-field advantage</a> that would have been given to Boise State and the expenses associated with traveling to Idaho. Ball State, which lost the <a href="MAC%20Championship%20Game">MAC Championship Game</a> and ended its perfect record, declined the overtures and instead met <a href="2008%20Tulsa%20Golden%20Hurricane%20football%20team">Tulsa</a> in the <a href="2009%20GMAC%20Bowl">2009 GMAC Bowl</a>.

In 2008, the ACC experienced a season of unusual parity and fielded an NCAA-record number of ten bowl-eligible teams. Six of those possessed identical 4–4 conference records, and the remaining four had 5–3 conference records. Among the eligible teams, <a href="2008%20North%20Carolina%20State%20Wolfpack%20football%20team">N.C. State</a> (6–6) possessed the only non-winning overall record and was therefore forced by NCAA rules to find an at-large berth outside of the ACC tie-in games.

For the 2008 season, the ACC possessed nine tie-in games. The <a href="2009%20Orange%20Bowl">Orange Bowl</a> was the conference's BCS game and granted an automatic bid to the winner of the <a href="2008%20ACC%20Championship%20Game">ACC Championship Game</a>. The <a href="2008%20Chick-fil-A%20Bowl">Chick-fil-A Bowl</a> in <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a> had the first-pick of eligible ACC teams after the BCS game, followed by the <a href="2009%20Gator%20Bowl">Gator Bowl</a> in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a> and the <a href="2008%20Champs%20Sports%20Bowl">Champs Sports Bowl</a> in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. The <a href="2008%20Music%20City%20Bowl">Music City Bowl</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>; the <a href="2008%20Meineke%20Car%20Care%20Bowl">Meineke Car Care Bowl</a> in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>; and the <a href="2008%20Emerald%20Bowl">Emerald Bowl</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco, California</a> submitted their preferences together, and selected in that order if an agreement between them could not be reached. A special clause also guaranteed that, with a minimum of eight wins, the loser of the championship game would be selected no lower than by the Music City Bowl. The Humanitarian Bowl had the eighth-overall choice followed by the inaugural <a href="2008%20EagleBank%20Bowl">EagleBank Bowl</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>

That season, an <a href="subprime%20mortgage%20crisis">economic recession</a> factored into the selections. In general, bowl officials attempted to select teams in close geographic proximity to compensate for an anticipated drop in ticket sales. Maryland, however, stated that they would not accept a berth to face in-state rival <a href="2008%20Navy%20Midshipmen%20football%20team">Navy</a> in the nearby EagleBank Bowl due to a conflict with the school's final exams. The Emerald Bowl was not seen as a viable choice due to Maryland's participation in it the year prior.

Maryland head coach <a href="Ralph%20Friedgen">Ralph Friedgen</a> made his case to bowl officials by saying that the Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4–4 teams and not played a game against the fifth, <a href="2008%20Miami%20Hurricanes%20football%20team">Miami</a>. Three of those teams were selected ahead of Maryland: the Meineke Car Care Bowl selected the nearby <a href="2008%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20football%20team">North Carolina</a> team; the Gator Bowl chose <a href="2008%20Clemson%20Tigers%20football%20team">Clemson</a>, a school with a traditionally well-traveling fanbase; and the Emerald Bowl selected Miami. After the higher-priority bowl games made their selections, the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or <a href="2008%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20football%20team">Wake Forest</a>, the school with the smallest enrollment in any BCS football conference. Humanitarian Bowl officials chose Maryland in light of its larger alumni base, well-traveled fans, and greater television marketing potential.

In week 12 of the 2008 season, Maryland possessed a 7–3 record and stood atop the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%23Divisions">ACC Atlantic Division</a>. However, the Terps lost their final two regular season games and slid to a four-way tie for third place in the division. Earlier in the season, Maryland defeated four ranked opponents, a feat surpassed only by the two teams that played in the <a href="2009%20BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">BCS National Championship Game</a>, <a href="2008%20Florida%20Gators%20football%20team">Florida</a> and <a href="2008%20Oklahoma%20Sooners%20football%20team">Oklahoma</a>—and those each played an extra game with their conference championships. Maryland spent three weeks ranked in the top-25 of the <a href="AP%20Poll%23College%20football">Associated Press Poll</a>.

At the end of the 2008 season, the WAC had six bowl-eligible teams, five of which participated in bowl games. The WAC had three conference tie-ins: the <a href="2008%20New%20Mexico%20Bowl">New Mexico Bowl</a> in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>; the <a href="2008%20Hawaii%20Bowl">Hawaii Bowl</a> in <a href="Honolulu%2C%20Hawaii">Honolulu, Hawaii</a>; and the Humanitarian Bowl. Additionally, the WAC had provisions for conditional participation in the <a href="2008%20Poinsettia%20Bowl">Poinsettia Bowl</a> in <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20California">San Diego, California</a>; the <a href="2008%20Independence%20Bowl">Independence Bowl</a> in <a href="Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a>; and the <a href="2009%20GMAC%20Bowl">GMAC Bowl</a> in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>.

In the past, the Humanitarian Bowl usually selected the WAC championship team. However, Boise State was not content to play a middle-grade ACC team after negotiations with Ball State failed. The WAC commissioner said that the Broncos would look for another match-up that had "the same type of sizzle" as a match-up against Ball State. The "<a href="Idaho%20Statesman">Idaho Statesman</a>" added that "The Terrapins don't 'sizzle.'" Boise State traveled to the Poinsettia Bowl, where they faced 11th-ranked <a href="2008%20Texas%20Christian%20Horned%20Frogs%20football%20team">TCU</a>, which had lost only to the BCS-bound Oklahoma and Utah teams.

In Nevada's final regular season game, Kaepernick led the Wolf Pack in a second-half comeback to defeat <a href="2008%20Louisiana%20Tech%20Bulldogs%20football%20team">Louisiana Tech</a>. The seventh win guaranteed Nevada a berth in one of the three WAC tie-in bowls. The Wolf Pack finished the season in a three-way tie for second place in the WAC alongside <a href="2008%20Hawaii%20Warriors%20football%20team">Hawaii</a> and Louisiana Tech. Hawaii had a standing contract with the home-town Hawaii Bowl where it played <a href="2008%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team">Notre Dame</a>. Louisiana Tech, having lost to both Nevada and Hawaii, appeared unlikely to be selected for a bowl at all. However, the Bulldogs were able to take advantage of a provisional WAC berth in the Independence Bowl since neither the <a href="Big%2012%20Conference">Big 12</a> nor the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> could provide eligible teams. Two other WAC teams achieved bowl eligibility with 6–6 records. <a href="2008%20Fresno%20State%20Bulldogs%20football%20team">Fresno State</a> secured a slot in the New Mexico Bowl, but <a href="2008%20San%20Jose%20State%20Spartans%20football%20team">San Jose State</a> was unable to find an at-large berth.

With Boise State's decision to decline the Humanitarian Bowl invitation, the organizing committee looked to Nevada. Like Maryland, Nevada ended the regular season with a 7–5 record. The Wolf Pack's schedule included losses against then sixth-ranked <a href="2008%20Missouri%20Tigers%20football%20team">Missouri</a>, ninth-ranked Boise State, and 12th-ranked <a href="2008%20Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders%20football%20team">Texas Tech</a>. Nevada finished the regular season ranked second nationally in rushing offense and fifth in total offense. The Wolf Pack possessed two 1,000-yard <a href="rush%20%28American%20football%29">rushers</a>: <a href="Quarterback%23Dual%20threat%20quarterbacks">dual-threat</a> quarterback <a href="Colin%20Kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a> and running back <a href="Vai%20Taua">Vai Taua</a>. Kaepernick also threw for more than 2,000 yards.

On December 7, 2008, the Humanitarian Bowl officially extended invitations to Maryland and Nevada, both of which were accepted.

The site of the game was <a href="Bronco%20Stadium">Bronco Stadium</a> in Boise, Idaho, the home field of <a href="Boise%20State%20University">Boise State University</a>. The field's blue <a href="Field%20Turf">artificial turf</a> has the distinction of being the only non-green playing field in use by a <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I%20Football%20Bowl%20Subdivision">Division I Football Bowl Subdivision</a> team. Due to the color of its field, the stadium is nicknamed "The Blue" and the field itself is sometimes colloquially referred to as "<a href="The%20Smurfs">smurf</a> turf".

Pundits and opponents have asserted that Boise State benefits from an added advantage by wearing their blue home uniforms to match the playing field. Boise State possessed a 64–2 record at Bronco Stadium from 1998 to 2008. Nevada, designated as the home team, likewise wore blue uniforms during the Humanitarian Bowl.

ACC teams viewed a berth in the Humanitarian Bowl as undesirable due to its location. Aside from being one of the lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a> are prohibitively expensive and historically caused low turnout among ACC fans. In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>.

The game historically relied on local ticket sales, and the participating schools struggled to sell their allotted tickets. On December 8, a Boise-area television news station reported that Maryland and Nevada had sold just sixteen and eight tickets, respectively. The story was widely circulated by sports-related <a href="blog">blog</a>s, but the figures were discredited by a Maryland official. On December 18, the <a href="Reno%20Gazette-Journal">Reno Gazette-Journal</a> reported that 100 tickets had been sold by Nevada. Maryland officials admitted that ticket sales among its fans were expected to be low, with one stating they were in the "mid-hundreds" a week and a half from the game date. According to a "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>" reporter, Maryland's final ticket figure was about 800. By comparison, <a href="2001%20Clemson%20Tigers%20football%20team">Clemson</a> sold about 3,500 tickets for the <a href="2001%20Humanitarian%20Bowl">2001 Humanitarian Bowl</a>, and <a href="2007%20Georgia%20Tech%20Yellow%20Jackets%20football%20team">Georgia Tech</a> sold about 250 tickets for the <a href="2007%20Humanitarian%20Bowl">2007 Humanitarian Bowl</a>.

Predictions for the game varied, but generally favored Nevada with Maryland as the <a href="Underdog%20%28competition%29">underdog</a>. Several publications, including "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>", named Nevada as three-point favorites in <a href="spread%20betting">spread betting</a>. <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>'s ACC correspondent predicted Nevada to win by 21 points. <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a> betting firms assigned Nevada as 0.5- to 3.0-point favorites. The <a href="over-under">over-under</a> was predicted to be between 60.0 and 62.0 points.

Under head coach <a href="Ralph%20Friedgen">Ralph Friedgen</a>, Maryland had earned a reputation for inconsistency, sometimes even being referred to as "schizophrenic". During the regular season, the Terrapins managed to beat four of the five top-25 teams they faced: 23rd-ranked <a href="2008%20California%20Golden%20Bears%20football%20team">California</a>, 20th-ranked Clemson, 21st-ranked Wake Forest, and 16th-ranked North Carolina. All of those teams subsequently participated in bowl games. However, Maryland also lost to teams they were expected to defeat. They lost by ten points to 12.5-point underdogs <a href="2008%20Middle%20Tennessee%20Blue%20Raiders%20football%20team">Middle Tennessee State</a>. Maryland suffered a 31-point shut-out against <a href="2008%20Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football%20team">Virginia</a>, a team (then 1–3) that had lost to <a href="2008%20Duke%20Blue%20Devils%20football%20team">Duke</a>, 31–3, the week prior.

Nevada suffered three of its five losses against then top-twelve ranked teams. They lost to <a href="Big%2012%20Football%20Championship%20Game">Big 12 Championship</a> runner-up Missouri and Texas Tech, which, in midseason, was in contention for the national championship and was led by <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> prospect <a href="Graham%20Harrell">Graham Harrell</a>. Nevada managed a close game against Boise State. The Wolf Pack lost by seven points to a team that recorded an average 21.4-point <a href="margin%20of%20victory">margin of victory</a> in a perfect 12–0 regular season. Boise State preserved victory when a <a href="Hail%20Mary%20pass">Hail Mary pass</a> from Kaepernick was broken up in the final seconds. Nevada, however, was also accused of inconsistent play. The Wolf Pack suffered a home loss to "perennial WAC bottom-feeder" <a href="2008%20New%20Mexico%20State%20Aggies%20football%20team">New Mexico State</a>, 48–45.

Maryland's offense was run by first-year <a href="offensive%20coordinator">offensive coordinator</a> and former <a href="wide%20receivers%20coach">wide receivers coach</a> <a href="James%20Franklin%20%28American%20football%20coach%29">James Franklin</a>, who utilized a <a href="West%20Coast%20offense">West Coast</a> system. During the 2008 regular season, starting quarterback <a href="Chris%20Turner%20%28American%20football%29">Chris Turner</a> threw for 2,318 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 10 <a href="interception">interception</a>s. <a href="NFL%20Draft">NFL Draft</a> prospect <a href="Darrius%20Heyward-Bey">Darrius Heyward-Bey</a> accumulated 561 receiving yards in ten games. Heyward-Bey also recorded 208 rushing yards and was often utilized in <a href="reverse%20%28American%20football%29">reverses</a> and other <a href="trick%20play">trick play</a>s due to his breakaway speed. Maryland had another offensive weapon in running back <a href="Da%27Rel%20Scott">Da'Rel Scott</a>, who ran for 959 yards during the regular season. Overall, the rushing offense gained 134.5 yards per game and was ranked 72nd in the nation. Against <a href="2008%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech</a> and <a href="2008%20Boston%20College%20Eagles%20football%20team">Boston College</a>, Maryland rushed for −12 and −6 yards, respectively. The previous year, in the <a href="2007%20Emerald%20Bowl">2007 Emerald Bowl</a> against <a href="2007%20Oregon%20State%20Beavers%20football%20team">Oregon State</a>, Maryland recorded 19 yards on the ground against the then second-ranked rushing defense.

About Maryland, Nevada head coach <a href="Chris%20Ault">Chris Ault</a> said, "Their offense to me is very balanced. They can run the ball and do a good job. With [quarterback Chris] Turner, they split out and they have some nice receivers. Whereas Missouri was going to throw it as much as Texas Tech did, I think Maryland is probably one of the more balanced teams we've played this year."

The Maryland offense faced first-year <a href="defensive%20coordinator">defensive coordinator</a> <a href="Nigel%20Burton">Nigel Burton</a>'s Nevada defense. It ranked third in the nation against the run, allowing 74.5 rushing yards per game, but was last (120th) in the nation in passing defense, allowing an average of 321.1 passing yards per game. Nevada was ranked eighth in the number of <a href="quarterback%20sack">quarterback sack</a>s with 35. <a href="Kevin%20Basped">Kevin Basped</a>, ranked tenth in the nation in sacks, and <a href="Dontay%20Moch">Dontay Moch</a>, ranked fifteenth, accumulated more than nine each. Maryland quarterback Turner was sacked 11 times in the Terrapins' last two games against <a href="2008%20Florida%20State%20Seminoles%20football%20team">Florida State</a> and Boston College. Nevada was also ranked sixth nationally in <a href="tackle%20%28football%20move%29%23American%20and%20Canadian%20football">tackles for loss</a>, with an average of 8.0 per game.

In 2008, Nevada typically ran an offensive scheme referred to as the "<a href="pistol%20offense">pistol offense</a>", a system that was pioneered by head coach <a href="Chris%20Ault">Chris Ault</a>. In the pistol offense, the quarterback lines up four yards directly behind the <a href="center%20%28American%20football%29">center</a> and with a running back directly behind the quarterback. Under the system, the offense attempts to keep the opposing defense off balance by diversifying the types of plays that can be run, with a focus on running up the middle, "quarterback keepers" in which the passer runs the ball, and <a href="play%20action%20pass">play action pass</a>es where the quarterback fakes a hand-off before throwing to a receiver. It aims to create man-to-man match-ups with the receivers and compensate for an undersized offensive line. With the running back obscured from view by the quarterback, it can also create confusion for the opposing <a href="linebacker">linebacker</a>s and allow more effective deception, which is critical to <a href="Play%20action%20pass">play-action</a> fakes.

The system worked well during the regular season. Nevada starting quarterback and 2008 WAC Offensive Player of the Year <a href="Colin%20Kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a> ran for more than 1,100 yards and 16 touchdowns in addition to passing for 2,479 yards and 19 touchdowns. Alongside Kaepernick, Nevada's rushing offense was led by running back <a href="Vai%20Taua">Vai Taua</a>, who ran for 1,420 yards and 14 touchdowns. With two 1,000-yard rushers for the first time in school history, Nevada ran for an average of 291.4 yards per game. Nevada was ranked fifth nationally in terms of total offense, averaging 510.6 yards per game.

With regards to facing the pistol offense, Maryland head coach <a href="Ralph%20Friedgen">Ralph Friedgen</a> said, "If we can keep our assignments and tackle, we'll be OK. One missed tackle could be a big play ... With the throwing game, there could be a lot of one-on-one situations. To me, it's pick your poison. What they do best is run it. What we'd like to do is get them off schedule. If they mix it, then we're in trouble."

Nevada coach Ault said, "I think the Maryland defense is as physical as Missouri's was." Kaepernick said, "You notice how disciplined and how hard they play. They're never out of alignment. If they're supposed to be somewhere, they're going to be there and they're going to be ready to make a play. When plays come their way, they make them. That's something we have to be ready for. We have to find a weakness and exploit it."

After Maryland's last regular-season game, defensive coordinator <a href="Chris%20Cosh">Chris Cosh</a> and <a href="tight%20ends%20coach">tight ends coach</a> and <a href="special%20teams">special teams</a> assistant Danny Pearman announced their resignations. Cosh returned to <a href="Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football">Kansas State</a>, where he had coached before Maryland, to assume defensive play-calling duties under recently re-hired head coach <a href="Bill%20Snyder">Bill Snyder</a>. Danny Pearman returned to his alma mater, <a href="Clemson%20Tigers%20football">Clemson</a>, to work for <a href="Dabo%20Swinney">Dabo Swinney</a>, who had been promoted from offensive coordinator to interim head coach and, finally, head coach for the Tigers. For the bowl game, Maryland's <a href="defensive%20line%20coach">defensive line coach</a>, Al Seamonson, was named as the interim defensive coordinator. Third-year intern Brian White filled in for Pearman as the interim tight ends coach and would assist head coach Friedgen in running the special teams.

Shortly before the game, Maryland head coach <a href="Ralph%20Friedgen">Ralph Friedgen</a> placed partial-game suspensions on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew. The suspended players were linebackers <a href="Moise%20Fokou">Moise Fokou</a>, Trey Covington, <a href="Antwine%20Perez">Antwine Perez</a>, and Derek Drummond, <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> <a href="Danny%20Oquendo">Danny Oquendo</a>, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters. Consequently, a much younger line-up started for Maryland, including, according to Friedgen, some who probably would not have seen playing time otherwise.

Friedgen stated that the curfew violations occurred over several nights, and that different players violated the rule to separate degrees. He informed Maryland athletic director <a href="Deborah%20Yow">Deborah Yow</a> of the infractions and initially suggested sending all of the curfew violators back to Maryland by bus. Yow dissented, and they agreed to suspend the players for part of the game. Describing the incident, Friedgen said that "Five percent of [the] guys thought they didn't need to listen to me, that they could get bed checked and sneak out." He added, "But I checked again at 1 o'clock. <a href="This%20Ain%27t%20My%20First%20Rodeo">"This is not my first rodeo</a>."

The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl kicked off at 2:30 p.m. <a href="Mountain%20Time%20Zone">Mountain Time</a> on Tuesday, December 30, 2008 in front of a crowd of 26,781 spectators at Bronco Stadium in Boise, Idaho. The weather conditions were cloudy with a temperature of 38 °F (3 °C) and wind at eight mph (12.9 km/h) from the southeast. The <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29">officiating staff</a> consisted of <a href="Referee%23Football%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%29">referee</a> Clair Gausman, <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29%23Umpire">umpire</a> Rico Orsot, <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29%23Head%20linesman">linesman</a> Cal McNeill, <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29%23Line%20judge">line judge</a> Gary McNanna, <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29%23Back%20judge">back judge</a> Tom Bessant, <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29%23Field%20judge">field judge</a> Shane Standley, <a href="Official%20%28American%20football%29%23Side%20judge">side judge</a> Kim Nelson, and scorer Mike Cannon. The game was televised on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> and drew a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">television rating</a> of 2.1 for an estimated 3,039,000 viewers. It was a 218% increase in television viewers from the previous season's game.

The game started with Maryland receiving the <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a>, which <a href="Kenny%20Tate">Kenny Tate</a> <a href="Kickoff%20return">returned</a> 17 yards to the Terrapins' 35-yard line. Quarterback <a href="Chris%20Turner%20%28American%20football%29">Chris Turner</a> threw a short <a href="forward%20pass">pass</a> to <a href="Torrey%20Smith">Torrey Smith</a>, bringing the ball to the Maryland 41-yard line, and then threw an <a href="incomplete%20pass">incomplete pass</a>. On third <a href="down%20%28American%20football%29">down</a> with three yards to go, Turner connected with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59-yard <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a> pass. However, <a href="placekicker">placekicker</a> <a href="Obi%20Egekeze">Obi Egekeze</a> missed the <a href="extra%20point">extra point</a>.

In subsequent possessions, Nevada and Maryland both failed to gain first downs and exchanged <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punts</a>. Nevada quarterback <a href="Colin%20Kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a> then led a drive that included a 68-yard pass to the Maryland three-yard line. The Terrapins' defense stopped two rushing attempts by <a href="Vai%20Taua">Vai Taua</a>, but a short pass to wide receiver Chris Wellington was completed for Nevada's first touchdown. With the extra point, Nevada took the lead, 7–6. Wolf Pack placekicker Brett Jaekle executed a 69-yard kickoff to Torrey Smith, and he returned it 99 yards for a second Maryland touchdown. Egekeze made the extra point and Maryland regained the lead, 13–7, with 7:53 remaining in the quarter.

On the ensuing kickoff, Egekeze attempted to kick the ball as it fell off the <a href="tee">tee</a>. This resulted in an unintentional <a href="squib%20kick">squib</a> that was returned 36 yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw the ball into the <a href="end%20zone">end zone</a>, but it was <a href="interception">intercepted</a> by Maryland <a href="safety%20%28American%20football%20position%29">safety</a> Kenny Tate, resulting in a <a href="touchback">touchback</a>. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back <a href="Davin%20Meggett">Davin Meggett</a> rushed for 13 yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver <a href="Ronnie%20Tyler">Ronnie Tyler</a> for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a <a href="false%20start%23American%20football">false start</a> penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a <a href="pass%20interference">pass interference</a> call against Maryland, and <a href="Quarterback%20scramble">scrambled</a> for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17 yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.

Nevada's Jaekle made a short kick-off, and Maryland <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> <a href="Dan%20Gronkowski">Dan Gronkowski</a> returned the ball eight yards to the Maryland 44-yard line. On the final play of the quarter, Turner handed the ball off to sophomore <a href="running%20back">running back</a> <a href="Morgan%20Green">Morgan Green</a>, who picked up three yards. The quarter ended with Nevada leading, 14–13.

The second quarter began with Maryland in possession of the ball at its 47-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Turner handed off to Green, who broke free of the Nevada defense for a 53-yard gain and a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Maryland a six-point lead, 20–14, with 14:50 remaining in the first half.

Nevada and Maryland then exchanged punts three times, and the Wolf Pack punted it away a fourth time. In the span of two series, Kaepernick was <a href="quarterback%20sack">sacked</a> three times, once each by linebackers <a href="Dave%20Philistin">Dave Philistin</a>, <a href="Alex%20Wujciak">Alex Wujciak</a>, and Adrian Moten. As a result, Kaepernick suffered an ankle sprain and played the rest of the game, but he noticeably favored his uninjured side. The Terps took over on their 47-yard line with 0:29 remaining in the half. Turner completed an eight-yard pass to Ronnie Tyler, and a Nevada hit out-of-bounds resulted in a 15-yard penalty against Nevada and a first down for Maryland. After two incomplete passes, Turner then converted on third down again with a toss to Tyler for 16 yards and then once more for 14 yards and a touchdown to bring the score to 26–14 in Maryland's favor. The Terps elected to attempt a <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>, and Turner completed a pass to a wide-open Meggett in the right side of the end zone. With six seconds remaining in the first half, Maryland had a 28–14 lead. Nevada received Maryland's kickoff, but elected to <a href="Running%20out%20the%20clock">run out the clock</a> and head into halftime.

Maryland kicked off to Nevada to start the second half, and the teams again exchanged punts twice. Kaepernick sat out the next series due to his sprained ankle. Backup quarterback Nick Graziano took over but was unable to complete two passes and Nevada punted a third time. In the next series, Turner threw an interception to Nevada safety Jonathan Amaya, who returned it for 33 yards to the Maryland 22-yard line, then <a href="fumble">fumble</a>d. The ball was recovered by Nevada, and Kaepernick capitalized on the turnover with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Taua, narrowing Nevada's deficit to 28–21.

Jaekle kicked off to the Maryland 30-yard line where it was returned by Green for two yards. A fresh <a href="Da%27Rel%20Scott">Da'Rel Scott</a> then made his first appearance in the game. He carried the ball four times in succession to advance to the Nevada 46-yard line. On third down with nine yards to go, Turner was sacked by <a href="defensive%20lineman">defensive lineman</a> <a href="Kevin%20Basped">Kevin Basped</a> and the ball was knocked loose. It was picked up by Wolf Pack linebacker Brandon Marshall who then also fumbled. Maryland <a href="offensive%20lineman">offensive lineman</a> <a href="Scott%20Burley">Scott Burley</a> recovered it on the Nevada 45-yard line. The alternating changes in possession gave Maryland a first down, and Turner then connected with <a href="Darrius%20Heyward-Bey">Darrius Heyward-Bey</a> on an 11-yard pass for another first down. Scott rushed twice to pick up a first down at the Nevada 23-yard line. After a rush by Meggett, Turner was sacked by <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> <a href="Dontay%20Moch">Dontay Moch</a> and again fumbled. This time, Nevada recovered the ball and retained possession. Kaepernick then passed to wide receiver Mike McCoy for 38 yards to the Maryland 27-yard line. Vai Taua picked up seven yards on a rush attempt, and the quarter came to an end with Maryland leading, 28–21.

The fourth quarter began with Nevada in possession of the ball at the Maryland 20-yard line. The first play of the quarter was a rush attempt by Taua, but he fumbled and recovered the ball for a loss of one yard. On the second play of the quarter, Kaepernick completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver <a href="Marko%20Mitchell">Marko Mitchell</a>, tying the score at 28–28.

Following the Nevada kickoff, Turner handed off to Scott, who picked up two yards. After an incomplete pass, Turner connected with Torrey Smith on a 26-yard toss for a third-down conversion. Scott then rushed for three yards to the Nevada 49-yard line, and <a href="carry%20%28American%20football%29">carried</a> it again down the middle, this time breaking free for a 49-yard touchdown run. On the following Nevada series, Kaepernick mounted a 38-yard drive to the Maryland 34-yard line, but failed to convert on fourth and 12. On the next series, Da'Rel Scott was handed the ball four times in succession to pick up first downs with rushes of 11, 23, 30 yards and a touchdown on a two-yard run. The score and extra point gave Maryland a two-touchdown lead, 42–28. Nevada's offense returned to the field with 7:44 remaining in the game and used almost three minutes in a 37-yard drive that culminated in an interception by Maryland safety Jeff Allen on the Maryland 38-yard line. After no gain on a rush by running back Morgan Green, Maryland attempted an <a href="end-around">end-around</a>. Turner was stepped on, and the handoff was botched. The intended recipient, Heyward-Bey, dropped the ball but managed to recover it for a loss of six yards. After Nevada called a <a href="time-out%20%28sport%29">time out</a>, Green rushed for a five-yard gain. Nevada expended its last remaining time out to stop the clock with 4:06 left. Maryland punted it away on fourth down with 11 yards to go.

Kaepernick took over on the Nevada 23-yard line with 4:01 and made four completions to drive to the Terps' 15-yard line. Exploiting a large opening, Kaepernick <a href="quarterback%20scramble">held onto the ball and ran</a> it into the end zone to narrow Maryland's lead to one touchdown, 42–35, with 2:19 remaining. Jaekle attempted an <a href="onside%20kick">onside kick</a> in an effort to give Nevada another chance on offense, but the ball was recovered by Maryland receiver <a href="Danny%20Oquendo">Danny Oquendo</a>. Scott rushed for two and then 19 yards. With the first down, Maryland had enough time to <a href="quarterback%20kneel">run out the clock</a> and clinch the 42–35 victory.

The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> honors were awarded to Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott, who rushed for 174 yards, and Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who threw for 370 yards. Each was the statistical leader at his respective position, and Scott scored Maryland's two final touchdowns to break the 28–28 stalemate. Scott also was able to help Maryland clinch the victory in the final minutes by rushing for a first down that allowed the team to run out the clock.

The 77 points scored in the game tied the Humanitarian Bowl record for total points, which had been set in 1998 by <a href="1998%20Idaho%20Vandals%20football%20team">Idaho</a> and <a href="1998%20Southern%20Miss%20Golden%20Eagles%20football%20team">Southern Miss</a>.

Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick set the Humanitarian Bowl passing yardage record with 370 yards <a href="forward%20pass">through the air</a>, and he scored three touchdowns in the process. Despite the loss, Kaepernick's team outperformed Maryland in terms of passing yardage, total offense, first downs, and time of possession.

Maryland freshman wide receiver Torrey Smith, with his 99-yard kickoff return, broke the all-time <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> single-season kickoff return yards record with 1,089 yards. Smith also broke the Humanitarian Bowl kick return record, which was previously 98 yards.

With 174 yards, Da'Rel Scott set the Maryland record for rushing yards in a bowl game, despite playing just one and a half quarters due to his curfew suspension. The previous record was 165 yards, set by <a href="Lu%20Gambino">Lu Gambino</a> in Maryland's first bowl game, the <a href="1948%20Gator%20Bowl">1948 Gator Bowl</a>. Scott also broke the 1,000 yards-per-season barrier, making him one of just seven players in school history to do so. Scott said earlier in the year that reaching the 1,000-yard benchmark was a personal goal he set for the 2008 season. Between Scott and Davin Meggett, Maryland also came the closest it ever has to having both a 1,000- and 500-yard rusher in the same season. Meggett fell just 43 yards shy of the 500-yard mark.

Nevada set a school record for single-season total offensive yards, recording 6,611 in 2008. This surpassed the previous record of 6,263 yards, set in 1995.

Four Maryland backups who saw significant playing time due to the suspensions scored touchdowns: second-string <a href="wide%20receiver%23Types">slot receiver</a> Ronnie Tyler, second-string <a href="wide%20receiver%23Types">X-receiver</a> Torrey Smith, third-string slot receiver Adrian Cannon, and third-string running back Morgan Green.

Maryland compiled 456 yards of total offense: 198 in the air and 258 yards on the ground. Quarterback Chris Turner completed passes to five receivers during the game: Ronnie Tyler (five), Darrius Heyward-Bey (four), Torrey Smith (two), Adrian Cannon (one), and Emani Lee-Odai (one). Cannon and Tyler each caught a pass for a touchdown. Running back Davin Meggett caught a pass for a two-point conversion. Turner also threw one interception.

On the ground, rushing attempts were made by running backs Da'Rel Scott (14 for 174 yards), Morgan Green (10 for 72 yards), and Davin Meggett (10 for 35 yards). Wide receiver Heyward-Bey also made a rushing attempt, but dropped the ball and recovered it for a loss of six yards.

Maryland had previously shown an ability to strike quickly on offense and did so again in the game. In the 2008 season, the team scored 18 out of 28 touchdowns in drives consisting of six or fewer plays or less than two minutes of game time. This led to the team often trailing opponents in time of possession. In the Humanitarian Bowl, Maryland continued the pattern by scoring in the first 1:01 with a 59-yard Chris Turner pass to Adrian Cannon. Maryland also possessed the ball for 2:26 less than Nevada.

Maryland, which was third-best in the ACC in third down attempts (40.4%), did comparatively poorly during the game, converting only four of 14 third downs (28.6%).

Defensively, Maryland was able to hold the nation's third-ranked rushing offense to just 114 yards on the ground. Nevada quarterback Kaepernick, who ran for 1,115 yards, was held to just 19 rushing yards, 15 of which were gained during a touchdown run. Two players made their first career interceptions: true freshman safety Kenny Tate and senior defensive back Jeff Allen. Tate's interception in the Maryland end zone prevented a Nevada score, while Allen's interception with 4:54 remaining helped seal the victory for Maryland. Offensive lineman Scott Burley forced a fumble against Nevada linebacker Brandon Marshall, who had recovered a third-down fumble by Turner. Burley subsequently recovered the forced fumble and gave Maryland a first down.

Maryland's <a href="special%20teams">special teams</a> recorded one touchdown when Torrey Smith returned a kickoff for 99 yards. After the first touchdown of the game, senior placekicker Obi Egekeze missed an extra point for the first time in his career. Early in the season, Egekeze missed his first five <a href="field%20goal%20%28football%29">field goal</a> attempts, but, prior to the Humanitarian Bowl, he had made all 64 extra-point attempts of his career. After the first failed kick, Egekeze made the other five extra-point attempts of the game. The placekicker also erred when he attempted to kick the ball as it fell off the tee, resulting in a short 15-yard kick which was returned 36 yards by Nevada to the Maryland nine-yard line.

Nevada recorded better statistics than Maryland in several areas despite ultimately losing the game. The Wolf Pack compiled seven more first downs, 172 more passing yards, 28 more total offensive yards, 15 fewer penalty yards, 15.8% more third down conversions, and 2:26 more time in possession of the ball.

In the passing game, Colin Kaepernick achieved a 51.1% pass completion rate (24 out of 47). He threw for 370 yards, including three touchdowns. He completed passes to Mike McCoy (13), Marko Mitchell (five), Chris Wellington (three), Arthur King, Jr. (two), and Vai Taua (one). Mitchell, Wellington, and Taua each caught a pass for a touchdown. Due to Kaepernick's injury, backup quarterback Nick Graziano played for one series but was unable to make a completion on two attempts.

On the ground, Nevada struggled against the Maryland defense, recording 114 rushing yards, far fewer than its 291.4 per game average. Running plays were attempted by Kaepernick and Taua, who made 23 carries for 101 yards and one touchdown. Despite suffering from a sprained ankle, Kaepernick also was able to scamper 15 yards for a rushing touchdown.

Conversely, the Nevada defense had difficulty stopping the Maryland run. Nevada's rush defense allowed 258 yards, compared with its regular-season average of just 74.5 yards allowed per game. This was especially true after a well-rested Da'Rel Scott entered the game in the middle of the third quarter. Head coach Chris Ault said, "He just ran through us like we weren't there." Defensive back Jonathan Amaya intercepted a Chris Turner pass for his fourth interception of the season.

Brett Jaekle handled all of Nevada's kicking duties. He made all five extra-point attempts. Jaekle punted eight times for 295 yards and kicked off five times for 270 yards. With 1:42 remaining, he attempted an onside kick, but the ball was recovered by Maryland's Danny Oquendo.
With the bowl game, Maryland finished the season with an 8–5 record. The win was Maryland's 600th in school history. Ralph Friedgen's postseason record improved to 4–2, which gave him twice as many bowl wins as any other head coach in school history. For the 2008 season, Maryland stood 5–1 in games <a href="margin%20of%20victory">decided by</a> seven points or less and 8–0 in games kicked off during daylight hours.

Nevada posted a final record of 7–6. The game was the third consecutive postseason loss for Chris Ault and Nevada. Ault's post-season bowl record slid to 1–5 as a result.

Brachiosaurus

Brachiosaurus () is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in North America during the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a>, about 154–153 million years ago. It was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> by American paleontologist <a href="Elmer%20S.%20Riggs">Elmer S. Riggs</a> in <a href="1903%20in%20paleontology">1903</a> from fossils found in the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> valley in western <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the <a href="generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> is <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> for "arm lizard", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> means "deep chest". "Brachiosaurus" is estimated to have been between 18 and 21 meters (59 and 69 ft) long; weight estimates range from 28.3 to 58 metric tons (31.2 and 64 short tons). It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. Atypically, "Brachiosaurus" had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, which resulted in a steeply inclined <a href="torso">trunk</a>, and a proportionally shorter tail.

"Brachiosaurus" is the namesake genus of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Brachiosauridae">Brachiosauridae</a>, which includes a handful of other similar sauropods. Most popular depictions of "Brachiosaurus" are in fact based on "<a href="Giraffatitan">Giraffatitan</a>", a genus of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the <a href="Tendaguru%20Formation">Tendaguru Formation</a> of <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. "Giraffatitan" was originally described by German paleontologist <a href="Werner%20Janensch">Werner Janensch</a> in 1914 as a species of "Brachiosaurus", "B. brancai", but moved to its own genus in 2009. Three other species of "Brachiosaurus" have been named based on fossils found in Africa and Europe; two are no longer considered valid, and a third has become a separate genus, "<a href="Lusotitan">Lusotitan</a>".

The <a href="holotype">type specimen</a> of "B. altithorax" is still the most complete specimen, and only a few other specimens are thought to belong to the genus, making it one of the rarer sauropods of the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>. It is regarded as a high <a href="browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browser</a>, possibly cropping or nipping vegetation as high as off the ground. Unlike other sauropods, it was unsuited for rearing on its hindlimbs. It has been used as an example of a dinosaur that was most likely <a href="ectothermic">ectothermic</a> because of its large size and the corresponding need for sufficient <a href="forage">forage</a>, but more recent research suggests it was <a href="warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>. Among the most iconic and initially thought to be one of the <a href="Dinosaur%20size">largest dinosaurs</a>, "Brachiosaurus" has appeared in <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>, notably in the 1993 film "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>".

Most estimates of "Brachiosaurus altithorax" size are based on the related African <a href="brachiosaurid">brachiosaurid</a> "<a href="Giraffatitan">Giraffatitan</a>" (formerly known as "Brachiosaurus brancai"), which is known from much more complete material than "Brachiosaurus". The two species are the largest brachiosaurids of which relatively extensive remains have been discovered. There is another element of uncertainty for the North American "Brachiosaurus" because the <a href="holotype">type</a> (and most complete) specimen appears to represent a <a href="subadult">subadult</a>, as indicated by the unfused <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">suture</a> between the <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>, a bone of the <a href="shoulder%20girdle">shoulder girdle</a> that forms part of the <a href="shoulder%20joint">shoulder joint</a>, and the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade). Over the years, the mass of "B. altithorax" has been estimated at , , , , , and . The length of "Brachiosaurus" has been estimated at 20–21 meters (66–69 ft) and , and its height at and 12–13 meters (39–43 ft).

While the limb bones of the most complete "Giraffatitan" skeleton (<a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20Berlin">MB</a>.R.2181) were very similar in size to those of the "Brachiosaurus" type specimen, the former was somewhat lighter than the "Brachiosaurus" specimen given its proportional differences. In studies including estimates for both genera, "Giraffatitan" was estimated at , , and . As with the main "Brachiosaurus" specimen, "Giraffatitan" specimen MB.R.2181 likely does not reflect the maximum size of the genus, as a <a href="fibula">fibula</a> (specimen <a href="List%20of%20museums%20in%20Hamburg%23Science%20%26amp%3B%20Natural%20History">HM</a> XV2) is 13% longer than that of MB.R.2181.

Like all sauropod dinosaurs, "Brachiosaurus" was a quadruped with a small skull, a long neck, a large trunk with a high-<a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> cross section, a long, muscular tail and slender, columnar limbs. Large <a href="air%20sacs">air sacs</a> connected to the lung system were present in the neck and trunk, invading the <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e and ribs by <a href="bone%20resorption">bone resorption</a>, greatly reducing the overall density of the body. The neck is not preserved in the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a>, but was very long even by sauropod standards in the closely related "Giraffatitan", consisting of thirteen elongated <a href="cervical%20vertebra">cervical</a> (neck) vertebrae. The neck was held in a slight S-curve, with the lower and upper sections bent and a straight middle section. "Brachiosaurus" likely shared with "Giraffatitan" the very elongated <a href="cervical%20rib">neck ribs</a>, which ran down the underside of the neck, overlapping several preceding vertebrae. These bony rods were attached to neck muscles at their ends, allowing these muscles to operate <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">distal</a> portions of the neck while themselves being located closer to the trunk, lightening the distal neck portions.

"Brachiosaurus" and "Giraffatitan" probably had a small shoulder hump between the third and fifth <a href="thoracic%20vertebra">dorsal</a> (back) vertebra, where the sideward- and upward-directed vertebral <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a> were longer, providing additional surface for neck muscle attachment. The ribcage was deep compared to other sauropods. Though the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) and <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone) were roughly equal in length, the entire forelimb would have been longer than the hindlimb, as can be inferred from the elongated forearm and <a href="metacarpus">metacarpus</a> of other brachiosaurids. This resulted in an inclined trunk with the shoulder much higher than the hips, and the neck exiting the trunk at a steep angle. The overall build of "Brachiosaurus" resembles a <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a> more than any other living animal. In contrast, most other sauropods had a shorter forelimb than hindlimb; the forelimb is especially short in contemporaneous <a href="Diplodocoidea">diplodocoids</a>.

"Brachiosaurus" differed in its body proportions from the closely related "Giraffatitan". The trunk was about 25–30% longer, resulting in a dorsal vertebral column longer than the humerus. Only a single complete <a href="caudal%20vertebra">caudal</a> (tail) vertebra has been discovered, but its great height suggests that the tail was larger than in "Giraffatitan". This vertebra had a much greater area for <a href="ligament">ligament</a> attachment due to a broadened <a href="neural%20spine">neural spine</a>, indicating that the tail was also longer than in "Giraffatitan", possibly by 20–25%. In 1988, paleontologist <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> suggested that the neck of "Brachiosaurus" was shorter than that of "Giraffatitan", but in 2009, paleontologist <a href="Mike%20P.%20Taylor">Mike P. Taylor</a> pointed out that two cervical vertebrae likely belonging to "Brachiosaurus" had identical proportions. Unlike "Giraffatitan" and other sauropods, which had vertically oriented forelimbs, the arms of "Brachiosaurus" appear to have been slightly sprawled at the shoulder joints, as indicated by the sideward orientation of the joint surfaces of the coracoids. The humerus was less slender than that of "Giraffatitan", while the femur had similar proportions. This might indicate that the forelimbs of "Brachiosaurus" supported a greater fraction of the body weight than is the case for "Giraffatitan".

Though the vertebral column of the trunk or torso is incompletely known, the back of "Brachiosaurus" most likely comprised twelve dorsal vertebrae; this can be inferred from the complete dorsal vertebral column preserved in an unnamed brachiosaurid specimen, <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">BMNH</a> R5937. Vertebrae of the front part of the dorsal column were slightly taller but much longer than those of the back part. This is in contrast to "Giraffatitan", where the vertebrae at the front part were much taller but only slightly longer. The centra (vertebral bodies), the lower part of the vertebrae, were more elongated and roughly circular in cross-section, while those of "Giraffatitan" were broader than tall. The <a href="foramen">foramina</a> (small openings) on the sides of the centra, which allowed for the intrusion of air sacs, were larger than in "Giraffatitan". The diapophyses (large projections extending sideways from the <a href="neural%20arch">neural arch</a> of the vertebrae) were horizontal, while those of "Giraffatitan" were inclined upward. At their ends, these projections articulated with the ribs; the articular surface was not distinctly triangular as in "Giraffatitan". In side view, the upward-projecting <a href="spinous%20processes">neural spines</a> stood vertically and were twice as wide at the base than at the top; those of "Giraffatitan" tilted backward and did not broaden at their base. When seen in front or back view, the neural spines widened toward their tops.

In "Brachiosaurus", this widening occurred gradually, resulting in a paddle-like shape, while in "Giraffatitan" the widening occurred abruptly and only in the uppermost portion. At both their front and back sides, the neural spines featured large, triangular and rugose surfaces, which in "Giraffatitan" were semicircular and much smaller. The various vertebral processes were connected by thin sheets or ridges of bone, which are called "laminae". "Brachiosaurus" lacked postspinal laminae, which were present in "Giraffatitan", running down the back side of the neural spines. The spinodiapophyseal laminae, which stretched from the neural spines to the diapophyses, were conflated with the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae, which stretched between the neural spines and the <a href="articular%20processes">articular processes</a> at the back of the vertebrae, and therefore terminated at mid-height of the neural spines. In "Giraffatitan", both laminae were not conflated, and the spinodiapophyseal laminae reached up to the top of the neural spines. "Brachiosaurus" is further distinguished from "Giraffatitan" in lacking three details in the laminae of the dorsal vertebrae that are unique to the latter genus.
Air sacs not only invaded the vertebrae, but also the ribs. In "Brachiosaurus", the air sacs invaded through a small opening on the front side of the rib shafts, while in "Giraffatitan" openings were present on both the front and back sides of the tuberculum, a bony projection articulating with the diapophyses of the vertebrae. Paul, in 1988, stated that the ribs of "Brachiosaurus" were longer than in "Giraffatitan", which was questioned by Taylor in 2009. Behind the dorsal vertebral column, the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> consisted of five co-<a href="ossification">ossified</a> <a href="sacral%20vertebra">sacral vertebra</a>e. As in "Giraffatitan", the sacrum was proportionally broad and featured very short neural spines. Poor preservation of the sacral material in "Giraffatitan" precludes detailed comparisons between both genera. Of the tail, only the second caudal vertebra is well preserved.

As in "Giraffatitan", this vertebra was slightly amphicoelous (concave on both ends), lacked openings on the sides, and had a short neural spine that was rectangular and tilted backward. In contrast to the second caudal vertebra of "Giraffatitan", that of "Brachiosaurus" had a proportionally taller neural arch, making the vertebra around 30% taller. The centrum lacked depressions on its sides, in contrast to "Giraffatitan". In front or back view, the neural spine broadened toward its tip to approximately three times its minimum width, but no broadening is apparent in "Giraffatitan". The neural spines were also inclined backward by about 30°, more than in "Giraffatitan" (20°). The caudal ribs projected laterally and were not tilted backward as in "Giraffatitan". The articular facets of the articular processes at the back of the vertebra were directed downward, while those of "Giraffatitan" faced more toward the sides. Besides the articular processes, the <a href="hyposphene-hypantrum%20articulation">hyposphene-hypantrum articulation</a> formed an additional articulation between vertebrae, making the vertebral column more rigid; in "Brachiosaurus", the hyposphene was much more pronounced than in "Giraffatitan".
The coracoid was semicircular and taller than broad. Differences from "Giraffatitan" are related to its shape in side view, including the straighter suture with the scapula. Moreover, the articular surface that forms part of the shoulder joint was thicker and directed more sideward than in "Giraffatitan" and other sauropods, possibly indicating a more sprawled forelimb. The humerus, as preserved, measures in length, though part of its lower end was lost to erosion; its original length is estimated at . This bone was more slender in "Brachiosaurus" than in most other sauropods, measuring only in width at its narrowest part. It was, however, more robust than that of "Giraffatitan", being around 10% broader at the upper and lower ends. At its upper end, it featured a low bulge visible in side view, which is absent in "Giraffatitan".

Distinguishing features can also be found in the <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> of the pelvis. In "Brachiosaurus", the ischiadic peduncle, a downward projecting extension connecting to the <a href="ischium">ischium</a>, reaches farther downward than in "Giraffatitan". While the latter genus had a sharp notch between the ischiadic peduncle and the back portion of the ilium, this notch is more rounded in "Brachiosaurus". On the upper surface of the hind part of the ilium, "Brachiosaurus" had a pronounced tubercle that is absent in other sauropods. Of the hindlimb, the femur was very similar to that of "Giraffatitan" although slightly more robust, and measured long. As in "Giraffatitan", it was strongly elliptical in cross-section, being more than twice as wide in front or back view than in side view. The <a href="fourth%20trochanter">fourth trochanter</a>, a prominent bulge on the back side of the femoral shaft, was more prominent and located further downward. This bulge served as anchor point for the most important locomotory muscle, the <a href="caudofemoralis">caudofemoralis</a>, which was situated in the tail and pulled the upper thigh backward when contracted. At the lower end of the femur, the pair of <a href="condyle%20%28anatomy%29">condyles</a> did not extend backward as strongly as in "Giraffatitan"; the two condyles were similar in width in "Brachiosaurus" but unequal in "Giraffatitan".

Though no skull remains were discovered with the original "Brachiosaurus" skeleton, one partial skull from a different location may belong to "Brachiosaurus": the Felch Quarry skull (specimen <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">USNM</a> 5730). Since there is no overlapping material between the two specimens, the skull has only been assigned to "Brachiosaurus" sp. (of uncertain species). As reconstructed, the skull was about long from the <a href="occipital%20condyle">occipital condyle</a> at the back of the skull to the front of the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>e (the front bones of the upper jaw), making it the largest sauropod skull from the <a href="Morrison%20Formation">Morrison Formation</a>. It appears to have been most similar to and intermediate between that of "Giraffatitan" and "<a href="Camarasaurus">Camarasaurus</a>". Overall, the skull was tall as in "Giraffatitan", with a snout that was long (about 36% of the skull length) in front of the nasal bar between the nostrils – typical of brachiosaurids. The snout, set at an angle relative to the rest of the skull, gave the impression of pointing downward. The <a href="frontal%20bones">frontal bones</a> on top of the skull were short and wide (similar to "Giraffatitan"), fused and connected by a suture to the <a href="parietal%20bones">parietal bones</a>, which were also fused together. The surface of the parietals between the <a href="supratemporal%20fenestra">supratemporal fenestra</a>e (openings at the rear skull roof) was wider than that of "Giraffatitan", but narrower than that of "Camarasaurus". The skull differed from that of "Giraffatitan" in its U-shaped (instead of W-shaped) suture between frontal and nasal bones, a shape which appears more pronounced by the frontal bones extending forward over the <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbits</a> (eye sockets).

Similar to "Giraffatitan", the neck of the occipital condyle was very long. The premaxilla appears to have been longer than that of "Camarasaurus", sloping more gradually toward the nasal bar, which created the very long snout. "Brachiosaurus" had a long and deep <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (the main bone of the upper jaw), which was thick along the margin where the <a href="Dental%20alveolus">alveoli</a> (tooth sockets) were placed, thinning upward. The <a href="interdental%20plates">interdental plates</a> of the maxilla were thin, fused, porous, and triangular. There were triangular <a href="Nutrient%20artery">nutrient foramina</a> between the plates, each containing the tip of an <a href="Tooth%20eruption">erupting tooth</a>. The narial <a href="Fossa%20%28anatomy%29">fossa</a> (depression) in front of the bony nostril was long and contained a subnarial fenestra, which was much larger than those of "Giraffatitan" and "Camarasaurus". The dentaries (the bones of the lower jaws that contained the teeth) were robust, though less than in "Camarasaurus". The upper margin of the dentary was arched in profile, but not as much as in "Camarasaurus". The interdental plates of the dentary were somewhat oval, with diamond shaped openings between them. The dentary had a <a href="Meckelian%20groove">Meckelian groove</a> that was open until below the ninth alveolus, continuing thereafter as a shallow trough.

Each maxilla had space for about 14 or 15 teeth, whereas "Giraffatitan" had 11 and "Camarasaurus" 8 to 10. The maxillae contained <a href="replacement%20teeth">replacement teeth</a> that had rugose <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, similar to "Camarasaurus", but lacked the small <a href="Denticle%20%28tooth%20feature%29">denticles</a> (serrations) along the edges. Since the maxilla was wider than that of "Camarasaurus", "Brachiosaurus" would have had larger teeth. The replacement teeth in the premaxilla had crinkled enamel, and the most complete of these teeth did not have denticles. Each dentary had space for about 14 teeth. The only well preserved tooth of this skull is large, spoon-shaped, and may be from the front part of the left dentary. It differs from those of "Giraffatitan" in that the crown is much wider than the root, similar to "Camarasaurus". That the tooth is not worn implies that it had erupted around the time the animal died. The outer and inner sides of the tooth were crenelated (had indented vertical grooves); the crenelations of one side met with those of the other side at the top of the tooth, where they formed denticles. The maxillary tooth rows of "Brachiosaurus" and "Giraffatitan" ended well in front of the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a> (the opening in front of the orbit), whereas they ended just in front of and below the fenestra in "Camarasaurus" and "<a href="Shunosaurus">Shunosaurus</a>".

The genus "Brachiosaurus" is based on a partial <a href="postcrania">postcrania</a>l skeleton discovered in <a href="1900%20in%20paleontology">1900</a> in the valley of the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> near <a href="Fruita%2C%20Colorado">Fruita, Colorado</a>. This specimen, which was later declared the holotype, comes from rocks of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation, and therefore is late <a href="Kimmeridgian">Kimmeridgian</a> in age, about 154 to 153 million years old. Discovered by American paleontologist <a href="Elmer%20S.%20Riggs">Elmer S. Riggs</a> and his crew from the Field Columbian Museum (now the <a href="Field%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Field Museum of Natural History</a>) of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, it is currently cataloged as FMNH P 25107.

Riggs and company were working in the area as a result of favorable correspondence between Riggs and Stanton Merill Bradbury, a dentist in nearby <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Colorado">Grand Junction</a>. In the spring of 1899, Riggs had sent letters to mayors in western Colorado, inquiring after possible trails leading from railway heads into northeastern Utah, where he hoped to find fossils of <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> <a href="mammals">mammals</a>. To his surprise, he was informed by Bradbury, an amateur collector himself and president of the Western Colorado Academy of Science, that dinosaur bones had been collected near Grand Junction since 1885. Riggs was skeptical of this claim, but his superior, curator of geology Oliver Cummings Farrington, was very eager to add a large sauropod skeleton to the collection to outdo other institutions, and convinced the museum management to invest five hundred dollars in an expedition. Arriving on June 20, 1900 they set camp at the abandoned Goat Ranch. During a prospecting trip on horseback, Riggs' field assistant Harold William Menke found the humerus of FMNH P 25107, on July 4, exclaiming it was "the biggest thing yet!". Riggs at first took the find for a badly preserved "<a href="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a>" specimen and gave priority to excavating Quarry 12, which held a more promising "<a href="Morosaurus">Morosaurus</a>" skeleton. Having secured that, on 26 July he returned to the humerus in Quarry 13, which soon proved to be of enormous size, convincing a puzzled Riggs that he had discovered the largest land animal ever.
The site, Riggs Quarry 13, is located on a small hill later known as Riggs Hill; it is today marked by a plaque. More "Brachiosaurus" fossils are reported on Riggs Hill, but other fossil finds on the hill have been vandalized. During excavation of the specimen, Riggs misidentified the humerus as a deformed femur due to its great length, and this seemed to be confirmed when an equally-sized, well-preserved real femur of the same skeleton was discovered. In 1904, Riggs noted: "Had it not been for the unusual size of the ribs found associated with it, the specimen would have been discarded as an Apatosaur, too poorly preserved to be of value." It was only after preparation of the fossil material in the laboratory that the bone was recognized as a humerus. The excavation attracted large numbers of visitors, delaying the work and forcing Menke to guard the site to prevent bones from being looted. On 17 August, the last bone was jacketed in plaster. After a concluding ten-day prospecting trip, the expedition returned to Grand Junction and hired a team and wagon to transport all fossils to the railway station, during five days; another week was spent to pack them in thirty-eight crates with a weight of . On 10 September, Riggs left for Chicago by train, arriving on the 15th; the railroad companies let both passengers and cargo travel for free, as a <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> gesture.

The holotype skeleton consists of the right humerus (upper arm bone), the right femur (thigh bone), the right ilium (a hip bone), the right coracoid (a shoulder bone), the sacrum (fused vertebrae of the hip), the last seven thoracic (trunk) and two caudal (tail) vertebrae, and several ribs. Riggs described the coracoid as from the left side of the body, but restudy has shown it to be a right coracoid. At the time of discovery, the lower end of the humerus, the underside of the sacrum, the ilium and the preserved caudal vertebrae were exposed to the air and thus partly damaged by weathering. The vertebrae were only slightly shifted out of their original anatomical position; they were found with their top sides directed downward. The ribs, humerus, and coracoid, however, were displaced to the left side of the vertebral column, indicating transportation by a water current. This is further evidenced by an isolated ilium of "Diplodocus" that apparently had drifted against the vertebral column, as well as by a change in composition of the surrounding rocks. While the specimen itself was embedded in fine-grained clay, indicating low-energy conditions at the time of deposition, it was cut off at the seventh vertebra by a thick layer of much coarser sediments consisting of pebbles at its base and <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> further up, indicating deposition under stronger currents. Based on this evidence, Riggs in 1904 suggested that the missing front part of the skeleton was washed away by a water current, while the hind part was already covered by sediment and thus got preserved.
Riggs published a short report of the new find in 1901, noting the unusual length of the humerus compared to the femur and the extreme overall size and the resulting giraffe-like proportions, as well as the lesser development of the tail, but did not publish a name for the new dinosaur. In 1903, he named the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "Brachiosaurus altithorax". Riggs derived the genus name from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "brachion"/βραχίων meaning "arm" and "sauros"/σαυρος meaning "lizard", because he realized that the length of the arms was unusual for a sauropod. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> was chosen because of the unusually deep and wide chest cavity, from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "altus" "deep" and Greek "thorax"/θώραξ, "breastplate, cuirass, corslet". Latin "thorax" was derived from the Greek and had become a usual scientific designation for the chest of the body. The titles of Riggs' 1901 and 1903 articles emphasized that the specimen was the "largest known dinosaur". Riggs followed his 1903 publication with a more detailed description in a <a href="monograph">monograph</a> in 1904.

Preparation of the holotype began in the fall of 1900 shortly after it was collected by Riggs for the Field Museum. First the limb elements were processed. In the winter of 1904, the badly weathered vertebrae of the back and hip were prepared by James B. Abbott and C.T. Kline. As the preparation of each bone was finished, it was put on display in a glass case in Hall 35 of the Fine Arts Palace of the <a href="Worlds%20Columbian%20Exposition">Worlds Columbian Exposition</a>, the Field Museum's first location. All the bones were, solitarily, still on display by 1908 in Hall 35 when the Field Museum's newly mounted "<a href="Apatosaurus">Apatosaurus</a>" was unveiled, the very specimen Riggs had found in Quarry 12, today catalogued as FMNH P25112 and identified as a "Brontosaurus" exemplar. No mount of "Brachiosaurus" was attempted because only 20% of the skeleton had been recovered. In 1993, the holotype bones were molded and cast, and the missing bones were sculpted based on "Giraffatitan" material in Berlin. This plastic skeleton was mounted and, in 1994, put on display at the north end of Stanley Field Hall, the main exhibit hall of the Field Museum's current building. The real bones of the holotype were put on exhibit in two large glass cases at either end of the mounted cast. The mount stood until 1999, when it was moved to the B Concourse of <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a>' Terminal One in <a href="O%27Hare%20International%20Airport">O'Hare International Airport</a> to make room for the museum's newly acquired "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>" skeleton, "<a href="Sue%20%28dinosaur%29">Sue</a>". At the same time, the Field Museum mounted a second plastic cast of the skeleton (designed for outside use) which is on display outside the museum on the NW terrace.
Another outdoor cast was sent to <a href="Disney%27s%20Animal%20Kingdom">Disney's Animal Kingdom</a> to serve as a gateway icon for the "DinoLand, U.S.A." area, known as the "Oldengate Bridge" that connects the two halves of the fossil quarry themed Boneyard play area.

Further discoveries of "Brachiosaurus" material in North America have been uncommon and consist of a few bones. To date, material can only be unambiguously ascribed to the genus when overlapping with the holotype material, and any referrals of elements form the skull, neck, anterior dorsal region, or distal limbs or feet remain tentative. Nevertheless, material has been described from Colorado, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming, and undescribed material has been mentioned from several other sites.

In 1883, farmer Marshall Parker Felch, a <a href="fossil%20collector">fossil collector</a> for the American paleontologist <a href="Othniel%20Charles%20Marsh">Othniel Charles Marsh</a>, reported the discovery of a sauropod skull in Felch Quarry 1, near <a href="Garden%20Park%2C%20Colorado">Garden Park, Colorado</a>. The skull was found in yellowish white sandstone, near a long cervical vertebra, which was destroyed during an attempt to collect it. The skull was catalogued as YPM 1986, and sent to Marsh at the <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a>, who incorporated it into his 1891 skeletal restoration of "Brontosaurus" (perhaps because Felch had identified it as belonging to that dinosaur). The Felch Quarry skull consists of the cranium, the maxillae, the right postorbital, part of the left maxilla, the left <a href="squamosal">squamosal</a>, the right <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate</a>, the dentaries, a possible partial <a href="pterygoid%20bone">pterygoid</a>, and a front tooth from the dentary. The bones were roughly prepared for Marsh, which led to some damage. Most of the specimens collected by Felch were sent to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">National Museum of Natural History</a> in 1899 after Marsh's death, including the skull, which was then catalogued as USNM 5730.

In 1975, the American paleontologists Jack McIntosh and David Berman investigated the historical issue of whether Marsh had assigned an incorrect skull to "Brontosaurus" (at the time thought to be a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Apatosaurus"), and found the Felch Quarry skull to be of "the general "Camarasaurus" type", while suggesting that the vertebra found near it belonged to "Brachiosaurus". They concluded that if Marsh had not arbitrarily assigned the Felch quarry skull and another "Camarasaurus"-like skull to "Brontosaurus", it would have been recognized earlier that the actual skull of "Brontosaurus" and "Apatosaurus" was more similar to that of "Diplodocus". McIntosh later tentatively recognized the Felch Quarry skull as belonging to "Brachiosaurus", and brought it to the attention of the American paleontologists <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Kenneth Carpenter</a> and Virginia Tidwell, while urging them to describe it. They brought the skull to the <a href="Denver%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Denver Museum of Natural History</a>, where they further prepared it and made a reconstruction of it based on casts of the individual bones, with the skulls of "Giraffatitan" and "Camarasaurus" acting as templates for the missing bones. In 1998, Carpenter and Tidwell described the Felch Quarry skull, and formally assigned it to "Brachiosaurus" sp., since it is impossible to determine whether it belonged to the species "B. altithorax" itself. They based the skull's assignment to "Brachiosaurus" on its similarity to that of "B. brancai", later known as "Giraffatitan".
A shoulder blade with coracoid from <a href="Dry%20Mesa%20Quarry">Dry Mesa Quarry</a>, Colorado, is one of the specimens at the center of the "<a href="Supersaurus">Supersaurus</a>"/"Ultrasauros" issue of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985, <a href="James%20A.%20Jensen">James A. Jensen</a> described disarticulated sauropod remains from the quarry as belonging to several exceptionally large <a href="taxon">taxa</a>, including the new genera "Supersaurus" and "Ultrasaurus", the latter renamed "Ultrasauros" shortly thereafter because <a href="Ultrasaurus">another sauropod</a> had already received the name. Later study showed that the "ultrasaur" material mostly belonged to "Supersaurus", though the shoulder blade did not. Because the holotype of "Ultrasauros", a dorsal vertebra, was one of the specimens that was actually from "Supersaurus", the name "Ultrasauros" is a synonym of "Supersaurus". The shoulder blade, specimen <a href="Monte%20L.%20Bean%20Life%20Science%20Museum">BYU</a> 9462 (previously BYU 5001), was in 1996 assigned to a "Brachiosaurus" sp. (of uncertain species) by Brian Curtice and colleagues; in 2009 Taylor concluded that it could not be referred to "B. altithorax". The Dry Mesa "ultrasaur" was not as large as had been thought; the dimensions of the shoulder's coracoid bone indicate that the animal was smaller than Riggs' original specimen of "Brachiosaurus".
Several additional specimens were briefly described by Jensen in 1987. One of these finds, the humerus USNM 21903, was discovered in ca. 1943 by uranium prospectors Vivian and Daniel Jones in the Potter Creek Quarry in western Colorado, and donated to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. Originally, this humerus was part of a poorly preserved partial skeleton that was not collected. According to Taylor in 2009, it is not clearly referable to "Brachiosaurus" despite its large size of . Jensen himself worked at the Potter Creek site in 1971 and 1975, excavating the disarticulated specimen BYU 4744, which contains a mid-dorsal vertebra, an incomplete left ilium, a left radius and a right metacarpal. According to Taylor in 2009, this specimen can be confidently referred to "B. altithorax", as far as it is overlapping with its type specimen. Jensen furthermore mentioned a specimen discovered near <a href="Jensen%2C%20Utah">Jensen, Utah</a> that includes a rib in length, an anterior cervical vertebra, part of a scapula, and a coracoid, although he did not provide a description. In 2001, Curtice and Stadtman ascribed two articulated dorsal vertebrae (specimen BYU 13023) from Dry Mesa Quarry to "Brachiosaurus". Taylor, in 2009, noted that these vertebrae are markedly shorter than those of the "B. altithorax" holotype, although otherwise being similar.

In 2012, José Carballido and colleagues reported a nearly complete postcranial skeleton of a small juvenile approximately in length. This specimen, nicknamed "Toni" and cataloged as SMA 0009, stems from the Morrison Formation of the <a href="Bighorn%20Basin">Bighorn Basin</a> in north-central Wyoming. Although originally thought to belong to a <a href="diplodocidae">diplodocid</a>, it was later reinterpreted as a brachiosaurid, probably belonging to "Brachiosaurus altithorax". In 2018, the largest sauropod foot ever found was reported from the <a href="Black%20Hills">Black Hills</a> of <a href="Weston%20County">Weston County</a>, Wyoming. The femur is not preserved but comparisons suggest that it was about 2% longer than that of the "B. altithorax" holotype. Though possibly belonging to "Brachiosaurus", the authors cautiously classified it as an indeterminate brachiosaurid.

Between 1909 and 1912, large-scale paleontological expeditions in <a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a> unearthed a considerable amount of <a href="Brachiosauridae">brachiosaurid</a> material from the <a href="Tendaguru%20Formation">Tendaguru Formation</a>. In 1914, German paleontologist <a href="Werner%20Janensch">Werner Janensch</a> listed differences and commonalities between these fossils and "B. altithorax", concluding they could be referred to the genus "Brachiosaurus". From this material Janensch named two species: "Brachiosaurus brancai" for the larger and more complete taxon, and "Brachiosaurus fraasi" for the smaller and more poorly known species. In three further publications in 1929, 1950 and 1961, Janensch compared the species in more detail, listing thirteen shared characters between "Brachiosaurus brancai" (which he now considered to include "B. fraasi") and "Brachiosaurus altithorax". Taylor, in 2009, considered only four of these characters as valid; six pertain to groups more inclusive than the Brachiosauridae, and the rest are either difficult to assess or refer to material that is not "Brachiosaurus".

There was ample material referred to "B. brancai" in the collections of the <a href="Museum%20f%C3%BCr%20Naturkunde">Museum für Naturkunde</a> Berlin, some of which was destroyed during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Other material was transferred to other institutions throughout Germany, some of which was also destroyed. Additional material was collected by the <a href="British%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">British Museum of Natural History</a>'s Tendaguru expedition, including a nearly complete skeleton (BMNH R5937) collected by F.W.H. Migeod in 1930. This specimen is now believed to <a href="List%20of%20informally%20named%20dinosaurs%23Archbishop">represent a new species</a>, awaiting description.

Janensch based his description of "B. brancai" on "Skelett S" (skeleton S) from Tendaguru, but later realized that it comprised two partial individuals: S I and S II. He at first did not designate them as a <a href="syntype">syntype</a> series, but in 1935 made S I (presently MB.R.2180) the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a>. Taylor in 2009, unaware of this action, proposed the larger and more complete S II (MB.R.2181) as the lectotype. It includes, among other bones, several dorsal vertebrae, the left scapula, both coracoids, both <a href="sternum">sternals</a> (breastbones), both humeri, both ulnae and radii (lower arm bones), a right hand, a partial left hand, both <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubes</a> (a hip bone) and the right femur, tibia and fibula (shank bones). Later in 2011, Taylor realized that Janensch had designated the smaller skeleton S I as the lectotype in 1935.
In 1988, Paul published a new reconstruction of the skeleton of "B. brancai", highlighting differences in proportion between it and "B. altithorax". Chief among them was a distinction in the way the trunk vertebrae vary: they are fairly uniform in length in the African material, but vary widely in "B. altithorax". Paul believed that the limb and girdle elements of both species were very similar, and therefore suggested they be separated not at genus, but only at <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> level, as "Brachiosaurus (Brachiosaurus) altithorax" and "Brachiosaurus (Giraffatitan) brancai". "Giraffatitan" was raised to full genus level by George Olshevsky in 1991, while referring to the vertebral variation. Between 1991 and 2009, the name "Giraffatitan" was almost completely disregarded by other researchers.

A detailed 2009 study by Taylor of all material, including the limb and girdle bones, found that there are significant divergences between "B. altithorax" and the Tendaguru material in all elements known from both species. Taylor found twenty-six distinct osteological (bone-based) characters, a larger difference than between "Diplodocus" and "<a href="Barosaurus">Barosaurus</a>", and therefore argued that the African material should indeed be placed in its own genus—"Giraffatitan"—as "Giraffatitan brancai". An important contrast between the two genera is their overall body shape, with "Brachiosaurus" having a 23% longer dorsal vertebral series and a 20 to 25% longer and also taller tail. The split was rejected by Daniel Chure in 2010, but from 2012 onward most studies recognized the name "Giraffatitan".

In 1947, at Atalaia in Portugal, brachiosaurid remains were found in layers dating from the <a href="Tithonian">Tithonian</a>. <a href="Albert-F%C3%A9lix%20de%20Lapparent">Albert-Félix de Lapparent</a> and Georges Zbyszewski named them as the species "Brachiosaurus atalaiensis" in 1957. Its referral to "Brachiosaurus" was doubted in the 2004 edition of "<a href="The%20Dinosauria">The Dinosauria</a>" by Paul Upchurch, Barret, and <a href="Peter%20Dodson">Peter Dodson</a> who listed it as an as yet unnamed brachiosaurid genus. Shortly before the publication of the 2004 book, the species had been placed in its own genus "<a href="Lusotitan">Lusotitan</a>" by <a href="Miguel%20Telles%20Antunes">Miguel Telles Antunes</a> and <a href="Oct%C3%A1vio%20Mateus">Octávio Mateus</a> in 2003. De Lapparent and Zbyszewski had described a series of remains but did not designate a <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a>. Antunes and Mateus selected a partial postcranial skeleton (<a href="Museo%20Geol%C3%B3gico%20do%20Instituto%20Geol%C3%B3gico%20e%20Mineiro">MIGM</a> 4978, 4798, 4801–4810, 4938, 4944, 4950, 4952, 4958, 4964–4966, 4981–4982, 4985, 8807, 8793–87934) as the lectotype; this specimen includes twenty-eight vertebrae, <a href="chevron%20%28anatomy%29">chevrons</a>, ribs, a possible shoulder blade, humeri, forearm bones, partial left pelvis, lower leg bones, and part of the right ankle. The low neural spines, the prominent deltopectoral crest of the humerus (a muscle attachment site on the upper arm bone), the elongated humerus (very long and slender), and the long axis of the ilium tilted upward indicate that "Lusotitan" is a brachiosaurid, which was confirmed by some later studies, such as an analysis in 2013.

In 1958, the French petroleum geologist F. Nougarède reported to have discovered fragmentary brachiosaurid remains in eastern <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, in the <a href="Sahara%20Desert">Sahara Desert</a>. Based on these, Albert-Félix de Lapparent described and named the species "Brachiosaurus nougaredi" in 1960. He indicated the discovery locality as being in the <a href="Late%20Jurassic">Late Jurassic</a>–age Taouratine Series. He assigned the rocks to this age in part because of the presumed presence of "Brachiosaurus". A more recent review placed it in the "<a href="Kem%20Kem%20Beds">Continental intercalaire</a>," which is considered to belong to the <a href="Albian">Albian</a> age of the late <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a>, significantly younger.

The type material moved to Paris consisted of a sacrum, weathered out at the desert surface, and some of the left metacarpals and <a href="phalanx%20bones">phalanges</a>. Found at the discovery site but not collected, were partial bones of the left forearm, wrist bones, a right shin bone, and fragments that may have come from <a href="metatarsus">metatarsals</a>.

""B." nougaredi" was in 2004 considered to represent a distinct, unnamed brachiosaurid genus, but a 2013 analysis by Philip D. Mannion and colleagues found that the remains possibly belong to more than one species, as they were collected far apart. The metacarpals were concluded to belong to some indeterminate <a href="titanosauriform">titanosauriform</a>. The sacrum was reported lost in 2013. It was not analyzed and provisionally considered to represent an indeterminate sauropod, until such time that it could be relocated in the collections of the "<a href="Mus%C3%A9um%20national%20d%27histoire%20naturelle">Muséum national d'histoire naturelle</a>". Only four out of the five sacral <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> are preserved. The total original length was in 1960 estimated at , compared to with "Brachiosaurus altithorax". This would make it larger than any other sauropod sacrum ever found, except those of "<a href="Argentinosaurus">Argentinosaurus</a>" and "Apatosaurus".

Riggs, in his preliminary 1903 description of the not yet fully prepared holotype specimen, considered "Brachiosaurus" to be an obvious member of the Sauropoda. To determine the validity of the genus, he compared it to the previously named genera "Camarasaurus", "Apatosaurus", "<a href="Atlantosaurus">Atlantosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Amphicoelias">Amphicoelias</a>", whose validity he questioned given the lack of overlapping fossil material. Because of the uncertain relationships of these genera, little could be said about the relationships of "Brachiosaurus" itself. In 1904, Riggs described the holotype material of "Brachiosaurus" in more detail, especially the vertebrae. He admitted that he originally had assumed a close affinity with "Camarasaurus", but now decided that "Brachiosaurus" was more closely related to "<a href="Haplocanthosaurus">Haplocanthosaurus</a>". Both genera shared a single line of neural spines on the back and had wide hips. Riggs considered the differences from other taxa significant enough to name a separate family, Brachiosauridae, of which "Brachiosaurus" is the <a href="type%20genus">namesake genus</a>. According to Riggs, "Haplocanthosaurus" was the more primitive genus of the family while "Brachiosaurus" was a specialized form.

When describing "Brachiosaurus brancai" and "B. fraasi" in 1914, Janensch observed that the unique elongation of the humerus was shared by all three "Brachiosaurus" species as well as the British "<a href="Pelorosaurus">Pelorosaurus</a>". He also noted this feature in "<a href="Cetiosaurus">Cetiosaurus</a>", where it was not as strongly pronounced as in "Brachiosaurus" and "Pelorosaurus". Janensch concluded that the four genera must have been closely related to each other, and in 1929 assigned them to a <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> Brachiosaurinae within the family Bothrosauropodidae.

During the twentieth century, several sauropods were assigned to Brachiosauridae, including "Astrodon", "<a href="Bothriospondylus">Bothriospondylus</a>", "Pelorosaurus", "<a href="Pleurocoelus">Pleurocoelus</a>", and "Ultrasauros". These assignments were often based on broad similarities rather than unambiguous <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a>, shared new traits, and most of these genera are currently regarded as <a href="nomen%20dubium">dubious</a>. In 1969, in a study by R.F. Kingham, "Brachiosaurus altithorax", "B." "brancai" and "B." "atalaiensis", along with many species now assigned to other genera, were placed in the genus "<a href="Astrodon">Astrodon</a>", creating an "Astrodon altithorax". Kingham's views of brachiosaurid taxonomy have not been accepted by many other authors. Since the 1990s, computer-based <a href="cladistic">cladistic</a> analyses allow for postulating detailed hypotheses on the relationships between species, by calculating those <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">trees</a> that require the fewest evolutionary changes and thus are the most likely to be correct. Such cladistic analyses have cast doubt on the validity of the Brachiosauridae. In 1993, Leonardo Salgado suggested that they were an unnatural group into which all kinds of unrelated sauropods had been combined. In 1997, he published an analysis in which species traditionally considered brachiosaurids were subsequent offshoots of the stem of a larger grouping, the <a href="Titanosauriformes">Titanosauriformes</a>, and not a separate branch of their own. This study also pointed out that "Brachiosaurus altithorax" and "B. brancai" did not have any synapomorphies, so that there was no evidence to assume they were particularly closely related.
Many cladistic analyses have since suggested that at least some genera can be assigned to the Brachiosauridae, and that this group is a basal branch within the Titanosauriformes. The exact status of each potential brachiosaurid varies from study to study. For example, a 2010 study by Chure and colleagues recognized "<a href="Abydosaurus">Abydosaurus</a>" as a brachiosaurid together with "Brachiosaurus", which in this study included "B. brancai". In 2009, Taylor noted multiple anatomical differences between the two "Brachiosaurus" species, and consequently moved "B. brancai" into its own genus, "Giraffatitan". In contrast to earlier studies, Taylor treated both genera as <a href="Operational%20taxonomic%20unit">distinct units</a> in a cladistic analysis, finding them to be <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a>s. Another 2010 analysis focusing on possible Asian brachiosaurid material found a clade including "Abydosaurus", "Brachiosaurus", "<a href="Cedarosaurus">Cedarosaurus</a>", "Giraffatitan", and "Paluxysaurus", but not "<a href="Qiaowanlong">Qiaowanlong</a>", the putative Asian brachiosaurid. Several subsequent analyses have found "Brachiosaurus" and "Giraffatitan" not to be sister groups, but instead located at different positions on the evolutionary tree. A 2012 study by Michael D'Emic placed "Giraffatitan" in a more basal position, in an earlier branch, than "Brachiosaurus", while a 2013 study by Philip Mannion and colleagues had it the other way around.

The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> of the Brachiosauridae below follows that published by Michael D. D'Emic in 2012:
Cladistic analyses also allow scientists to determine which new traits the members of a group have in common, their synapomorphies. According to the 2009 study by Taylor, "Brachiosaurus altithorax" shares with other brachiosaurids the classic trait of having an upper arm bone that is at least nearly as long as the femur (ratio of humerus length to femur length of at least 0.9). Another shared character is the very flattened femur shaft, its transverse width being at least 1.85 times the width measured from front to rear.

It was believed throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that sauropods like "Brachiosaurus" were too massive to support their own weight on dry land, and instead lived partly submerged in water. Riggs, affirming observations by <a href="John%20Bell%20Hatcher">John Bell Hatcher</a>, was the first to defend in length that most sauropods were fully terrestrial animals in his 1904 account on "Brachiosaurus", pointing out that their hollow vertebrae have no analogue in living aquatic or semiaquatic animals, and their long limbs and compact feet indicate specialization for terrestrial locomotion. "Brachiosaurus" would have been better adapted than other sauropods to a fully terrestrial lifestyle through its slender limbs, high chest, wide hips, high ilia and short tail. In its dorsal vertebrae the <a href="zygapophyses">zygapophyses</a> were very reduced while the hyposphene-hypanthrum complex was extremely developed, resulting in a stiff torso incapable of bending sideways. The body was only fit for quadrupedal movement on land. Though Riggs' ideas were gradually forgotten during the first half of the twentieth century, the notion of sauropods as terrestrial animals has gained support since the 1950s, and is now universally accepted among paleontologists. In 1990 the paleontologist Stephen Czerkas stated that "Brachiosaurus" could have entered water occasionally to cool off (<a href="thermoregulate">thermoregulate</a>).

Ongoing debate revolves around the neck posture of brachiosaurids, with estimates ranging from near-vertical to horizontal orientations. The idea of near-vertical postures in sauropods in general was popular until 1999, when Stevens and Parrish argued that the sauropod neck was not flexible enough to be held in an upright, S-curved pose, and instead was held horizontally. A reaction to this research, various newspapers ran stories criticizing the Field Museum "Brachiosaurus" mount for having an upward curving neck. Museum paleontologists Olivier Rieppel and Christopher Brochu defended the posture in 1999, noting the long forelimbs and upward sloping backbone. They also stated that the most developed neural spines for muscle attachment being positioned in the region of the shoulder girdle would have permitted the neck to be raised in a giraffe-like posture. They also stated that such a pose would have required less energy than lowering its neck, and that the inter-vertebral discs would not have been able to counter the pressure caused by a lowered head for extended periods of time (though lowering its neck to drink must have been possible). Some recent studies also advocated a more upward directed neck. Christian and Dzemski (2007) estimated that the middle part of the neck in "Giraffatitan" was inclined by 60–70 degrees; a horizontal posture could be maintained only for short periods of time.

With their heads held high above the heart, brachiosaurids would have had stressed cardiovascular systems. It is estimated that the heart of "Brachiosaurus" would have to pump double the blood pressure of a giraffe to reach the brain, and possibly weighed . The distance between head and heart would have been reduced by the S-curvature of the neck by more than in comparison to a totally vertical posture. The neck may also have been lowered during locomotion by 20 degrees. In studying the inner ear of "Giraffatitan", Gunga & Kirsch (2001) concluded that brachiosaurids would have moved their necks in lateral directions more often than in dorsal-ventral directions while feeding.

"Brachiosaurus" is thought to have been a high <a href="browsing%20%28predation%29">browser</a>, feeding on foliage well above the ground. Even if it did not hold its neck near vertical, and instead had a less inclined neck, its head height may still have been over above the ground. It probably fed mostly on foliage above . This does not preclude the possibility that it also fed lower at times, between up. Its diet likely consisted of ginkgos, conifers, tree ferns, and large cycads, with intake estimated at of plant matter daily in a 2007 study. Brachiosaurid feeding involved simple up-and-down jaw motion. As in other sauropods, animals would have swallowed plant matter without further oral processing, and relied on <a href="hindgut%20fermentation">hindgut fermentation</a> for food processing. As the teeth were not spoon-shaped as with earlier sauropods but of the compressed cone-chisel type, a precision-shear bite was employed. Such teeth are optimized for non-selective nipping, and the relatively broad jaws could crop large amounts of plant material. Even if a "Brachiosaurus" of forty tonnes would have needed half a tonne of fodder, its dietary needs could have been met by a normal cropping action of the head. If it fed sixteen hours per day, biting off between a tenth and two-thirds of a kilogram, taking between one and six bites per minute, its daily food intake would have equaled roughly 1.5% of its body mass, comparable to the requirement of a modern elephant.

As "Brachiosaurus" shared its <a href="habitat">habitat</a>, the Morrison, with many other sauropod species, its specialization for feeding at greater heights would have been part of a system of <a href="niche%20partitioning">niche partitioning</a>, the various taxa thus avoiding direct competition with each other. A typical food tree might have resembled "<a href="Sequoiadendron">Sequoiadendron</a>". The fact that such tall conifers were relatively rare in the Morrison might explain why "Brachiosaurus" was much less common in its <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> than the related "Giraffatitan", which seems to have been one of the most abundant sauropods in the Tendaguru. "Brachiosaurus", with its shorter arms and lower shoulders, was not as well-adapted to high-browsing as "Giraffatitan".

It has been suggested that "Brachiosaurus" could rear on its hind legs to feed, using its tail for extra ground support. A detailed physical modelling-based analysis of sauropod rearing capabilities by Heinrich Mallison showed that while many sauropods could rear, the unusual body shape and limb length ratio of brachiosaurids made them exceptionally ill-suited for rearing. The forward position of its center of mass would have led to problems with stability, and required unreasonably large forces in the hips to obtain an upright posture. "Brachiosaurus" would also have gained only 33% more feeding height, compared to other sauropods, for which rearing may have tripled the feeding height. A bipedal stance might have been adopted by "Brachiosaurus" in exceptional situations, like male dominance fights.

The downward mobility of the neck of "Brachiosaurus" would have allowed it to reach open water at the level of its feet, while standing upright. Modern giraffes spread their forelimbs to lower the mouth in a relatively horizontal position, to more easily gulp down the water. It is unlikely that "Brachiosaurus" could have attained a stable posture this way, forcing the animal to plunge the snout almost vertically into the surface of a lake or stream. This would have submerged its fleshy nostrils if they were located at the tip of the snout as Witmer hypothesized. Hallett and Wedel therefore in 2016 rejected his interpretation and suggested that they were in fact placed at the top of the head, above the bony nostrils, as traditionally thought. The nostrils might have evolved their retracted position to allow the animal to breathe while drinking.

The bony nasal openings of <a href="Neosauropoda">neosauropods</a> like "Brachiosaurus" were large and placed on the top of their skulls. Traditionally, the fleshy nostrils of sauropods were thought to have been placed likewise on top of the head, roughly at the rear of the bony nostril opening, because these animals were erroneously thought to have been amphibious, using their large nasal openings as snorkels when submerged. The American paleontologist <a href="Lawrence%20M.%20Witmer">Lawrence M. Witmer</a> rejected this reconstruction in 2001, pointing out that all living <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> land animals have their external fleshy nostrils placed at the front of the bony nostril. The fleshy nostrils of such sauropods would have been placed in an even more forward position, at the front of the narial fossa, the depression which extended far in front of the bony nostril toward the snout tip.

Czerkas speculated on the function of the peculiar brachiosaurid nose, and pointed out that there was no conclusive way to determine where the nostrils where located, unless a head with skin impressions was found. He suggested that the expanded nasal opening would have made room for tissue related to the animal's ability to smell, which would have helped smell proper vegetation. He also noted that in modern reptiles, the presence of bulbous, enlarged, and uplifted nasal bones can be correlated with fleshy horns and knobby protuberances, and that "Brachiosaurus" and other sauropods with large noses could have had <a href="Biological%20ornament">ornamental</a> nasal crests.

It has been proposed that sauropods, including "Brachiosaurus", may have had <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a>es (trunks) based on the position of the bony narial orifice, to increase their upward reach. Fabien Knoll and colleagues disputed this for "<a href="Diplodocus">Diplodocus</a>" and "Camarasaurus" in 2006, finding that the opening for the <a href="facial%20nerve">facial nerve</a> in the braincase was small. The facial nerve was thus not enlarged as in elephants, where it is involved in operating the sophisticated musculature of the proboscis. However, Knoll and colleagues also noted that the facial nerve for "Giraffatitan" was larger, and could therefore not discard the possibility of a proboscis in this genus.

Like other sauropods, "Brachiosaurus" was probably <a href="homeothermy">homeothermic</a> (maintaining a stable internal temperature) and <a href="endothermic">endothermic</a> (controlling body temperature through internal means) at least while growing, meaning that it could actively control its body temperature ("<a href="warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>"), producing the necessary heat through a high <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basic metabolic rate</a> of its cells. Russel (1989) used "Brachiosaurus" as an example of a dinosaur for which endothermy is unlikely, because of the combination of great size (leading to overheating) and great <a href="calorie">caloric</a> needs to fuel endothermy. Sander (2010) found that these calculations were based on incorrect body mass estimates and faulty assumptions on the available cooling surfaces, as the presence of large air sacs was unknown at the time of the study. These inaccuracies resulted in the overestimation of heat production and the underestimation of heat loss. The large nasal arch has been postulated as an adaptation for cooling the brain, as a surface for <a href="Evaporation">evaporative</a> cooling of the blood.

The <a href="respiration%20system">respiration system</a> of sauropods, like that of birds, made use of air sacs. There was not a bidirectional airflow as with mammals, in which the lungs function as <a href="bellows">bellows</a>, first inhaling and then exhaling air. Instead the air was sucked from the <a href="trachea">trachea</a> into an abdominal air sac in the belly which then pumped it forward through the parabranchi, air loops, of the stiff lung. Valves prevented the air from flowing backward when the abdominal air sac filled itself again; at the same time a cervical air sac at the neck base sucked out the spent air from the lung. Both air sacs contracted simultaneously to pump the used air out of the trachea. This procedure guaranteed an unidirectional airflow, the air always moving in a single forward direction in the lung itself. This significantly improved the <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> intake and the release of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. Not only was dead air removed quickly but also the blood flow in the lung was counterdirectional in relation to the airflow, leading to a far more effective <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a>.

In sauropods, the air sacs did not simply function as an aid for respiration; by means of air channels they were connected to much of the skeleton. These branches, the "diverticula", via pneumatic openings invaded many bones and strongly hollowed them out. It is not entirely clear what the evolutionary benefit of this phenomenon was but in any case it considerably lightened the skeleton. They might also have removed excess heat to aid thermoregulation.

In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel for the first time reconstructed the entire air sac system of a sauropod, using "Brachiosaurus altithorax" as an example of how such a structure might have been formed. In their reconstruction a large abdominal air sac was located between the pelvis and the outer lung side. As with birds, three smaller sacs assisted the pumping process from the underside of the breast cavity: at the rear the posterior thoracic air sac, in the middle the anterior thoracic air sac and in front the clavicular air sac, in that order gradually diminishing in size. The cervical air sac was positioned under the shoulder blade, on top of the front lung. The air sacs were via tubes connected with the vertebrae. Diverticula filled the various "fossae" and pleurocoels that formed depressions in the vertebral bone walls. These were again connected with inflexible air cells inside the bones.

The <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a> of "Brachiosaurus" has been reconstructed by Carballido and colleagues in 2012 based on SMA 0009, a postcranial skeleton of a young juvenile with an estimated total body length of just . This skeleton shares some unique traits with the "B. altithorax" holotype, indicating it is referable to this species. These commonalities include an elevation on the rear blade of the ilium; the lack of a postspinal lamina; vertical neural spines on the back; an ilium with a subtle notch between the appendage for the ischium and the rear blade; and the lack of a side bulge on the upper thighbone. There are also differences; these might indicate that the juvenile is not a "B. altithorax" individual after all, but belongs to a new species. Alternatively, they might be explained as juvenile traits that would have changed when the animal matured.

Such ontogenetic changes are especially to be expected in the proportions of an organism. The middle neck vertebrae of SMA 0009 are remarkably short for a sauropod, being just 1.8 times longer than high, compared with a ratio of 4.5 in "Giraffatitan". This suggests that the necks of brachiosaurids became proportionally much longer while their backs, to the contrary, experienced relative negative growth. The humerus of SMA 0009 is relatively robust: it is more slender than that of most basal titanosauriforms but thicker than the upper arm bone of "B. altithorax". This suggests that it was already lengthening in an early juvenile stage and became even more slender during growth. This is in contrast to diplodocoids and basal macronarians, whose slender humeri are not due to such <a href="allometric">allometric</a> growth. "Brachiosaurus" also appears to have experienced an elongation of the metacarpals, which in juveniles were shorter compared to the length of the radius; SMA 0009 had a ratio of just 0.33, the lowest known in the entire Neosauropoda.

Another plausible ontogenetic change is the increased <a href="pneumatization">pneumatization</a> of the vertebrae. During growth, the <a href="diverticulum">diverticula</a> of the air sacs invaded the bones and hollowed them out. SMA 0009 already has pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, at the sides of its neck vertebrae. These are divided by a ridge but are otherwise still very simple in structure, compared with the extremely complex ridge systems typically shown by adult derived sauropods. Its dorsal vertebrae still completely lack these.

Two traits are not so obviously linked to ontogeny. The neural spines of the rear dorsal vertebrae and the front sacral vertebrae are extremely compressed transversely, being eight times longer from front to rear than wide from side to side. The spinodiapophyseal lamina or "SPOL", the ridge normally running from each side of the neural spine toward each diapophysis, the transverse process bearing the contact facet for the upper rib head, is totally lacking. Both traits could be <a href="autapomorphies">autapomorphies</a>, unique derived characters proving that SMA 0009 represents a distinct species, but there are indications that these traits are growth-related as well. Of the basal sauropod "<a href="Tazoudasaurus">Tazoudasaurus</a>" a young juvenile is known that also lacks the spinodiapophyseal lamina, whereas the adult form has an incipient ridge. Furthermore, a very young juvenile of "<a href="Europasaurus">Europasaurus</a>" had a weak SPOL but it is well developed in mature individuals. These two cases represent the only finds in which the condition can be checked; they suggest that the SPOL developed during growth. As this very ridge widens the neural spine, its transverse compression is not an independent trait and the development of the SPOL plausibly precedes the thickening of the neural spine with more mature animals.

Sauropods were likely able to sexually reproduce before they attained their maximum individual size. The maturation rate differed between species. Its bone structure indicates that "Brachiosaurus" was able to reproduce when it reached 40% of its maximal size.

"Brachiosaurus" is known only from the Morrison Formation of western North America (following the reassignment of the African species). The Morrison Formation is interpreted as a <a href="semiarid">semiarid</a> environment with distinct <a href="wet%20season">wet</a> and <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>s, and flat <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s. Several other sauropod genera were present in the Morrison Formation, with differing body proportions and feeding adaptations. Among these were "Apatosaurus", "Barosaurus", "Camarasaurus", "Diplodocus", "Haplocanthosaurus", and "Supersaurus". "Brachiosaurus" was one of the less abundant Morrison Formation sauropods. In a 2003 survey of over 200 fossil localities, John Foster reported 12 specimens of the genus, comparable to "Barosaurus" (13) and "Haplocanthosaurus" (12), but far fewer than "Apatosaurus" (112), "Camarasaurus" (179), and "Diplodocus" (98). "Brachiosaurus" fossils are found only in the lower-middle part of the expansive Morrison Formation (stratigraphic zones 2–4), dated to about 154–153 million years ago, unlike many other types of sauropod which have been found throughout the formation. If the large foot reported from Wyoming (the northernmost occurrence of a brachiosaurid in North America) did belong to "Brachiosaurus", the genus would have covered a wide range of latitudes. Brachiosaurids could process tough vegetation with their broad-crowned teeth, and might therefore have covered a wider range of vegetational zones than for example diplodocids. Camarasaurids, which were similar in tooth morphology to brachiosaurids, were also widespread and are known to have migrated seasonally, so this might have also been true for brachiosaurids.

Other dinosaurs known from the Morrison Formation include the predatory <a href="theropods">theropods</a> "<a href="Koparion">Koparion</a>", "<a href="Stokesosaurus">Stokesosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ornitholestes">Ornitholestes</a>", "<a href="Ceratosaurus">Ceratosaurus</a>", "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Torvosaurus">Torvosaurus</a>", as well as the herbivorous <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>ns "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>", "<a href="Dryosaurus">Dryosaurus</a>", "<a href="Othnielia">Othnielia</a>", "<a href="Gargoyleosaurus">Gargoyleosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". "Allosaurus" accounted for 70 to 75% of theropod specimens and was at the top <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a> of the Morrison <a href="food%20chain">food web</a>. "Ceratosaurus" might have specialized in attacking large sauropods, including smaller individuals of "Brachiosaurus". Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included <a href="actinopterygii">ray-finned fishes</a>, <a href="frog">frog</a>s, <a href="salamander">salamander</a>s, <a href="turtle">turtle</a>s like "<a href="Dorsetochelys">Dorsetochelys</a>", <a href="sphenodontia">sphenodonts</a>, <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s, terrestrial and aquatic <a href="crocodylomorpha">crocodylomorpha</a>ns such as "<a href="Hoplosuchus">Hoplosuchus</a>", and several species of <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> like "<a href="Harpactognathus">Harpactognathus</a>" and "<a href="Mesadactylus">Mesadactylus</a>". Shells of <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s and aquatic <a href="snail">snail</a>s are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of <a href="chlorophyta">green algae</a>, <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="moss">moss</a>es, <a href="equisetum">horsetails</a>, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, <a href="ginkgo">ginkgo</a>es, and several families of <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests in otherwise treeless settings (<a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a>s) with <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s, and <a href="fern">fern</a>s, to fern <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s with occasional trees such as the "<a href="Araucaria">Araucaria</a>"-like conifer "<a href="Brachyphyllum">Brachyphyllum</a>".

Riggs in the first instance tried to limit public awareness of the find. When reading a lecture to the inhabitants of Grand Junction, illustrated by lantern slides, on 27 July 1901, he explained the general evolution of dinosaurs and the exploration methods of museum field crews but did not mention that he had just found a spectacular specimen. He feared that teams of other institutions might soon learn of the discovery and take away the best of the remaining fossils. A week later, his host Bradbury published an article in the local "Grand Junction News" announcing the find of one of the largest dinosaurs ever. On 14 August, the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" brought the story. At the time sauropod dinosaurs appealed to the public because of their great size, often exaggerated by sensationalist newspapers. Riggs in his publications played into this by emphasizing the enormous magnitude of "Brachiosaurus". 
"Brachiosaurus" has been called one of the most iconic dinosaurs, but most popular depictions are based on the African species "B. brancai" which has since been moved to its own genus, "Giraffatitan". A <a href="asteroid%20belt">main belt</a> <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>, , was named <a href="%26lt%3B%21--no%20italics%20here--%26gt%3B9954%20Brachiosaurus%26lt%3B%21--no%20italics%20here--%26gt%3B">9954 Brachiosaurus</a> in honor of the genus in 1991. "Brachiosaurus" was <a href="List%20of%20cloned%20animals%20in%20Jurassic%20Park">featured</a> in the 1993 movie "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>", as the first <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">computer generated</a> dinosaur shown. These effects were considered ground-breaking at the time, and the awe of the movie's characters upon seeing the dinosaur for the first time was mirrored by audiences. The movements of the movie's "Brachiosaurus" were based on the gait of a giraffe combined with the mass of an elephant. A scene later in the movie used an <a href="animatronic">animatronic</a> head and neck, for when a "Brachiosaurus" interacts with human characters. The digital model of "Brachiosaurus" used in "Jurassic Park" later became the starting point for the <a href="Ronto%20%28Star%20Wars%29">ronto</a> models in the 1997 special edition of the film "".

Fred P. Moosally (born 4 October 1944) is a former <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. During his naval career, Moosally served in many different assignments, including commander of a <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> and the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> . Moosally was captain of the "Iowa" when the center gun of one of the ship's main gun turrets <a href="USS%20Iowa%20turret%20explosion">exploded</a> on April 19, 1989, killing 47 crewmen.

During the investigation into the cause of the explosion, Moosally testified that the Navy had assigned personnel of inferior quality to the "Iowa". The investigation found that "Iowa" had been operating with severe deficiencies in safety and training procedures, for which Moosally was disciplined. The Navy stated that the deficiencies were unrelated to the turret explosion.

In December 1989 in testimony before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Armed%20Services%20Committee">United States Senate Armed Services Committee</a>, Moosally declined to fully support the Navy's conclusion that the explosion had been intentionally caused by Clayton Hartwig, one of the turret's crewmen. Moosally's testimony was widely reported in the media. Moosally retired from the Navy soon after in May 1990.

In 1999, Moosally began working for <a href="Lockheed%20Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>. In 2002 he was appointed president of the company's MS2 division. In this capacity, Moosally has helped lead Lockheed Martin's involvement in the and <a href="Integrated%20Deepwater%20System%20Program">Integrated Deepwater System</a> programs. Fred Moosally led MS2 from a $1B organization to a $4B+ organization when he retired in January 2010. Fred Moosally was succeeded in his position by Orlando Carvahlo, former General Manager and Vice President of the Lockheed Martin MS2 Moorestown, New Jersey site.

It was announced on 12 February 2010 that Moosally was hired as President and Chief Executive Officer of Fincantieri Marine Group (FMG), a subsidiary of Fincantieri-Cantieri Navali Italiani S.p.A.

Moosally, born and raised in <a href="Youngstown%2C%20Ohio">Youngstown, Ohio</a>, was one of six children in a family of three sons and three daughters. His father was an insurance salesman and the family attended the local Syriac <a href="Maronite%20Church">Maronite Church</a>.

Moosally graduated in 1966 with a class ranking of 812 out of 868. His classmates nicknamed him "Moose" because of his physical presence and his "slap-on-the-back" personality.

Moosally's first tour after commissioning as an <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> was on the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> in which he spent some time off the coast of <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a>. He attended destroyer department head school at <a href="Naval%20Station%20Newport">Naval Station Newport</a>, <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> and was assigned to the destroyer .

In 1971, Moosally returned to the Naval Academy, where he worked in the recruitment and candidate guidance office. He also worked with the varsity football team. After turning 30 years old, Moosally was assigned to the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> as the ship's <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>. The ship's captain was (then) <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> <a href="William%20J.%20Flanagan%2C%20Jr.">William J. "Bud" Flanagan</a> who would later become a <a href="4%20star%20rank">four-star</a> <a href="admiral">admiral</a> and commander of the Navy's <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a>.

After the "Bronstein" Moosally was assigned to Washington, D.C. in the Navy's <a href="BUPERS">Bureau of Naval Personnel</a>, where he worked for <a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Joseph%20Metcalf%2C%20III">Joseph Metcalf, III</a>. He was subsequently assigned to the destroyer as executive officer. After "Mahan", Moosally was promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> and was assigned to work for the Navy's <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> (CNO) office as a surface-warfare program coordinator. Two years later, he became administrative assistant and aide to the CNO, <a href="Thomas%20B.%20Hayward">Thomas B. Hayward</a>.

By this time, Moosally was considered to be very well-connected politically with many of the Navy's top admirals, mainly because of tours on the staffs of Metcalf and Hayward. In 1985, Moosally began a tour as commander of the destroyer . Metcalf later said he thought Moosally did "a terrific job" as skipper of "Kidd".

After "Kidd", Moosally worked in the Navy's <a href="Office%20of%20Legislative%20Affairs%20%28United%20States%20Navy%29">Office of Legislative Affairs</a>. His supervisor was an Academy football teammate, Rear Admiral Thomas Lynch. In this position, Moosally was successful in helping lobby for congressional approval and funding for two new <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, two frigates, and a nuclear-powered <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> for the Navy. Jim Hickey, a <a href="United%20States%20Congress">congressional</a> aide at the time, said of Moosally, "He's intelligent, politically savvy and well respected not only by the people in the liaison office but by the Navy folks as well."

Moosally then requested the command of one of the newly reactivated s. His request was supported by Metcalf, (then) Rear Admiral "Bud" Flanagan, Rear Admiral Richard Milligan (the Navy battle group commander in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>), and (then) Rear Admiral <a href="Jeremy%20Michael%20Boorda">Jeremy Michael Boorda</a>. The CNO at that time, Admiral <a href="Carlisle%20Trost">Carlisle Trost</a>, apparently agreed, and the request was granted; Moosally was assigned to command .

On May 23, 1988, Moosally took command of "Iowa" at <a href="Naval%20Station%20Norfolk">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. Reportedly, Moosally favored "Iowa"s missile and engineering systems and deemphasized 16-inch gunnery. A week after taking command, Moosally and his executive officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned one million dollar repair package for "Iowa"s main gun batteries, including repairs to the main gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder hoists, and hydraulic systems; seventy-five detailed deficiencies in all. Instead, the funds were spent on overhauling the ship's powerplant.

After completion of the overhaul Moosally took "Iowa" on a shakedown cruise around <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> on August 25, 1988. Encountering difficulty in conning the ship through shallow water, "Iowa", with Moosally at the helm, narrowly missed colliding with the , , and before, Thompson claims, running aground in soft mud outside the bay's main ship channel near the Thimble Shoals. After one hour, "Iowa" was able to extricate herself without damage and return to port. Although other US Navy vessels observed "Iowa" grounded in the mud, the incident apparently was not acted upon by Moosally's superiors. Throughout August and September, "Iowa" continued with sea trials, then began refresher training in the waters around <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> in October.

Between September 1988 and January 1989, "Iowa"s crew did not conduct much training with the 16-inch guns, in part because of ongoing, serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets. According to <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">Ensign</a> Dan Meyer, officer in charge of the ship's Turret One, <a href="morale">morale</a> and operational readiness among the gun turret crews suffered greatly. In spite of the problems with the main gun turrets, the ship passed its Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation in October 1988.

In January 1989 "Iowa"s <a href="Master%20Chief%20Petty%20Officer">Master Chief</a> <a href="Fire%20Controlman">Fire Controlman</a>, Stephen Skelley, and Gunnery Officer, <a href="Lieutenant%20Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> Kenneth Michael Costigan, persuaded Moosally to allow them to experiment with increasing the range of the main guns using "supercharged" <a href="Gunpowder">powder</a> bags and specially designed shells. Moosally was led to believe, falsely, that top officials from <a href="Naval%20Sea%20Systems%20Command">Naval Sea Systems Command</a> (NAVSEA) had authorized the experiments. In fact, John McEachren, a mid-level bureaucrat with NAVSEA, had given the go-ahead to conduct the experiments, even though he had no authority to do so. McEachren concealed his approval of the gunnery experiments from his superiors.

Several of the <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> and <a href="non-commissioned%20officers">non-commissioned officers</a> in charge of the main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, especially because of the age of and numerous maintenance problems with the main guns and gun turrets. Meyer complained to Lieutenant Commander Roger John Kissinger, "Iowa"s chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Moosally or halt the experiments.

On January 20, 1989, off <a href="Vieques%20Island">Vieques Island</a> "Iowa"s Turret One fired six of the experimental shells using the supercharged powder bags. Skelley claimed that one of the 16-inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16-inch shell ever fired. Moosally was pleased with the accomplishment, and ensured that news of the record was publicized in the media. Although the shells had been fired without serious incident, Meyer and <a href="Petty%20Officer%20First%20Class">Petty Officer First Class</a> Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.

On April 10, 1989 the battleship was visited by the commander of the <a href="US%202nd%20Fleet">US 2nd Fleet</a>, then <a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Jerome%20L.%20Johnson">Jerome L. Johnson</a>, and on April 13 sailed from Norfolk to participate in a fleet <a href="military%20exercise">exercise</a> in the Caribbean near Puerto Rico. The exercise, titled "FLEETEX 3-89", began on or around April 17 under Johnson's command. "Iowa" served as Johnson's <a href="flagship">flagship</a> during the exercise.

At 8:31 a.m. on April 19, 1989 "Iowa" prepared to engage in a main gun firing drill as Moosally and Johnson watched from the ship's <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>. Turret Two was to fire practice (no explosives) projectiles with five powder bags. The use of five bags had been directed by Skelley and was against regulations but Moosally was not aware of the unauthorized nature of the drill.

Turret One fired first, beginning at 09:33. Turret One's left gun misfired and its crew was unable to get the gun to discharge. Moosally now ordered Turret Two to load and fire a three-gun salvo. According to standard procedure, the misfire in Turret One should have been resolved first before proceeding with the exercise.

At 09:53, about 81 seconds after Moosally's order to load and 20 seconds after the right gun had reported loaded and ready, Turret Two's center gun exploded. A fireball between and and traveling at per second with a pressure of 4000 lb per square inch (281 kg per square cm) blew out from the center gun's open breech. The fireball spread through all three gun rooms and through much of the lower levels of the turret. All 47 crewmen inside the turret were killed. The turret contained most of the force of the explosion.

Turret Two's sprinkler system failed to operate automatically. Firefighting crews quickly responded and sprayed the roof of the turret and the left and right gun barrels, which were still fully loaded with both gunpowder and projectiles, with water. On Kissinger's recommendation, Moosally ordered Turret Two's magazines, annular spaces, and powder flats flooded with 16 tons (14,000 kg) of seawater, preventing the remaining powder from exploding and likely saving the ship. The turret fire was extinguished in about 90 minutes.

After the fire was extinguished, Moosally directed his crew to remove the bodies and to clean up the turret. No attempt was made to photograph or record the locations of the bodies or of damaged equipment in the turret. As a result, important evidence which could have assisted with the subsequent investigation into the cause of the explosion was lost.

"Iowa" returned on April 23 to Norfolk, where a memorial service was held on April 24. Several thousand people, including family members of many of the victims, attended the ceremony at which President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> spoke. Moosally also spoke at the ceremony, saying, "I remember Turret 2. They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship. We came together in times of trouble. We shared the good and the bad, the comedy and now the tragedy. But we must go on, the crew of the "Iowa"."

Milligan was placed in charge of the investigation into the explosion. As part of his investigation, Milligan interviewed Moosally on May 1 and May 10, 1989. In his testimony to Milligan, Moosally criticized "Iowa"s crew, stating that the Navy had sent him enlisted men of "inferior quality" and that many of "Iowa"s sailors were "dopers, marginal performers, constant UAs [unauthorized absences]". Moosally added that if he had kicked out every sailor in his crew who was a troublemaker, had legal difficulties, or was incapable of doing his job, "I don't think I'd have many guys left."

According to Thompson, "Iowa"s Turret Two was trained forward after the explosion to its stowed position and superficial repairs were conducted. All the related repair pieces were stored inside the turret and the turret was sealed shut. The turret was never put back into operation.

In June 1989, "Iowa", under Moosally's command, departed for a training cruise and operational deployment to Europe and the Mediterranean. On August 2, "Iowa", in a shipyard at <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a>, was ordered to join a force of US warships off the coast of Lebanon in response to threats by <a href="Shiite">Shiite</a> Muslim kidnappers to <a href="Lebanon%20hostage%20crisis">kill American hostages</a> and threats to the US embassy by Maronite Christian demonstrators loyal to <a href="Michel%20Aoun">Michel Aoun</a>. The ship remained off Lebanon until the crisis cooled a little over a week later, then departed for Italy.

Milligan's investigation, completed in July, concluded that the explosion was caused intentionally by a Turret Two crewman named Clayton Hartwig who Milligan believed was suicidal and homicidal. Milligan also found that, under Moosally, "Iowa" was operating with severe training and safety deficiencies. The finding that the explosion was intentionally caused by Hartwig was heavily criticized by the victims' families, the media, and members of Congress. Most of "Iowa"s crewmen also did not believe that Hartwig was responsible for the explosion.

On October 3, 1989 Donnell flew to the Mediterranean to discipline "Iowa"s officers in response to findings in Milligan's report. Milligan had recommended that Moosally be relieved of command, but Donnell had decided on a lesser punishment. Moosally and Bob Finney, "Iowa"s operations officer, were given non-punitive "letters of admonition" which were not placed in their permanent personnel records. Donnell stated that Moosally's "poor adherence to explosive safety regulations and ordnance safety" and "his failure of leadership" were a "marked departure from an otherwise outstanding performance".

Shortly thereafter, the Navy issued a statement explaining that the safety violations and training deficiencies found aboard "Iowa" during the investigation were unrelated to the explosion. Two weeks later, a panel of 13 Navy admirals recommended that Moosally be given another major command, stating that Moosally was "superbly fit" for such responsibility. Milligan was one of the admirals on the panel who supported the recommendation. After Thompson asked Rear Admiral Brent Baker, the Navy's <a href="Public%20affairs%20%28military%29">Chief of Naval Information</a>, and Chief of Naval Personnel <a href="Jeremy%20Michael%20Boorda">Jeremy Michael Boorda</a> about the recommendation, Moosally's name, according to Thompson, was withdrawn.

On October 8, the <a href="Military%20Times">"Navy Times"</a> newspaper published a story titled ""Iowa" CO Rips Quality of Officers, Crew" which detailed Moosally's testimony to Milligan in which Moosally had disparaged his crew. Thompson claims that many of "Iowa"s sailors were enraged by Moosally's remarks, with a few reportedly threatening Moosally's life.

"Iowa" returned to Norfolk on December 7. At a press conference the same day, according to Thompson, Moosally explained that his comments criticizing his crew had been taken out of context by the news media.

Moosally was scheduled to testify on December 11 before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Armed%20Services%20Committee">United States Senate Armed Services Committee</a> (SASC), which was investigating the Navy's findings about the explosion. The weekend before his appearance in front of the committee, Moosally prepared his remarks at his home in <a href="Oakton%2C%20Virginia">Oakton, Virginia</a>. Rumors were spreading throughout the top ranks of the Navy that Moosally was angry about Milligan's investigation and was contemplating attacking the Navy's findings before the SASC. In response, several Navy admirals, including Bud Flanagan and Ted Gordon, at that time the Navy's Deputy Judge Advocate General, visited Moosally at his home during the weekend to encourage Moosally to support the Navy's position regarding the cause of the explosion in his senate testimony. Said Gordon of his visit, "I went over to Moosally's home the night before his testimony to tell him to cool it, to watch it. I told him I thought he would still make admiral, no matter what had happened to the "Iowa"."

Appearing before the SASC on December 11, Moosally denied that "Iowa" had carried out illegal or unauthorized gunfire experiments. He added that his disparaging remarks about the quality of his crew had been misunderstood. Senator <a href="Sam%20Nunn">Sam Nunn</a> asked Moosally if he agreed with the Navy's conclusion that Hartwig had "most probably" caused the explosion. In a response that was widely reported in the media, Moosally answered, "I would not come out and say that. I would not make an unqualified statement that Petty Officer Hartwig is the guy who committed the wrongful act. I do not think I can do that."

Reportedly as a result of his refusal to fully support the Navy's position, Moosally's Navy career was over. A request for his retirement, whether made by Moosally or someone else is unclear, was approved a few days later. The Navy later reopened its investigation and eventually concluded that it could not determine who or what had caused the tragedy. An independent review of the Navy's investigation by <a href="Sandia%20National%20Laboratories">Sandia National Laboratories</a> concluded that the explosion had probably been caused by an overram of the powder bags into the center gun's breech, possibly because of a malfunction in the rammer mechanism or because the gun crew was inadequately trained.

Captain Moosally retired from the Navy at that rank in May 1990. At his change of command ceremony on "Iowa" on May 4, 1990, Moosally criticized the Navy for mismanaging the investigation into the turret explosion, saying that the investigators were "people who, in their rush to manage the "Iowa" problem, forgot about doing the right thing for the "Iowa" crew". During the ceremony, Moosally was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> by Rear Admiral George Gee for his service as commander of "Iowa". Soon after, Moosally went to work for an unnamed <a href="defense%20contractor">defense contractor</a> in the Washington, D.C. area.

On April 19, 1994, Moosally and other former "Iowa" crewmen attended the dedication of a memorial plaque at Norfolk Naval Station to the 47 sailors killed in the explosion. Moosally was shunned or ignored by many of the former crewmen present, who were still angry over his disparaging comments about them during the investigation.

In 1999, Charles Thompson published a book titled "<a href="A%20Glimpse%20of%20Hell%20%28book%29">A Glimpse of Hell: The Explosion on the USS "Iowa and Its Cover-Up</a>" which documented Thompson's investigation into the explosion and its aftermath. The book was extremely critical of Moosally, depicting him as an inept officer who gained command of the battleship through political connections. In 2001, the <a href="FX%22%20%28TV%20network%29">FX</a> TV network broadcast a movie "<a href="A%20Glimpse%20of%20Hell%20%28film%29">A Glimpse of Hell</a>" based on Thompson's book, starring <a href="James%20Caan%20%28actor%29">James Caan</a> in the role of Moosally.

In March 2001 Moosally and two other former "Iowa" officers plus an officer involved in the investigation into the explosion filed suit against "Glimpse of Hell" author Thompson, his publisher, <a href="W.%20W.%20Norton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">W.W. Norton</a>, and Dan Meyer, who the <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a>s stated provided much of the information used in the book, for <a href="libel">libel</a>, <a href="false%20light">false light privacy</a>, and <a href="conspiracy%20%28civil%29">conspiracy</a>. In response to the suit, Thompson stated that he stood "<a href="wikt%3Afoursquare">foursquare</a>" behind his book's content.

In April 2004 the <a href="South%20Carolina%20Supreme%20Court">South Carolina Supreme Court</a> dismissed the suits against Thompson and Meyer for of lack of <a href="Personal%20jurisdiction%20%28United%20States%29">personal jurisdiction</a> against both individuals, but allowed the suit against W. W. Norton to proceed. In February 2007 the suit was settled out-of-court for undisclosed terms. Stephen F. DeAntonio, Moosally's attorney, said that his client felt "totally vindicated". W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson's book, however, instead sending a letter to Moosally and the other plaintiffs stating, in part, "'To the extent you believe the book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover-up, were incompetent, committed criminal acts, violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude, Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by you or your family."

In 1997, Moosally began working for <a href="Lockheed%20Martin">Lockheed Martin</a> in the Washington, D.C. area while living in Oakton. In 1999, Lockheed Martin appointed Moosally as president of its Naval Electronics & Surveillance Systems (NESS) Surface Systems business, based in <a href="Moorestown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Moorestown, New Jersey</a>. On October 1, 2002, Lockheed Martin appointed Moosally as president of the NESS division. The division's name was later changed to Maritime Systems and Sensors (MS2) division.

On May 29, 2004, Lockheed was awarded a contract to construct two of the first four <a href="littoral%20combat%20ship">littoral combat ship</a>s (LCS) for the US Navy. Moosally's MS2 division managed the contract for Lockheed. The contract called for the first LCS to be delivered to the Navy at the end of 2006 at cost of $220 million. As construction of the ship progressed, however, it became apparent that the delivery date and construction cost would significantly exceed the original expectations.

In response to an inquiry on adverse issues with the program, on February 8, 2007, Moosally submitted a statement to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">United States House Committee on Armed Services</a> <a href="United%20States%20House%20Armed%20Services%20Subcommittee%20on%20Seapower%20and%20Expeditionary%20Forces">Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces</a> regarding Lockheed's construction of its portion of the LCS contract. In the statement, Moosally stated that the problems with contract completion arose from the addition of new requirements and specifications by the Navy shortly after contract award, material shortages, and "First-of-Class issues associated with the process of transitioning a new ship design into production".

Due to the expected cost and schedule overruns with Lockheed's first LCS and a failure to come to an agreement on a fixed cost for future work, the Navy canceled Lockheed's production of its second LCS in April 2007. Lockheed's first LCS, , was delivered to the Navy in November 2008 at a cost of over $531 million, more than double the original contracted price. In March 2009, the Navy renewed the contract with Lockheed to build its second LCS, the .

Around 1997, the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> (USCG) determined that its fleet of open ocean ("deepwater") ships and aircraft needed to be replaced. The USCG elected to replace these assets with a system-of-systems acquisition which would be procured as a single, integrated package, estimated to cost a total of $24 billion, called the <a href="Integrated%20Deepwater%20System%20Program">Integrated Deepwater System Program</a> or "Deepwater." On June 25, 2002, the USCG awarded a five-year, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, performance-based contract to Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS), a consortium of private companies led by Lockheed Martin and <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20Ship%20Systems">Northrop Grumman Ship Systems</a>. Moosally served as vice-chairman of ICGS. On May 19, 2006, the USCG extended the contract with ICGS for 43 additional months.

Moosally's MS2 division led Lockheed's participation in the Deepwater contract. Specifically, Lockheed's portion of the Deepwater program encompassed system engineering and integration, the command and control network, and logistics and aviation, including refurbishment of existing assets and production of new components. One of the refurbishment projects was upgrades to the USCG's <a href="USCG%20Patrol%20Boat">110-foot patrol boats</a>.

In August 2006, Lockheed engineer <a href="Michael%20DeKort">Michael DeKort</a> went public with claims that Lockheed's MS2 division had contributed to ICGS's delivery of boats that were unsafe and which did not meet the USCG's requirements. DeKort stated that Lockheed had accepted schedule and cost requirements that were impossible to meet. As result, according to DeKort, Lockheed's MS2 engaged in corner-cutting measures which adversely affected the boat's electronics systems. These issues included camera surveillance blind spots over the bridge, electronic equipment for communications, navigation and sensor systems, that were installed on the outside of the boat, that would not meet extreme weather requirements, the use of hazardous smoke producing cables, and security deficiencies that would cause a compromise of the boat's secure communications systems.

A subsequent <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">United States Department of Homeland Security</a> (DHS) <a href="inspector%20general">inspector general</a> report confirmed that some of DeKort's allegations were valid, including that in at least one instance, "The contractor [Lockheed Martin] knowingly installed in the (boats) equipment that did not meet specific environmental requirements outlined in the Deepwater contract." As a result of this and other issues with the program, in April 2007 the USCG announced that it was curtailing ICGS's role as active manager of the Deepwater contract.

On May 17, 2007, Moosally testified before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Homeland%20Security%20Subcommittee%20on%20Border%2C%20Maritime%20and%20Global%20Counterterrorism">United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime and Global Counterterrorism</a> concerning the DHS' report's findings. Moosally stated that Lockheed had either met the contracted requirements or had immediately notified the USCG when issues arose. He added that any other discrepancies were minor and did not affect the safety, reliability, or effectiveness of the systems in question.

DeKort criticized Moosally's testimony, calling it "not correct" in that it had misrepresented the true nature of the issues. In a letter to <a href="Member%20of%20Congress">Representatives</a> <a href="Loretta%20Sanchez">Loretta Sanchez</a> and <a href="Chris%20Carney">Chris Carney</a>, DeKort stated that in 2004 when he asked to talk to Moosally to explain his concerns about issues with MS2's work on the systems, Moosally had refused to meet with him. The USCG later canceled all further work on upgrading the 110-foot patrol boats, but this was primarily because of problems with hull modernization and extension efforts by Bollinger Shipyards, Inc., a Lockheed subcontractor.

<doc id="20646635" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20646635" title="Tidus">
Tidus

Tidus was designed by <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> with a cheerful appearance, in contrast to previous "Final Fantasy" protagonists. Scenario writer <a href="Kazushige%20Nojima">Kazushige Nojima</a> wanted to expand the relationship between player and character with monologues describing the game's setting. Tidus is <a href="voice%20actor">voiced</a> primarily by <a href="Masakazu%20Morita">Masakazu Morita</a> in Japanese and <a href="James%20Arnold%20Taylor">James Arnold Taylor</a> in English. Both actors enjoyed voicing the character, and Morita also performed his <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a>.

He has been generally well received by video-game critics. Tidus' cheerful personality and heroic traits make him an appealing protagonist, contrasting with previous male characters in the franchise. His <a href="character%20arc">character development</a> and romantic relationship with Yuna are considered among the best in video games, although reviewers and fans were divided on Taylor's voicing. Tidus has been popular with fans, often ranking as one of the best "Final Fantasy" characters in polls. Action figures and Tidus-related jewelry have been produced, and he is a popular <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> character.

Before the development of "Final Fantasy X", game scenario writer <a href="Kazushige%20Nojima">Kazushige Nojima</a> was concerned about the relationship between the player and the main character in a "Final Fantasy" title and wanted to try to make the story easier to follow. Since the player and the main character find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding of that world to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest character to draw in the first half of "Final Fantasy X", because character and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for character designer <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme so he would stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an <a href="undead">undead</a> person as a playable character, and Tidus was meant to be that character. During "Final Fantasy X" development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary character, <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20X%20and%20X-2%23Auron">Auron</a>.

Nomura mentioned the contrast between the lead male and female protagonists established by their names; Tidus' name is based on the <a href="Okinawan%20language">Okinawan</a> word for "sun", and <a href="Yuna%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Yuna</a>'s name means "night" in Okinawan. The contrast is also indicated by the items required to empower their celestial weapons: the sun <a href="Sigil%20%28magic%29">sigil</a> and crest for Tidus, and the moon sigil and crest for Yuna. The developers had difficulty with Tidus and Yuna's kissing scene, since they were unaccustomed to animating romantic scenes. According to <a href="Visual%20Works">Visual Works</a> director Kazuyuki Ikumori, this was due to the use of 3D models, and it was revised several times due to a negative response from female staff members. Director <a href="Yoshinori%20Kitase">Yoshinori Kitase</a> said that in the development of "Final Fantasy X", one of the staff's main objectives was to focus on the romance between Tidus and Yuna. Nojima said that he cried during the game's ending, when Tidus and Yuna separate and Tidus vanishes.

Designer Nomura said that he wanted Tidus' clothing and accessories to suggest a relationship with the sea. Tidus' clothing has a distinctive blue motif; his blitzball team logo, based on a fish hook, is an amalgam of the letters "J" and "T" (the first letters of Tidus' name and that of his father, <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20X%20and%20X-2%23Jecht">Jecht</a>). Because a player can change Tidus' name, the character is not referred to by name in audible dialogue; however, a character in Dream Zanarkand uses Tidus' name in a dialogue box. The only other in-game appearance of his name is "Tidu" in Spiran script on the nameplate of an Auroch locker in the Luca stadium. Before "Final Fantasy X"s release, Tidus was known to the media as Tida. In early 2001, <a href="PlayOnline">PlayOnline</a> changed the character's name to "Tidus". Because his name is never spoken in "Final Fantasy X", its intended pronunciation has been debated. Interviews with <a href="James%20Arnold%20Taylor">James Arnold Taylor</a> and spoken dialogue in the English versions of "<a href="Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a>", "<a href="Dissidia%20012%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy</a>", and "Kingdom Hearts" (with cameo appearances by the character) indicate that it is pronounced (); in the English version of "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>", Tidus' name is pronounced (). According to Taylor, it was pronounced during the localization of "Final Fantasy X" because the narrator of an early English trailer pronounced it that way.

For the sequel, "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>", producer Kitase thought that the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20X%20and%20X-2%23Shuyin">Shuyin</a>, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of "Final Fantasy X" and "Final Fantasy X-2", producer Kitase's motivation was to have people too young to have played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from "Dissidia Final Fantasy" and its prequel. For the first two "X" games' rerelease, Nomura redesigned Tidus based on his older appearance from the audiodrama "Will". For the franchise's 30th anniversary, Square presented Tidus' new design in a museum.

According to Nomura, he wanted to give Tidus a cheerful persona and appearance after designing serious, moody main characters for "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a>". He wanted to continue the recent trend of sky-related names, and Kazushige Nojima chose a name based on "tiida" (Okinawan for "sun"). Nojima called Tidus' personality "lively" and compared him to "Final Fantasy VIII"s <a href="Laguna%20Loire">Laguna Loire</a> and <a href="Zell%20Dincht">Zell Dincht</a>, two other cheerful characters. Tidus was initially a rude plumber who was part of a delinquent gang, but Kitase said he would be a weak protagonist and he was made an athlete instead.

His relationship with his father was based on "stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek legends</a>" and would reveal the key to the weakness of <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20X%20and%20X-2%23Sin">Sin</a>, the game's main antagonist. Kitase noted that, in contrast to previous orphan characters seen in the franchise, Tidus' character arc included accepting Jecht's seeking redemption for Tidus' <a href="child%20abuse">child abuse</a>. Kitase felt that the voice acting and facial expression were crucial to Tidus at this stage. <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a> said that when "Final Fantasy X" was released, he saw the story from Tidus' point of view: "about parent, child and family".

<a href="Masakazu%20Morita">Masakazu Morita</a> voiced Tidus in Japanese. He called the character a career highlight, comparable to his voicing of "<a href="Bleach%20%28manga%29">Bleach</a>" <a href="manga">manga</a> protagonist <a href="Ichigo%20Kurosaki">Ichigo Kurosaki</a>. Morita also enjoyed performing Tidus' motion capture, which gave him a greater understanding of the character's personality; when he recorded Tidus' dialogue for the game, he moved his body. Morita said that Tidus was his favorite, calling him "the most outstanding, most special character to me". As his first work as an actor, he has fond memories of voicing Tidus and interacting with other "Final Fantasy X" staff members. Morita said that there was no difficulty in working as Tidus, since the character's personality was similar to his own, and he did not need to study the character. However, he was concerned that if fans did not enjoy Tidus it would impact his career. When it announced the Japanese actor, Square said that Morita was chosen because he also did the motion capture for Zell (which would make fans remember previous games). Across "Final Fantasy X" there are also flashback scenes which depict a seven-year old Tidus. For these scenes Tidus is instead voiced by Yūto Nakamura.

For the <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a> "Dissidia Final Fantasy", Morita returned to voice Tidus. He was concerned about being able to perform the character's lines like the original "Final Fantasy" series, since it had been nearly a decade since he voiced Tidus. By that time, he was also more accustomed to acting as Ichigo and Keiji Maeda from <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a>'s "<a href="Sengoku%20Basara">Sengoku Basara</a>" hack-and-slash games and the characters had a different vocal tone than Tidus'. When Moriata returned to voice Tidus, he tried to make it match his original performance. When the game director complimented Morita for keeping the character's tone, Morita was relieved and joked that he felt younger.
<a href="James%20Arnold%20Taylor">James Arnold Taylor</a> was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor was offered the role by voice director <a href="Jack%20Fletcher">Jack Fletcher</a> (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator <a href="Alexander%20O.%20Smith">Alexander O. Smith</a> explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording "Final Fantasy X", Taylor said that he would enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. 

According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how "stilted and out of place" it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and <a href="Mayuko%20Aoki">Mayuko Aoki</a>'s performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it "awkward" and "funny". When "Final Fantasy X" was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice. For "Dissidia NT", Taylor commented that while Tidus' new role would seem new to players due to how he is led once again into battle, people would still find him as an appealing new trait.

In "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>", Tidus is a player in the underwater sport of blitzball in an advanced, technological version of Zanarkand. Belying his cheerful, carefree attitude, Tidus hates his absent father, <a href="Jecht">Jecht</a>—initially because of his mother's neglect, and later for their rivalry at blitzball. During a blitzball tournament, Zanarkand is destroyed by a huge, shrouded creature known as Sin. Sin transports Tidus and Jecht's friend, <a href="%C4%80ron">Auron</a>, to the world of Spira. After his arrival on Spira, Tidus drifts to the island of Besaid and joins a number of guardians on a journey to help <a href="Yuna%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Yuna</a> defeat Sin. Tidus joins them in the hope of finding his way home.

When he meets Auron, Tidus learns that Jecht and Auron made the same pilgrimage ten years before to protect the summoner Braska (Yuna's father) and defeated Sin (who was reborn as Jecht). As the journey continues, Tidus, losing hope that he will return home, begins a romantic relationship with Yuna and swears not to let her die after the guardians tell him that Sin's battle will kill her. When the party approaches Zanarkand, Tidus learns that he and Zanarkand are the dreams of dead people known as "<a href="fayth">fayth</a>". "Dream" Zanarkand was created when Sin was born during the war between Zanarkand and Bevelle and the original Zanarkand was destoyed. If Sin is permanently defeated, the summoning of Dream Zanarkand and its people (including Tidus) will cease. In the real Zanarkand, the group decides to find a way to destroy Sin which does not require the sacrifice of a guardian or a summoner. They attack Sin, entering its shell. They eventually find Jecht (whom they must defeat to eliminate Sin), and Tidus makes peace with his father in the aftermath. After defeating the spirit of <a href="Yu%20Yevon">Yu Yevon</a> (who is responsible for Sin's rebirth), the "fayth" are allowed to leave and the summoning of Dream Zanarkand ends. As he vanishes, Tidus says goodbye to his friends and joins the spirits of Auron, Jecht and Braska in the afterlife.

Tidus makes few appearances in the plot of the 2003 sequel, "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>", although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of "Final Fantasy X", Yuna sees a <a href="Spira%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29%23Spheres">sphere</a> with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the hope of finding more clues that Tidus is alive. The individual in the sphere is later revealed as <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20X%20and%20X-2%23Shuyin">Shuyin</a>. Depending on the player's development during the game, the "fayth" will appear to Yuna at the end and tell her that they can make Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an <a href="Player%20character%23Secret%20characters">unlockable character</a> as Star Player, a blitzball player. In "Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission" (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play-through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. An illusion of Tidus also appears as a <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss character</a>.
Tidus' dialogue, monologues and songs were included on the "Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection" and "feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus" CDs. Although he does not fully understand that he is not the "fayth" dream, Tidus feels that disappearing would be preferable to making Yuna cry again. The novel "Final Fantasy X-2.5 ~Eien no Daishou~", set after "Final Fantasy X-2", explores Tidus and Yuna's visit to Besaid Island 1,000 years before. The HD remastered version of "Final Fantasy X" and "Final Fantasy X-2", "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X/X-2%20HD%20Remaster">Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster</a>", adds an audio drama ("Final Fantasy X: Will") in which Tidus is a new blitzball star who appears to be concealing an injury. After Yuna breaks up with him, Tidus helps her on a quest to defeat a reborn Sin. Tetsuya Nomura made a revision of Tidus's design for this game, hinting it will be used in a possible "Final Fantasy X-3".

He also appears in games outside the "Final Fantasy X" <a href="fictional%20universe">fictional universe</a>, and a younger version is a friend of the protagonists <a href="Sora%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Sora</a> and <a href="Riku%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Riku</a> in the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series. In "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20%28video%20game%29">Kingdom Hearts</a>", Tidus appears with younger versions of Wakka and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a>"s <a href="Characters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20VIII%23Selphie">Selphie</a> as an optional sparring opponent. The character makes a cameo appearance in "", and is mentioned briefly in "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20II">Kingdom Hearts II</a>". A digital replica of Tidus is a boss character in "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20Coded">Kingdom Hearts Coded</a>", and he appears with Auron and Yuna in the board game-based "<a href="Itadaki%20Street%20Special">Itadaki Street Special</a>".

In "Dissidia Final Fantasy" (an action game with several "Final Fantasy" heroes and villains), Tidus is the hero from "Final Fantasy X": a warrior from the goddess, Cosmos, whose father works for the rival god Chaos. Tidus has two uniforms in this game, and his thoughts and actions refer to "Final Fantasy X". With the cast, he reappears in the prequel "<a href="Dissidia%20012%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy</a>" and represents Chaos in the previous war. Tidus is confronted by Yuna and offers his life to save her from an attack by the villain Emperor, but is saved by Jecht to become a warrior of Cosmos. In addition to his previous outfits, Tidus has a design based on an illustration by Square artist <a href="Yoshitaka%20Amano">Yoshitaka Amano</a>. He appears in the third entry in the series, "<a href="Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy%20NT">Dissidia Final Fantasy NT</a>". Director Takeo Kujiraoka noted that the staff received multiple requests by fans to include Tidus' "Will" look as an alternative design but Nomura said it was not possible as the company would first need to develop "Final Fantasy X-3".

Tidus is a playable character in the "<a href="Theatrhythm%20Final%20Fantasy">Theatrhythm Final Fantasy</a>" <a href="rhythm%20game">rhythm game</a>. He also appears in "<a href="World%20of%20Final%20Fantasy">World of Final Fantasy</a>", and "Fortune Street: Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary". Tidus' disappearance between "Final Fantasy X" and its sequel is also explained in the game "<a href="Mobius%20Final%20Fantasy">Mobius Final Fantasy</a>". Trapped in an underworld-like place known as Palamecia, Tidus joins forces with a warrior known as Wol. The two join on a quest to become fully Warrior of Light though Tidus uses as a distraction since he does not care about his own well-being, satisfied with his actions in Spira. After seeing one of Yuna's creatures disappear from Palamecia, Tidus decides to search for a way to return to Spira. Following more battles, Tidus finds a crystal which allows him to be teleported back to the world.

Tidus had a positive reception in video-game publications. Raymon Padilla of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> called him a "garishly dressed <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>", whose his flaws make him appealing. According to <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> reviewer <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a>, players might not initially like the character but would eventually find him "suitably endearing". Kasavin wrote that Tidus had the "surprising depth" characteristic of past "Final Fantasy" protagonists, and called the game's ending "emotionally charged and satisfying". PSXextreme's Arnold Katayev liked Tidus' easygoing personality, contrasting it with those of previous (antisocial) "Final Fantasy" protagonists. <a href="Atlus">Atlus</a> character designer <a href="Kazuma%20Kaneko">Kazuma Kaneko</a> called him "a dashing lead character". GameZone praised Tidus' role as the male lead compared with previous characters for its "perpetual feel of youth and innocence". In the book, "Dungeons, Dragons, and Digital Denizens: The Digital Role-Playing Game", authors Gerald A. Voorhees and Joshua Call compared Tidus with "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" protagonist <a href="Cloud%20Strife">Cloud Strife</a> in appearance and weapon; however, they found Tidus more realistic than Cloud. In "Console video games and global corporations", Mia Consalvo that despite Tidus was designed from a Western's perspective which contrasted the others' Eastern designs, the game managed to blend their looks and appeal to the audience.

Although the revelation of his true nature in the game's ending was third on <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s list of top-five video-game spoilers (reducing "at least two 1UP staffers to a state of misty-eyed mourning"), Tidus' resurrection in the sequel was called unrealistic. GamesRadar's Dave Meikleham found the character's fate in the first game confusing; he appears to be alive in the epilogue despite his disappearance, which is not explained until the sequel's end. Matthew Walker of Cheat Code Central wrote that Tidus told his father he hated him in the climax, but later appreciated him. According to Walker, the game's final scene was intended to give hope that Tidus was alive; Walker found the ending (where Sin's defeat makes Tidus disappear) sad.

The character was compared to <a href="Squall%20Leonhart">Squall Leonhart</a>, the protagonist of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a>". The staff of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> noted differences in appearance between them, contrasting Squall's dark-colored outfit and "permanent mope" with Tidus' brighter outfit and weapon and "an indelible grin". Kurt Kalata of <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> found Tidus a more entertaining character than Squall, albeit "a bit whiny". GameSpot criticized his English-language voicing, saying that they would have preferred "an almost-mute lead character, a la Squall". 1UP found him the worst-dressed video-game character, citing Nomura's "deal with it" outfit design; despite the "preposterous" design, Square could "successfully sell" Tidus as "Final Fantasy X"s main protagonist. According to Square Enix producer <a href="Shinji%20Hashimoto">Shinji Hashimoto</a>, Tidus <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a> has been popular. The character has also inspired action figures and jewelry. To commemorate the franchise's 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of Tidus and other "Final Fantasy" protagonists.

In the English-language version, IGN said that the character "has a tendency to speak a little too high and fast when he gets excited". Andrew Long of RPGamer criticized James Arnold Taylor's work, saying that Tidus is supposed to sound "impulsive and energetic" but his dialogue is "stupid and childish". <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Tom Brawell agreed, calling Tidus' voice "whiny" and "detestable". Despite his dislike of the voice acting, Chris Carter of <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> enjoyed playing as Tidus in the crossover fighting game "Dissidia Final Fantasy" and looked forward to its <a href="Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy%20%282015%20video%20game%29">reboot</a>. On the other hand, PSXextreme liked Taylor's work in voicing Tidus. In the book "Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century", the writers recalled that Tidus' characterization differs in the original Japanese release of "Final Fantasy X" and its English dub; the localized version failed to emulate the original Tidus. In a "Final Fantasy X" scene, Yuna tells Tidus to laugh (to cheer him up) and Tidus forces a laugh. Although fans criticised the laughter as too forced, Taylor stated that it was an intentionally "awkward, goofy, dumb laugh."

The relationship between Tidus and Yuna was listed as one of the video-game "great loves" by GameSpot, which called it "one of the best (and ultimately saddest) examples" of mature romance in games and cited its progression through the story as one of the game's best elements. <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> found the relationship realistic, noting that they still try to reunite despite their sacrifices. <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>'s Mike Fahey wrote that the popularity of Tidus and Yuna's relationship and his fading away at the game's end forced Square to make a sequel so they could meet again. Gamasutra's <a href="Leigh%20Alexander%20%28journalist%29">Leigh Alexander</a>, calling Tidus a "forgettable hero", nevertheless praised his and Yuna's relationship. In 2001, Tidus and Yuna won "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" Best Couple of the Year award. Their kiss was ranked the second-best in video games by <a href="Lisa%20Foiles">Lisa Foiles</a> of "<a href="The%20Escapist%20%28magazine%29">The Escapist</a>". "Kotaku" called the scene one of gaming's most romantic, and IGN listed Tidus and Luna as one of gaming's greatest couples. Yuna's English voice actress, <a href="Hedy%20Burress">Hedy Burress</a>, said that Tidus' interaction with Yuna gave her a humanized, "womanly aspect". The 1UP.com staff described Tidus as the "good kind of jock" because of his support for the game's other protagonists, but his anger and growth kept him from being a "stereotypical boy scout". According to Eurogamer's Tom Brawell, Tidus and the other characters "make much more dignified and believable decisions than those made by their predecessors in other "Final Fantasy" games". "NowGamer" and "Digital Spy" found the remastered game lacking in emotion, but "Destructoid" said that its models still look good in comparison to newer role-playing games released.

Tidus' character has also appeared in popularity polls and features in video-game publications. He was "Final Fantasy X" second-most-popular character (behind Auron) in a fan poll. "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" listed him as the second-best "Final Fantasy" character, surpassed only by Cloud. His caring, cheerful personality (contrasting with previous "Final Fantasy" protagonists) was praised. "GameZone" ranked Tidus the third-best "Final Fantasy" character (behind Cloud and <a href="Sephiroth%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Sephiroth</a>, also from "Final Fantasy VII"), and Heath Hooker called him "a complete mixture of everything cheesy and everything emotional". Tidus was the fourth-most-popular male "Final Fantasy" character in a 2012 Square Enix poll. In a "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" poll, Tidus was voted the 20th-best video-game character in Japan. Christian Nutt of "GamesRadar" wrote that despite initial issues, Tidus' character development during the game made him more likable; Nutt ranked him the fourth-best "Final Fantasy" hero. Tidus and Yuna were included in "<a href="The%20Inquirer">The Inquirer</a>"s list of most memorable video-game couples, with Tidus' self-sacrifice and their farewell noted.

Toa Payoh ritual murders

The Toa Payoh ritual murders took place in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> in 1981. On 25 January, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a bag next to the <a href="Elevator">lift</a> of a block of <a href="Public%20housing%20in%20Singapore">flat</a>s in the town of <a href="Toa%20Payoh">Toa Payoh</a>, and two weeks later, a ten-year-old boy was found dead nearby. The children had been killed, purportedly as blood sacrifices to the Hindu goddess <a href="Kali">Kali</a>. The murders were masterminded by Adrian Lim, a self-styled <a href="Mediumship">medium</a>, who had tricked scores of women into believing he had supernatural powers. His victims offered money and sexual services in exchange for cures, beauty, and good fortune. Two of the women became his loyal assistants; <a href="Tan%20Mui%20Choo">Tan Mui Choo</a> married him, and <a href="Hoe%20Kah%20Hong">Hoe Kah Hong</a> became one of his "holy wives". When the police investigated a <a href="rape">rape</a> charge filed by one of Lim's targets, he became furious and decided to kill children to derail the investigations. On each occasion, Hoe lured a child to Lim's flat where he or she was drugged and killed by the trio. Lim also sexually assaulted the girl before her death. The trio were arrested after the police found a trail of blood that led to their flat. Although the case name suggested ritualistic murders, the defendants said they did not conduct prayers, burning of <a href="joss%20stick">joss stick</a>s, ringing of bells, or any other rituals during the killings.

The 41-day trial was the second longest to have been held in the courts of Singapore at the time. None of the defendants denied their guilt. Their appointed counsels tried to spare their clients the death sentence by pleading <a href="diminished%20responsibility">diminished responsibility</a>, arguing that the accused were mentally ill and could not be held entirely responsible for the killings. To support their case they brought in doctors and psychologists, who analysed the defendants and concluded that they had exhibited <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>, and depressions of the <a href="Psychotic%20depression">psychotic</a> and <a href="Hypomania">manic</a> order. The prosecution's expert, however, refuted these testimonies and argued that they were in full control of their mental faculties when they planned and carried out the murders. The judges agreed with the prosecution's case and sentenced the trio to death. While on <a href="death%20row">death row</a>, the women appealed to the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> in London and pleaded for <a href="Pardon">clemency</a> from the President of Singapore to no avail. Lim did not seek any pardons; instead, he accepted his fate and went smiling to the gallows. The three were <a href="Hanging">hanged</a> on 25 November 1988.

The Toa Payoh ritual murders shocked the public in Singapore, who were surprised by such an act taking place in their society. Reports of the trio's deeds and the court proceedings were closely followed and remained prominent in the Singaporean consciousness for several years. Twice, movie companies tried to capitalise on the sensation generated by the murders by producing motion pictures based on the killings; however, critics panned both films for indulging in gratuitous sex and violence, and the movies performed poorly at the box office. The actions and behaviour of the three killers were studied by academics in the criminal psychology field, and the rulings set by the courts became local case studies for diminished responsibility.

Early in the nineteenth century, immigrants flooded into <a href="Peninsular%20Malaysia">Peninsular Malaysia</a>, colonising the <a href="Straits%20Settlements">Straits Settlements</a> including the island city of Singapore. Migrants and natives held differing beliefs, but over time the boundaries between those belief systems blurred. Most of the population believed in spirits that inhabit the jungles, and in gods and devils that hover around, capable of benevolence and mischief. Certain people claimed that they could communicate with these supernatural beings. Through rituals in which they danced and chanted, these <a href="Mediumship">spirit mediums</a>—"tang-kees" and "<a href="bomoh">bomoh</a>s"—invited the beings to possess their bodies and dole out wisdoms, blessings, and curses to their believers. As time passed and the cities grew, the jungles gave way to concrete structures and the mediums' practices moved deeper into the heartland of communities.

By 1980, 75% of the residents in Singapore were living in <a href="Public%20housing%20in%20Singapore">public housing</a>. Government-built high-rise blocks of flats clustered in the population centres, of which <a href="Toa%20Payoh">Toa Payoh</a> was typical. Although a high density of people lived in each block, the residents mostly kept to themselves, valuing their privacy and tending to ignore what was happening around their homes. During this time, Singapore was a relatively peaceful society—a stark contrast to the prevalence of secret societies, <a href="Triad%20%28underground%20society%29">triads</a> and gang warfare during the pre-independence days. The low crime rate, brought on by strict laws and tough enforcement, gave citizens a sense of security. Nonetheless, the government warned against complacency and lectured in its local campaigns, "Low crime doesn't mean no crime". In 1981, three Singaporeans committed a crime that shocked the nation.

For several years, a medium in Block 12, Toa Payoh Lorong 7, had been performing noisy rituals in the middle of the night. The residents complained several times to the authorities, but the rituals would always resume after a short time. On the afternoon of 24 January 1981, nine-year-old Agnes Ng Siew Heok () disappeared after attending religious classes at her church in Toa Payoh. Hours later, her naked body was found stuffed in a bag outside a <a href="Elevator">lift</a> in Block 11, less than a kilometre (five-eighths of a mile) from the church. The girl had been smothered to death; the investigation revealed injuries to her genitals and semen in her rectum. Although the police launched an intensive investigation, questioning more than 250 people around the crime scene, they failed to obtain any leads. On 7 February ten-year-old Ghazali bin Marzuki was found dead under a tree between Blocks 10 and 11, naked. He had been missing since the previous day, after being seen boarding a taxi with an unknown woman. <a href="Forensic%20pathology">Forensic pathologists</a> on the scene deemed the cause of death as drowning, and found on the boy suffocation marks similar to those on Ng. There were no signs of sexual assault, but burns were on the boy's back and a puncture on his arm. Traces of a <a href="sedative">sedative</a> were later detected in his blood.

The police found a scattered trail of blood that led to the seventh floor of Block 12. Stepping into the common corridor from the stairwell, Inspector Pereira noticed an eclectic mix of religious symbols (a cross, a mirror, and a knife-blade) on the entrance of the first flat (unit number 467F). The owner of the flat, Adrian Lim, approached the inspector and introduced himself, informing Pereira that he was living there with his wife, Tan Mui Choo, and a girlfriend, Hoe Kah Hong. Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood. Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood. After the police found slips of paper written with the dead children's personal details, Lim tried to allay suspicions by claiming that Ghazali had come to his flat seeking treatment for a bleeding nose. He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's. Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation. Lim overheard them and became agitated, raising his voice at the law enforcers. His ire was mimicked by Hoe as she gestured violently and shouted at the officers. Their actions further raised the investigators' suspicions that the trio were deeply involved in the murders. The police collected the evidence, sealed the flat as a crime scene, and took Lim and the two women in for questioning.

Born on 6 January 1942, Adrian Lim () was the eldest son of a low-income family. Described at the trial by his sister as a hot-tempered boy, he dropped out of secondary school and worked a short stint as an informant for the <a href="Internal%20Security%20Department">Internal Security Department</a>, joining the cable radio company <a href="Rediffusion%20Singapore">Rediffusion Singapore</a> in 1962. For three years, he installed and serviced Rediffusion sets as an electrician before being promoted to bill collector. In April 1967, Lim married his childhood sweetheart with whom he had two children. He converted to Catholicism for his marriage. Lim and his family lived in rented rooms until his 1970 purchase of a three-room flat—a seventh floor unit (unit number 467F) of Block 12, Toa Payoh.

Lim started part-time practice as a spirit medium in 1973. He rented a room where he attended to the women—most of whom were <a href="bargirl">bargirl</a>s, dance hostesses, and prostitutes—introduced to him by his landlord. Lim's customers also included superstitious men and elderly females, whom he cheated only of cash. He had learned the trade from a bomoh called "Uncle Willie" and prayed to gods of various religions despite his Catholic baptism. The Hindu goddess <a href="Kali">Kali</a> and "Phragann", which Lim described as a Siamese sex god, were among the spiritual entities he called on in his rituals. Lim deceived his clients with several <a href="confidence%20trick">confidence trick</a>s; his most effective gimmick, known as the "needles and egg" trick, duped many to believe that he had supernatural abilities. After blackening needles with soot from a burning candle, Lim carefully inserted them into a raw egg and sealed the hole with powder. In his rituals, he passed the egg several times over his client while chanting and asked her to crack open the egg. Unaware that the egg had been tampered with, the client would be convinced by the sight of the black needles that evil spirits were harassing her.

Lim particularly preyed on gullible girls who had deep personal problems. He promised them that he could solve their woes and increase their beauty through a ritual massage. After Lim and his client had stripped, he would knead her body—including her genitals—with Phragann's idol and have sex with her. Lim's treatments also included an <a href="electro-shock%20therapy">electro-shock therapy</a> based on that used on mental patients. After placing his client's feet in a tub of water and attaching wires to her temples, Lim passed electricity through her. The shocks, he assured her, would cure headaches and drive away evil spirits.

Catherine Tan Mui Choo () was referred to Lim by a fellow bargirl, who claimed the spirit medium could cure ailments and depression. Tan, at that time, was grieving the death of her grandmother to whom she had been devoted. Furthermore, her estrangement from her parents weighed on her mind; having been sent away at the age of 13 to a vocational centre (a home mostly for <a href="Juvenile%20delinquency">juvenile delinquents</a>), she felt unwanted by them. Tan's visits to Lim became regular, and their relationship grew intimate. In 1975 she moved into his flat on his insistence. To allay his wife's suspicions that he was having an affair with Tan, Lim swore an oath of denial before a picture of Jesus Christ. However, she discovered the truth and moved out with their children a few days later, divorcing Lim in 1976. Lim quit his Rediffusion job and became a full-time medium. He enjoyed brisk business, at one point receiving <a href="Singapore%20dollar">S$</a>6,000–7,000 (<a href="US%20dollar">US$</a>2,838–3,311) a month from a single client. In June 1977, Lim and Tan registered their marriage.

Lim dominated Tan through beatings, threats, and lies. He persuaded her to prostitute herself to supplement their income. He also convinced her that he needed to fornicate with young women to stay healthy; thus, Tan assisted him in his business, preparing their clients for his pleasure. Lim's influence over Tan was strong; on his encouragement and promise that sex with a younger man would preserve her youth, Tan copulated with a Malay teenager and even with her younger brother. The boy was not her only sibling to be influenced by Lim; the medium had earlier seduced Tan's younger sister and tricked her into selling her body and having sex with the two youths. Despite the abuses, Tan lived with Lim, enjoying the dresses, beauty products and slimming courses bought with their income.

Born on 10 September 1955, Hoe Kah Hong () was eight years old when her father died; she was sent to live with her grandmother until she was fifteen. When she returned to her mother and siblings she was constantly required to give way to her elder sister Lai Ho. Under the perception that her mother favoured her sister, Hoe became disgruntled, showing her temper easily. In 1979 her mother brought Lai to Lim for treatment, and became convinced of Lim's powers by his "needles and egg" trick. Believing that Hoe's volatile temper could also be cured by Lim, the old woman brought her younger daughter to the medium. After witnessing the same trick, Hoe became Lim's loyal follower. Lim desired to make Hoe one of his "holy wives", even though she was already married to Benson Loh Ngak Hua. To achieve his goal, Lim sought to isolate Hoe from her family by feeding her lies. He claimed that her family were immoral people who practiced infidelity, and that Loh was an unfaithful man who would force her into prostitution. Hoe believed Lim's words, and after going through a rite with him she was declared by the medium as his "holy wife". She no longer trusted her husband and family, and became violent towards her mother. Three months after she had first met Lim, Hoe moved from her house and went to live with him.

Loh sought his wife at Lim's flat and ended up staying to observe her treatment. He was persuaded by her to participate in the electro-shock therapies. In the early hours of 7 January 1980, Loh sat with Hoe, their arms locked together and their feet in separate tubs of water. Lim applied a large voltage to Loh, who was electrocuted, while Hoe was stunned into unconsciousness. When she woke, Lim requested her to lie to the police about Loh's death. Hoe repeated the story Lim had given her, saying that her husband had been electrocuted in their bedroom when he tried to switch on a faulty electric fan in the dark. The coroner recorded an <a href="open%20verdict">open verdict</a>, and the police made no further investigations.

Despite her antipathy towards Loh, Hoe was affected by his death. Her sanity broke; she started hearing voices and hallucinating, seeing her dead husband. At the end of May she was admitted to the <a href="Institute%20of%20Mental%20Health%20%28Singapore%29">Woodbridge Hospital</a>. There, psychologists diagnosed her condition as <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> and started appropriate treatments. Hoe made a remarkably quick recovery; by the first week of July, she was discharged. She continued her treatment with the hospital; follow-up checks showed that she was in a state of remission. Hoe's attitude towards her mother and other family members began to improve after her stay in the hospital, although she continued to live with Lim and Tan.

With Hoe and Tan as his assistants, Lim continued his trade, tricking more women into giving him money and sex. By the time of his arrest, he had 40 "holy wives". In late 1980 he was arrested and charged with rape. His accuser was Lucy Lau, a door-to-door cosmetic salesgirl, who had met Lim when she was promoting beauty products to Tan. On 19 October, Lim told Lau that a ghost was haunting her, but he could exorcise it with his sex rituals. She was unconvinced, but the medium persisted. He secretly mixed two capsules of <a href="Flurazepam">Dalmadorm</a>, a sedative, into a glass of milk and offered it to her, claiming it had holy properties. Lau became groggy after drinking it, which allowed Lim to take advantage of her. For the next few weeks, he continued to abuse her by using drugs or threats. In November, after Lim had given her parents a loan smaller than the amount they had requested, Lau made a police report about his treatment of her. Lim was arrested on charges of rape, and Tan for abetting him. Out on bail, Lim persuaded Hoe to lie that she was present at the alleged rape but saw no crime committed. This failed to stop the police enquiries; Lim and Tan had to extend their bail, in person, at the police station every fortnight.
Frustrated, Lim plotted to distract the police with a series of child murders. Moreover, he believed that sacrifices of children to Kali would persuade her supernaturally to draw the attention of the police away from him. Lim pretended to be possessed by Kali, and convinced Tan and Hoe that the goddess wanted them to kill children to wreak vengeance on Lau. He also told them Phragann demanded that he have sex with their female victims.

On 24 January 1981, Hoe spotted Agnes at a nearby church and lured her to the flat. The trio plied her with food and drink that was laced with Dalmadorm. After Agnes became groggy and fell asleep, Lim sexually abused her. Near midnight, the trio smothered Agnes with a pillow and drew her blood, drinking and smearing it on a portrait of Kali. Following that, they drowned the girl by holding down her head in a pail of water. Finally, Lim used his electro-shock therapy device to "make doubly sure that she was dead". They stuffed her body in a bag and dumped it near the lift at Block 11.

Ghazali suffered a similar fate when he was brought by Hoe to the flat on 6 February. He, however, proved resistant to the sedatives, taking a long time to fall asleep. Lim decided to tie up the boy as a precaution; however, the boy awoke and struggled. Panicking, the trio delivered <a href="Knifehand%20strike">karate chops</a> to Ghazali's neck and stunned him. After drawing his blood, they proceeded to drown their victim. Ghazali struggled, vomiting and losing control of his bowels as he died. Blood kept streaming from his nose after his death. While Tan stayed behind to clean the flat, Lim and Hoe disposed of the body. Lim noticed that a trail of blood led to their flat, so he and his accomplices cleaned as much as they could of these stains before sunrise. When the trail of blood led the police to their flat, this resulted in their arrest.

Two days after their arrest, Lim, Tan and Hoe were charged in the <a href="Judicial%20system%20of%20Singapore">Subordinate Court</a> for the murders of the two children. The trio were subjected to further interrogations by the police, and to medical examinations by prison doctors. On 16–17 September, their case was brought to the court for a <a href="committal%20procedure">committal procedure</a>. To prove that there was a case against the accused, Deputy Public Prosecutor <a href="Glenn%20Knight">Glenn Knight</a> called on 58 witnesses and arrayed 184 pieces of evidence before the magistrate. While Tan and Hoe denied the charges of murder, Lim pleaded guilty and claimed sole responsibility for the acts. The magistrate decided that the case against the accused was sufficiently strong to be heard at the High Court. Lim, Tan, and Hoe remained in custody while investigations continued.

The High Court was convened in the Supreme Court Building on 25 March 1983. Presiding over the case were two judges: Justice <a href="T.%20S.%20Sinnathuray">Thirugnana Sampanthar Sinnathuray</a>, who would deliver judgment on serial murderer <a href="John%20Martin%20Scripps">John Martin Scripps</a> 13 years later, and Justice Frederick Arthur Chua, who was at the time the longest serving judge in Singapore. Knight continued to build his case on the evidence gathered by detective work. Photographs of the crime scenes, together with witness testimonies, would help the court to visualise the events that led to the crimes. Other evidence—the blood samples, religious objects, drugs, and the notes with Ng and Ghazali's names—conclusively proved the defendants' involvement. Knight had no eyewitnesses to the murders; his evidence was circumstantial, but he told the court in his opening statement, "What matters is that [the accused] did intentionally suffocate and drown these two innocent children, causing their deaths in circumstances which amount to murder. And this we will prove beyond all reasonable doubt."

Tan, with Lim's and the police's permission, used $10,000 of the $159,340 (US$4,730 of US$75,370) seized from the trio's flat to engage <a href="Joshua%20Benjamin%20Jeyaretnam">J. B. Jeyaretnam</a> for her defence. Hoe had to accept the court's offer of counsel, receiving Nathan Isaac as her defender. Since his arrest, Lim had refused legal representation. He <a href="Litigant%20in%20person">defended himself</a> at the Subordinate Court hearings, but could not continue to do so when the case was moved to the High Court; Singapore law requires that for capital crimes the accused must be defended by a legal professional. Thus Howard Cashin was appointed as Lim's lawyer, although his job was complicated by his client's refusal to cooperate. The three lawyers decided not to dispute that their clients had killed the children. Acting on a defence of <a href="diminished%20responsibility">diminished responsibility</a>, they attempted to show that their clients were not sound of mind and could not be held responsible for the killings. Had this defence been successful, the defendants would have escaped the death penalty but be sentenced to either life imprisonment, or up to 10 years in jail.

After Knight had presented the prosecution evidence the court heard testimonies on the personalities and character flaws of the accused, from their relatives and acquaintances. Details of their lives were revealed by one of Lim's "holy wives". Private medical practitioners Dr. Yeo Peng Ngee and Dr. Ang Yiau Hua admitted that they were Lim's sources for drugs, and had provided the trio sleeping pills and sedatives without question on each consultation. The police and forensics teams gave their accounts of their investigations; Inspector Suppiah, the investigating officer-in-charge, read out the statements the defendants had made during their remand. In these statements Lim stated that he had killed for revenge, and that he had sodomised Ng. The accused had also confirmed in their statements that each was an active participant in the murders. There were many contradictions among these statements and the confessions made in court by the accused, but Judge Sinnathuray declared that despite the conflicting evidence, "the essential facts of this case are not in dispute". Lim's involvement in the crimes was further evidenced by a witness who vouched that just after midnight on 7 February 1981, at the ground floor of Block 12, he saw Lim and a woman walk past him carrying a dark-skinned boy.

On 13 April, Lim took the stand. He maintained that he was the sole perpetrator of the crimes. He denied that he raped Lucy Lau or Ng, claiming that he made the earlier statements only to satisfy his interrogators. Lim was selective in answering the questions the court threw at him; he verbosely answered those that agreed with his stance, and refused to comment on the others. When challenged on the veracity of his latest confession, he claimed that he was bound by religious and moral duty to tell the truth. Knight, however, countered that Lim was inherently a dishonest man who had no respect for oaths. Lim had lied to his wife, his clients, the police, and psychiatrists. Knight claimed Lim's stance in court was an open admission that he willingly lied in his earlier statements. Tan and Hoe were more cooperative, answering the questions posed by the court. They denied Lim's story, and vouched for the veracity of the statements they had given to the police. They told how they had lived in constant fear and awe of Lim; believing he had supernatural powers, they followed his every order and had no free will of their own. Under Knight's questioning, however, Tan admitted that Lim had been defrauding his customers, and that she had knowingly helped him to do so. Knight then got Hoe to agree that she was conscious of her actions at the time of the murders.

Of the fact that Lim, Tan, and Hoe had killed the children there was no doubt. Their defence was based on convincing the judges that medically, the accused were not in total control of themselves during the crimes. The bulk of the trial was therefore a battle between expert witnesses called by both sides. Dr Wong Yip Chong, a senior psychiatrist in private practice, believed that Lim was mentally ill at the time of the crimes. Claiming to be "judging by the big picture, and not fussing over contradictions", he said that Lim's voracious sexual appetite and deluded belief in Kali were characteristics of a <a href="Hypomania">mild manic depression</a>. The doctor also proclaimed that only an unsound mind would dump the bodies close to his home when his plan was to distract the police. Countering this, the prosecution's expert witness, Dr Chee Kuan Tsee, a psychiatrist at Woodbridge Hospital, said that Lim was "purposeful in his pursuits, patient in his planning and persuasive in his performance for personal power and pleasure". In Dr Chee's opinion, Lim had indulged in sex because through his role as a medium he obtained a supply of women who were willing to go to bed with him. Furthermore, his belief in Kali was religious in nature, not delusional. Lim's use of religion for personal benefit indicated full self-control. Lastly, Lim had consulted doctors and freely taken sedatives to alleviate his insomnia, a condition which, according to Dr Chee, sufferers from manic depression fail to recognise.

Dr R. Nagulendran, a consultant psychiatrist, testified that Tan was mentally impaired by <a href="Psychotic%20depression">reactive psychotic depression</a>. According to him she was depressed before she met Lim, due to her family background. Physical abuse and threats from Lim deepened her depression; drug abuse led her to hallucinate and believe the medium's lies. Dr Chee disagreed; he said that Tan had admitted to being quite happy with the material lifestyle Lim gave to her, enjoying fine clothes and beauty salon treatments. A sufferer from reactive psychotic depression would not have paid such attention to her appearance. Also, Tan had earlier confessed to knowing Lim was a fraud, but changed her stance in court to claim she was acting completely under his influence. Although Dr Chee had neglected Lim's physical abuse of Tan in his judgment, he was firm in his opinion that Tan was mentally sound during the crimes. Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Chee agreed that Hoe suffered from schizophrenia long before she met Lim, and that her stay in Woodbridge Hospital had helped her recovery. However, while Dr Nagulendran was convinced that Hoe suffered a relapse during the time of the child killings, Dr Chee pointed out that none of the Woodbridge doctors saw any signs of relapse during the six months of her follow-up checks (16 July 1980 – 31 January 1981). Were Hoe as severely impaired by her condition as Dr Nagulendran described, she would have become an invalid. Instead, she methodically abducted and helped kill a child on two occasions. Ending his testimony, Dr Chee stated that it was incredible that three people with different mental illnesses should share a common delusion of receiving a request to kill from a god.

In their closing speeches, the defence tried to reinforce the portrayal of their clients as mentally unsound individuals. Cashin declared that Lim was a normal man until his initiation into the occult, and that he was clearly divorced from reality when he entered the "unreasonable world of atrociousness", acting on his delusions to kill children in Kali's name. Jeyaretnam relied on the fact that due to her depression and Lim's abuse, Tan was just "a robot", carrying out orders without thought. Isaac simply concluded, "[Hoe's] schizophrenic mind accepted that if the children were killed, they would go to heaven and not grow up evil like her mother and others." The defence criticised Dr Chee for failing to recognise their clients' symptoms.

The prosecution started its closing speech by drawing attention to the "cool and calculating" manner in which the children were killed. Knight also argued that the accused could not have shared the same delusion, and only brought it up during the trial. The "cunning and deliberation" displayed in the acts could not have been done by a deluded person. Tan helped Lim because "she loved [him]", and Hoe was simply misled into helping the crimes. Urging the judges to consider the ramifications of their verdict, Knight said: "My Lords, to say that Lim was less than a coward who preyed on little children because they could not fight back; killed them in the hope that he would gain power or wealth and therefore did not commit murder, is to make no sense of the law of murder. It would lend credence to the shroud of mystery and magic he has conjured up his practices and by which he managed to frighten, intimidate and persuade the superstitious, the weak and the gullible into participating in the most lewd and obscene acts."

On 25 May 1983, crowds massed outside the building, waiting for the outcome of the trial. Due to limited seating, only a few were allowed inside to hear Justice Sinnathuray's delivery of the verdict, which took 15 minutes. The two judges were not convinced that the accused were mentally volatile during the crimes. They found Lim to be "abominable and depraved" in carrying out his schemes. Viewing her interviews with the expert witnesses as <a href="Self-incrimination">admissions of guilt</a>, Sinnathuray and Chua found Tan to be an "artful and wicked person", and a "willing [party] to [Lim's] loathsome and nefarious acts". The judges found Hoe to be "simple" and "easily influenced". Although she suffered from schizophrenia, they noted that she was in a state of remission during the murders; hence she should bear full responsibility for her actions. All three defendants were found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged. The two women did not react to their sentences. On the other hand, Lim beamed and cried, "Thank you, my Lords!", as he was led out.

Lim accepted his fate; the women did not, and appealed against their sentences. Tan hired <a href="Francis%20Seow">Francis Seow</a> to appeal for her, and the court again assigned Isaac to Hoe. The lawyers asked the appeal court to reconsider the mental states of their clients during the murders, charging that the trial judges in their deliberations had failed to consider this point. The Court of Criminal Appeal reached their decision in August 1986. The appeal judges which consist of <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Singapore">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Wee%20Chong%20Jin">Wee Chong Jin</a>, Justice <a href="Lai%20Kew%20Chai">Lai Kew Chai</a> and Justice <a href="L%20P%20Thean">L P Thean</a> reaffirmed the decision of their trial counterparts, noting that as finders of facts, judges have the right to discount medical evidence in the light of evidence from other sources. Tan and Hoe's further appeals to London's <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> and Singapore President <a href="Wee%20Kim%20Wee">Wee Kim Wee</a> met with similar failures.

Having exhausted all their avenues for pardon, Tan and Hoe calmly faced their fates. While waiting on <a href="death%20row">death row</a> the trio were counselled by Catholic priests and nuns. In spite of the reputation that surrounded Lim, Father Brian Doro recalled the murderer as a "rather friendly person". When the day of execution loomed, Lim asked Father Doro for absolution and <a href="Eucharist">Holy Communion</a>. Likewise, Tan and Hoe had Sister Gerard Fernandez as their spiritual counsellor. The nun converted the two female convicts to Catholicism, and they received forgiveness and Holy Communion during their final days. On 25 November 1988 the trio were given their last meal and led to the <a href="Hangman%27s%20knot">hangman's noose</a>. Lim smiled throughout his last walk. After the sentences were carried out, the three murderers were given a short Catholic funeral mass by Father Doro, and cremated on the same day.

The trial on the Toa Payoh ritual murders was closely followed by the populace of Singapore. Throngs of people constantly packed the grounds of the courts, hoping to catch a glimpse of Adrian Lim and to hear the revelations first-hand. Reported by regional newspapers in detail, the gory and sexually explicit recounting of Lim's acts offended the sensibilities of some; Canon Frank Lomax, Vicar of <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Singapore">St. Andrew's Anglican Church</a>, complained to "<a href="The%20Straits%20Times">The Straits Times</a>" that the reports could have a corrupting effect on the young. His words received support from a few readers. Others, however, welcomed the open reporting, considering it helpful in raising public awareness of the need for vigilance even in a city with low crime rates. Books, which covered the murders and the trial, were quickly bought by the public on their release.

The revelations from the trial cast Lim as evil incarnate in the minds of Singaporeans. Some citizens could not believe that anyone would willingly defend such a man. They called Cashin to voice their anger; a few even issued death threats against him. On the other hand, Knight's name spread among Singaporeans as the man who brought Adrian Lim to justice, boosting his career. He handled more high-profile cases, and became the director of the <a href="Commercial%20Affairs%20Department">Commercial Affairs Department</a> in 1984. He would maintain his good reputation until his conviction for corruption seven years later.

Even in prison, Lim was hated; his fellow prisoners abused and treated him as an outcast. In the years that followed the crime, memories remained fresh among those who followed the case. Journalists deemed it the most sensational trial of the 80s, being "the talk of a horrified city as gruesome accounts of sexual perversion, the drinking of human blood, spirit possession, exorcism and indiscriminate cruelty unfolded during the 41-day hearing". Fifteen years from the trial's conclusion, a poll conducted by "<a href="The%20New%20Paper">The New Paper</a>" reported that 30 per cent of its respondents had picked the Toa Payoh ritual murders as the most horrible crime, despite the paper's request to vote only for crimes committed in 1998. Lim had become a benchmark for local criminals; in 2002 <a href="Subhas%20Anandan">Subhas Anandan</a> described his client, wife-killer Anthony Ler, as a "cooler, more handsome version of [the] notorious Toa Payoh medium-murderer".

During the 1990s, the local film industry made two movies based on the murder case, the first of which was "<a href="The%20Medium%20%281992%20film%29">Medium Rare</a>". The 1991 production had substantial foreign involvement; most of the cast and crew were American or British. The script was locally written and intended to explore the "psyche of the three main characters". The director, however, focused on sex and violence, and the resulting film was jeered by the audience at its midnight screening. Its 16-day run brought in $130,000 (US$75,145), and a reporter called it "more bizarre than the tales of unnatural sex and occult practices associated with the Adrian Lim story". The second film, 1997's "God or Dog", also had a dismal box-office performance despite a more positive critical reception. Both shows had difficulty in finding local actors for the lead role; <a href="Zhu%20Houren">Zhu Houren</a> declined on the basis that Adrian Lim was too unique a personality for an actor to portray accurately, and <a href="Xie%20Shaoguang">Xie Shaoguang</a> rejected the role for the lack of "redeeming factors" in the murderer. On the television, the murder case would have been the opening episode for "<a href="True%20Files">True Files</a>", a crime awareness programme in 2002. The public, however, complained that the trailers were too gruesome with the re-enactments of the rituals and murders, forcing the media company <a href="MediaCorp">MediaCorp</a> to reshuffle the schedule. The Toa Payoh ritual murders episode was replaced by a less sensational episode as the opener and pushed back into a later timeslot for more mature viewers, marking the horrific nature of the crimes committed by Lim, Tan, and Hoe.

Ray Lindwall with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

<a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> was a key member of <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948</a>. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet "The Invincibles".

Lindwall played as a right-arm <a href="fast%20bowling">opening fast bowler</a> and right-handed batsman in the <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">lower middle-order</a>. Along with <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>, Lindwall formed Australia's first-choice pace duo, regarded as one of the best of all time, and Bradman typically used them in short and sharp bursts against the home batsmen. The pair were used to target England's leading batsmen, <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> during the major matches, and subdued Hutton for much of the summer. England had agreed to make a new ball available after every 55 <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a>, more often than the usual regulations at the time, thereby allowing the pair more frequent use of a shiny ball that <a href="swing%20bowling">swung</a> at high pace. Bradman gave the duo lighter workloads in the tour matches in order to preserve their energy for the new ball battles against England's key batsmen in the Tests. Lindwall was a capable lower-order batsman who made two Test centuries during his career, and he featured in several rearguard actions that boosted Australia's scores during the tour.

Lindwall was the equal leading wicket-taker in the Tests (27 along with <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a>) and had the best <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a> (19.62) and <a href="strike%20rate">strike rate</a>. In the <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class matches</a>, he led the averages although he was second in the wicket-taking list with 86 at 15.68 behind Johnston (102), who was assigned more of the workload in order to keep Miller and Lindwall fresh for the Tests. With the bat, Lindwall scored 191 runs at a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of 31.83 in the Tests.

Lindwall's most influential contributions in <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> matches were his 5/70 in the first innings of the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, a hard-hitting 77 that limited Australia's first innings deficit in the Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a>, and most notably, his 6/20 on the first day of the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. The performance was a display of extreme pace and swing that earned high praise from pundits and was largely responsible for England being bowled out for 52. Outside the Tests, Lindwall took 11/59 in a match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>, with eight of his victims being <a href="bowled">bowled</a> as the ball curved through their defences at high pace. In recognition of his achievements, Lindwall was chosen as one of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a>. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" said that "by whatever standard he is judged ... [Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers".

A bowler of express pace, Lindwall was a regular member of the Test team and had opened Australia's attack since the resumption of cricket following <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. During the Australian summer of 1947–48, Lindwall played in all five Tests against the touring <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team">Indian cricket team</a>. He played a major part in Australia's 4–0 series win as the leading wicket-taker with 18 scalps at an average of 16.88, ahead of <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> and <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> who took 16 apiece at averages of 16.31 and 11.37 respectively. As a result, Lindwall was selected as part of <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>'s "Invincibles" that toured England without defeat in 1948, with the intention of leading the pace attack. There were two concerns for Lindwall in the lead-up to the tour. Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon and his foot drag during the delivery stride led to discussion in the media and among umpires as to its <a href="no-ball">legality</a>. Bradman arranged for Lindwall to see his Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, who restored the paceman's leg to prime condition in a fortnight. On the public relations front, Bradman stated his firm belief in the fairness of Lindwall's delivery. During the lengthy sea voyage to England, Bradman emphasized the importance of caution with respect to his bowling action. Bradman advised Lindwall to ensure that his dragging rear right foot was further behind the <a href="crease%20%28cricket%29">line</a> than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to refrain from bowling at full speed until the umpires were satisfied with his delivery stride. The Australian captain guaranteed Lindwall selection for the Tests and told him that his first priority in the lead-in tour matches was passing the umpires' scrutiny. Bradman recalled how paceman <a href="Ernie%20McCormick">Ernie McCormick</a> had been no-balled 35 times in the traditional tour opener against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcester</a> during the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">1938 campaign</a>, destroying his confidence for the rest of the season.

In the lead-up to the match against Worcestershire, photographers and cameramen constantly followed Lindwall, trying to capture visual evidence of an illegal drag when he was bowling in the <a href="cricket%20nets">practice nets</a>. Bradman tried to stop the journalists from taking photographs of the crease as Lindwall came in to bowl, and deflected media questions about his bowler's drag. The spectators and media were keenly observing the position of his foot in the tour opener, but Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and complaints about his drag faded away for the rest of the tour. The hosts elected to bat first, and Lindwall took 2/41 in the first innings, bowling and trapping his victims <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> before delivering three wicketless <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> for 19 runs in the second innings. Lindwall took a wicket with his second ball in England, trapping <a href="Don%20Kenyon">Don Kenyon</a> for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> to leave the hosts at 1/0. He was promoted to No. 4 as Bradman rotated his <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">batting order</a> and he scored a quickfire 32 from 34 balls with six <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">boundaries</a> before Australia completed an innings victory. According to former Australian Test batsman and journalist <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, Lindwall "took things very quietly ... The fast bowler is very wise who builds up his speed match by match". With the media and public attention now focused on actual bowling, Lindwall's classical bowling action evoked almost as much interest as his captain's batting.

Bradman rested Lindwall for the second tour match against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>, which ended in an innings victory for the Australians. Lindwall returned for the next fixture against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> at <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, but bowled only nine overs for a total of 1/16. He made a duck in the first innings on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">damp pitch</a> favourable to slower bowling, as Australia scraped home by four wickets. Lindwall was due in next when Australia collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory in the second innings. The tourists were effectively seven wickets down with the injured <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> unable to bat, but <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> and <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> saw Australia to the target without further loss. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. The Australians travelled to London to play <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. They batted first and Lindwall managed only four, clean bowled by <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a>, as Australia amassed 632. He then took the first two wickets to reduce Surrey to 2/15 in the first innings. Bradman used Lindwall sparingly, taking a match total of 3/45 from 25 overs as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Fingleton felt that Lindwall was at his fastest for the season during the Surrey match. One of Lindwall's <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncers</a> flew over three feet above the batsman's head.

Lindwall had another light workout in the match against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a>, taking match figures of 1/33 from nine overs. His solitary wicket was that of <a href="Doug%20Insole">Doug Insole</a>, and he was not required to bat as Australia completed another innings victory. After the fixture against Cambridge, Lindwall was rested for two consecutive matches. In the first, Australia crushed <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. The second match resulted in another innings victory, this time over <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>.

Lindwall was brought back for the match against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia selected their first-choice team. It was a chance for the Australian pace attack to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests, with <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>, <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> and <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>—three of England's first four batsmen—all playing. Australia batted first and Lindwall scored 29, including three <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">sixes</a> from the bowling of England Test <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a>. After Australia amassed 552, Lindwall took combined figures of 2/68, removing Compton and England and MCC captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> as the tourists enforced the follow on by an innings and 158 runs. The MCC fixture was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>. After the first day was washed out, Lindwall made a duck and then took 3/44, removing Test players <a href="Ken%20Cranston">Ken Cranston</a> and <a href="Jack%20Ikin">Jack Ikin</a> during the hosts’ only innings. He was not required to bat in the second innings as the match petered into a draw on the final day.

In the next match against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a> at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>, Lindwall took 6/14 to gain a psychological blow ahead of the First Test to be held at the same venue. After taking the first four wickets and cutting through the top-order, the paceman returned to finish off the tail and ensure the hosts were dismissed for 179. Lindwall bowled three of his victims with fast and swinging <a href="yorker">yorker</a>s. He delivered 91 balls, conceding less than a run per <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>. Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls. Fingleton said that Lindwall "absolutely paralysed" the batsmen, with some of his bowling "in the real <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Larwood</a> manner". Harold Larwood was a Nottinghamshire express pace bowler of the 1920s and 1930s who led the controversial <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> attack in Australia in 1932–33, and Lindwall modelled his bowling action on Larwood after seeing him in action at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> during the tour. Lindwall could only manage eight runs with the bat and was unable to repeat his incisive bowling in the second innings, sending down 14 wicketless overs as the match ended in a draw.

Lindwall was rested for Australia's eight-wicket win over <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>, before returning in the following match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>. Bowling with a <a href="tailwind">tailwind</a>, he took two early wickets before returning to remove the last four batsmen to fall. Five of Lindwall's opponents were bowled as he ended with 6/34 from 19.4 overs; the hosts were dismissed for 86. During the tourists' reply, Bradman promoted Lindwall to No. 4 and he came to the wicket at 2/342, scored 57 and put on 93 runs with <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a>, who scored an unbeaten 100 as Australia <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> at 5/549. Lindwall then broke through with two early wickets to leave Sussex at 2/2, and went on to finish with 5/25 in 15 overs as the home side were bowled out for 138, handing Bradman's men a victory by an innings and 325 runs in two days. He ended with match figures of 11/59, with eight of his victims being bowled, five of these by swinging yorkers, unable to counter Lindwall's swerving deliveries. Fingleton said that "Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions" as Sussex "crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew".

Lindwall lined up for the First Test at Trent Bridge, a venue where he had taken six wickets in the tour game against Nottinghamshire. Australia bowled first, and Lindwall delivered the first ball of the match at a moderate pace; Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Lindwall gradually increased his speed and rhythm, and took the wicket of <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a>, caught on the run by <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> on the <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">fine leg boundary</a> after the batsman had attempted a <a href="Pull%20shot">hook shot</a>. However, he was forced to leave the field with a groin strain midway through the first day, ending with figures of 1/30. After England were out for 165, Lindwall came out to bat at 7/365 without a <a href="runner%20%28cricket%29">runner</a> on the third day, and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. He added 107 runs for the eighth wicket with vice-captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>. Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting before Bedser struck his off stump. Four runs later, Lindwall was caught by <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a> down the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> to leave the total at 6/469, but some free hitting by Australia's last pair allowed them to advance to 509, giving them a 344-run lead.

Although Lindwall was able to jog between the wickets, he did not take the field in the second innings and the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">12th man</a> <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> replaced him. This gave Australia a marked fielding advantage—Fingleton described Harvey as "by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides". Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but he did not formally object to Harvey's presence on the field. Journalist, former Australian Test cricketer and Lindwall mentor <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a>, said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, he was in no way "incapacitated" and that the English captain "must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far" when no substitute was justified. O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far. English commentator <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world.

However, the gains provided by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling and made their eventual victory much more difficult. England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon to complete an eight-wicket victory. Due to his injury, Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches leading up to the Second Test. Australia proceeded to defeat <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire.

Two weeks after injuring himself at Trent Bridge, Lindwall undertook a thorough fitness examination on the morning of the Second Test at Lord's. Bradman was not convinced of the bowler's fitness, but Lindwall—keen to play at the historic ground known as the "home of cricket"—was able to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. He came in late on the first afternoon with the score at 7/246 and made three runs before stumps were called at 7/258. The next morning, Lindwall batted confidently from the outset. He hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball had been taken, prompting O'Reilly to say that Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series in 1946–47. However, he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8. Australia were out for 350 shortly before lunch on the second morning. In the hosts' reply, Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin after delivering the first ball of the innings to <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>. Despite this, the paceman persevered through the pain.

In his fourth over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump. Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> accompanied him from the other end because <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> had a back injury and was only able to bat. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a> tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having been dismissed <a href="hit%20wicket">hit wicket</a> after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a>. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>—who was playing across the line of the ball—for five. <a href="Tom%20Dollery">Tom Dollery</a> was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall's next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck. Dollery's bat was about to start its downward swing by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.

Once the second new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall returned but appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. At the start of the third morning, he bowled <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> off an inside edge from a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning. O'Reilly said Lindwall "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task ... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.

Bradman's batsmen set about building on their lead and Lindwall was initially not expected to bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch on the fourth day so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.

Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch at the start of the run chase, and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before he had scored and the English batsmen played and missed multiple times. Hutton had trouble seeing and playing Lindwall's deliveries in the deteriorating light with no <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">sightscreen</a> available, and Fingleton described it as "probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test". O'Reilly said Hutton "seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows", calling him "little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [of 1938]". Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings.

Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42—England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far—before the latter edged Lindwall to Johnson <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">in the slips</a> and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short balls</a>, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. However, they survived Lindwall's spell of bowling. Late in the day, Lindwall was brought back to put pressure on Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance.

Lindwall returned on the final morning with the score at 6/141. Dollery, who had been batting with assurance, shaped to duck under a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Later in the same over, Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck to leave England at 8/141. The match ended when <a href="Doug%20Wright%20%28cricketer%29">Doug Wright</a> hit <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> to Lindwall and was caught for four. Lindwall ended with 3/61 as Australia took a 409-run victory. Arlott said that while Toshack (5/40) had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall "so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome." In later years, Bradman told Lindwall he pretended not to notice the bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried Bradman had noticed his injury and would be disappointed, but the Australian captain later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow Lindwall to relax and focus on his bowling.

After carrying an injury into the Second Test, Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against Surrey, which started the day after the proceedings at Lord's ended; Australia took a ten-wicket victory. Lindwall returned for the match against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>. Australia batted first and made 7/774, its highest score of the tour and the second highest by any Australian team in England. Lindwall was not able to partake in the prolific run-getting, as the tourists declared before he had scored. He bowled a total of 21 overs, taking 0/41 as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 363 runs.

When the teams reconvened at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a> for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, sparking much acrimony and controversy in the English cricket community. The reason was said to be Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player. The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton's replacement as opener, <a href="George%20Emmett">George Emmett</a>, who fended a short ball to <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">short leg</a> to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall's <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> and took his eyes from the ball, fending with one hand on the bat, while ducking his head below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match, and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".

Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with a short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Larwood. During this period, both Edrich and Compton found it difficult to position themselves quickly enough to play Lindwall. The Australian paceman then hit Compton on the arm, and soon after, felled him with a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> that the batsman top-edged into his face. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 2/33. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no-ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that after rebounding from his head, it flew more than half-way to the boundary before landing. This was followed by a period of slow play as England tried to regroup.

Lindwall returned to take the second new ball and trapped <a href="Jack%20Crapp">Jack Crapp</a>, who did not offer a shot, for 37 to leave the score at 3/87. The batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Lindwall later had Edrich <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23G">gloving</a> a rearing ball to the wicket-keeper to leave England at 5/119. Compton returned upon the fall of the fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4/99 after having <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a> caught behind from an expansive <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut shot</a>. England ended on 363 all out on the second day; Compton made an unbeaten 145. Lindwall had beaten Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch on the second day, but the Englishman survived to add more than 20 further runs. On the third day, Lindwall came to the crease at 6/172 after Barnes—who had collapsed due to the aftereffects of being hit in the ribs from point blank range when fielding—had been forced to retire hurt. Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on, and Lindwall received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on by eight runs; he was the last man to be dismissed.

At the start of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who promptly removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an <a href="outswinger">outswinger</a> on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed by umpire <a href="Dai%20Davies%20%28cricketer%29">Dai Davies</a> for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no-balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">fine leg</a>, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.

Lindwall returned for a new spell late on the third day and almost hit Washbrook in the head. Hassett again dropped Washbrook, who was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd. Lindwall ended with 1/37 as England declared at their stumps score of 3/174 after the entire fourth day and the final morning was washed out. The match petered into a draw with Lindwall not required as Australia safely batted out the final day. Lindwall played in Australia's only match—against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>—before the Fourth Test, but was not at his best. He and Miller had been partying heavily in the days before the match, and were out and binge drinking on the night before the match; they did not return until after dawn, when they were caught severely inebriated by Bradman at breakfast time. Miller was rested for the match, but Lindwall was selected for the match. The home team won the toss and elected to bat, so Lindwall could not rest and sober up in the dressing room while the specialist batsmen were at work. He was asked to bowl a lengthy spell in warm and sunny conditions on the opening morning, and was at times lying on the ground in an attempt to recover during stoppages. Nevertheless, he ended with 1/28 from 16 overs, the opposition still unable to score heavily despite his obvious lethargy. He took a total of 3/59 from 25 overs and scored one as the tourists won by an innings, removing the home team's captain <a href="George%20Mann%20%28cricketer%29">George Mann</a> twice and Edrich once. In the second innings, Lindwall took 2/31, but effectively had a third wicket. He bowled a bouncer at opener <a href="Jack%20Robertson%20%28English%20cricketer%29">Jack Robertson</a>, who tried to hook, but missed, suffered a fractured jaw and was forced to retire hurt, prompting angry shouting and booing from sections of the crowd. Robertson defended Lindwall, contending that the delivery was fair and that he had executed his shot incorrectly.

Hutton returned for the Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> and played effectively. At one stage he and Washbrook took five boundaries from six Lindwall overs. An opening partnership of 168 resulted until Lindwall bowled him for 81. The English opener went onto the front foot and was clean bowled, much to the dismay of the home crowd. The stand came after Washbrook had decided to refrain from hooking Lindwall's bouncers, which had caused him problems in the earlier Tests. England did not lose their second wicket until the last over of the day, when Washbrook hit Johnston into Lindwall's hands for 143, leaving the total at 2/268. Both Fingleton and O'Reilly criticised the bowling group as a whole for what they deemed a very lethargic display; the former deemed it the worst day's performance since World War II and the latter accused all the Australian bowlers of operating "without object".

During the innings, Lindwall <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a>ed for lbw four times while wicket-keeper <a href="Ron%20Saggers">Ron Saggers</a>—standing in for the injured Tallon—remained silent, not supporting the appeal. England ran up a large score of 496 but squandered a very strong position after losing their last 8 wickets for 73 runs; Lindwall had Compton caught down the leg side to give Saggers his first Test catch, leaving England at 6/473. Lindwall ended with 2/79 from 38 overs. Fingleton said "this grand fast bowler held the side together splendidly and answered every call". O’Reilly said that until England collapsed—mostly due to unforced errors despite favourable conditions—only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said the paceman "kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after the other members of the attack had lost all signs of hostility ... Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work." O’Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity.

In reply, Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall came in at 6/329 on the third afternoon. With the fall of <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> and Saggers in quick succession, Bradman's men were at 8/355 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling; he dominated in stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half-volley to hit lofted drives. Of the 103 runs added for the last two wickets, the two tail-enders managed only 25 between them. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps with Johnston <a href="runner%20%28cricket%29">running</a> for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. During Lindwall's partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike and face most of the balls. O’Reilly speculated that Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play, so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain Lindwall nor dismiss the Australians. Sunday was a rest day, and on Monday, the fourth morning, Lindwall was the last man out in the third over of the day, leaving Australia on 458, 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Lindwall edged Bedser into the slips cordon and Crapp took the catch low down in his left hand.

England made a strong start in their second innings—the openers registered their second century stand for the match. When Australia took the second new ball, Lindwall—worried by the substantial and hazardous craters in the pitch he and the other bowlers had created while following through on the left-hand side of the crease—changed to bowling from <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">around the wicket</a> and was warned for running on the pitch. He reverted to bowling from over the wicket, although he delivered from the edge of the crease to avoid the holes. O’Reilly said the warning to Lindwall played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump that the English bowlers target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. England reached 2/232 before Lindwall trapped Edrich to end a 103-run partnership. The paceman followed this by bowling <a href="Jack%20Crapp">Jack Crapp</a>, who inside edged an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot onto his own stumps. This triggered a collapse of 4/33 from 3/260 to 7/293. Lindwall took 2/84 as the hosts declared on the final day at 8/365, leaving Australia to chase a world Test record of 404 for victory, with only 345 minutes available. Centuries to Bradman and Morris in a 301-run stand saw Australia seal the series 3–0 with a record-breaking seven-wicket win with 15 minutes in hand.

The paceman was rested for the match against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings. Lindwall returned for the match against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a> and took 2/36 in a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. In the next match against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>, he claimed 3/27 in the first innings, taking three consecutive middle-order wickets—including Test batsmen <a href="Tom%20Dollery">Tom Dollery</a> and <a href="Abdul%20Hafeez%20Kardar">Abdul Hafeez Kardar</a>—in the space of 12 balls as the hosts fell for 138. In reply, Australia stumbled to 6/161 when Lindwall joined Hassett. The pair put on 70 for the seventh wicket, the largest partnership in a low-scoring match. Lindwall ended with 45, the second highest score for the entire match, as Australia took a 116-run lead. He took the first wicket and ended with 1/32 as Bradman's men won by nine wickets. Australia proceeded to face Lancashire at Old Trafford for the second time during the season in a match that doubled as Washbrook's <a href="benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit</a>. Lindwall made 17 in the tourists’ first innings of 321 and then dismissed the home side's first three batsmen, taking 3/32 as Lancashire fell for 130. Washbrook top-scored with 38 before Lindwall had him caught in the slips by Miller. He also collected several painful bruises from Lindwall on his right hand and thumb. Bradman described his leading paceman as being in "stupendous form ... I have not seen before or since such sustained brilliance from a pace bowler". Australia made 3/265 declared in their second innings, leaving the hosts with a target of 457 in less than a day, with Washbrook unable to bat due to Lindwall's bruising bowling. Lindwall bowled both openers with the new ball, but Lancashire appeared to be safely batting out a draw at 5/191 with only eight minutes remaining. Lindwall returned after Bradman took the new ball, and told the slip cordon to move halfway back to the boundary. Bowling with a tailwind, Lindwall was at full pace, in one of the fastest displays Bradman had seen in his long career. He bowled <a href="Jack%20Ikin">Jack Ikin</a> for 99 and <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a>—who later claimed to have not seen the ball—for a golden duck. The hosts were in danger of suffering a late collapse and defeat, but <a href="William%20Roberts%20%28cricketer%29">William Roberts</a> successfully defended the hat-trick ball; Lancashire lost no further wickets and were 7/191 when stumps were drawn; Lindwall ended with 4/27. He also caused Washbrook to miss the final Test with a thumb injury. The paceman was rested from the non-first-class match against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, which was a rain-affected draw.

According to Bradman, Fingleton and O'Reilly, Lindwall's performance in the final Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> was one of the best they had ever seen from any player. English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, surprising most observers. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of sawdust to allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.

After Miller had taken an early wicket, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">third man</a>, who stopped the ball and waited for the batsman to regather his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect a run out. However, this gesture of sportsmanship cost Australia little, because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton attempted a hook shot and <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> ran from his position at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">short square leg</a> to take a difficult catch, leaving the hosts at 3/17. Fingleton described Morris's feat as "one of the catches of the season".

After the lunch break, England struggled to 4/35, before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging <a href="yorker">yorker</a>. The debutant <a href="Allan%20Watkins">Allan Watkins</a> then batted for 16 balls in an attempt to get off the mark with a series of failed hook shots. He missed an attempted hook shot and was hit in the shoulder by another Lindwall bouncer. Soon after, Watkins was dismissed without scoring after playing across the line and being trapped lbw by Johnston, leaving England at 6/42. Watkins also collected a bruise on his right shoulder for his troubles with Lindwall; this inhibited his bowling later in the match. Following the departure of Watkins, Lindwall removed <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a>, <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> and Young, all yorked in the space of two runs. England fell from 6/45 to 9/47, bringing Hollies in at No. 11 to accompany Hutton, who had batted through the innings. Hutton then hit the only boundary of the innings, lofting a <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">straight drive</a> back over Lindwall's head. The ball almost went for six, landing just short of the fence. The home team's innings ended on 52 when Hutton—who never appeared to be troubled by the bowling—<a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">leg glanced</a> Lindwall and was caught by wicket-keeper <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> one-handed, at full stretch to his left. Lindwall described the catch as one of the best he had ever seen. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled a spell of 8.1 overs during which he took 5/8; he totalled 6/20 in 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as "the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket". Fingleton, who played against the "<a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>" attack in 1932–33, said "I was watching a man almost the equal of Larwood [the "Bodyline" spearhead] in pace ... Truly a great bowler". O'Reilly said that Lindwall's "magnificent performance must go down as one of the greatest bowling efforts in Anglo-Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so well that he set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever."

In Australia's reply, Lindwall came in at 6/304 and attacked immediately, scoring two fours before falling for nine. He played a cover drive from the bowling of Young, but hit the ball too early and thus launched it into the air, and it was caught by Edrich at cover point to leave the score at 7/332. The visitors ended on 389 and England started their second innings late on the second day. Debutant <a href="John%20Dewes">John Dewes</a> took strike and got off the mark when he aimed a hook shot and was credited with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer had risen over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Lindwall made the early breakthrough soon after, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England at 1/20. Dewes often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty.

Early on the third day, Lindwall bowled Edrich—who was playing across the line—for 28, hitting the off stump with a ball that cut inwards to leave England's score at 64, before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings and took the total to 2/121 at lunch. Soon after, with his score on 39, Compton aimed a hard <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut shot</a> that flew into Lindwall's left hand at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">second slip</a> for a "freak slip catch" from Johnston's bowling; leaving England at 3/125. Lindwall returned for another spell after lunch and bowled Evans for eight. Evans appeared to not detect Lindwall's yorker in the fading light, and the umpires called off play due to <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">poor visibility</a> after an appeal by Yardley. The next morning, England were bowled out for 188, giving Australia an innings victory and the series 4–0. Lindwall took 3/50 to total 9/70 for the match. He ended the Tests as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets at 19.62, and scored 191 runs at 31.83.

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> and Lindwall made only one in a total of 361. The paceman took two wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before they were all out for 51; Lindwall ended with 2/16. Forced to follow on, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets; the victims included <a href="Tony%20Pawson%20%28cricketer%29">Tony Pawson</a> and former Test wicket-keeper <a href="Les%20Ames">Les Ames</a>. The hosts were further hampered by the absence of opener <a href="Leslie%20Todd">Leslie Todd</a>, who had been hit on the foot by a Lindwall swinging yorker in the first innings. The blow caused so much bruising that Todd's foot could not fit inside his cricket boots. Lindwall ended with 4/25 as Kent fell for 124 to lose by an innings. In his match total of 6/41 from 15 overs, Lindwall bowled four of his victims. The Kent fixture was followed by a match against the <a href="Gentlemen%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">Gentlemen of England</a>. Lindwall was not required to bat, and after taking 1/39 in the first innings, Bradman allowed him to rest as Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Bradman rested Lindwall for the match against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, which resulted in another innings victory for the tourists. The paceman returned against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a>—a representative team—scoring an unbeaten 17 in an unbroken 61-run stand with <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> before Australia declared at 7/522. He then took 1/45 as rain ended the match at the conclusion of the hosts’ second innings.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson-Gower">Leveson Gower's</a> XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After the hosts had complied, the Australian skipper fielded a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Lindwall bowled Hutton for a duck with the new ball. He returned and took five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. His last five victims were former England captain <a href="Walter%20Robins">Walter Robins</a> and Test players <a href="Freddie%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Freddie Brown</a>, Evans, Bedser and Laker. Lindwall ended with 6/59; four of his wickets were bowled, while the other two were caught by <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> in the slips. He made five as Australia with 8/489 declared; time ran out in the rain-affected match with Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75.

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>. Lindwall was rested from the first, which Australia won by an innings. In the second fixture, Lindwall signed off in a low key manner, scoring 15 and taking a total of 0/28 from 14 overs as Australia ended their campaign with another innings triumph.

When fit, Lindwall opened the bowling with Miller in the Tests, and the pair operated in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs in the Tests; at the time, the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored, something which usually took longer than 55 overs. The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians, as a new ball is ideal for <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowling</a> and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs. As a result, Lindwall bowled 224 overs, while Australia's third fast bowler <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> bowled 306. Lindwall led the Test bowling averages, with 27 wickets at 19.62, making him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Johnston, who averaged 23.33. The duo's haul of 27 Test wickets equalled the record for an Australian fast bowler during a tour of England. The Australian pair were substantially ahead the next most successful bowler, England's <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a>, who took 18 wickets at 38.22. Lindwall's role as the leading strike bowler is borne out in his <a href="economy%20rate">economy</a> and <a href="strike%20rate">strike rate</a> in both the Tests and all first-class matches. He was the least economical of the three pacemen, but took his wickets more frequently than any other frontline bowler.

In all first-class matches, he took 86 wickets at 15.68 and held onto 14 catches, fielding in the slips. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between, so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests by giving them a lighter workload during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4, Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Outside the Tests, Lindwall bowled 349.3 overs, only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches.

The local batsmen were unable to cope with Lindwalls high pace and swing; 43 of his wickets came after his opponent had missed the ball and been bowled. Lindwall scored 411 runs at 24.17 with two fifties in the first-class matches, including 191 at 31.83 in the Tests. Lindwall had limited batting opportunities, usually playing from No. 7 to No. 9. It was hard for Lindwall to get any higher up the order as Australia's other frontline bowlers, such as <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a>, <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> and <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>, all scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, and were of similar batting ability. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions due to their batting strength, Lindwall only had 20 innings in his 22 matches, and usually batted at numbers 7, 8 or 9. However, he was often effective when he did get an opportunity.

"<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" recognised Lindwall by naming him as one of its five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1949. The publication cited the paceman's ability to seize the initiative for Australia in all but one of the Tests by taking early wickets. The fast bowler's success was attributed to a "superb control of length and direction, his change of pace and general skill, the like of which in a slower bowler could be classed as cunning". The ferocity of Lindwall's bouncer often prompted opponents to retreat onto the back foot before he had even released the ball. "Wisden" said that "by whatever standard he is judged ... [Lindwall] must be placed permanently in the gallery of great fast bowlers".

The Swimming Hole

The Swimming Hole (also known as Swimming and The Old Swimming Hole) is an 1884–85 painting by the American artist <a href="Thomas%20Eakins">Thomas Eakins</a> (1844–1916), <a href="List%20of%20works%20by%20Thomas%20Eakins">Goodrich catalog #190</a>, in the collection of the <a href="Amon%20Carter%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Amon Carter Museum of American Art</a> in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>. Executed in <a href="oil%20on%20canvas">oil on canvas</a>, it depicts six men <a href="skinny%20dipping">swimming naked</a> in a lake, and is considered a masterpiece of American painting. According to art historian Doreen Bolger it is "perhaps Eakins' most accomplished rendition of the nude figure", and has been called "the most finely designed of all his outdoor pictures". Since the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, the human body has been considered both the <a href="Figure%20drawing">basis of artists' training</a> and the most challenging subject to depict in art, and the nude was the centerpiece of Eakins' teaching program at the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Academy%20of%20the%20Fine%20Arts">Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts</a>. For Eakins, this picture was an opportunity to display his mastery of the human form.

In this work, Eakins took advantage of an exception to the generally prudish <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorian</a> attitude to <a href="nudity">nudity</a>: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when <a href="Depictions%20of%20nudity">nudity was on display</a>. "The Swimming Hole" develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of <a href="buttocks">buttocks</a> and his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his "<a href="The%20Gross%20Clinic">The Gross Clinic</a>" (1875) and "<a href="William%20Rush%20and%20His%20Model">William Rush</a>" (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers ("<a href="Taking%20the%20Count">Taking the Count</a>", "<a href="Salutat">Salutat</a>", and "<a href="Between%20Rounds">Between Rounds</a>") and wrestlers ("<a href="Wrestlers%20%28Eakins%29">Wrestlers</a>").

Although the theme of male bathers was familiar in <a href="Western%20art%20history">Western art</a>, having been explored by artists from <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> to <a href="Daumier">Daumier</a>, Eakins' treatment was novel in <a href="Visual%20arts%20of%20the%20United%20States">American art</a> at the time. "The Swimming Hole" has been "widely cited as a prime example of homoeroticism in American art". In 2008, the art critic Tom Lubbock described Eakins' work as:

Eakins referred to the painting as "Swimming" in 1885, and as "The Swimmers" in 1886. The title "The Swimming Hole" dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, <a href="Susan%20Macdowell%20Eakins">Susan Macdowell Eakins</a> Four years later, she titled the work "The Old Swimming Hole", in reference to the 1882 poem "The Old Swimmin'-Hole"; by <a href="James%20Whitcomb%20Riley">James Whitcomb Riley</a>. The <a href="Amon%20Carter%20Museum">Amon Carter Museum</a> has since returned to Eakins' original title, "Swimming".

The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at <a href="Dove%20Lake%20%28Pennsylvania%29">Dove Lake</a>, an artificial lake in <a href="Mill%20Creek%20%28Montgomery%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania%29">Mill Creek</a> outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, "apparently lost in a contemplative moment". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): <a href="Talcott%20Williams">Talcott Williams</a> (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), <a href="J.%20Laurie%20Wallace">J. Laurie Wallace</a> (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' <a href="Irish%20Setter">Irish Setter</a>, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast.

The composition is notable for both its adherence to <a href="Academy%23Academies%20of%20the%20arts">academic tradition</a> (the mastery of the figure as an end in itself), and its uniqueness in transposing the male nude to an outdoor setting. The depiction of someone diving into water was very rare in the history of Western art. The other figures are artfully arranged to imply a continuous narrative of movement, the poses progressing "from reclining to sitting to standing to diving"; at the same time, each figure is carefully positioned so that no genitalia are visible. As in his previous works, Eakins chose to include a <a href="self-portrait">self-portrait</a>, here as the swimmer at bottom-right. Unlike his appearances in "The Gross Clinic" or "<a href="Max%20Schmitt%20in%20a%20Single%20Scull">Max Schmitt in a Single Scull</a>", here the artist's presence is more ambiguous—he may be seen as companion, teacher, or voyeur. The ripple in the water next to Eakins, and the bubbles around the diver, are the only indications of movement in a painting where motion is otherwise arrested; the water next to the red-headed figure in the lake is still enough to offer a clear reflection. This contrast underscores the tension in the picture between classical prototypes and scientific naturalism.

The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of <a href="Greek%20art">Greek art</a>. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the "<a href="Dying%20Gaul">Dying Gaul</a>", and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was "<a href="Sc%C3%A8ne%20d%27%C3%A9t%C3%A9">Scène d'été</a>", painted in 1869 by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Bazille">Frédéric Bazille</a> (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Salon</a> while studying in Paris, and would have been sympathetic to its depiction of male bathers in a modern setting.

In Eakins' oeuvre, "The Swimming Hole" was immediately preceded by a number of similar works on the <a href="Arcadia%20%28utopia%29">Arcadian</a> theme. These correspond to lectures he gave on <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20sculpture">Ancient Greek sculpture</a> and were inspired by the Pennsylvania Academy's casts of <a href="Phidias">Phidias</a>' Pan-Athenaic procession from the <a href="Elgin%20Marbles">Parthenon marbles</a>. A series of photographs, relief sculptures, and oil sketches culminated in the 1883 "<a href="Arcadia%20%28painting%29">Arcadia</a>", a painting that also featured nude figures—posed for by a student, a nephew, and the artist's fiancée—in a pastoral landscape.

Eakins made several on-site <a href="oil%20sketch">oil sketch</a>es and photographic studies before painting "The Swimming Hole". It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced or vice versa (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).

By the early 1880s, Eakins was using photography to explore sequential movement and as a reference for painting. Some time in 1883 or 1884, he photographed his students engaged in outdoor activities. Four photographs of his students swimming naked in Dove Lake have survived, and bear a clear relationship to "The Swimming Hole". The swimmers are seen in the same spot and from the same vantage point, although their positions are entirely different from those in the painting. None of the photographs closely matches the poses depicted in the painting; this was unusual for Eakins, who typically adhered closely to his photographic studies. "The divergence between these sets of images may hint at lost or destroyed pictures, or it may tell us that the photographs came first, before Eakins' mental image had crystallized, and before the execution of his first oil sketch. The poses in the photographs are more spontaneous, while those of the painting are deliberately composed with a classical "severity". Although no photographic studies have survived that would suggest a more direct connection between the photographs and the painting, recent scholarship has proposed that marks incised onto the canvas and later covered by paint indicate that Eakins made use of light-projected photographs.
Eakins combined his studies into a final oil sketch in 1884, which became the basis for the finished painting. The basic composition remained unchanged, as all six men and the dog appeared in the sketch; however, Eakins, who usually adhered closely to his sketches when developing a final work, made several uncharacteristic alterations to the specific movements and positions of the figures. A friend and student, Charles Bregler, described the process:

The painting was commissioned in 1884 by <a href="Edward%20Hornor%20Coates">Edward Hornor Coates</a>, a Philadelphia businessman who chaired the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where Eakins taught. Coates intended to pay Eakins $800 ($  in dollars), which at the time was the largest commission Eakins had been offered.

Coates intended the painting for an exhibition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and it was shown at the Academy's exhibition in the fall of 1885. However, Coates rejected it as unrepresentative of Eakins' oeuvre. In a November 27, 1885 letter to Eakins, Coates reasoned:

It is not known precisely why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, it seems likely that Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire. Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would have surprised or shocked him. Rather, it seems certain that Coates would have recognized the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from <a href="Haverford%20College">Haverford College</a>, where Coates studied as an undergraduate. The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent. Coates chose to exchange "The Swimming Hole" for the "less controversial genre scene" of Eakins' "<a href="The%20Pathetic%20Song">The Pathetic Song</a>"—today housed in the <a href="Corcoran%20Gallery%20of%20Art">Corcoran Gallery of Art</a>— and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission.

On February 9, 1886, Eakins was forced to resign from the Academy because of his removal of a loincloth from a male model in a class where female students were present. In a letter to Coates on February 15 in which Eakins explained his reasons for resigning, he addressed the issue of nudity in his artwork:
Following its rejection by Coates, the painting remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the <a href="Provenance">historical record</a>—there is no further reference to the painting in any records from Eakins or his circle of friends during Eakins' lifetime. Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917.

In 1925, "The Swimming Hole" was purchased from the artist's widow by the community of <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a> for $750 ($ in dollars). Thereafter it was in the collection of the Fort Worth Art Association, the institutional predecessor of the <a href="Modern%20Art%20Museum%20of%20Fort%20Worth">Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth</a>, and was displayed in the city's public library. In 1990, the museum announced it intended to sell the painting to build an endowment for the purchase of contemporary art. A public outcry ensued, prompting the museum to search for a local buyer. Eventually, after tumultuous negotiations, the <a href="Amon%20Carter%20Museum">Amon Carter Museum of American Art</a> agreed to purchase "The Swimming Hole" for $10 million ($ in dollars).

Before its purchase by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, "The Swimming Hole" appears to have undergone seven different <a href="art%20restoration">conservatory treatments</a>. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the <a href="Glaze%20%28painting%20technique%29">glazes</a> and a drip mark, possibly caused by the splash of a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was <a href="lining%20of%20paintings">relined</a> by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Museum</a> performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, "The Swimming Hole" received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.

Following its purchase by the Amon Carter, in June 1993, Claire M. Barry and staff from the Amon Carter and the <a href="Kimbell%20Art%20Museum">Kimbell Art Museum</a>s began a major restoration of the painting. According to Barry, "The restoration revealed relatively little significant damage or deterioration not previously visible. Several layers of discolored varnish and overpaint were removed, exposing a rich and varied surface with brushwork ranging from the controlled, almost miniaturistic strokes forming the figures to the freer treatment of the landscape elements."

Much effort went into distinguishing the original glazes from those added during subsequent restorations. Previous retouches were removed and a natural resin varnish was applied. The painting's original frame, long missing, was located in 1992. It too was cleaned, restored, and reinstalled to the painting.

During the restoration, it was discovered that a long-standing ascription of the painting's date to 1883 was the result of a misinterpretation: the artist's original inscription of 1885 was painted in a <a href="fugitive%20pigments">fugitive</a> red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator to the earlier date.

"The Swimming Hole" represented the full range of Eakins' techniques and academic principles. He used life study, photography, wax studies, and landscape sketches to produce a work that manifested his interest in the human form. <a href="Lloyd%20Goodrich">Lloyd Goodrich</a> (1897–1987) believed the work was "Eakins' most masterful use of the nude", with the solidly conceived figures perfectly integrated into the landscape, an image of subtle tonal construction and one of the artist's "richest pieces of painting". Another biographer, <a href="William%20Innes%20Homer">William Innes Homer</a> (b. 1929), was more reserved and described the poses of the figures as rigidly academic. Homer found inconsistencies in paint quality and atmospheric effect, and wrote that the painting was unsuccessful in reconciling antique and naturalistic ideals. For him, "it is as though these nudes had been abruptly transplanted from the studio into nature".

Before the mid-19th century, the subject of the nude male figure in Western art had long been reserved for classical subject matter. In the 19th century, it was not unusual for boys and men to swim without clothing in public, but there was no precedent for this subject in American painting. Although there was an informal convention for multiple-figure compositions featuring female nudes, in America such paintings were exhibited in saloons rather than galleries; Eakins altered the gender and presented the subject as fine art. Viewed in a broader context, "The Swimming Hole" has been cited as one of the few 19th-century American paintings that "engages directly with a newly emerging European tradition"—that of the male bather. Eakins' picture, although not as stylistically progressive as the works of his French contemporaries, parallels the novel thematic direction taken by Bazille in "Summer Scene", <a href="Georges-Pierre%20Seurat">Georges Seurat</a> (1859–91) ("<a href="Bathers%20at%20Asni%C3%A8res">Bathers at Asnières</a>", 1884) and <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a> (1839–1906) in his numerous explorations of the subject.
Eakins' work influenced the subsequent generation of <a href="American%20realism">American realists</a>, particularly the artists of the <a href="Ashcan%20School">Ashcan School</a>. <a href="George%20Bellows">George Bellows</a>' (1882–1925) "Forty-two Kids", painted in 1907, bears obvious similarity to "The Swimming Hole", although Bellows' painting has been interpreted as a parody of the Eakins, and the many naked children of the title are playing in the urban <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> of New York City rather than in a rural setting. In a sentiment that reflected Eakins' philosophy, Bellows later explained his motivation for painting "Forty-two Kids": "Prizefighters and swimmers are the only types whose muscular action can be painted in the nude legitimately."

Eakins' widow's retitling of the picture after his death reinforced the popular association with the nostalgic sentiment of Riley's poem. More recently, the painting's subject has been compared to the poem "<a href="Song%20of%20Myself">Song of Myself</a>" by <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> (1819–92), particularly the section "", given the shared interest in the imagery of men bathing in the nude. Whitman may have provided inspiration: the celebration of nudity, which in Whitman's case was an open expression of his homosexuality, informs the art of both men. In 1895, one of Eakins' male students reminisced about "us Whitman fellows", which has been interpreted as a reference to homosexuality. "But for their marital status, however, virtually nothing concrete is known of the private realms or sexual propensities of any of the men depicted (in "The Swimming Hole"), with the exception of Eakins."

Although the painting has been viewed as a <a href="Platonic%20love">platonic</a> vision of the male nude seen unselfconsciously in a natural setting, by the 1970s some American writers were beginning to see Eakins' work, and specifically "The Swimming Hole", as having homoerotic implications. Critics have paid particular attention to the compositional prominence of the standing figure's buttocks, which has been interpreted as suggestive of "homoerotic interests". According to Jonathan Weinberg, "The Swimming Hole" marked the beginning of homoerotic imagery in American art. Eakins left a record simultaneously provocative and ambiguous on matters of sex. On the basis of the same visual evidence, that of the photographs, oil sketches, and the finished painting of swimmers, art historians have drawn markedly varying conclusions as to the artist's intent.

The Beatles: Rock Band

The Beatles: Rock Band is a 2009 <a href="music%20video%20game">music video game</a> developed by <a href="Harmonix">Harmonix</a>, published by <a href="MTV">MTV Games</a>, and distributed by <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>. It is the third major <a href="video%20game%20console">console</a> release in the "<a href="Rock%20Band">Rock Band</a>" music video game series, in which players can simulate the playing of <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> by using <a href="Game%20controller">controllers</a> shaped like musical instruments. "The Beatles: Rock Band" is the first band-centric game in the series, and it is centered on the popular English rock group <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>. The game features <a href="List%20of%20artists%20who%20have%20portrayed%20themselves%20in%20music%20games">virtual portrayals</a> of the four band members performing the songs throughout the band's history, including depictions of some of their famous <a href="List%20of%20The%20Beatles%27%20live%20performances">live performances</a>, as well as a number of "dreamscape" sequences for songs from the <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> recording sessions during <a href="The%20Beatles%27%20studio%20years">the group's studio years</a>. The game's soundtrack consists of 45 <a href="List%20of%20The%20Beatles%20songs">Beatles songs</a>; additional songs and albums by the Beatles were made available for the game as <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>.

The game was released internationally on September 9, 2009, coinciding with the release of new, remastered compact disc versions of <a href="The%20Beatles%20discography">the Beatles' albums</a>. It incorporates many of the gameplay features of the Rock Band series; however, it is not an <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a> for the "Rock Band" series and content for it and other "Rock Band" titles is not cross-compatible. Harmonix co-founder <a href="Alex%20Rigopulos">Alex Rigopulos</a> described the game as "a new, full game title production built from the ground up". Gameplay mechanics differ slightly from previous "Rock Band" games, including the addition of a three-part <a href="vocals">vocal</a> <a href="harmony">harmony</a> system. Subsequent games in the "Rock Band" series would reuse these new elements, including vocal harmonies.

The game was developed with the blessing and critical input of <a href="Apple%20Corps">Apple Corps</a>, including former Beatles <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a>, who both made public appearances supporting the game. <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>'s son <a href="Dhani%20Harrison">Dhani</a> helped to bridge discussion between Harmonix and Apple Corps, while <a href="Giles%20Martin">Giles Martin</a>, son of the Beatles' music producer <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>, ensured high-fidelity versions of the Beatles' songs would be available.

"The Beatles: Rock Band" was well received by the press, both as a genuine means of experiencing the music and history of the Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with more than half a million units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game genre and the video game industry recovery from the <a href="late-2000s%20recession">late-2000s recession</a>.

"The Beatles: Rock Band" allows players to perform simulated <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> by providing up to six players with the ability to play three different controllers modeled after music instruments (a <a href="guitar">guitar</a> controller for <a href="lead%20guitar">lead guitar</a> and <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> gameplay, a <a href="drum%20kit">drum</a> controller and up to three <a href="microphone">microphone</a>s for vocals). Players simulate the performance of rock music by using their controllers to play scrolling on-screen notes. For lead and bass guitar, this is accomplished by holding down colored buttons mimicking guitar <a href="fret">fret</a>s and pushing the controller's strum bar; for drums, this requires striking the matching colored drumhead, or stepping on the pedal to simulate playing bass drum notes. A "Lefty" mode allows left-handed people to play, by switching which colour the beats are given. When singing vocals, the player must sing in <a href="relative%20pitch">relative pitch</a> to the original vocals. A pitch indicator displays the singer's accuracy relative to the original pitch. For songs with multi-part vocals, players need only to stay in tone with the lead singer to score points and keep their performance meter up, but players earn additional scoring bonuses when they successfully complete phrases in harmony.

As in previous "Rock Band" games, successfully hitting the proper notes in sequence earns points for each player and boosts their "performance meter". Each separate instrument is given a level, defined by their instrument icon, and the average level is also displayed. If a player fails to match the notes, their performance meter drops. If the meter empties, that player is forced to drop out of play, which in turn causes the band's overall performance to drop. Any player to drop out can be "saved" if another player activates "Beatlemania" (referred to as "Overdrive" in other "Rock Band" titles), which is collected by successfully completing specially marked phrases. These phrases appear in white, and if the phrase is completed, the energy bar, displayed at the bottom of every track, fills by one quarter. Beatlemania can also be used to temporarily increase the amount of points the band earns. Activating Beatlemania is specific to each "instrument". For guitar, the controller must be temporarily shifted to an upright position; for drums, a special "cymbal" (Green, or red for "Lefty" mode) is hit; and for vocals, a noise must be registered by the microphone when prompted.

Some alterations to the "Rock Band" formula were made to preserve the sound of the Beatles' music. Audio cues that provide feedback on how well the band is doing, typically through the crowd cheering, singing along with the lyrics, or booing if the band is failing, are not included. The virtual band members are not booed off the stage if a player fails a song. Rather, the game simply cuts to a "song failed" menu with the option to try again. The song is restarted from the beginning. Variations on Overdrive/Beatlemania activation include the removal of player-controlled audio effects. While guitar players can use the controller's whammy bar on sustained marked note to collect more Beatlemania, this does not alter the sound of the note. There are also no freestyle drum <a href="fill%20%28music%29">fills</a> in the songs for activating Beatlemania; instead the player continues to perform the correct note sequence before being presented with a note to activate Beatlemania.

Throughout the song, players receive points for every note hit, and this is totalled up and displayed at the end of the song, along with a percentage of how many notes they hit, and a rating: 1 to 5 stars. If the score is close to perfect, normally requiring at least 98% of the notes, the rating is five 'gold' stars, instead of the normal bronze. The score is saved and shown alongside the song in the select screen; over time, as the song is replayed, it shows only the highest score.

All currently available "Rock Band" peripherals are compatible with their respective console version of "The Beatles: Rock Band". Similarly, peripherals designed for "The Beatles: Rock Band" are backward compatible with other "Rock Band" titles. Some controllers designed for "Guitar Hero" games will also work with "The Beatles: Rock Band".

Four new instrument peripherals modeled after those used by the Beatles members were introduced alongside the game: a <a href="Rickenbacker%20325">Rickenbacker 325</a> guitar, a <a href="Gretsch%206128">Gretsch Duo Jet</a> guitar, a <a href="H%C3%B6fner%20500/1">Höfner bass</a> and a <a href="Ludwig-Musser">Ludwig</a> drum set. These instrument controllers function similarly to <a href="Rock%20Band%202%23Instrument%20peripherals">the controllers designed for "Rock Band 2"</a>, with most alterations being purely aesthetic. A "Limited Edition" bundle of the game includes one Höfner bass guitar controller, one Ludwig-branded drum controller, a microphone, a microphone stand and Beatles-themed postcards. A second, less expensive bundle configuration contains peripherals first introduced with the original "Rock Band" game; this bundle does not contain a mic stand or postcards. The game was also released as a SingStar bundle with two microphones, and finally as a standalone release. The Rickenbacker and Gretsch guitar peripherals are sold separately.

"The Beatles: Rock Band" features gameplay modes similar to other "Rock Band" games, playable both locally and online. "Story" mode is similar to the "Career" mode of the first "Rock Band" game and follows a linear progression through the Beatles history. Optional challenges are available in each story "chapter", tasking players to complete every song in a specific chapter as a single performance. By earning high score ratings for songs or challenges, players will unlock photographs and video clips of the Beatles taken from the Apple Corps' archive to provide "splashes of history". One such unlockable "prize" is an edited version of .

Up to six players can play any song in the game cooperatively via "Solo/Band Quickplay" mode. Two players can also play against one another in "Rock Band"'s two competitive modes: "Tug of War", where two players perform alternating sections of songs to outdo the other's performance, and "Score Duel", where each player simultaneously plays the entirety of a song while trying to accumulate the highest score. Tug of War allows players to choose individual difficulty levels, while Score Duel requires that both players play at the same difficulty level. Both competitive modes require that players use the same type of instrument.

Several "Training" modes are available for "The Beatles: Rock Band", including tutorials for both guitar/bass and drums. Practice modes are instrument-specific and allow players to practice entire songs or individual sections of songs. Guitar, bass, and drum practice modes allow players to slow the tempos of songs; vocal practice mode helps to emphasize the selected harmony portion of the vocals by adding a generated <a href="waveform">waveform</a> sound to the selected harmony line in tune with the lyrics. There are also two drum training modes called "Drum Lessons" and "Beatle Beats".

Before playing, a difficulty has to be selected: easy, medium, hard or expert. Expert is a match of the original notes; hard has some note-heavy drum rolls and other difficult or fast notes removed; medium takes away the orange notes (for guitar and bass) and anything else considered tricky. Easy is designed for new players, and gives an easy rhythm for those to settle into the game. However, there are too few notes for it to feel like they're playing the actual tune from the song. A "No Fail" mode has been carried over from "Rock Band 2" and is accessible from the band members selection screen rather than from the game's main menu. This mode lets players continue playing even if their performance meter hits rock bottom. In addition, No Fail mode is automatically enabled for any player who chooses the "Easy" difficulty.

Prior to "The Beatles: Rock Band", no song by The Beatles, nor a cover of a Beatles song, had been featured in any "Guitar Hero" or "Rock Band" title, whether as disc-based or downloadable content. The idea of "The Beatles: Rock Band" came about during a chance encounter between MTV president Van Toffler and <a href="Dhani%20Harrison">Dhani Harrison</a>, son of <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>, at a luncheon sponsored by <a href="Robert%20Earl%20%28businessman%29">Robert Earl</a> during the 2006 Christmas holiday, shortly after MTV's acquisition of Harmonix. Dhani, having been familiar with the "<a href="Guitar%20Hero">Guitar Hero</a>" franchise and learning of the recent acquisition and plans for "<a href="Rock%20Band">Rock Band</a>" from Toffler, suggested a game based on the Beatles. Though both Dhani and Toffler considered the concept an unlikely possibility, their meeting nonetheless spurred Dhani into further discussions with Harmonix's president, <a href="Alex%20Rigopulos">Alex Rigopulos</a>. At the same time, Dhani helped to introduce the "Rock Band" concept to <a href="Apple%20Corps">Apple Corps</a>, the music production company created by the Beatles, and its key shareholders <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo Starr</a> and <a href="Yoko%20Ono">Yoko Ono</a>. Initial meetings were arranged with the shareholders using an early prototype of the game to garner their interest in the title. One stipulation that the Apple Corps shareholders required of Harmonix was that the game feature songs spanning the band's entire career. Harmonix subsequently created a more complete demonstration that used examples of music and artwork that they envisioned for the game. The five-song demo, which included an early build for "<a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Sun">Here Comes the Sun</a>", was finished in February 2008. It was used to gain approval from McCartney, Starr, Ono and <a href="Olivia%20Harrison">Olivia Harrison</a>, effectively bringing them aboard the project as creative partners.

The Apple Corps shareholders considered "The Beatles: Rock Band" a new way to introduce the band's music to the public. They approved of the songs and venues that would appear in the game, and provided feedback on the artwork, character representations, and storyboards for animation sequences. McCartney and Starr fact-checked certain anecdotes relating to The Beatles while Ono and Harrison provided insight on their late husbands' performances and lyrics. At the developer's request, Ono visited the Harmonix offices late in development to provide critical feedback on several visual elements. In a <a href="Wired%20News">Wired</a> article, MTV's senior vice president of the games division Paul DeGooyer was quoted saying "She gave the designers hell", with Harmonix head Alex Rigopulos adding, "She really held our feet to the fire". DeGooyer and Rigopulos clarified the statement soon after the article had been published, asserting that the visit was "a high point of the two-year development process" and "has been mischaracterized by some in the press".

Though "The Beatles: Rock Band" aims to present a visual and musical history of the Beatles, the game does not attempt to replicate periods of turmoil between the band members. Rather, it presents a "fantasy version" of the Beatles to better serve the entertainment purposes of the video game. For example, Starr was estranged from the rest of the band during periods of recording for "<a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">The Beatles</a>" (commonly referred to as the White Album). Thus, he did not perform on certain songs, such as "<a href="Back%20in%20the%20U.S.S.R.">Back in the U.S.S.R.</a>" or "Dear Prudence" In the game, however, the Ringo Starr character plays drums during the animated performance of the song.

Preparing the Beatles' songs for "Rock Band" was a significant technical challenge for Harmonix. The band's earlier songs, recorded on <a href="Multitrack%20recording">two- and four-track</a> equipment, needed to be reworked into a multitrack format that is essential in providing feedback to players. Each of the game's four instrument parts need to have their own "stems"—for example, when a player misplays a note from the guitar track, the guitar audio for the song will be temporarily quieted, leaving the other instruments' audio unaffected. Such isolated tracks were not available through the new 2009 remasters, so the team started with the original <a href="master%20recording">master recording</a>s.

The development team was able to bring <a href="Giles%20Martin">Giles Martin</a> aboard as the game's music producer. Martin had recently completed co-production on the 2006 "<a href="Love%20%28The%20Beatles%20album%29">Love</a>" project with his father <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a> and was already familiar with the Beatles catalogue. Through that project, Martin created digital back-up copies of all the original tapes, which aided his work on "The Beatles: Rock Band". Using audio forensics software, Martin and his team were able to extract the audio of individual instruments by isolating sounds at certain frequencies with digital filters, thus assuring multitrack capabilities for the Beatles' master recordings. This process, conducted at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studio</a> 52 with the help of Paul Hicks and other Abbey Road recording engineers, reportedly took months to complete.

During the game's development, Harmonix only used low-fidelity versions of the remasters, which were sufficient for programming and note charting; Apple Corps feared that the leak of any high-fidelity remastered track from Abbey Road studios would lead to the unauthorized use of samples of the Beatles' music in remixes. High-fidelity versions of the songs were not implemented until the final publishing of the game. Harmonix performed very little additional remixing upon receipt of these remasters; in some cases, three different guitar parts—lead, solo, and rhythm—were brought into a single cohesive guitar part, slightly raising the volume of the specific guitar track that was used in note tracking to make it easier for the player to follow in the game. The ability for up to three players to sing vocal harmonies, a feature not present in previous "Rock Band" games, was designed and implemented as an optional feature so as not to be overwhelming to players.

While live recordings of songs, such as "Paperback Writer" at <a href="Nippon%20Budokan">the Budokan</a>, were available, Martin believed some of these renditions were sloppy and would not be enjoyable to play. Instead, he took the studio versions and added audio effects from the live performances to create a "live concert" ambiance. In several instances, the team also opted to slightly restructure the endings to certain songs, particularly those that <a href="Fade%20%28audio%20engineering%29">fade out</a>. Differences in editing between the album versions and in-game versions of songs continued with the release of <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>, notably the inclusion of a once-missing final chord at the end of the "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>" closer "<a href="Her%20Majesty%20%28song%29">Her Majesty</a>".

Dhani Harrison has stated the game will include "stuff that has never been heard, never been released". Some of the new material includes band chatter and instrument tunes taken from recorded performances. This audio plays during the loading screens or bookends certain songs. Within the Abbey Road studio, Martin recreated some of the incidental sound, played through speakers but capturing the acoustics of the studio room. In one instance, for example, this process involved recording four people miming the act of drinking tea. The entirety of the game's credits are also made up of this band chatter and studio takes.

In coordination with the art team, sound programmers attempted to realistically map the game's note tracks relative to the real performances by the Beatles. For guitar parts, colored notes were selected not necessarily to match tonally with the music, but to replicate the movement and finger positioning used by the original performers. These were then matched against ten different strumming animations to be used for the virtual depictions of the guitarists. The "Expert" difficulty drum tracks attempt to match every single drum beat that is performed in a song, including some peculiar rhythms brought about by Starr's <a href="ambidexterity">ambidextrous</a> drumming habits. Vocals were slowed down and broken into phonetic segments, allowing the art team to determine the appropriate facial movement for the virtual characters to go along with the lyrics.

Art assets were created with help of Apple Corps, with Harmonix developers gaining access to their unique archive as well as personal photos from the shareholders. Apple Corps had strict desires for how the Beatles were to appear; art director <a href="Ryan%20Lesser">Ryan Lesser</a> noted that the art team's earliest character designs were met with "brutal" responses from Apple, but that this feedback was essential in developing the visual styles of the band. In addition to Apple Corps' material, Harmonix designers watched the eight-part "<a href="The%20Beatles%20Anthology%20%28film%29">The Beatles Anthology</a>" on a weekly basis for further reference on the band. These materials were meticulously reviewed to replicate the outfits that the Beatles wore for each of their concerts, as well as the instruments they used for recordings and live performances.

Although McCartney had hoped technology would allow the virtual band members to appear in hyper-realistic detail, Harmonix opted to start with more exaggerated, cartoon-like designs, gradually scaling them back to appear more realistic. Animation for the Beatles characters was aided by <a href="motion%20capture">motion capture</a> provided by Beatles <a href="tribute%20act">tribute bands</a>. Dhani Harrison also assisted with modeling for character animation in the game.

The team designed venues that represented parts of the Beatles' history in order to create an atmosphere of authenticity. For example, the set of "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>" was recreated from photographs and videos, including a rare color photograph in Apple's collection that showed the yellow tint used to enhance the video as shown on black-and-white television sets. <a href="The%20Cavern%20Club">The Cavern Club</a>, <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a>, <a href="Nippon%20Budokan">Budokan</a>, <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> and the rooftop of the <a href="Savile%20Row%23The%20Beatles">Apple Corps Headquarters</a> also appear as venues in the game. Fashions of the 1960s were researched to properly apply them to the various virtual crowds at these locations.

Twenty of the game's on-disc songs are associated with "dreamscape" sequences in conjunction with the Abbey Road venue, representing the in their later years. Animation sequences for songs linked with dreamscapes feature abstract or representative scenery. For example, the sequence for "<a href="Octopus%27s%20Garden">Octopus's Garden</a>" takes place in an underwater reef, while the sequence for "<a href="I%20Am%20the%20Walrus">I Am the Walrus</a>" is reminiscent of the band's psychedelic performance of the song in the 1967 film "<a href="Magical%20Mystery%20Tour%20%28film%29">Magical Mystery Tour</a>". The concept of dreamscapes evolved from brainstorming sessions between Harmonix and Apple Corps.; as "Rock Band" was a game that celebrated the performance of music, simply portraying The Beatles performing in the Abbey Road studio was not enough, and the dreamscape sequences provided a way to surpass that. While the art team used existing materials as reference, the Apple Corps. shareholders encouraged the team to interpret the songs in new ways. For inspiration, Harmonix looked to <a href="Cirque%20du%20Soleil">Cirque du Soleil</a>'s approach in interpreting The Beatles catalogue for the "<a href="Love%20%28Cirque%20du%20Soleil%29">Love</a>" stage show. <a href="Storyboard">Storyboard</a>s for these animated sequences were created using both hand-drawn and 2D computer-generated art. In some cases, the computer-generated elements used in storyboarding were kept as elements in the final venue, such as computer-generated blades of grass in the "Here Comes the Sun" sequence.

The game includes heavily stylized opening and ending cinematics produced in part by Pete Candeland of <a href="Passion%20Pictures">Passion Pictures</a>, with help from animator Robert Valley and background visuals from Alberto Mielgo. Candeland, who is known for his work animating <a href="Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a> videos, also produced the opening cinematics for both the original "Rock Band" and "Rock Band 2". Within two and a half minutes, the opening cinematic provides a brief representative history of the band interspersed with numerous references to songs by The Beatles, followed by more metaphorical scenes reflecting their studio albums. Prior to each of the chapters in the game's Story mode, the game presents short introductory animations; these animations were prepared by graphic design studio <a href="MK12">MK12</a>, who had previously worked on the opening cinematics for movies such as "<a href="Stranger%20than%20Fiction%20%282006%20film%29">Stranger than Fiction</a>" and "<a href="Quantum%20of%20Solace">Quantum of Solace</a>".

"The Beatles: Rock Band" was first revealed on October 30, 2008 when Harmonix, MTV Games, and <a href="Viacom">Viacom</a> announced an exclusive agreement with <a href="Apple%20Corps">Apple Corps, Ltd.</a> to produce the standalone title. Prior to this announcement, industry rumours reported that both Harmonix/MTV Games and <a href="Activision">Activision</a> were vying for The Beatles songs, the latter for the "<a href="Guitar%20Hero">Guitar Hero</a>" franchise. The agreement was the result of 17 months of discussions. John Drake, PR spokesperson for Harmonix, stated that Apple Corps "respected and appreciated what Harmonix does creatively for rhythm games" as part of the success of the deal. <a href="Eversheds">Eversheds</a>, the legal firm working for Apple Corps. for both "The Beatles: Rock Band" and the <a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28film%29%23Cancelled%203D%20remake">abandoned remake</a> of "<a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28film%29">Yellow Submarine</a>" by <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a>, stated that it took six months to complete the complex agreements and paperwork over the copyrights, trademarks, and publishing issues. Viacom's deal with The Beatles' property owners includes <a href="royalties">royalties</a> with a guaranteed minimum of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>10 million and upwards of $40 million based on initial sales projections, an amount that chairman Martin Bendier of Sony/ATV Publishing has stated to be "not even comparable to anything that has been done before". The licensing of the Beatles' work for the game was considered a critical step in the later negotiations and availability of the band's songs on iTunes about a year after the game's release. A further complication arose about a year after the game's release; <a href="Chrysalis%20Group">Chrysalis Group</a> legally challenged EMI over a previous 1965 agreement whereby EMI would pay Chrysalis up to 1.5% of royalties on sales of the Beatles' records, and claimed that they are owned <a href="GBP">₤</a>500,000 for the two million units sold of "The Beatles: Rock Band". EMI asserts that the video game format would not be covered under the concept of a "record" from the 1965 agreement.

The game was released internationally on September 9, 2009. The game's release was planned to coincide with the release of the new, remastered CD versions of The Beatles albums. Footage from "The Beatles: Rock Band" was revealed for the first time on April 18, 2009, during Paul McCartney's performance at the <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival</a>. McCartney continued to utilize gameplay footage during his concert performances while touring during the months prior to the game's release. The game was formally showcased on June 1, 2009 at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202009">E3 2009</a>. Presented by Harmonix at the beginning of the <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> press conference, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr briefly took the stage to discuss the games. Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also made a brief appearance. The game's E3 demo booth was modeled as a recreation of Abbey Road Studios.
The game's official website was revealed early in 2009, showing only images of the Abbey Road studios and the game's release date. Over time, images of the Beatles' favored instruments appeared in the studio as their game peripheral replicas were announced. On May 5, 2009, the website was updated to include general information and promotional media. Customers who pre-ordered the game from selected vendors received an access code to view exclusive images and media on the site before it was eventually made public.

In August 2009, VH1 Classic aired music videos from the TV special "<a href="Around%20The%20Beatles">Around The Beatles</a>" (1964), "<a href="Help%21%20%28film%29">Help!</a>" (1965), and a music video of the "<a href="Birthday%20%28The%20Beatles%20song%29">Birthday</a>" gameplay footage, promoting the launch of "The Beatles Rock Band" online store. This store was also launched by several segments held on the <a href="Shopping%20channel">home shopping channel</a>, <a href="QVC">QVC</a>, for the game, the Beatles' remastered albums, and other related products; several Harmonix employees were present to demonstrate the game.

A video advertisement for the game featuring the song "<a href="Come%20Together">Come Together</a>" premiered on August 28, 2009. The spot features a live action recreation of the iconic "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>" album cover; as The Beatles cross the road, a crowd of people follow, some of whom are carrying the game's controllers. The advertisement was directed by Marcel Langenegger, who worked with Apple Corps and Giles Martin to build an Abbey Road set at a Hollywood studio, and to blend archival footage of The Beatles into the video. <a href="Body%20double">Body double</a>s, vetted by the Apple Corps shareholders, appear in some shots. On September 8, 2009, <a href="Dhani%20Harrison">Dhani Harrison</a> appeared as a guest on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien">The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien</a>" to promote the game. Harrison and O'Brien (along with "Tonight Show" web manager <a href="Aaron%20Bleyaert">Aaron Bleyaert</a> and <a href="Max%20Weinberg%20and%20The%20Tonight%20Show%20Band">The Tonight Show Band</a> member Mark Pender) performed the song "Birthday" at the close of the show.

The game includes 45 songs from 12 of <a href="The%20Beatles%20discography">The Beatles albums</a> recorded during their 1963–1970 tenure with <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI Records</a>. With the exception of "<a href="Magical%20Mystery%20Tour">Magical Mystery Tour</a>", track information is based on the United Kingdom-released versions of the albums. Six non-album singles and the <a href="mashup%20%28music%29">mashup</a> track "<a href="Within%20You%20Without%20You">Within You Without You</a>/<a href="Tomorrow%20Never%20Knows">Tomorrow Never Knows</a>" from the 2006 <a href="remix%20album">remix album</a> "<a href="Love%20%28The%20Beatles%20album%29">Love</a>" have also been included. Selections of the soundtrack are under license from <a href="Sony/ATV%20Music%20Publishing">Sony/ATV Music Publishing</a> Company. Although <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, who owned 50% of the publishing rights to the Beatles songs through Sony/ATV, <a href="Death%20of%20Michael%20Jackson">died in June 2009</a>, the sale of his estate did not affect the songs or the release schedule of "The Beatles: Rock Band", according to Harmonix.

Additional songs are available for the game as <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>. The song "<a href="All%20You%20Need%20Is%20Love">All You Need Is Love</a>" was first to appear as downloadable content, proceeds from which ($1.40 of the $2 song cost) are donated to <a href="Doctors%20Without%20Borders">Doctors Without Borders</a>. The song was initially made available as an exclusive for Xbox 360 on the same day the game was released. Within two weeks of the game's release, "All You Need Is Love" was announced by Microsoft and MTV to be the fastest-selling downloadable song across any of the "Rock Band" platforms, with tens of thousands of downloads; The song had been downloaded more than 100,000 times by the end of September, and by February 2010, had generated over $200,000 for the charity. The song is now available for download on the Wii and PlayStation 3.

Full albums were also made available as downloadable content; the remaining songs from "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>", "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>", and "<a href="Rubber%20Soul">Rubber Soul</a>" have since been released on the consoles' respective store services. While there is potential for the entire Beatles catalogue to be made available, this will be unlikely, according to John Drake of Harmonix. Drake identified the costly development process as a potentially prohibitive factor: "Every time we do one song, it's not like "Rock Band" where we wait for the masters to come in and just author them ... its like, send people to Abbey Road, use the original tape, separate them out ... it costs thousands of dollars." Drake asserted that Harmonix would take sales of the currently announced albums into consideration before continuing development of downloadable content. Harmonix's Foster stated that solo acts from the Beatles' members will not be included as downloadable content for "The Beatles: Rock Band"; however, he did not rule out the possibility of these acts appearing in other "Rock Band" games. A three pack of songs from Paul McCartney's 2009 live album, "<a href="Good%20Evening%20New%20York%20City">Good Evening New York City</a>", was made available for the main "Rock Band" series on 5 January 2010. John Lennon's "<a href="Imagine%20%28John%20Lennon%20song%29">Imagine</a>" is a part of the "<a href="Rock%20Band%203">Rock Band 3</a>" soundtrack, with the full "<a href="Imagine%20%28John%20Lennon%20album%29">Imagine</a>" album arriving later as downloadable content in celebration of Lennon's 70th birthday. A pack featuring Paul McCartney's band <a href="Wings%20%28band%29">Wings</a> was also released as DLC for "Rock Band 3" on December 28, 2010.

The respective downloadable content for "The Beatles: Rock Band" and other currently available "Rock Band" titles are not cross-compatible. Furthermore, the songs contained on "the Beatles" disc are not <a href="Downloadable%20rock%20band%20songs">exportable</a> to other games in the "Rock Band" series. Harmonix's Chris Foster cited the game's new vocal harmony feature as well as the unique song-specific dreamscape animations as reasons for the lack of exportability to other "Rock Band" games. John Drake stated that the developer had a responsibility to treat the Beatles' songs as "iconic", and keep its music separated from other songs. 

On May 5, 2016, Harmonix ceased downloadable content distribution for "The Beatles: Rock Band" due to the license expiration, though those that had already purchased the tracks would be able to redownload them in the future.

"The Beatles: Rock Band" received high praise from several media outlets upon release. Regarding the game's cross-generational appeal, Chad Sapieha of "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" suggested that the game would spark a new wave of <a href="Beatlemania">Beatlemania</a>, while Seth Schiesel of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called it "nothing less than a cultural watershed". Some critics hailed the title as landmark of the music game genre; Randy Lewis of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described the game as a "quantum leap forward for the music video game", while Johnny Minkley of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> called it "the new standard by which all band-specific game experiences will be judged".

Described as an "interactive Beatles experience", the game was considered to bring players closer to the band through both technical and emotional means. By playing each song's respective note chart, players were said to have a better appreciation for the structure and complexity of the compositions and performances by the Beatles. Emotionally, critics commented on the sentimental values of the game's career mode, recalling the history of the band. Critics were mostly positive concerning the visual and aural elements of the game; <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a>'s Abbie Heppe considered it a preferable package to the newly remastered albums, citing song-specific animations as a strong feature. The dreamscape sequences in particular were likened to live performances, praised as "dazzling" and "evocative". However, Schiesel remarked that due to the players' concentration on the note tracks, the animations "serve mostly to entertain onlookers rather than the players themselves". Heppe observed that the color saturation of the background elements as well as the "Beatlemania" visual effects can sometimes contrast poorly with the scrolling notes, making it difficult to play. After the game's release, Harmonix lead designer Chris Foster acknowledged that the visuals can be "too overwhelming for [some players] at moments". The implementation of three-part harmonies, expressed by some to be the most significant addition to the series, was well received.

Critics primarily found fault with the game's length, as the bulk of the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing that there would be a market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with "Rock Band" or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> considered that in attaching the "Rock Band" name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous "Rock Band" titles, which "The Beatles: Rock Band" failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of "Rock Band" would consider the songs in "The Beatles: Rock Band" to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for newcomers to the series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as <a href="Pete%20Best">Pete Best</a> or collaborators such as <a href="Billy%20Preston">Billy Preston</a> or <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.

"<a href="PC%20World%20%28magazine%29">PC World</a>" listed "The Beatles: Rock Band" as their ninth Best Product of 2009. The game won for Best Music Game on the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a> 2009. The game won the Family Game of the Year and was nominated for the Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack 13th Annual <a href="Interactive%20Achievement%20Award">Interactive Achievement Award</a>s from the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a>.

"The Beatles: Rock Band" is currently being used as a finale for each performance of the 125th anniversary season of the <a href="Boston%20Pops%20Orchestra">Boston Pops Orchestra</a>; the orchestra leads the audience in a sing-along to several songs by the Beatles played by the orchestra but synchronized to the visuals from the game.

"The Beatles: Rock Band" was well received at the 2009 E3 Convention, and was named the Best Music/Rhythm Game by <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>, and <a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>; the game was also nominated for Best Music or Rhythm game by the <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a> and <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. The opening animation video, released at the same time as E3, was praised by the press. It has been described as "surreal" by both the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" and <a href="Boing%20Boing">Boing Boing</a>'s Offworld blog. <a href="fps%20magazine">Frames Per Second</a> called it "simply stunning", and the "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" blog PopWatch described it as "damned spiffy". The second half of the video, where <a href="traditional%20animation">traditional animation</a> gives way to a combination of computer-aided <a href="animation%232D%20animation">2D</a> and <a href="3D%20animation">3D scenery</a> has been described as "a mashup of <a href="Peter%20Max">Peter Max</a> and the <a href="Unreal%20Engine">Unreal Engine</a>... chaperoned by the ghost of <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>" by the <a href="Entertainment%20Consumers%20Association">ECA</a>'s GameCulture blog. The opening video was awarded the 2009 British Animation Award for "Best Commissioned Animation" and won a Silver <a href="Clio%20Awards">Clio Award</a> in the field of "Television/Cinema/Digital Technique".

According to Viacom CEO Philipe Dauman, one quarter of "The Beatles: Rock Band" inventory was sold during its first week of release, exceeding their expectations. Based on current sales projections, Dauman claimed that the Limited Edition Premium bundle of the game could be sold out by November. Dauman attributed some success of the game's sales to the price reduction of the PlayStation 3, which occurred a few weeks before the release of "The Beatles: Rock Band".

"The Beatles: Rock Band" was the fourth high-selling game across all platforms in its first week of release in the United Kingdom. According to the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, "The Beatles: Rock Band" sold 595,000 units across all offerings for the Xbox 360, Wii, and PlayStation 3 versions during September 2009, respectively in the United States, making the game the 5th, 10th, and 20th top sellers for the month, respectively; only "Guitar Hero 5" for the Xbox 360 placed in the top 10 titles selling 210,800 units. Total sales across all platforms in the United States was 595,000 units with revenue between <a href="USD">$</a>59 and , and was the second highest revenue-generating game behind "" driven by sales of the bundled units. Though MTV Games was pleased with the sales performance of the game, the sales numbers fell short of the projected values by industry analysts, attributing it to the slow recovery of the video game market from the <a href="late-2000s%20recession">late-2000s recession</a>. As of December 2009, Harmonix has stated that the game has sold more than copies worldwide. NPD Group data through the end of 2009 reported North American sales of the game at 1.18 and . In considering the comparison of "The Beatles: Rock Band" sales in North America to the nearly units sold by "Guitar Hero 5", the magazine "<a href="Advertising%20Age">Advertising Age</a>" identified the ability of MTV Games and Harmonix to leverage the music of the Beatles and their other partners in novel and experimental methods among more traditional means. In an October 2010 interview Alex Rigopulos claimed that "The Beatles: Rock Band" sales were "respectable", having sold "well over three million units", though had not exceeded sales of other "Rock Band" games.
