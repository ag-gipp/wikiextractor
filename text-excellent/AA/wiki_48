Greater crested tern

The greater crested tern ("Thalasseus bergii"), also called crested tern or swift tern, is a <a href="tern">tern</a> in the family <a href="Laridae">Laridae</a> that nests in dense colonies on coastlines and islands in the tropical and subtropical <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>. Its five <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> breed in the area from <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> around the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> to the central <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, all populations <a href="bird%20migration">dispersing</a> widely from the breeding range after nesting. This large tern is closely related to the <a href="Royal%20tern">royal</a> and <a href="lesser%20crested%20tern">lesser crested tern</a>s, but can be distinguished by its size and bill colour.

The greater crested tern has grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow bill, and a shaggy black crest that recedes in winter. Its young have a distinctive appearance, with strongly patterned grey, brown and white plumage, and rely on their parents for food for several months after they have <a href="fledge">fledge</a>d. Like all members of the genus "Thalasseus", the greater crested tern feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments; the male offers fish to the female as part of the courtship ritual.

This is an adaptable species that has learned to follow fishing boats for jettisoned <a href="bycatch">bycatch</a>, and to use unusual nest sites such as the roofs of buildings and artificial islands in <a href="salt%20evaporation%20pond">salt pans</a> and <a href="sewage%20treatment">sewage works</a>. Its eggs and young are taken by <a href="gull">gull</a>s and <a href="ibis">ibis</a>es, and human activities such as fishing, shooting and egg harvesting have caused local population declines. There are no global conservation concerns for this bird, which has a stable total population of more than 500,000 individuals.

The terns, family Sternidae, are small to medium-sized seabirds closely related to the <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a>s and <a href="skua">skua</a>s. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings (which give them a fast, buoyant flight), a deeply forked tail and short legs. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap that is reduced or flecked with white in the winter.

The greater crested tern was originally described as "Sterna bergii" by German naturalist <a href="Martin%20Lichtenstein">Martin Lichtenstein</a> in 1823, but was moved to its current genus, "<a href="Thalasseus">Thalasseus</a>", after <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l <a href="DNA">DNA</a> studies confirmed that the three main head patterns shown by terns (no black cap, black cap, black cap with a white forehead) corresponded to distinct <a href="clade">clade</a>s.

The greater crested tern's closest relatives within its genus appear to be the <a href="lesser%20crested%20tern">lesser crested tern</a> ("T. bengalensis"), and the <a href="royal%20tern">royal tern</a> ("T. maximus"). The DNA study did not include the <a href="Critically%20endangered%20species">critically endangered</a> <a href="Chinese%20crested%20tern">Chinese crested tern</a> ("T. bernsteini") but, as that bird was formerly considered to be <a href="conspecificity">conspecific</a> with the greater crested tern as a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of the subspecies "T. b. cristatus", it is presumably also very closely related.

The <a href="genus">generic name</a> of the greater crested tern is derived from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "Thalassa", "sea", and the species <a href="epithet">epithet</a> "bergii" commemorates <a href="Karl%20Heinrich%20Bergius">Carl Heinrich Bergius</a>, a <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n pharmacist and botanist who collected the first specimens of this tern near <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>.

The greater crested tern has about five geographical races, differing mainly in the colour of the upperparts and bill. These are listed below in <a href="taxonomic%20sequence">taxonomic sequence</a>. A similar number of other potential subspecies have been proposed, but are not considered valid.

The greater crested tern is a large tern with a long () yellow bill, black legs, and a glossy black crest that is noticeably shaggy at its rear. The breeding adult of the <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate subspecies</a> "T. b. bergii" is long, with a wing-span; this subspecies weighs 325–397 <a href="gram">g</a> (11.4–14.0 <a href="ounce">oz</a>). The forehead and the underparts are white, the back and inner wings are dusky-grey. In winter, the upperparts plumage wears to a paler grey, and the crown of the head becomes white, merging at the rear into a peppered black crest and mask.

The adults of both sexes are identical in appearance, but juvenile birds are distinctive, with a head pattern like the winter adult, and upperparts strongly patterned in grey, brown, and white; the closed wings appear to have dark bars. After <a href="moult">moult</a>ing, the young terns resemble the adult, but still have a variegated wing pattern with a dark bar on the inner <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s.
The northern subspecies "T. b. velox" and "T. b. thalassina" are in breeding plumage from May to September or October, whereas the relevant period for the two southern African races is from December to April. For "T. b. cristata", the moult timing depends on location; birds from Australia and <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a> are in breeding plumage from September to about April, but those in <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, China and <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> have this appearance from February to June or July.

The royal tern is similar in size to this species, but has a heavier build, broader wings, a paler back and a blunter, more orange bill. The greater crested often associates with the lesser crested tern, but is 25% larger than the latter, with a proportionately longer bill, longer and heavier head, and bulkier body. Lesser crested tern has an orange-tinted bill, and in immature plumage it is much less variegated than greater crested.

The greater crested tern is highly <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocal</a>, especially at its breeding grounds. The territorial advertising call is a loud, raucous, <a href="crow">crow-like</a> '. Other calls include a ' given at the nest by anxious or excited birds, and a hard "" in flight.

The greater crested tern occurs in tropical and warm temperate coastal parts of the Old World from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and Australia. The subspecies "T. b. bergii" and "T. b. enigma" breed in Southern Africa from Namibia to <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, and possibly on islands around Madagascar. There is then a break in the breeding distribution of this species until <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> and the Red Sea, and another discontinuity further east in southern <a href="India">India</a>.

The greater crested tern breeds on many islands in the Indian Ocean including <a href="Aldabra">Aldabra</a> and Etoile in the Seychelles, the <a href="Chagos%20Archipelago">Chagos Archipelago</a>, and <a href="Rodrigues%20%28island%29">Rodrigues.</a> There are colonies on numerous Pacific islands, including <a href="Kiribati">Kiribati</a>, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>, the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a> and the <a href="Tuamotus">Tuamotus</a>.

The nests are located on low‑lying sandy, rocky, or coral islands, sometimes amongst stunted shrubs, often without any shelter at all. When not breeding, the greater crested tern will roost or rest on open shores, less often on boats, pilings, harbour buildings and raised salt mounds in lagoons. It is rarely seen on tidal creeks or inland waters.

All populations of greater crested tern disperse after breeding. When Southern African birds leave colonies in Namibia and <a href="Western%20Cape%20Province">Western Cape Province</a>, most adults move east to the Indian Ocean coastline of South Africa. Many young birds also travel east, sometimes more than , but others move northwards along the western coast. "T. b. thalassina" winters on the east African coast north to <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> and Somalia and may move as far south as Durban. Populations of "T. b. velox" breeding from the Persian Gulf eastwards appear to be sedentary or dispersive rather than truly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, but those breeding in the Red Sea winter south along the east African coast to Kenya. "T. b. cristata" mostly stays within of its colonies, but some birds wander up to around . This species has occurred as a vagrant to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, and <a href="Israel">Israel</a>.

The greater crested tern breeds in <a href="seabird%20colony">colonies</a>, often in association with other seabirds. It is <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> and the pair bond is maintained through the year and sometimes in consecutive breeding seasons. The colony size is related to the abundance of <a href="pelagic%20fish">pelagic fish</a> prey, and the largest documented colony, with 13,000 to 15,000 pairs, is in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Carpentaria">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> in northern Australia, a region which also supports major colonies of other seabirds. Since nesting in this area follows the summer <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>al flooding, it is presumably a response to fish stocks rising, probably due to river run-off providing extra nutrient to the Gulf. This tern does not show <a href="philopatry">site fidelity</a>, frequently changing its nest site from year to year, sometimes by more than .

A male greater crested tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting, and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory. If the intruder is another male, it retaliates in kind, and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent. A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male's aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.

The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping ground. It is often unlined, but sometimes includes stones or <a href="cuttlefish">cuttlefish</a> bones. One, sometimes two, eggs are laid and <a href="avian%20incubation">incubated</a> by both parents for 25 to 30 days prior to hatching. The eggs are cream with blackish streaks. Egg laying is synchronised within a breeding colony and more tightly so within sub-colonies. Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched chicks, but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two days-old, shortly before they begin to wander from the nest. The <a href="precocial">precocial</a> chicks, which are very pale with black speckling, are brooded and fed by both parents, but may gather in crèches when older. The young terns fledge after 38 to 40 days, but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until they are about four months old.

In South Africa, this species has adapted to breeding on the roofs of building, sometimes with <a href="Hartlaub%27s%20gull">Hartlaub's gull</a>, which also shares the more typical nesting sites of the nominate race. In 2000, 7.5% of the population of this subspecies bred on roofs. Artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works have also recently been colonised by this adaptable seabird.

Adult terns have few predators, but in Namibia immature birds are often robbed of their food by <a href="kelp%20gull">kelp gull</a>s, and that species, along with Hartlaub's gull, <a href="silver%20gull">silver gull</a> and <a href="sacred%20ibis">sacred ibis</a>, has been observed feeding on eggs or nestlings, especially when colonies are disturbed. Smaller subcolonies with a relatively larger numbers of nests located on the perimeter are subject to more predation. In Australia, predation by cats and dogs, and occasional deaths by shooting or collisions with cars, wires or light-towers have been documented.

Commercial fisheries can have both positive and negative effects on the greater crested tern. Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler discards provide extra food, and huge population increases in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large prawn trawl fishery. Conversely, <a href="Seine%20fishing%23Purse%20seine">purse-seine</a> fishing reduces the available food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of great crested terns breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by purse-seine fishing. Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with trawl warps, trapped in trawls or discarded gear, or hooked by <a href="longline%20fishing">longline fishing</a>, but, unlike <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es and <a href="petrel">petrel</a>s, there is little evidence that overall numbers are significantly affected.

An unusual incident was the incapacitation of 103 terns off <a href="Robben%20Island">Robben Island</a>, South Africa by marine foam, generated by a combination of wave action, <a href="kelp">kelp</a> <a href="mucilage">mucilage</a> and <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>. After treatment, 90% of the birds were fit to be released.

Fish are the main food of the greater crested tern, found to make up nearly 90% of all prey items with the remainder including <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, <a href="crustacea">crustacea</a>ns and <a href="insect">insect</a>s. Unusual <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> prey included <a href="Agamids">agamid lizards</a> and <a href="green%20turtle">green turtle</a> hatchlings.

The great crested tern feeds mostly at sea by plunge diving to a depth of up to , or by dipping from the surface, and food is usually swallowed in mid-air. Birds may forage up to from land in the breeding season. Prey size ranges from in length and up to in weight. Shoaling <a href="pelagic">pelagic</a> fish such as <a href="anchovy">anchovy</a> and <a href="sardine">sardine</a> are typical prey, but bottom-living species are taken as discards from commercial fishing. This tern actively follows trawlers, including at night, and during the fishing season trawl discards can constitute 70% of its diet. Prawn fishing is particularly productive in providing extra food, since prawns usually represent only 10–20% of the catch, the remaining being bycatch, mainly fish such as <a href="Apogonidae">cardinalfish</a> and <a href="Goby">gobies</a>.

A study of an area of the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> where the number of breeding great crested terns has grown ten-fold, probably due to extra food from trawl <a href="bycatch">by-catch</a>, suggested that lesser crested and <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a>s have moved away and now breed on a part of the reef where fishing is banned. It is possible that the large increase in the number of greater crested terns may have affected other species through competition for food and nesting sites.

Terns have red oil droplets in the <a href="cone%20cell">cone cell</a>s of the <a href="retina">retina</a>s of their eyes. This improves contrast and sharpens distance <a href="bird%20vision">vision</a>, especially in hazy conditions. Birds that have to see through an air/water interface, such as terns and gulls, have more strongly coloured <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s in the cone oil drops than other avian species. The improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> on which the fish feed, or observing other terns diving for food. Tern's eyes are not particularly <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> sensitive, an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls.

The greater crested tern has a widespread distribution range, estimated at 1–10 million square kilometres (0.4–3.8 million square miles). The population has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for either the size criterion (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals) or the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as being of Least Concern at the global level. However, there are concerns for populations in some areas such as the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Thailand">Gulf of Thailand</a> where the species no longer breeds, and in <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> where egg harvesting has caused declines.

All subspecies except "T. b. cristata" are covered under the "Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds" (<a href="AEWA">AEWA</a>). Parties to the Agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.

Masked shrike

The masked shrike ("Lanius nubicus") is a bird in the <a href="shrike">shrike</a> family, Laniidae. It breeds in southeastern Europe and at the eastern end of the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, with a separate population in eastern Iraq and western Iran. It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering mainly in northeast Africa. Although it is a short-range migrant, vagrants have occurred widely elsewhere, including northern and western Europe. It is the smallest member of its <a href="genus">genus</a>, long-tailed and with a hooked bill. The male has mainly black upperparts, with white on its crown, forehead and <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> and large white patches on the shoulders and <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">wings</a>. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange flanks and breast. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish black upperparts and a grey or buff tone to the shoulders and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with a paler forehead and barring from the head to rump, barred off-white underparts and brown wings аpart from the white primary patches. The species' calls are short and grating, but the song has melodic <a href="Old%20World%20warbler">warbler-like</a> components.

The masked shrike's preferred habitat is open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup built in a tree by both adults, and the <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 18–20 days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing in parts of the European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

The shrikes are a family of slender, long-tailed <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, most of its members being in the genus "<a href="Lanius">Lanius</a>", the typical shrikes. They are short-necked birds with rounded wings and a hooked tip to the bill. Most occur in open habitats. The affiliations of the masked shrike with other members of the genus are uncertain; the "brown" shrikes (<a href="brown%20shrike">brown</a>, <a href="red-backed%20shrike">red-backed</a> and <a href="isabelline%20shrike">isabelline shrike</a>s) and tropical species like the <a href="Somali%20fiscal">Somali fiscal</a> have both been suggested as possible relatives. The masked shrike has no subspecies.

The masked shrike was described by German explorer and naturalist <a href="Martin%20Lichtenstein">Martin Lichtenstein</a> in 1823 under its current scientific name. "Lanius" is the Latin for a butcher, and comes from the shrikes' habit of impaling prey, reminiscent of a butcher hanging carcasses, and "nubicus" means "Nubian" (from northeast Africa). The bird was independently described by Dutch <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Temminck</a> in 1824 as "Lanius personatus", from the Latin "personatus" "masked", referring, as does the English name, to the bird's appearance, but the older name takes precedence. A later synonym from 1844 was "L. leucometopon" from the Greek "leukos", "white", and "metopon", "forehead", describing a feature of the distinctive head pattern. "Shrike", first recorded in 1545, derives from the shrill cries given by this family, and the traditional common name "butcher-bird" again refers to the characteristic prey storage, and has been in use since at least 1668.

The masked shrike is the smallest of its genus, a slender bird which usually weighs , measuring long with a wingspan. It has a long tail and relatively small bill, on each side of which is a <a href="tomium">tomial tooth</a>; the upper mandible bears a triangular ridge which fits a corresponding notch in the lower mandible. This adaptation is otherwise only found in <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s.

The male has mainly black upperparts, a white crown, forehead and <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>. There are large white patches on the shoulders and <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primaries</a>, and the outermost tail feathers are also white. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange on the flanks and breast. The <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is brown, the bill is black and the legs are dark brown or black. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish-black upperparts and a grey or buff tinge to the white shoulder patches and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with darker bars from the head to rump, a paler grey forehead, barred off-white underparts and brown wings with white primary patches.

Masked shrikes are most similar in appearance to <a href="woodchat%20shrike">woodchat shrike</a>s, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults of the two species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.

Juveniles <a href="moult">moult</a> their head, body and some wing feathers a few weeks after fledging, and adults have a complete moult after breeding. In both cases, if the process is not complete by the time of migration it is suspended and completed on the wintering grounds.

The masked shrike gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with repeated "tsr", "tzr" or "shek" notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling "krrrr". The bill may be snapped when the bird is agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of "<a href="Hippolais">Hippolais</a>" species, particularly the <a href="olive-tree%20warbler">olive-tree warbler</a>. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.

The masked shrike breeds in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, northeast Greece and some of the Greek islands, Turkey, Cyprus and from Syria south to Israel. It also nests in eastern Iraq and western Iran. The range in the east is uncertain, and may include Afghanistan and northern Saudi Arabia. It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering south of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>, mainly in Chad, Sudan and Ethiopia. Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria, and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia. Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September, and return north in February and March.

This species is seen in Egypt, Jordan and Israel much more often in spring than autumn, suggesting that the southern movement may be concentrated further east. Birds will hold small territories on about on migration, and, unlike other shrikes, may congregate in significant numbers. More than 100 have been seen in one locality in Israel, with five in a single bush. This shrike has occurred as a vagrant in Algeria, Finland, Kenya, Libya, Spain, Sweden, Mauritania and Turkmenistan. At least three individuals have been documented in Great Britain, and two individuals in Armenia.

The masked shrike's preferred habitat is open woodland with bushes and some large trees. Unlike its relatives, it avoids very open, lightly vegetated country. Orchards and other cultivated land with suitable old trees or large hedges are also used by this species. It is normally found in more wooded areas than <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> shrikes. It occurs in lowlands and in hills up to . In some areas breeding occurs at greater altitudes, up to . It may occur in gardens and resorts on migration, and in winter again prefers open country with thorny bushes and large trees like <a href="acacia">acacia</a> or introduced <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a>.

The masked shrike is a solitary species except when on migration. It maintains a breeding territory of and is also territorial on the wintering grounds, defending an area of about . Although unafraid of humans, it is aggressive to its own species and other birds which infringe on its territory. Most other shrikes use high, exposed branches throughout the year, but the masked shrike only uses conspicuous locations at the start of the breeding season, otherwise choosing lower, more sheltered spots. It perches upright, frequently cocking its tail, and has an easy, agile flight. A masked shrike has been recorded as feigning injury when trapped, only to return to normal when the threat receded.

Male masked shrikes sing from perches in their territories from early April, sometimes chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, starts with the bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and is followed by the shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on the move or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on the move appear to be confined to this species.

The nest, built by both sexes, is a small, neat cup of rootlets, stems and twigs, lined with wool or hair, and adorned with <a href="lichen">lichen</a> externally. It is constructed in a tree above the ground and averages wide and deep, with the cup across and a in depth. Eggs are laid from April to June, mainly in May in the lowlands and about a month later in the mountains. Replacement <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a> are laid in June or July if the nest fails, and second broods appear to be common in at least some areas. The first nest is destroyed by the pair to provide material for a replacement breeding attempt. The eggs average in size and are variable in colour, with a background of grey, cream or yellow, diffuse grey blotches, and a ring of brown markings. The normal clutch is 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The <a href="altricial">altricial</a> downy chicks are fed by both parents until they <a href="fledge">fledge</a> 18–20 days later. They are dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike breeds in its first year, but its average life span is unknown.

Vertebrate predators of young birds include cats and crows. This species may also be infected by parasites, such as an <a href="nematode">eyeworm</a>, a <a href="tick">tick</a>, "<a href="Hyalomma%20marginatum">Hyalomma marginatum</a>", and at least two species of "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" blood parasites.

Like its relatives, the masked shrike hunts from a perch, typically high, although usually in less exposed locations than those favoured by most other shrikes. Prey is usually taken from the ground, but occasionally picked off foliage or caught in the air with an agile <a href="Old%20World%20flycatcher">flycatcher-like</a> flight. The kill may be impaled on thorns or barbed wire as a "larder" for immediate or later consumption. Because passerines have relatively weak legs, impalement holds the corpse while it is dismembered. It was once thought that this behaviour was shown mainly by male shrikes in the breeding season, but this is not the case. Masked shrikes of both sexes are known to impale in winter and on migration. Individual birds may be very tame, following a gardener or feeding close to an observer.

The masked shrike feeds mainly on large insects, although other <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, but to a lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, the masked shrike has been recorded as killing species such as <a href="lesser%20whitethroat">lesser whitethroat</a> and <a href="little%20swift">little swift</a>. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows to the back of the head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.

The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) estimates the European population of the masked shrike to be between 105,000–300,000 individuals, suggesting a global total of 142,000–600,000 birds. Although the population appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and extensive breeding range of about , mean that this shrike is classified by the IUCN as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>.

Numbers have declined in recent decades in Europe, although Bulgaria, Greece and Cyprus still have several thousand breeding pairs. Turkey is a stronghold with up to 90,000 pairs. The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel is thought to be due to <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s. In Somalia this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, where this species is considered to be unlucky. There are indications that this shrike is adapting to plantations instead of natural woodlands, which could help populations in the longer term.

Peking opera

Peking opera, or Beijing opera (), is the most dominant form of <a href="Chinese%20opera">Chinese opera</a> which combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance and acrobatics. It arose in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> in the mid-<a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing dynasty</a> (1636–1912) and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century. The form was extremely popular in the Qing court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China. Major performance troupes are based in Beijing, <a href="Tianjin">Tianjin</a> and <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. The art form is also preserved in <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> , where it is also known as (). It has also spread to other regions such as the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

Peking opera features four main role types, "<a href="Sheng%20role">sheng</a>" (gentlemen), "<a href="dan%20role">dan</a>" (women), "<a href="jing%20role">jing</a>" (rough men), and "<a href="chou%20role">chou</a>" (clowns). Performing troupes often have several of each variety, as well as numerous secondary and tertiary performers. With their elaborate and colorful costumes, performers are the only focal points on Peking opera's characteristically sparse stage. They use the skills of speech, song, dance and combat in movements that are symbolic and suggestive, rather than realistic. Above all else, the skill of performers is evaluated according to the beauty of their movements. Performers also adhere to a variety of stylistic conventions that help audiences navigate the plot of the production. The layers of meaning within each movement must be expressed in time with music. The music of Peking opera can be divided into the () and () styles. Melodies include <a href="aria">aria</a>s, fixed-tune melodies and <a href="Percussion%20instrument">percussion</a> patterns. The repertoire of Peking opera includes over 1,400 works, which are based on <a href="Chinese%20history">Chinese history</a>, <a href="Chinese%20folklore">folklore</a> and, increasingly, contemporary life.

Traditional Peking opera was denounced as "feudalistic" and "bourgeois" during the <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> (1966–1976) and replaced with the <a href="revolutionary%20opera">revolutionary opera</a>s as a means of propaganda and indoctrination. After the Cultural Revolution, these transformations were largely undone. In recent years, Peking opera has attempted numerous reforms in response to sagging audience numbers. These reforms, which include improving performance quality, adapting new performance elements and performing new and original plays, have met with mixed success.

"Peking opera" is the English term for the art form; the term entered the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" in 1953. "Beijing opera" is a more recent equivalent.

In China, the art form has been known by many names in different times and places. The earliest Chinese name, "Pihuang", was a combination of the "xipi" and "erhuang" melodies. As it increased in popularity, its name became "Jingju" or "Jingxi", which reflected its start in the capital city (). From 1927 to 1949, when Beijing was known as <a href="Beiping">Beiping</a>, Peking opera was known as "Pingxi" or "Pingju" to reflect this change. Finally, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the name of the capital city was reverted to Beijing, and the formal name of this theatre in Mainland China was established as "Jingju". The <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>ese name for this type of opera, "Guoju", or "national drama", reflects <a href="Political%20status%20of%20Taiwan">disputes</a> over the true seat of the Chinese government.

Peking opera was born when the 'Four Great Anhui Troupes' brought Hui opera, or what is now called "<a href="Huiju">Huiju</a>", in 1790 to Beijing, for the eightieth birthday of the <a href="Qianlong%20Emperor">Qianlong Emperor</a> on 25 September. It was originally staged for the court and only made available to the public later. In 1828, several famous Hubei troupes arrived in Beijing and performed jointly with Anhui troupes. The combination gradually formed Peking opera's melodies. Peking opera is generally regarded as having fully formed by 1845. Although it is called Peking opera (Beijing theatre style), its origins are in the southern <a href="Anhui">Anhui</a> and eastern <a href="Hubei">Hubei</a>, which share the same dialect of <a href="Xiajiang%20Mandarin">Xiajiang Mandarin</a> (Lower Yangtze Mandarin). Peking opera's two main <a href="Four%20Great%20Characteristic%20Melodies">melodies</a>, "Xipi" and "Erhuang", were derived from Han Opera after about 1750. The tune of Peking opera is extremely similar to that of Han opera, therefore Han opera is widely known as the Mother of Peking opera. "Xipi" literally means 'Skin Puppet Show', referring to the puppet show that originated in <a href="Shaanxi%20province">Shaanxi province</a>. Chinese puppet shows always involve singing. Much dialogue is also carried out in an archaic form of Mandarin Chinese, in which the <a href="Zhongyuan%20Mandarin">Zhongyuan Mandarin</a> dialects of Henan and Shaanxi are closest. This form of Mandarin is recorded in the book "Zhongyuan Yinyun". It also absorbed music from other operas and local "<a href="Zhili%20Province">Zhili</a>" musical art forms. Some scholars believe that the "Xipi" musical form was derived from the historic <a href="Qinqiang">Qinqiang</a>, while many conventions of staging, performance elements, and <a href="aesthetic">aesthetic</a> principles were retained from <a href="Kunqu">Kunqu</a>, the form that preceded it as court art.

Thus, Peking opera is not a monolithic form, but rather a coalescence of many older forms. However, the new form also creates its own innovations. The vocal requirements for all of the major roles were greatly reduced for Peking opera. The Chou, in particular, rarely has a singing part in Peking opera, unlike the equivalent role in Kunqu style. The <a href="melodies">melodies</a> that accompany each play were also simplified, and are played with different traditional instruments than in earlier forms. Perhaps most noticeably, true acrobatic elements were introduced with Peking opera. The form grew in popularity throughout the 19th century. The Anhui troupes reached their peak of excellence in the middle of the century, and were invited to perform in the court of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom that had been established during the <a href="Taiping%20Rebellion">Taiping Rebellion</a>. Beginning in 1884, the <a href="Empress%20Dowager%20Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a> became a regular patron of Peking opera, cementing its status over earlier forms like Kunqu. The popularity of Peking opera has been attributed to the simplicity of the form, with only a few voices and singing patterns. This allowed anyone to sing the arias themselves.
At the time of its growth in the late nineteenth century, albums became used to display aspects of stage culture, including makeup and costumes of performers.

Peking opera was initially an exclusively male pursuit. The <a href="Qianlong%20Emperor">Qianlong Emperor</a> had banned all female performers in Beijing in 1772. The appearance of women on the stage began unofficially during the 1870s. Female performers began to impersonate male roles and declared equality with men. They were given a venue for their talents when Li Maoer, himself a former Peking-opera performer, founded the first female Peking-opera troupe in Shanghai. By 1894, the first commercial venue showcasing female performance troupes appeared in Shanghai. This encouraged other female troupes to form, which gradually increased in popularity. As a result, theatre artist Yu Zhenting petitioned for the lifting of the ban after the founding of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29">Republic of China</a> in 1911. This was accepted, and the ban was lifted in 1912, although male Dan continued to be popular after this period.

After the <a href="Chinese%20Civil%20War">Chinese Civil War</a>, Peking opera became a focal point of identity for both involved parties. When the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Communist Party of China</a> came to power in Mainland China in 1949, the newly formed government moved to bring art into line with Communist ideology, and "to make art and literature a component of the whole revolutionary machine". To this end, dramatic works without Communist themes were considered subversive, and were ultimately banned during the <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> (1966–1976).

The use of opera as a tool to transmit communist ideology reached its climax in the Cultural Revolution, under the purview of <a href="Jiang%20Qing">Jiang Qing</a>, wife of <a href="Mao%20Zedong">Mao Zedong</a>. The 'model operas' were considered one of the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution, and were meant to express Mao's view that "art must serve the interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and must conform to proletarian ideology."

Among the <a href="eight%20model%20plays">eight model plays</a> eventually retained during that time were five Peking operas. Notable among these operas was "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Red%20Lantern">The Legend of the Red Lantern</a>", which was approved as a concert with piano accompaniment based on a suggestion from Jiang Qing. Performances of works beyond the eight model plays were allowed only in heavily modified form. The endings of many traditional plays were changed, and visible stage assistants in Peking opera were eliminated. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s, traditional Peking opera began to be performed again. Peking opera and other theatrical art forms were a controversial subject both before and during the Twelfth National People's Congress in 1982. A study carried in the "<a href="People%27s%20Daily">People's Daily</a>" revealed that over 80 percent of musical dramas staged in the country were traditional plays from the pre-Communist era, as opposed to newly written historical dramas promoting socialist values. In response, Communist party officials enacted reforms to curb liberalism and foreign influence in theatrical works.

After the retreat of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> to Taiwan in 1949, Peking opera there took on a special status of "political symbolism", in which the <a href="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> government encouraged the art form over other forms of performance in an attempt to claim a position as the sole representative of Chinese culture. This often occurred at the expense of traditional <a href="Taiwanese%20opera">Taiwanese opera</a>. Due to its status as a prestigious art form with a long history, Peking opera has indeed been studied more and received more monetary support than other forms of theater in Taiwan. However, there has also been a competing movement towards advocating native opera to differentiate Taiwan from the mainland. In September 1990, when the Kuomintang government participated in a state-sponsored mainland cultural event for the first time, a Taiwanese opera group was sent, possibly to emphasize "Taiwaneseness".

During the second half of the 20th century, Peking opera witnessed a steady decline in audience numbers. This has been attributed both to a decrease in performance quality and an inability of the traditional opera form to capture modern life. Furthermore, the archaic language of Peking opera required productions to use electronic subtitles, which hampered the development of the form. The influence of Western culture has also left the younger generations impatient with the slow pacing of Peking opera. In response, Peking opera began to see reform starting in the 1980s. Such reforms have taken the form of creating a school of performance theory to increase performance quality, employing modern elements to attract new audiences, and performing new plays outside of the traditional canon. However, these reforms have been hampered by both a lack of funding and an adverse political climate that makes the performance of new plays difficult.

In addition to more formal reform measures, Peking-opera troupes during the 1980s also adopted more unofficial changes. Some of those seen in traditional works have been called "technique for technique's sake". This has included the use of extended high pitch sequences by female Dan, and the addition of lengthier movement sections and percussion sequences to traditional works. Such changes have generally met with disdain from Peking-opera performers, who see them as ploys to gain immediate audience appeal. Plays with repetitive sequences have also been shortened to hold audience interest. New works have naturally experienced a greater freedom to experiment. Regional, popular, and foreign techniques have been adopted, including Western style makeup and beards and new face paint designs for Jing characters. The spirit of reform continued during the 1990s. To survive in an increasingly open market, troupes like the Shanghai Peking Opera Company needed to bring traditional Peking opera to new audiences. To do this, they have offered an increasing number of free performances in public areas.

There has also been a general feeling of a shift in the creative attribution of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works. However, perhaps following the lead of the West, Peking opera in recent decades has shifted to a more director and playwright centered model. Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.

Channel <a href="CCTV-11">CCTV-11</a> in Mainland China is currently dedicated to broadcasting classic Chinese opera productions, including Peking opera.

In addition to its presence in mainland China, Peking opera has spread to many other places. It can be found in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas Chinese communities elsewhere.

<a href="Mei%20Lanfang">Mei Lanfang</a>, one of the most famous Dan performers of all time, was also one of the greatest popularizers of Peking opera abroad. During the 1920s, he performed Peking opera in Japan. This inspired an American tour in February 1930. Although some, such as the actor <a href="Otis%20Skinner">Otis Skinner</a>, believed that Peking opera could never be a success in the United States, the favorable reception of Mei and his troupe in New York City disproved this notion. The performances had to be relocated from the 49th Street Theater to the larger National Theater, and the duration of the tour extended from two weeks to five. Mei traveled across the United States, receiving honorary degrees from the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> and <a href="Pomona%20College">Pomona College</a>. He followed this tour with a tour in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in 1935.

The theatre department at the <a href="University%20of%20Hawaii%20at%20M%C4%81noa">University of Hawaii at Mānoa</a> has been home to English language Jingju for more than twenty-five years. The school offers Asian Theatre as a major and has regular Jingju performances, the most recent being "Lady Mu and the Yang Family Generals" in 2014.

The Sheng (生) is the main male role in Beijing opera. This role has numerous subtypes. The "laosheng" is a dignified older role. These characters have a gentle and cultivated disposition and wear sensible costumes. One type of "laosheng" role is the "hongsheng", a red-faced older male. The only two "hongsheng" roles are <a href="Guan%20Gong">Guan Gong</a>, the Chinese God of War, and <a href="Emperor%20Taizu%20of%20Song">Zhao Kuang-yin</a>, the first <a href="Song%20Dynasty">Song Dynasty</a> emperor. Young male characters are known as "xiaosheng". These characters sing in a high, shrill voice with occasional breaks to represent the voice changing period of adolescence. Depending on the character's rank in society, the costume of the "xiaosheng" may be either elaborate or simple. Off-stage, "xiaosheng" actors are often involved with beautiful women by virtue of the handsome and young image they project. The "wusheng" is a martial character for roles involving combat. They are highly trained in acrobatics, and have a natural voice when singing. Troupes will always have a "laosheng" actor. A "xiaosheng" actor may also be added to play roles fitting to his age. In addition to these main Sheng, the troupe will also have a secondary "laosheng".

The <a href="Dan%20%28Chinese%20opera%29">Dan</a> (旦) refers to any female role in Beijing opera. Dan roles were originally divided into five subtypes. Old women were played by "laodan", martial women were "wudan", young female warriors were "daomadan", virtuous and elite women were "qingyi", and vivacious and unmarried women were "huadan". One of Mei Lanfang's most important contributions to Beijing opera was in pioneering a sixth type of role, the "huashan". This role type combines the status of the "qingyi" with the sensuality of the "huadan". A troupe will have a young Dan to play main roles, as well as an older Dan for secondary parts. Four examples of famous Dans are <a href="Mei%20Lanfang">Mei Lanfang</a>, <a href="Cheng%20Yanqiu">Cheng Yanqiu</a>, <a href="Shang%20Xiaoyun">Shang Xiaoyun</a>, and <a href="Xun%20Huisheng">Xun Huisheng</a>. In the early years of Beijing opera, all Dan roles were played by men. <a href="Wei%20Changsheng">Wei Changsheng</a>, a male Dan performer in the Qing court, developed the "cai ciao", or "false foot" technique, to simulate the bound feet of women and the characteristic gait that resulted from the practice. The ban on female performers also led to a controversial form of brothel, known as the "xianggong tangzi", in which men paid to have sex with young boys dressed as females. Ironically, the performing skills taught to the youths employed in these brothels led many of them to become professional Dan later in life.

The Jing (净) is a painted face male role. Depending on the repertoire of the particular troupe, he will play either primary or secondary roles. This type of role will entail a forceful character, so a Jing must have a strong voice and be able to exaggerate gestures. Beijing opera boasts 16 basic facial patterns, but there are over 100 specific variations. The patterns and coloring are thought to be derived from traditional Chinese color symbolism and divination on the lines of a person's face, which is said to reveal personality. Easily recognizable examples of coloring include red, which denotes uprightness and loyalty, white, which represents evil or crafty characters, and black, which is given to characters of soundness and integrity. Three main types of Jing roles are often seen. These include "dongchui", a loyal general with a black face who excels in singing, "jiazi", a complex character played by a skilled actor, and "wujing", a martial and acrobatic character.

The Chou (丑) is a male clown role. The Chou usually plays secondary roles in a troupe. Indeed, most studies of Beijing opera classify the Chou as a minor role. The name of the role is a <a href="homophone">homophone</a> of the <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> word "chou", meaning "ugly". This reflects the traditional belief that the clown's combination of ugliness and laughter could drive away evil spirits. Chou roles can be divided into "Wen Chou", civilian roles such as <a href="merchant">merchant</a>s and jailers, and "Wu Chou", minor military roles. The "Wu Chou" is one of the most demanding in Beijing opera, because of its combination of comic acting, acrobatics, and a strong voice. Chou characters are generally amusing and likable, if a bit foolish. Their costumes range from simple for characters of lower status to elaborate, perhaps overly so, for high status characters. Chou characters wear special face paint, called "xiaohualian", that differs from that of Jing characters. The defining characteristic of this type of face paint is a small patch of white chalk around the nose. This can represent either a mean and secretive nature or a quick wit.

Beneath the whimsical persona of the Chou, a serious connection to the form of Beijing opera exists. The Chou is the character most connected to the "guban", the <a href="drum">drum</a>s and clapper commonly used for musically accompaniment during performances. The Chou actor often uses the "guban" in solo performance, especially when performing "Shu Ban", light-hearted verses spoken for comedic effect. The clown is also connected to the small <a href="gong">gong</a> and <a href="cymbals">cymbals</a>, percussion instruments that symbolize the lower classes and the raucous atmosphere inspired by the role. Although Chou characters do not sing frequently, their <a href="arias">arias</a> feature large amounts of <a href="improvisation">improvisation</a>. This is considered a license of the role, and the orchestra will accompany the Chou actor even as he bursts into an unscripted folk song. However, due to the standardization of Beijing opera and political pressure from government authorities, Chou improvisation has lessened in recent years. The Chou has a vocal timbre that is distinct from other characters, as the character will often speak in the common <a href="Beijing%20dialect">Beijing dialect</a>, as opposed to the more formal dialects of other characters.

Becoming a Peking opera performer requires a long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age. Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked at a young age by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five o'clock in the morning for exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.

Performers are first trained in acrobatics, followed by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, all based on the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the <a href="Mei%20Lanfang">Mei Lanfang</a> school, the <a href="Cheng%20Yanqiu">Cheng Yanqiu</a> school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively in the art of performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent often become Peking-opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20National%20Defense%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20China">Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China</a> runs a national Peking-opera training school.

Peking-opera performers use four main skills. The first two are song and speech. The third is dance-acting. This includes pure dance, pantomime, and all other types of dance. The final skill is combat, which includes both acrobatics and fighting with all manner of weaponry. All of these skills are expected to be performed effortlessly, in keeping with the spirit of the art form.

Peking opera follows other traditional Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers is to put beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, but this does not mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.

Many performances deal with behaviors that occur in daily life. However, in accordance with the overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of "Mo", mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their eyes in a circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often take the form of a smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.

Peking opera stages have traditionally been square platforms. The action on stage is usually visible from at least three sides. The stage is divided into two parts by an embroidered curtain called a "shoujiu". Musicians are visible to the audience on the front part of the stage. Traditional Peking opera stages were built above the line of sight of the viewers, but some modern stages have been constructed with higher audience seating. Viewers are always seated south of the stage. Therefore, north is the most important direction in Peking opera, and performers will immediately move to "center north" upon entering the stage. All characters enter from the east and exit from the west. In line with the highly symbolic nature of Peking opera, the form uses very few props. This reflects seven centuries of Chinese performance tradition. The presence of large objects is frequently indicated through conventions. The stage will almost always have a table and at least one chair, which can be turned through convention into such diverse objects as a city wall, a mountain, or a bed. Peripheral objects will often be used to signify the presence of a larger, main object. For example, a whip is used to indicate a horse and an oar symbolizes a boat.

The length and internal structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, "zhezixi", short plays or plays made up of short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include all four of the main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression from the beginning of the play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play "The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated" begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later "zhezixi" productions. Some of the most complex plays may even have an emotional progression from scene to scene.

Due to the scarcity of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a "mang", or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often in the design of a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the "kuan yi", a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the "chezi", a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have <a href="water%20sleeves">water sleeves</a>, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked and waved like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in with the rest of the costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.

Qimo (stage props) is the name for all stage properties and some simple decorations. The term first occurred in the <a href="Jin%20dynasty%20%28265%E2%80%93420%29">Jin dynasty (265–420)</a>. Qimo includes articles of everyday life such as candlesticks, lanterns, fans, handkerchiefs, brushes, paper, ink and ink slabs, and tea and wine sets. The props also include: sedan chairs, vehicle flags, oars, and horsewhips, as well as weapons. Also employed are various articles to demonstrate environments, such as cloth backdrops to represent cities, and curtains, flags, table curtains, and chair covers. Traditional qimo are not just imitations of real articles, but also artistic articles in their own right. Flags are also frequently used on the stage. A square flag with the Chinese character for "marshal" on it, a rectangular flag with the Chinese character for "commander" on it, and a flag with the name of a certain army on it represent the location of army camps and commanders-in-chief. In addition, there are water, fire, wind, and vehicle flags. Actors shake these flags to represent waves, fire, wind, or moving vehicles.

Vocal production in Peking opera is conceived of as being composed of "four levels of song": songs with music, verse recitation, prose dialogue, and non-verbal vocalizations. The conception of a sliding scale of vocalization creates a sense of smooth continuity between songs and speech. The three basic categories of vocal production technique are the use of breath ("yongqi"), pronunciation ("fayin"), and special Peking-opera pronunciation ("shangkouzi").

In Chinese opera, breath is based in the pubic region and supported by the abdominal muscles. Performers follow the basic principle that "Strong centralized breath moves the melodic-passages" ("zhong qi xing xiang"). Breath is visualized being drawn up through a central breathing cavity extending from the pubic region to the top of the head. This "cavity" must be under the performer's control at all times, and he or she develops special techniques to control both entering and exiting air. The two major methods of taking in breath are known as "exchanging breath" ("huan qi") and "stealing breath" ("tou qi"). "Exchanging breath" is a slow, unhurried process of breathing out old air and taking in new. It is used at moments when the performer is not under time constraint, such as during a purely instrumental musical passage or when another character is speaking. "Stealing breath" is a sharp intake of air without prior exhalation, and is used during long passages of prose or song when a pause would be undesirable. Both techniques should be invisible to the audience and take in only the precise amount of air required for the intended vocalization. The most important principle in exhalation is "saving the breath" ("cun qi"). Breath should not be expended all at once at the beginning of a spoken or sung passage, but rather expelled slowly and evenly over its length. Most songs and some prose contain precise written intervals for when breath should be "exchanged" or "stolen". These intervals are often marked by carats.

Pronunciation is conceptualized as shaping the throat and mouth into the shape necessary to produce the desired vowel sound, and clearly articulating the initial consonant. There are four basic shapes for the throat and mouth, corresponding to four vowel types, and five methods of articulating consonants, one for each type of consonant. The four throat and mouth shapes are "opened-mouth" ("kaikou"), "level-teeth" ("qichi"), "closed-mouth" ("hekou" or "huokou"), and "scooped-lips" ("cuochun"). The five consonant types are denoted by the portion of the mouth most critical to each type's production: throat, or larynx ("hou"); tongue ("she"); molars, or the jaws and palate ("chi"); front teeth ("ya"); and lips ("chun").

Some syllables (written <a href="Chinese%20characters">Chinese characters</a>) have special pronunciations in Peking opera. This is due to the collaboration with regional forms and <a href="kunqu">kunqu</a> that occurred during the development of Peking opera. For example, 你, meaning "you", may be pronounced "li", as it is in the Anhui dialect, rather than the Standard Chinese "ni". 我, meaning "I" and pronounced "wo" in Standard Chinese, becomes "ngo", as it is pronounced in the dialect of <a href="Suzhou">Suzhou</a>. In addition to pronunciation differences that are due to the influence of regional forms, the readings of some characters have been changed to promote ease of performance or vocal variety. For example, "zhi", "chi", "shi", and "ri" sounds do not carry well and are difficult to sustain, because they are produced far back in the mouth. Therefore, they are performed with an additional "i" sound, as in "zhii".

These techniques and conventions of vocal production are used to create the two main categories of vocalizations in Peking opera: stage speech and song.

Peking opera is performed using both <a href="Classical%20Chinese">Classical Chinese</a> and <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Chinese">Modern Standard Chinese</a> with some slang terms added for color. The social position of the character being played determines the type of language that he or she uses. Peking opera features three major types of stage speech ("nianbai"). Monologues and dialogue, which make up the majority of most plays, consist of prose speeches. The purpose of prose speech is to advance the plot of the play or inject humor into a scene. They are usually short, and are performed mostly using vernacular language. However, as Elizabeth Wichmann points out, they also have rhythmic and musical elements, achieved through the "stylized articulation of monosyllabic sound units" and the "stylized pronunciation of speech-tones", respectively. Prose speeches were frequently improvised during the early period of Peking opera's development, and "chou" performers carry on that tradition today.

The second main type of stage speech consists of quotations drawn from classical Chinese poetry. This type is rarely used in Peking opera; plays have one or two such quotations at most, and often none at all. In most instances, the use of classical poetry is intended to heighten the impact of a scene. However, "Chou" and more whimsical "Dan" characters may misquote or misinterpret the classical lines, creating a comical effect.

The final category of stage speech is conventionalized stage speeches ("chengshi nianbai"). These are rigid formulations that mark important transition points. When a character enters for the first time, an "entrance speech" ("shangchang") or "self-introduction speech" ("zi bao jiamen") is given, which includes a prelude poem, a set-the-scene poem, and a prose set-the-scene speech, in that order. The style and structure of each entrance speech is inherited from earlier <a href="Yuan%20Dynasty">Yuan Dynasty</a>, <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a>, folk, and regional forms of Chinese opera. Another conventionalized stage speech is the exit speech, which may take the form of a poem followed by a single spoken line. This speech is usually delivered by a supporting character, and describes his or her present situation and state of mind. Finally, there is the recapitulation speech, in which a character will use prose to recount the story up to that point. These speeches came about as a result of the "zhezixi" tradition of performing only one part of a larger play.

There are six main types of song lyrics in Peking opera: emotive, condemnatory, narrative, descriptive, disputive, and "shared space separate sensations" lyrics. Each type uses the same basic lyrical structure, differing only in kind and degree of emotions portrayed. Lyrics are written in couplets ("lian") consisting of two lines ("ju"). Couplets can consist of two ten character lines, or two seven character lines. The lines are further subdivided into three "dou" (lit. "pause"), typically in a 3-3-4 or 2-2-3 pattern. Lines may be "padded" with extra characters for the purpose of clarifying meaning. Rhyme is an extremely important device in Peking opera, with thirteen identified rhyme categories. Song lyrics also use the speech tones of Mandarin Chinese in ways that are pleasing to the ear and convey proper meaning and emotion. The first and second of Chinese's four tones are normally known as "level" ("ping") tones in Peking opera, while the third and fourth are called "oblique" ("ze"). The closing line of every couplet in a song ends in a level tone.

Songs in Peking opera are proscribed by a set of common aesthetic values. A majority of songs are within a pitch range of an octave and a fifth. High pitch is a positive aesthetic value, so a performer will pitch songs at the very top of his or her vocal range. For this reason, the idea of a song's key has value in Peking opera only as a technical tool for the performer. Different performers in the same performance may sing in different keys, requiring the accompanying musicians to constantly retune their instruments or switch out with other players. Elizabeth Wichmann describes the ideal basic timbre for Peking opera songs as a "controlled nasal tone". Performers make extensive use of vocal vibrato during songs, in a way that is "slower" and "wider" than vibrato used in Western performances. The Peking opera aesthetic for songs is summed up by the expression "zi zheng qiang yuan", meaning that the written characters should be delivered accurately and precisely, and the melodic passages should be weaving, or "round".

The accompaniment for a Peking opera performance usually consists of a small ensemble of traditional melodic and percussion instruments. The lead melodic instrument is the "<a href="Jinghu%20%28instrument%29">jinghu</a>", a small, high-pitched, two-string spike fiddle. The "jinghu" is the primary accompaniment for performers during songs. Accompaniment is heterophonic – the "jinghu" player follows the basic contours of the song's melody, but diverges in pitch and other elements. The "jinghu" often plays more notes per measure than the performer sings, and does so an octave lower. During rehearsal, the "jinghu" player adopts his or her own signature version of the song's melody, but also must adapt to spontaneous improvisations on the part of the performer due to changed performance conditions. Thus, the "jinghu" player must have an instinctive ability to change his or her performance without warning to properly accompany the performer.

The second is the circular bodied plucked lute, the "<a href="yueqin">yueqin</a>". Percussion instruments include the "daluo", "xiaoluo", and "naobo". The player of the "gu" and "ban", a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, "Xipi" and "Erhuang", originally differed in subtle ways. In the "Xipi" style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In "Erhuang", on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central <a href="Hubei">Hubei</a> province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including "manban" (a slow tempo), "yuanban" (a standard, medium-fast tempo), "kuai sanyan" ("leading beat"), "daoban" ("leading beat"), "sanban" ("rubato beat"), and "yaoban" ("shaking beat"). The "xipi" style also uses several unique tempos, including "erliu" ("two-six"), and "kuaiban" (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, "yuanban", "manban", and "kuaiban" are most commonly seen. The tempo at any given time is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. "Erhuang" has been seen as more improvisational, and "Xipi" as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.

The melodies played by the accompaniment mainly fall into three broad categories. The first is the aria. The arias of Peking opera can be further divided into those of the "Erhuang" and "Xipi" varieties. An example of an aria is "wawa diao", an aria in the "Xipi" style that is sung by a young Sheng to indicate heightened emotion. The second type of melody heard in Peking opera is the fixed-tune melody, or "qupai". These are instrumental tunes that serve a wider range of purposes than arias. Examples include the "Water Dragon Tune" ("shui long yin"), which generally denotes the arrival of an important person, and "Triple Thrust" ("ji san qiang"), which may signal a feast or banquet. The final type of musical accompaniment is the percussion pattern. Such patterns provide context to the music in ways similar to the fixed-tune melodies. For example, there are as many as 48 different percussion patterns that accompany stage entrances. Each one identifies the entering character by his or her individual rank and personality.
The repertoire of Peking opera includes nearly 1,400 works. The plays are mostly taken from historical novels or traditional stories about civil, political and military struggles. Early plays were often adaptations from earlier Chinese theatre styles, such as "kunqu." Nearly half of 272 plays listed in 1824 were derived from earlier styles. Many classification systems have been used to sort the plays. Two traditional methods have existed since Peking opera first appeared in China. The oldest and most generally used system is to sort plays into civil and martial types. Civil plays focus on the relationships between characters, and feature personal, domestic, and romantic situations. The element of singing is frequently used to express emotion in this type of play. Martial plays feature a greater emphasis on action and combat skill. The two types of play also feature different arrays of performers. Martial plays predominantly feature young sheng, jing, and chou, while civil plays have a greater need for older roles and dan. In addition to being civil or martial, plays are also classified as either "daxi" (serious) or "xiaoxi" (light). The performance elements and performers used in serious and light plays greatly resemble those used in martial and civil plays, respectively. Of course, the aesthetic principle of synthesis frequently leads to the use of these contrasting elements in combination, yielding plays that defy such dichotomous classification.

Since 1949, a more detailed classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. The first category in this system is "chuantongxi", traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is "xinbian de lishixi", historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final category is "xiandaixi", contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In the second half of the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>" and "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>", among others.
Peking opera and its stylistic devices have appeared in many Chinese films. It often was used to signify a unique "Chineseness" in contrast to sense of culture being presented in Japanese films. <a href="Fei%20Mu">Fei Mu</a>, a director of the pre-Communist era, used Peking opera in a number of plays, sometimes within "Westernized", realistic plots. <a href="King%20Hu">King Hu</a>, a later Chinese film director, used many of the formal norms of Peking opera in his films, such as the parallelism between music, voice, and gesture. In the 1993 film "<a href="Farewell%20My%20Concubine%20%28film%29">Farewell My Concubine</a>", by <a href="Chen%20Kaige">Chen Kaige</a>, Peking opera serves as the object of pursuit for the protagonists and a backdrop for their romance. However, the film's portrayal of Peking opera has been criticized as one-dimensional. Chen returned to the subject again in 2008 with the <a href="Mei%20Lanfang">Mei Lanfang</a> biopic "<a href="Forever%20Enthralled">Forever Enthralled</a>". Peking opera is also featured in "<a href="Peking%20Opera%20Blues">Peking Opera Blues</a>" by <a href="Tsui%20Hark">Tsui Hark</a>.

A Western film that thematized Peking opera was the 1993 film "<a href="M.%20Butterfly%20%28film%29">M. Butterfly</a>" by <a href="David%20Cronenberg">David Cronenberg</a> with <a href="Jeremy%20Irons">Jeremy Irons</a> and <a href="John%20Lone">John Lone</a>, based on a <a href="M.%20Butterfly">play of the same name</a> by <a href="David%20Henry%20Hwang">David Henry Hwang</a>, which was itself based of the real-life relationship between French diplomat <a href="Bernard%20Boursicot">Bernard Boursicot</a> and Peking opera singer <a href="Shi%20Pei%20Pu">Shi Pei Pu</a>. This story of love and espionage focuses especially on the fact that in traditional Peking operas, all female roles were played by men.

Fundamental to the performance and overall ambience of traditional Peking opera is the venue. There are many restored venues in Beijing dating from the late 17th century onwards, the opera stage at <a href="Prince%20Gong%20Mansion">Prince Gong Mansion</a>, <a href="Zheng%20Yici%20Peking%20Opera%20Theatre">Zhengyici-xi-lou</a> and <a href="Huguang%20Guild%20Hall">Huguang Guild Hall</a>, being among them. However, modern venues for the general operatic and theatre stage are also common, such as the <a href="National%20Centre%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts%20%28China%29">National Centre for the Performing Arts</a>, and the <a href="Chang%27an%20Grand%20Theatre">Chang'an Grand Theatre</a> located on the East Chang'an Avenue is an example of modern Peking opera theatre.

A Handful of Dust

A Handful of Dust is a novel by the British writer <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>. First published in 1934, it is often grouped with the author's early, satirical comic novels for which he became famous in the pre-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> years. Commentators have, however, drawn attention to its serious undertones, and have regarded it as a transitional work pointing towards Waugh's <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Catholic</a> postwar fiction.

The protagonist is Tony Last, a contented but shallow English country squire, who, having been betrayed by his wife and seen his illusions shattered one by one, joins an expedition to the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Brazilian jungle</a>, only to find himself trapped in a remote outpost as the prisoner of a maniac. Waugh incorporated several autobiographical elements into the plot, including his own recent desertion by his wife. In 1933–34 he travelled into the South American interior, and a number of incidents from the voyage are incorporated into the novel. Tony's singular fate in the jungle was first used by Waugh as the subject of an independent short story, published in 1933 under the title "The Man Who Liked Dickens".

The book's initial critical reception was modest, but it was popular with the public and has never been out of print. In the years since publication the book's reputation has grown; it is generally considered one of Waugh's best works, and has more than once figured on unofficial lists of the 20th century's best novels.

Waugh had converted to <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a> in 1930, after which his satirical, secular writings drew hostility from some Catholic quarters. He did not introduce overtly religious themes into "A Handful of Dust", but later explained that he intended the book to demonstrate the futility of humanist, as distinct from religious, especially Catholic, values. The book has been dramatised for radio, stage and screen.

Tony Last is a country gentleman, living with his wife Brenda and his eight-year-old son John Andrew in his ancestral home, Hetton Abbey. The house is a Victorian <a href="neo-Gothic">pseudo-Gothic</a> pastiche described as architecturally "devoid of interest" by a local guide book and "ugly" by his wife, but is Tony's pride and joy. Entirely content with country life, he is seemingly unaware of Brenda's increasing boredom and dissatisfaction, and of his son's developing waywardness. Brenda meets John Beaver and, despite acknowledging his dullness and insignificance, she begins an affair with him. Brenda starts spending her weeks in London, and persuades Tony to finance a small <a href="Apartment">flat</a>, which she rents from John's mother, Mrs Beaver, an unscrupulous property developer. Although the Brenda–Beaver liaison is well known to their London friends, Tony remains uxorious and oblivious; attempts by Brenda and her friends to set him up with a mistress are absurdly unsuccessful.

Brenda is in London when John Andrew is killed in a riding accident. On being told that "John is dead", Brenda at first thinks that Beaver has died; on learning that it is her son John, she betrays her true feelings by uttering an involuntary "Thank God!". After the funeral, she tells Tony that she wants a divorce so that she can marry Beaver. On learning the extent of her deception Tony is shattered, but agrees to protect Brenda's social reputation by allowing <a href="Collusive%20lawsuit">her to divorce him</a>, and to provide her with £500 a year. After spending an awkward but chaste weekend in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> with a prostitute contriving divorce evidence, Tony learns from Brenda's brother that, encouraged by Beaver, Brenda is now demanding £2,000 a year—a sum that would require Tony to sell Hetton. Tony's illusions are shattered. However, the prostitute brought her child with her who can establish that Tony did not commit adultery and the blackmail fails. Tony withdraws from the divorce negotiations, and announces that he intends to travel for six months. On his return, he says, Brenda may have her divorce, but without any financial settlement.

With no prospect of Tony's money, Beaver loses interest in Brenda, who is left adrift and in poverty. Meanwhile, Tony has met an explorer, Dr. Messinger, and joins him on an expedition in search of a supposed lost city in the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a>. On the outward journey, Tony engages in a shipboard romance with Thérèse de Vitré, a young girl whose <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> causes her to shun him when he tells her he has a wife. In Brazil, Messinger proves an incompetent organiser; he cannot control the native guides, who abandon him and Tony in the depths of the jungle. Tony falls ill, and Messinger leaves in their only canoe to find help, but is swept over a waterfall and killed.

Tony wanders in delirium until he is rescued by Mr. Todd, an expatriate Englishman who rules over a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, and asks Tony to read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks to be helped on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony realises he is being held against his will. When a search party finally reaches the settlement, Todd arranges that Tony be drugged and kept hidden; he tells the party that Tony has died, and gives them his watch to take home. When Tony awakes he learns that his hopes of rescue are gone, and that he is condemned to read Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.

<a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, born in 1903, was the younger son of <a href="Arthur%20Waugh">Arthur Waugh</a>, the managing director of the London publishing firm of <a href="Chapman%20%26amp%3B%20Hall">Chapman & Hall</a>. After attending <a href="Lancing%20College">Lancing College</a> and <a href="Hertford%20College%2C%20Oxford">Hertford College, Oxford</a>, Waugh taught for three years in a series of private preparatory schools before beginning his career as a writer. His first commercially printed work was a short story, "The Balance", which Chapman and Hall included in a 1926 anthology. He worked briefly as a "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" reporter, and wrote a short biography of the pre-Raphaelite painter <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Gabriel Rossetti</a> before achieving success in 1928 with the publication of his comic novel, "<a href="Decline%20and%20Fall">Decline and Fall</a>". By the end of 1932 Waugh had written two further novels, "<a href="Vile%20Bodies">Vile Bodies</a>" and "<a href="Black%20Mischief">Black Mischief</a>", and two travel books. His professional successes coincided with private upheavals; in June 1928 he married Evelyn Gardner, but just over a year later the marriage ended when she declared her love for the couple's mutual friend <a href="John%20Heygate">John Heygate</a>. Reconciliation proved impossible, and Waugh filed for divorce in September 1929. At the same time, Waugh was undergoing instruction which led to his reception, in September 1930, into the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.

Waugh's adherence to Catholic teaching on divorce caused him frustration while awaiting the possible annulment of his marriage. He had fallen in love with Teresa Jungman, a lively socialite whose Catholicism precluded any intimacy in their relationship since in the eyes of the Church Waugh remained married. Waugh's conversion did not greatly affect the acerbic and sharply satirical tone of his fiction—his principal characters were frequently amoral and their activities sometimes shocking. Waugh claimed "the right to write of man's depravity in such a fashion as to make it unattractive". When "Black Mischief" was published in 1932, the editor of the Catholic journal "<a href="The%20Tablet">The Tablet</a>", Ernest Oldmeadow, launched a violent attack on the book and its author, stating that the novel was "a disgrace to anybody professing the Catholic name". Waugh, wrote Oldmeadow, "was intent on elaborating a work outrageous not only to Catholic but to ordinary standards of modesty". Waugh made no public rebuttal of these charges; an open letter to <a href="Francis%20Bourne">the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster</a> was prepared, but on the advice of Waugh's friends was not sent.

In 1932 Waugh embarked on an extended voyage to South America. His decision to absent himself may have been a reaction to his increasingly complicated emotional life; while his passion for Teresa Jungman remained unrequited, he was involved in various unsatisfactory casual sexual liaisons, and was himself being pursued by the much older <a href="Hazel%20Lavery">Hazel Lavery</a>. The choice of South America was probably influenced by <a href="Peter%20Fleming%20%28writer%29">Peter Fleming</a>, the literary editor of "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>". Fleming had recently returned from an expedition to Brazil seeking traces of <a href="Percy%20Fawcett">Colonel Percy Fawcett</a> who, in 1925, had disappeared in Brazil while searching for a fabled lost city.

Having seen "Black Mischief" launched to mixed but generally favourable critical comment (Oldmeadow's intervention was not immediate), Waugh sailed from <a href="Tilbury">Tilbury</a> on 2 December 1932. He arrived in <a href="Guyana">British Guiana</a> on 23 December, and after some days of indecision opted to accompany the district commissioner for <a href="Rupununi">Rupununi</a>, on a journey into the interior. He hoped that he might reach <a href="Manaus">Manaus</a>, a large city deep within the Brazilian jungle, but transport proved unreliable, and he got no further than the border town of <a href="Boa%20Vista%2C%20Roraima">Boa Vista</a>. On the way, at one of his overnight stopping points, he encountered Mr Christie, an elderly mixed-race settler who greeted him by saying, "I was expecting you. I was warned in a vision of your approach". The two enjoyed an agreeable dinner together, where Christie talked of the "Fifth Kingdom" (a biblical prophecy from the <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Book of Daniel</a>). He told Waugh that he had seen the entire gathering of the saints in heaven—surprisingly few, he said—but could not count them because they were incorporeal. Waugh added Christie to his "treasury of eccentrics", set aside for future literary use.

Waugh arrived at Boa Vista on 4 February 1933, to find no boats available to take him on to Manaus. Days of inactivity and boredom followed, with "nothing to read except some lives of the Saints in French and <a href="Jacques-B%C3%A9nigne%20Bossuet">Bossuet</a>'s sermons". Waugh passed some of the time by writing a short story; although not identified in the diaries, this story has been generally accepted as "The Man Who Liked Dickens". Apart from using different names and some minor details this story is the same as the episode that Waugh later used as the climax to "A Handful of Dust": an elderly settler (modelled in manner, speech and appearance on Christie), rescues and holds captive a lost explorer and requires him to read aloud the novels of Dickens, in perpetuity. The story was published in 1933, in America in "<a href="Cosmopolitan%20%28magazine%29">Hearst's International–Cosmopolitan</a>", and in Britain in "<a href="The%20Pall%20Mall%20Magazine">Nash's Pall Mall Magazine</a>". In an article written many years later, Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel: "The idea [for the short story] came quite naturally from the experience of visiting a lonely settler [Christie] ... and reflecting how easily he could hold me prisoner. Then, after the short story was written and published, the idea kept working in my mind. I wanted to discover how the prisoner got there, and eventually the thing grew into a study of other sorts of savage at home and the civilized man’s helpless plight among them."

On his return to England in May 1933, Waugh, short of cash, had to complete numerous writing commitments before he could begin work on the projected novel. In October–November he wrote his account of the South American journey, which he called "Ninety-two Days". He then went to <a href="Fez%2C%20Morocco">Fez</a> in Morocco, to begin the novel in warmth and solitude. In January he wrote to <a href="Lady%20Mary%20Lygon">Mary Lygon</a>, reporting that he had written 18,500 words of "my filthy novel", and later he told Katharine Asquith: "I have just killed a little boy at a lawn meet & made his mother commit adultery ... so perhaps you won't like it after all". By 10 February he had reached the half-way point—45,000 words—but was uncertain how the story should proceed, and returned to England at the end of February with most of the second half unwritten. He finished the book at the Easton Court Hotel at <a href="Chagford">Chagford</a>, in <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, a regular retreat that he used when completing writing projects. By mid-April the book was with his publishers, Chapman & Hall, and Waugh was busy correcting the proofs.

Waugh's agent <a href="A.%20D.%20Peters">A. D. Peters</a> sold the pre-publication serialisation rights to the American monthly magazine "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>". Because the "Mr Todd" episode had been published as a short story the previous year, for the purposes of the serialisation Waugh provided an alternative ending. In this, the whole Brazilian adventure was replaced by a brief coda, in which Tony returns from a luxury cruise to be greeted by a chastened Brenda asking to be reconciled. Tony agrees, but, unknown to her, he decides to keep her London flat for his own purposes. Waugh's biographer Selena Hastings describes this ending as "artistically far more complementary" than that used in the book version; an earlier biographer, <a href="Christopher%20Sykes%20%28author%29">Christopher Sykes</a> thought that had this alternative been retained in the book version, the novel would not have acquired its later distinction.

In March 1933 Waugh wrote to Peters from Chagford to say that he intended to call the novel "A Handful of Ashes". This title was disliked by "Harpers"; an alternative, "Fourth Decade", was also considered and rejected. Finally, the story was serialised under the title "A Flat in London", and the chosen book title was "A Handful of Dust"—taken from a line in <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Waste%20Land">The Waste Land</a>": "I will show you fear in a handful of dust." The line is within the section of the poem entitled "The Burial of the Dead", which depicts a comfortless, lifeless land of desert and rubble, reflecting the empty moral ambience of the novel. The title phrase had been used earlier by Joseph Conrad in the story "Youth"; by <a href="Tennyson">Tennyson</a> in "<a href="Maud%20%28poem%29">Maud</a>"; and even earlier by <a href="John%20Donne">John Donne</a> in his "Meditations".

In his study of Waugh's literary life, David Wykes describes "A Handful of Dust" as "a courageous and skilful act of fictional autobiography", driven by the trauma of the writer's divorce without which, Wykes maintains, the book would not have been written. Waugh, says his biographer Martin Stannard, was "dredging the memory of his personal agony" in documenting the breakdown of the Lasts' marriage. The critic <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a>, whose first reaction to the work had been negative, later called it "the only book which understands the true horror of the withdrawal of affection in an affair from [the point of view of] the innocent party".

Wykes believes that, of the novel's three central characters, only Tony is representative of his real-life equivalent—Waugh in his pre-Catholic irreligious state. Brenda is portrayed in the novel as typical of many of the women in Waugh's early stories—well-bred, trivial and faithless—but Wykes argues that she is not a representation of Evelyn Gardner, "neither in inward nor outward qualities". Nor, he asserts, is Beaver intended as an accurate portrayal of Evelyn Gardner's lover, the "dreadful nullity" of Beaver being a form of literary revenge on the erudite Heygate. There is general agreement among commentators that other characters are drawn from life: Mr Todd is clearly based on the eccentric but rather less sinister Mr Christie; Dr Messinger, the incompetent explorer, reflects W. E. Roth, the curator of the <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Guyana">Georgetown</a> museum whom Waugh considered accompanying into the jungle, only to be dissuaded by reports of Roth's irresponsibility and disregard of danger. Thérèse de Vitré, the object of Tony's forlorn attempt at a shipboard romance, was named "Bernadette" in the original manuscript; the change was made as a reference to Waugh's platonic friend Teresa Jungman. Thérèse announces her destiny to marry a rich Catholic, and, in an echo of Jungman, recoils from Tony when she discovers that he still has a wife. The culmination of Tony's misfortunes, his enslavement to Mr Todd and Dickens, is foreshadowed in Waugh's life by his father's habit of reading his favourite literature aloud to his family, three or four evenings a week: "... most of Shakespeare, most of Dickens, most of Tennyson ... stepping about the room and portraying the characters ... he held us enthralled".

The art historian John Richardson, however, wrote, in the article "Sybil Colefax, Lion Hunter" (House & Garden, September 1983), that the society decorator Lady Colefax "was the model for the deadly decorator, Mrs. Beaver (as, allegedly, her son Michael was the model for Mrs. Beaver's son John)."

Critics and commentators have generally acknowledged that "A Handful of Dust" stands apart from Waugh's other prewar fiction. <a href="Philip%20Toynbee">Philip Toynbee</a> describes it as a turning point in Waugh's journey from outright satire to disillusioned realism: "Much of this book is in the old manner, funny-preposterous laced with funny-bitter, but the whole tone and atmosphere are violently changed when the little boy is killed". Likewise Gerald Gould in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", reviewing the book's initial publication in 1934: "Here was the old gorgeous, careless note of contempt and disillusionment. Gradually, implacably, the note changes and deepens". A later critic, John Cunningham, recognises that stylistically, the book is in a different category from Waugh's other 1930s novels, both more ambitious and more ambiguous. Although, says Cunningham, "[i]t provokes as much knowing laughter as Waugh's other satires of manners", it is a significant step away from its predecessors, towards the Catholic "comedies of redemption" that would become the principal focus of his writing life.

In his introduction to the 1997 Penguin edition, Robert Murray Davis suggests that in part, the book reflected Waugh's reconsideration of his position as a Catholic writer, in the light of the recent Oldmeadow furore over "Black Mischief". He may have developed a more serious tone to pre-empt further criticism from that quarter, although Stannard maintains that Waugh's beginnings as a serious writer date back to 1929, when he was completing "Vile Bodies". Waugh's own comment, in 1946, was that he was not, according to his own understanding of the term, a "satirical" writer, and that in writing the book he was merely "trying to distil comedy and sometimes tragedy from the knockabout farce of people's outward behaviour".

<a href="William%20Plomer">William Plomer</a>, writing in "The Spectator" after the book's first publication, thought it mistaken "to regard Mr Waugh's more surprising situations as farcical or far-fetched; they are on the whole extremely realistic". However, the mixture of genres was not immediately understood or appreciated by some of Waugh's admirers; Connolly's initial thought was that Waugh had been "destroyed as a writer", by snobbery and association with country-house living. In Sykes's view, the fleeting appearances in the book of characters from Waugh's farcical world, such as Lady Metroland, are awkward and intrusive—the world of "A Handful of Dust" is not outlandish: "Evelyn would have done better to have forgotten Lady Metroland and her world altogether".

Cunningham sees "A Handful of Dust" as a forerunner of Waugh's later, avowedly Catholic novels. In keeping with Waugh's dismissive attitude to the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, Anglicanism is shown as a farce (Mr Tendril the vicar's sermons), or a nullity (Tony's admission that he had never really thought much about God). Instead, Christianity is evoked by presenting the awfulness of life without it; according to the writer and critic <a href="Frank%20Kermode">Frank Kermode</a>, "[T]he callousness of incident and the coldness of tone work by suggesting the positive and rational declaration of the Faith". The reader, Stannard says, "is never allowed to forget man's primal bestiality ... God is the key that has been thrown away in this purely secular world". John Raymond in the "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" refers to Waugh's "unique type of moral vision", and calls the novel a "powerful twentieth century sermon on the breakdown of a Christian marriage".

Tony's doomed quest in the Brazilian jungle is framed in biblical terms; the relevant chapter title, "In Search of a City" alludes to <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Hebrews</a> 13:14: "For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come". However, Waugh remarked of the novel that it was "humanist, and said all I wanted to say about humanism". He believed that the essential 20th century conflict was between Christianity and Chaos, and chose to present a chaotic world to demonstrate that civilisation did not have in itself the power to survive. Thus, in the Brazilian jungle, Tony encounters what Davis terms "power without grace ... secular feudalism unredeemed by the saving grace of Christianity". Todd is the symbol of humanist, irreligious power.

The critic Bernard Bergonzi refers to Tony Last as "a doomed Gothic hero", echoing Waugh's explanation to his friend <a href="Henry%20Green">Henry Yorke</a> that the theme of the book was "a Gothic man in the hands of savages—first Mrs Beaver etc, then the real ones". According to Stannard, Waugh tended to judge a civilisation by its art, and especially by its architecture, and <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture">English Gothic</a> is a major leitmotif of the novel. Tony's recognition of the extent of Brenda's betrayal is described as "a whole Gothic world ... come to grief". Later, Tony finds purpose in his otherwise pointless voyage when he hears of the fabled lost city from Messinger; he visualises it as Gothic in character, "a transfigured Hetton ... everything luminous and translucent; a coral citadel crowning a green hill top sown with daisies". When at the end of his quest he first catches sight of Todd's settlement, in his delirium he sees, instead of the reality of mud huts and desolation, "gilded cupolas and spires of alabaster".

Although devoted to original English Gothic, Waugh had mixed views on <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival architecture</a>, preferring what he called "pre-Ruskin" to the "stodgy" later 19th-century style in which he places Hetton. He instructed the artist responsible for the frontispiece in the first edition of the book to "design the worst possible 1860" style to depict the house. The guidebook description of Hetton which opens the second chapter reveals that, "formerly one of the notable houses of the county, it was entirely rebuilt in 1864 in the Gothic style and is now devoid of interest". Thus, Tony's devotion is shown to be to a false ideal; his deposition and replacement in his domain by middle-class heirs represents what the writer <a href="Brigid%20Brophy">Brigid Brophy</a> terms "a bourgeois sack of a fake-Gothic Rome".

"A Handful of Dust" first appeared in "Harper's Bazaar", as a serial in five instalments during the summer of 1934, using the alternative, non-Brazilian ending. The complete novel was first published in book form in London, on 4 September 1934, by Chapman and Hall. It was an immediate success with the British public, and within four weeks had reached its fifth impression. In the same month it was issued in New York by <a href="Farrar%20%26amp%3B%20Rinehart">Farrar & Rinehart</a>, who were initially unenthusiastic about the book and, according to Waugh's agent, made little promotional effort on its behalf. It has since been published in the United States by (among others) <a href="Dell%20Publishing">Dell Publishing</a> (1959); <a href="Little%2C%20Brown%20and%20Company">Little, Brown</a> (1977); and <a href="Barnes%20%26amp%3B%20Noble">Barnes and Noble</a> (2001).

Since its first publication the book has remained in print, and has been reproduced in many editions and foreign languages. It was first published as a paperback in 1951, by <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin</a>, who have reissued it regularly. In 1945 Bernard Grasset published a translation in French, after which the book was published in most European languages, and also in Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Arabic.

The initial critical response to the book, while largely complimentary in tone, was nevertheless muted and sparse. This relative paucity of attention, Stannard surmises, might have been a consequence of the earlier serialisation, which meant that the essence of the story was well known before the book appeared. "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>"'s anonymous reviewer deemed the novel "a study of futility", whose hero is "so incapable of helping himself that he is not worth helping". <a href="Peter%20Quennell">Peter Quennell</a> in the "New Statesman" found the story both painful and amusing—"tragedy and comedy are interdependent"—but was not overcome by the bouts of hilarity that had interrupted his reading of earlier novels such as "Decline and Fall". If not exhilarating, the book was "certainly the most mature and best written novel that Mr Waugh has yet produced". Plomer's "Spectator" review described the book as "another of [Waugh's] cultivated pearls", economically written, holding the reader's attention throughout and capturing with precision the moods and rhythms of life as it was lived in certain quarters of society.

The only overtly hostile review was Oldmeadow's in "The Tablet", which asserted that, after the disquiet in Catholic circles following the publication of Waugh's previous novel, his co-religionists "reasonably hoped to find Mr Waugh turning over a completely new leaf. He has not done so". The review mixed literary criticism with moral sermonising, to which Waugh felt bound to object publicly. His friend, the journalist <a href="Tom%20Driberg">Tom Driberg</a> agreed to place a notice in his <a href="William%20Hickey%20%28columnist%29">"William Hickey"</a> column in the "Daily Express", in which Waugh accepted fully Oldmeadow's right to criticise the literary quality of the work "in any terms he thinks suitable". However, he added, so far as his moral lecturing was concerned, Oldmeadow was "in the position of a valet masquerading in his master's clothes. Long employment by a prince of the Church has tempted him to ape his superiors, and, naturally enough, he gives an uncouth and impudent performance".

Many of Waugh's friends and admirers gave the book unstinting praise, among them <a href="Rebecca%20West">Rebecca West</a>, <a href="Lady%20Diana%20Cooper">Lady Diana Cooper</a>, <a href="Desmond%20MacCarthy">Desmond MacCarthy</a> and <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>. Among those less enthusiastic were the novelist <a href="J.B.%20Priestley">J.B. Priestley</a>, who found the characters lightweight and uninvolving, and the devoutly Catholic Katharine Asquith who thought the writing was brilliant but the subject-matter deeply depressing. The novel's critical standing grew steadily in the years following its publication. In 1942 the American critic <a href="Alexander%20Woollcott">Alexander Woollcott</a> chose it as the best English novel in 100 years, a verdict largely endorsed some years later by Frank Kermode. Sykes wrote in 1975 that "there are only five or six novels of this century that can seriously challenge it".

In 2010 "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine placed "A Handful of Dust" in its listing of the hundred best English-language novels published since 1923 (the year the magazine began publication), stating: "If this is Waugh at his bleakest it’s also Waugh at his deepest, most poisonously funny". In the <a href="Modern%20Library">Modern Library</a>'s list of 100 best novels, "A Handful of Dust" is placed 34th in the "Board list", although unplaced in the complementary "Readers' List".

On 8 April 1968 <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> broadcast "A Handful of Dust" as a radio play, in an adaptation by Denis Constanduros produced by Brian Miller. <a href="Jack%20Watling">Jack Watling</a> and <a href="Stephanie%20Beacham">Stephanie Beacham</a> played Tony and Brenda Last, with Rex Holdsworth as Mr Todd. A new radio adaptation, with Jonathan Cullen and <a href="Tara%20Fitzgerald">Tara Fitzgerald</a> in the main roles, was broadcast as a two-part serial in May 1996. In November 1982 an ensemble cast performed the work as a stage play, directed by Mike Alfreds, at the <a href="Lyric%20Theatre%20%28Hammersmith%29">Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith</a>. A <a href="A%20Handful%20of%20Dust%20%28film%29">film version</a>, directed by <a href="Charles%20Sturridge">Charles Sturridge</a>, was released in 1988, with <a href="James%20Wilby">James Wilby</a> as Tony, <a href="Kristin%20Scott%20Thomas">Kristin Scott Thomas</a> as Brenda, <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a> as Mrs Beaver and <a href="Alec%20Guinness">Alec Guinness</a> as Mr Todd.

Geology of the Grand Canyon area

The geology of the Grand Canyon area includes one of the most complete and studied sequences of <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a> on Earth. The nearly 40 major <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a> layers exposed in the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> and in the <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Grand Canyon National Park</a> area range in age from about 200 million to nearly 2 billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Both marine and terrestrial <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s are represented, including lithified <a href="sand%20dune">sand dune</a>s from an extinct desert. There are at least 14 known <a href="Unconformity">unconformities</a> in the geologic record found in the Grand Canyon.

Uplift of the region started about 75 million years ago during the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a>; a mountain-building event that is largely responsible for creating the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> to the east. In total, the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a> was uplifted an estimated . The adjacent <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a> to the west started to form about 18 million years ago as the result of <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">crustal</a> stretching. A drainage system that flowed through what is today the eastern Grand Canyon emptied into the now lower Basin and Range province. Opening of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> around 6 million years ago enabled a large <a href="river">river</a> to cut its way northeast from the gulf. The new river captured the older drainage to form the ancestral <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28US%29">Colorado River</a>, which in turn started to form the Grand Canyon.

Wetter <a href="climate">climate</a>s brought upon by <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>s starting 2 million years ago greatly increased excavation of the Grand Canyon, which was nearly as deep as it is now, 1.2 million years ago. <a href="volcano">Volcanic</a> activity deposited <a href="lava">lava</a> over the area 1.8 million to 500,000 years ago. At least 13 <a href="lava%20dam">lava dam</a>s blocked the Colorado River, forming <a href="lake">lake</a>s that were up to deep. The end of the last ice age and subsequent <a href="human">human</a> activity has greatly reduced the ability of the Colorado River to excavate the canyon. <a href="Dam">Dam</a>s in particular have upset patterns of sediment transport and <a href="Deposition%20%28sediment%29">deposition</a>. Controlled floods from <a href="Glen%20Canyon%20Dam">Glen Canyon Dam</a> upstream have been conducted to see if they have a restorative effect. <a href="Earthquake">Earthquake</a>s and <a href="mass%20wasting">mass wasting</a> erosive events still affect the region.

At about 2.5 and 1.8 billion years ago in <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> time, <a href="sand">sand</a>, <a href="mud">mud</a>, <a href="silt">silt</a>, and <a href="Volcanic%20ash">ash</a> were laid down in a marine basin adjacent to an <a href="orogenic%20belt">orogenic belt</a>. From 1.8 to 1.6 billion years ago at least two <a href="island%20arc">island arc</a>s collided with the proto-North American <a href="continent">continent</a>. This process of <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a> compressed and grafted the marine sediments in the basin onto the mainland and uplifted them out of the sea. Later, these rocks were buried under the surface and pressure-cooked into <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a>. The resulting <a href="Granite%20Gorge%20Metamorphic%20Suite">Granite Gorge Metamorphic Suite</a>, which is part of the <a href="Vishnu%20Basement%20Rocks">Vishnu Basement Rocks</a>, consists of the metasedimentary Vishnu Schist and the metavolcanic Brahma and Rama Schists that were formed 1.75 billion to 1.73 billion years ago. This is the resistant rock now exposed at the bottom of the canyon in the Inner Gorge.

As the volcanic islands collided with the mainland around 1.7 billion years ago, blobs of <a href="magma">magma</a> rose from the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> zone and intruded the Granite Gorge Metamorphic Suite. These <a href="Intrusion">pluton</a>s slowly cooled to form the Zoroaster Granite; part of which would later be metamorphosed into <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>. This rock unit can be seen as light-colored bands in the darker <a href="garnet">garnet</a>-studded Vishnu Schist (see 1b in ). The intrusion of the granite occurred in three phases: two during the initial Vishnu metamorphism period, and a third around 1.4 billion years ago. The third phase was accompanied by large-scale <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a>ing, particularly along north–south faults, leading to a partial <a href="rifting">rifting</a> of the continent. The collision expanded the continent from the <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>–<a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> border into Mexico and almost doubled the crust's thickness in the Grand Canyon region. Part of this thickening created the high ancestral <a href="Mazatzal%20Mountains">Mazatzal Mountains</a>.

Subsequent erosion lasting 300 million years stripped much of the exposed sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet (tens of meters) high. Geologist <a href="John%20Wesley%20Powell">John Wesley Powell</a> called this major gap in the geologic record, which is also seen in other parts of the world, the <a href="Great%20Unconformity">Great Unconformity</a>. Other sediments may have been added but, if they ever existed, were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the <a href="Geologic%20time%20scale">geologic record</a> are called <a href="unconformity">unconformities</a> by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of the best examples of an exposed <a href="unconformity">nonconformity</a>, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above <a href="igneous%20rocks">igneous</a> or <a href="metamorphic%20rocks">metamorphic rocks</a>.

In late Precambrian time, extension from a large <a href="tectonic%20plate">tectonic plate</a> or smaller plates moving away from <a href="Laurentia">Laurentia</a> thinned its <a href="continental%20crust">continental crust</a>, forming large <a href="rift%20basin">rift basin</a>s that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a> to <a href="Glacier%20National%20Park%20%28U.S.%29">Glacier National Park</a> in <a href="Montana">Montana</a> to the Grand Canyon and the <a href="Uinta%20Mountains">Uinta Mountains</a>. The resulting Grand Canyon Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a>s that were laid down from 1.2 billion and 740 million years ago in this sea. Good exposures of the supergroup can be seen in eastern Grand Canyon in the Inner Gorge and from Desert View, Lipan Point and Moran point.
The oldest section of the supergroup is the <a href="Unkar%20Group">Unkar Group</a>. It accumulated in a variety of fluvial, deltaic, tidal, nearshore marine, and offshore marine environments. The first formation to be laid down in the Unkar Group was the <a href="Bass%20Formation">Bass Formation</a>. Fluvial gravels initially accumulated in shallow river valleys. They later lithified into a basal <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a> that is known as the Hotauta Member of the Bass Formation. The Bass Formation was deposited in a shallow sea near the coast as a mix of <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, and <a href="shale">shale</a>. Diagenesis later altered the bulk of the limestone into <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a>. It is thick and grayish in color. Averaging 1250 million years old, this is the oldest layer exposed in the Grand Canyon that contains fossils—<a href="stromatolite">stromatolite</a>s. <a href="Hakatai%20Shale">Hakatai Shale</a> is made of thin beds of marginal-marine-derived <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>s, sandstones, and shale that, together, are thick. This formation indicates a short-lived regression (retreat) of the seashore in the area that left mud flats. Today it is very bright orange-red and gives the Red Canyon its name. <a href="Shinumo%20Quartzite">Shinumo Quartzite</a> is a resistant marine sedimentary <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> that was eroded to form <a href="monadnock">monadnock</a>s that later became islands in <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> time. Those islands withstood wave action long enough to become re-buried by other sediments in the Cambrian Period. <a href="Dox%20Formation">Dox Formation</a> is over thick and is made of sandstone with some interbedded shale beds and mudstone that were deposited in fluvial and tidal environments. <a href="Ripple%20mark">Ripple mark</a>s and other features indicate it was close to the shore. Outcrops of this red to orange formation can be seen in the eastern parts of the canyon. Fossils of stromatolites and algae are found in this layer. At 1070 ± 70 million years old, the <a href="Cardenas%20Basalt">Cardenas Basalt</a> is the youngest formation in the Unkar Group. It is made of layers of dark brown <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic rocks that flowed as <a href="lava">lava</a> up to thick.

<a href="Nankoweap%20Formation">Nankoweap Formation</a> is around 1050 million years old and is not part of a group. This rock unit is made of coarse-grained sandstone, and was deposited in a shallow sea on top of the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt. The Nankoweap is only exposed in the eastern part of the canyon. A gap in the geologic record, an unconformity, follows the Nankoweap.
All formations in the <a href="Chuar%20Group">Chuar Group</a> were deposited in coastal and shallow sea environments about 1000 to 700 million years ago. The Galeros Formation is a mainly greenish formation composed of interbedded sandstone, limestone, and shale. Fossilized stromatolites are found in the Galeros. The Kwagunt Formation consists of black shale and red to purple mudstone with some limestone. Isolated pockets of reddish sandstone are also found around Carbon Butte. Stromatolites are found in this layer. The Sixtymile Formation is made of tan-colored sandstone with some small sections of shale.

About 800 million years ago the supergroup was tilted 15° and block <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a>ed in the Grand Canyon Orogeny. Some of the block units moved down and others moved up while fault movement created north–south-trending <a href="fault-block%20mountain">fault-block mountain</a> ranges. About 100 million years of erosion took place that washed most of the Chuar Group away along with part of the Unkar Group (exposing the Shinumo Quartzite as previously explained). The mountain ranges were reduced to hills, and in some places, the whole of the supergroup were removed entirely, exposing the <a href="basement%20rock">basement rock</a>s below. Any rocks that were deposited on top of the Grand Canyon Supergroup in the Precambrian were completely removed. This created a major unconformity that represents 460 million years of lost geologic history in the area.

During the <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> era, the western part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a <a href="passive%20margin">passive margin</a>. The <a href="Cambrian%20Explosion">Cambrian Explosion</a> of life took place over about 15 million years in this part of the world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the <a href="trilobite">trilobite</a>s, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550 million years ago. As its shoreline moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the <a href="Tonto%20Group">Tonto Group</a>.
Tapeats Sandstone averages 525 million years old and is made of medium- to coarse-grained sand and conglomerate that was deposited on an ancient shore (see 3a in ). Ripple marks are common in the upper members of this dark brown thin-bedded layer. Fossils and <a href="Trace%20fossil">imprint trail</a>s of trilobites and <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s have also been found in the Tapeats. Today it is a cliff-former that is thick. Bright Angel Shale averages 515 million years old and is made of mudstone-derived shale that is interbedded with small sections of sandstone and shaly limestone with a few thin beds of <a href="Dolostone">dolomite</a>. It was mostly deposited as mud just offshore and contains brachiopod, trilobite, and worm fossils (see 3b in figure 1). The color of this formation is mostly various shades of green with some brownish-tan to gray parts. It is a slope-former and is thick. <a href="Glauconite">Glauconite</a> is responsible for the green coloration of the Bright Angel. <a href="Muav%20Limestone">Muav Limestone</a> averages 505 million years old and is made of gray, thin-bedded limestone that was deposited farther offshore from <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> precipitates (see 3c in figure 1). The western part of the canyon has a much thicker sequence of Muav than the eastern part. The Muav is a cliff-former, thick.

These three formations were laid down over a period of 30 million years from early-to-middle Cambrian time. Trilobites followed by brachiopods are the most commonly reported fossils in this group but well-preserved fossils are relatively rare. We know that the shoreline was transgressing (advancing onto land) because finer grade material was deposited on top of coarser-grained sediment. Today, the Tonto Group makes up the Tonto Platform seen above and following the Colorado River; the Tapeats Sandstone and Muav Limestone form the platform's cliffs and the Bright Angel Shale forms its slopes. Unlike the Proterozoic units below it, the Tonto Group's beds basically lie in their original horizontal position. The Bright Angel Shale in the group forms an <a href="aquiclude">aquiclude</a> (barrier to <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> seeping down), and thus collects and directs water through the overlying Muav Limestone to feed springs in the Inner Gorge.

The next two periods of <a href="geologic%20history">geologic history</a>, the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> and the <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a>, are missing from the Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists do not know if sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in the first place. Either way, this break in the geologic history of the area spans about 65 million years. A type of unconformity called a <a href="disconformity">disconformity</a> was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.
Geologists do know that deep channels were carved on the top of the Muav Limestone during this time. Streams were the likely cause, but marine scour may be to blame. Either way, these depressions were filled with freshwater limestone about 385 million years ago in the Middle <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> in a formation that geologists call the <a href="Temple%20Butte%20Limestone">Temple Butte Limestone</a> (see 4a in figure 1). <a href="Marble%20Canyon">Marble Canyon</a> in the eastern part of the park displays these filled purplish-colored channels well. Temple Butte Limestone is a cliff-former in the western part of the park where it is gray to cream-colored <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a>. Fossils of animals with <a href="Vertebral%20column">backbone</a>s are found in this formation; bony plates from freshwater fish in the eastern part and numerous marine fish fossils in the western part. Temple Butte is thick; thinner near Grand Canyon Village and thicker in western Grand Canyon. An unconformity representing 40 to 50 million years of lost geologic history marks the top of this formation.

The next formation in the Grand Canyon geologic column is the cliff-forming <a href="Redwall%20Limestone">Redwall Limestone</a>, which is thick (see 4b in figure 1). Redwall is composed of thick-bedded, dark brown to bluish gray limestone and dolomite with white <a href="chert">chert</a> nodules mixed in. It was laid down in a retreating shallow <a href="tropical">tropical</a> sea near the equator during 40 million years of the early-to-middle <a href="Mississippian%20age">Mississippian</a>. Many fossilized <a href="crinoid">crinoid</a>s, <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s, <a href="bryozoan">bryozoan</a>s, <a href="horn%20coral">horn coral</a>s, <a href="nautiloid">nautiloid</a>s, and <a href="sea%20sponge">sponge</a>s, along with other marine organisms such as large and complex trilobites have been found in the Redwall. In late Mississippian time, the Grand Canyon region was slowly uplifted and the Redwall was partly eroded away. A <a href="Karst%20topography">Karst topography</a> consisting of caves, sinkholes, and subterranean river channels resulted but were later filled with more limestone. The exposed surface of Redwall gets its characteristic color from rainwater dripping from the <a href="iron">iron</a>-rich <a href="redbed">redbed</a>s of the Supai and Hermit shale that lie above.

<a href="Surprise%20Canyon%20Formation">Surprise Canyon Formation</a> is a sedimentary layer of purplish-red shale that was laid down in discontinuous beds of sand and lime above the Redwall (see 4c in figure 1). It was created in very late Mississippian and possibly in very earliest <a href="Pennsylvanian%20%28geology%29">Pennsylvanian</a> time as the land subsided and tidal <a href="estuary">estuaries</a> filled river valleys with sediment. This formation only exists in isolated lenses that are thick. Surprise Canyon was unknown to science until 1973 and can be reached only by <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>. Fossil logs, other plant material and marine shells are found in this formation. An unconformity marks the top of the Surprise Canyon Formation and in most places this unconformity has entirely removed the Surprise Canyon and exposed the underlying Redwall.

An unconformity of 15 to 20 million years separates the <a href="Supai%20Group">Supai Group</a> from the previously deposited Redwall Formation. Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the early <a href="Permian">Permian</a> time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the <a href="Texas%20Gulf%20Coast">Texas Gulf Coast</a> of today. Around this time, the <a href="Ancestral%20Rocky%20Mountains">Ancestral Rocky Mountains</a> rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.

Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta. This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were <a href="oxidation">oxidized</a> to a bright red color. Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.

Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages thick in Grand Canyon. <a href="Wescogame%20Formation">Wescogame</a> (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is thick. An unconformity marks the top of the Supai Group.

Like the Supai Group below it, the <a href="Permian">Permian</a>-aged <a href="Hermit%20Formation">Hermit Formation</a> was probably deposited on a broad coastal plain (see 6a in figure 1). The alternating thin-bedded <a href="iron%20oxide">iron oxide</a>, mud and silt were deposited via freshwater streams in a semiarid environment around 280 million years ago. Fossils of winged insects, cone-bearing plants, and <a href="fern">fern</a>s are found in this formation as well as tracks of vertebrate animals. It is a soft, deep red shale and mudstone slope-former that is approximately thick. Slope development will periodically undermine the formations above and car- to house-sized blocks of that rock will cascade down onto the Tonto Platform. An unconformity marks the top of this formation .
<a href="Coconino%20Sandstone">Coconino Sandstone</a> formed about 275 million years ago as the area dried out and <a href="sand%20dune">sand dune</a>s made of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> sand invaded a growing desert (see 6b in figure 1). Some Coconino fills deep mudcracks in the underlying Hermit Shale and the desert that created the Coconino lasted for 5 to 10 million years. Today, the Coconino is a thick golden white to cream-colored cliff-former near the canyon's rim. <a href="Cross%20bedding">Cross bedding</a> patterns of the frosted, fine-grained, well-sorted and rounded quartz grains seen in its cliffs is compatible with an eolian environment. Also fossilized are tracks from <a href="lizard">lizard</a>-like creatures and what look like tracks from <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s and <a href="scorpion">scorpion</a>s. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.
Next in the geologic column is the -thick <a href="Toroweap%20Formation">Toroweap Formation</a> (see 6c in figure 1). It consists of red and yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The average age of the rock is about 273 million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, <a href="coral">coral</a>s, and <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some <a href="chert">chert</a>. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.

One of the highest, and therefore youngest, formations seen in the Grand Canyon area is the <a href="Kaibab%20Limestone">Kaibab Limestone</a> (see 6d in figure 1). It erodes into ledgy cliffs that are thick and was laid down in latest early Permian time, about 270 million years ago, by an advancing warm, shallow sea. The formation is typically made of sandy limestone sitting on top of a layer of sandstone. This is the cream to grayish-white rock that park visitors stand on while viewing the canyon from both rims. It is also the surface rock covering much of the <a href="Kaibab%20Plateau">Kaibab Plateau</a> just north of the canyon and the <a href="Coconino%20Plateau">Coconino Plateau</a> immediately south. Shark teeth have been found in this formation as well as abundant fossils of marine invertebrates such as brachiopods, corals, <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s, <a href="sea%20lily">sea lilies</a>, and worms. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.

Uplift marked the start of the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> and streams started to incise the newly dry land. Streams flowing through broad low valleys in <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> time deposited sediment eroded from nearby uplands, creating the once -thick <a href="Moenkopi%20Formation">Moenkopi Formation</a>. The formation is made from sandstone and shale with gypsum layers in between. Moenkopi outcrops are found along the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28US%29">Colorado River</a> in <a href="Marble%20Canyon">Marble Canyon</a>, on Cedar Mountain (a <a href="mesa">mesa</a> near the southeastern park border), and in <a href="Red%20Butte">Red Butte</a> (located south of <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20Village">Grand Canyon Village</a>). Remnants of the <a href="Shinarump%20Conglomerate">Shinarump Conglomerate</a>, itself a member of the <a href="Chinle%20Formation">Chinle Formation</a>, are above the Moenkopi Formation near the top of Red Butte but below a much younger lava flow.

Formations totaling over in thickness were deposited in the region in the Mesozoic and <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> but were almost entirely removed from the Grand Canyon sequence by subsequent erosion. The <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Zion%20and%20Kolob%20canyons%20area">geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area</a> and the <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Bryce%20Canyon%20area">geology of the Bryce Canyon area</a> records some of these formations. All these rock units together form a super sequence of rock known as the <a href="Grand%20Staircase">Grand Staircase</a>.

The <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a> affected all of western North America by helping to build the <a href="American%20cordillera">American cordillera</a>. The <a href="Kaibab%20Uplift">Kaibab Uplift</a>, <a href="Monument%20Upwarp">Monument Upwarp</a>, the <a href="Uinta%20Mountains">Uinta Mountains</a>, <a href="San%20Rafael%20Swell">San Rafael Swell</a>, and the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> were uplifted, at least in part, by the Laramide orogeny. This major mountain-building event started near the end of the Mesozoic, around 75 million years ago, and continued into the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by <a href="subduction">subduction</a> off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north–south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift. Many of these faults are Precambrian in age and are still active today. Streams draining the Rocky Mountains in early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is no evidence for a major river.

Around 18 million years ago, tensional forces started to thin and drop the region to the west, creating the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a>. Basins (<a href="graben">graben</a>s) dropped down and mountain ranges (<a href="Horst%20%28geology%29">horst</a>s) rose up between old and new north–south–trending faults. However, for reasons poorly understood, the beds of the <a href="Colorado%20Plateaus">Colorado Plateaus</a> remained mostly horizontal through both events even as they were uplifted about in two pulses. The extreme western part of the canyon ends at one of the Basin and Range faults, the Grand Wash, which also marks the boundary between the two provinces.

Uplift from the Laramide orogeny and the creation of the Basin and Range province worked together to steepen the <a href="stream%20gradient">gradient</a> of streams flowing west on the Colorado Plateau. These streams cut deep, eastward-growing, channels into the western edge of the Colorado Plateau and deposited their sediment in the widening Basin and Range region.

According to a 2012 study, there is evidence that the western Grand Canyon could be as old as 70 million years.

Rifting started to create the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> far to the south 6 to 10 million years ago. Around the same time, the western edge of the Colorado Plateau may have sagged slightly. Both events changed the direction of many streams toward the sagging region and the increased gradient caused them to <a href="downcutting">downcut</a> much faster. From 5.5 million to 5 million years ago, <a href="headward%20erosion">headward erosion</a> to the north and east <a href="stream%20capture">consolidated</a> these streams into one major river and associated tributary channels. This river, the ancestral Lower <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28US%29">Colorado River</a>, started to fill the northern arm of the gulf, which extended nearly to the site of <a href="Hoover%20Dam">Hoover Dam</a>, with estuary deposits.
At the same time, streams flowed from highlands in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The mechanism by which the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from much of the rest of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.

<a href="Ice%20age">Ice age</a>s during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> brought a cooler and wetter <a href="pluvial">pluvial</a> climate to the region starting 2 to 3 million years ago. The added <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>s in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2 million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2 million years ago.

The resulting Grand Canyon of the Colorado River trends roughly east to west for between <a href="Lake%20Powell">Lake Powell</a> and <a href="Lake%20Mead">Lake Mead</a>. In that distance, the Colorado River drops and has excavated an estimated of sediment to form the canyon. This part of the river bisects the -high Kaibab Uplift and passes seven plateaus (the <a href="Kaibab%20Plateau">Kaibab</a>, <a href="Kanab%20Plateau">Kanab</a>, and <a href="Shivwits%20Plateau">Shivwits</a> plateaus bound the northern part of the canyon and the <a href="Coconino%20Plateau">Coconino</a> bounds the southern part). Each of these plateaus are bounded by north–south-trending faults and monoclines created or reactivated during the Laramide orogeny. Streams flowing into the Colorado River have since exploited these faults to excavate their own tributary canyons, such as Bright Angel Canyon.

Volcanic activity started in <a href="Uinkaret%20volcanic%20field">Uinkaret volcanic field</a> (in the western Grand Canyon) about 3 million years ago. Over 150 <a href="lava%20flow">flow</a>s of <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic lava dammed the Colorado River at least 13 times from 725,000 to 100,000 years ago. The dams typically formed in weeks, were long, high (thicker upstream and thinner downstream) and had volumes of .

The longevity of the dams and their ability to hold Colorado River water in large lakes has been debated. In one hypothesis water from the Colorado River backed up behind the dams in large lakes that extended as far as <a href="Moab%2C%20Utah">Moab, Utah</a>. Dams were overtopped in short time; those that were high were overtopped by their lakes in 2 to 17 days. At the same time, sediment filled the lakes behind the dams. Sediment would fill a lake behind a -high dam in 10.33 months, filled a lake behind an -high dam in 345 years, and filled the lake behind the tallest dam in 3000 years. <a href="Fan%20waterfalls">Cascades</a> of water flowed over a dam while waterfalls migrated up-river along it. Most lava dams lasted for around 10,000 to 20,000 years. However others have proposed that the lava dams were much more ephemeral and failed catastrophically before overtopping. In this model dams would fail due to fluid flow through fractures in the dams and around dam abutments, through permeable river deposits and <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a>.

Since the demise of these dams the Colorado River has carved a maximum of about into the rocks of the Colorado Plateau 

The end of the Pleistocene ice ages and the start of the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> began to change the area's climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer semi-arid conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. <a href="Mass%20wasting">Mass wasting</a> processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two <a href="debris%20flow">debris flow</a>s per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also plays a major role in excavating the larger canyons.
In 1963 <a href="Glen%20Canyon%20Dam">Glen Canyon Dam</a> and other dams farther upstream started to regulate the flow of the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. Pre-dam but still historic flows of the Colorado through Grand Canyon ranged from per second with at least one late 19th century flood of per second. Discharge from Glen Canyon Dam exceeds per second only when there is danger of overtopping the dam or when the level of <a href="Lake%20Powell">Lake Powell</a> otherwise needs to be lowered. An interim conservation measure since 1991 has held maximum flows at per second even though the dam's power plant can handle per second more flow.

Controlling river flow by use of dams has diminished the river's ability to scour rocks by substantially reducing the amount of sediment it carries. Dams on the Colorado River have also changed the character of the river water. Once both muddy and warm, the river is now clear and averages a temperature year-round. Experimental floods approaching the per second level mentioned above have been carried out in 1996 and 2004 to study the effects on sediment erosion and deposition.

Grand Canyon lies on the southern end of the <a href="Intermountain%20West">Intermountain West</a> seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the <a href="Richter%20Scale">Richter Scale</a> occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north–south-trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.

The Trail of Time is an outdoor geology exhibit and <a href="nature%20trail">nature trail</a> on the South Rim of <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Grand Canyon National Park</a>. Each meter walked on the trail represents one million years of Grand Canyon's geologic history. Bronze markers on the trail mark your location in time. The trail begins at Yavapai Geology Museum at 2 billion years ago, and ends at Verkamp's Visitor Center. Along the way are samples of the Canyon's rocks, as you would encounter them going from the river up to the rim, and displays explaining the geologic history of the Canyon. The trail opened in late 2010.

The Yavapai Geology Museum include three-dimensional models, photographs, and exhibits which allow park visitors to see and understand the complicated geologic story of the area. The museum building, the historic Yavapai Observation Station (built 1928), located one mile (1.6 km) east of Market Plaza, features expansive canyon views. A bookstore offers a variety of materials about the area.

Tom Simpson

Thomas Simpson (30 November 1937 – 13 July 1967) was one of Britain's most successful professional <a href="Cycle%20sport">cyclists</a>. He was born in <a href="Haswell%2C%20County%20Durham">Haswell, County Durham</a> and later moved to <a href="Harworth">Harworth</a>, Nottinghamshire. Simpson began <a href="road%20cycling">road cycling</a> as a teenager before taking up <a href="track%20cycling">track cycling</a>, specialising in <a href="Pursuit%20racing">pursuit races</a>. He won a bronze medal for track cycling at the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a> and a silver at the <a href="1958%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a>.

In 1959, at age 21, Simpson was signed by the French professional <a href="Road%20bicycle%20racing">road-racing</a> team . He advanced to their first team () the following year, and won the <a href="1961%20Tour%20of%20Flanders">1961 Tour of Flanders</a>. Simpson then joined ; in the <a href="1962%20Tour%20de%20France">1962 Tour de France</a> he became the first British rider to wear the <a href="General%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">yellow jersey</a>, finishing sixth overall.

In 1963 Simpson moved to , winning <a href="Bordeaux%E2%80%93Paris">Bordeaux–Paris</a> that year and the <a href="1964%20Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">1964 Milan–San Remo</a>. In 1965 he became Britain's first <a href="1965%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">world road race champion</a> and won the <a href="1965%20Giro%20di%20Lombardia">Giro di Lombardia</a>; this made him the <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">BBC Sports Personality of the Year</a>, the first cyclist to win the award. Injuries hampered much of Simpson's 1966 season. He won two stages of the <a href="1967%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">1967 Vuelta a España</a> before he won the <a href="general%20classification">general classification</a> of <a href="1967%20Paris%E2%80%93Nice">Paris–Nice</a> that year.

In the thirteenth stage of the <a href="1967%20Tour%20de%20France">1967 Tour de France</a>, Simpson collapsed and died during the ascent of <a href="Mont%20Ventoux">Mont Ventoux</a>. He was 29 years old. The post-mortem examination found that he had mixed <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>s and alcohol; this <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a> combination proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and a stomach complaint. A memorial near where he died has become a place of <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> for many cyclists. Simpson was known to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during his career, when no doping controls existed. He is held in high esteem by many cyclists for his character and will to win.

Simpson was born on 30 November 1937 in <a href="Haswell%2C%20County%20Durham">Haswell, County Durham</a>, the youngest of six children of <a href="Coal%20mining">coal miner</a> Tom Simpson and his wife Alice (née Cheetham). His father had been a semi-professional <a href="Sprint%20%28running%29">sprinter</a> in athletics. The family lived modestly in a small <a href="terraced%20house">terraced house</a> until 1943, when his parents took charge of the village's <a href="working%20men%27s%20club">working men's club</a> and lived above it. In 1950 the Simpsons moved to <a href="Harworth">Harworth</a> on the Nottinghamshire–Yorkshire border, where young Simpson's maternal aunt lived; new coalfields were opening, with employment opportunities for him and older brother Harry, by now, the only children left at home. Simpson rode his first bike, his brother-in-law's, at age 12, sharing it with Harry and two cousins for <a href="Individual%20time%20trial">time trials</a> around Harworth. Following Harry, Tom joined Harworth & District CC (Cycling Club) aged 13. He delivered groceries in the <a href="Bassetlaw%20District">Bassetlaw</a> district by bicycle and traded with a customer for a better road bike. He was often left behind in club races; members of his cycling club nicknamed him "four-<a href="Stone%20%28unit%29">stone</a> Coppi", after Italian rider <a href="Fausto%20Coppi">Fausto Coppi</a>, due to his slim physique.

Simpson began winning club time trials, but sensed resentment of his boasting from senior members. He left Harworth & District and joined <a href="Rotherham">Rotherham</a>'s Scala Wheelers at the end of 1954. Simpson's first road race was as a junior at the <a href="Forest%20Recreation%20Ground">Forest Recreation Ground</a> in Nottingham. After leaving school he was an apprentice <a href="technical%20drawing">draughtsman</a> at an engineering company in <a href="Retford">Retford</a>, using the commute by bike as training. He placed well in half mile races on grass and cement, but decided to concentrate on road racing. In May 1955 Simpson won the <a href="National%20Cyclists%27%20Union">National Cyclists' Union</a> South Yorkshire <a href="individual%20pursuit">individual pursuit</a> track event as a junior; the same year, he won the <a href="British%20League%20of%20Racing%20Cyclists">British League of Racing Cyclists</a> (BLRC) junior <a href="Hillclimbing%20%28cycling%29">hill climb</a> championship and placed third in the senior event.

Simpson immersed himself in the world of cycling, writing letters asking for advice. <a href="Naturalization">Naturalised</a> Austrian rider George Berger responded, travelling from London to Harworth to help him with his riding position. In late 1955, Simpson ran a red light in a race and was suspended from racing for six months by the BLRC. During his suspension he dabbled in <a href="motorcycle%20trials">motorcycle trials</a>, nearly quitting cycling but unable to afford a new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport.

Berger told Simpson that if he wanted to be a successful road cyclist, he needed experience in <a href="track%20cycling">track cycling</a>, particularly in the pursuit discipline. Simpson competed regularly at <a href="Fallowfield%20Stadium">Fallowfield Stadium</a> in Manchester, where in early 1956 he met amateur world pursuit silver medallist <a href="Cyril%20Cartwright">Cyril Cartwright</a>, who helped him develop his technique. At the national championships at Fallowfield the 18-year-old Simpson won a silver medal in the individual pursuit, defeating amateur world champion <a href="Norman%20Sheil">Norman Sheil</a> before losing to <a href="Mike%20Gambrill">Mike Gambrill</a>.

Simpson began working with his father as a draughtsman at the glass factory in Harworth. He was riding well; although not selected by Great Britain for the amateur <a href="UCI%20Track%20Cycling%20World%20Championships">world championships</a>, he made the 4,000-metre <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%201956%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20team%20pursuit">team pursuit</a> squad for the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Olympics</a>. In mid-September, Simpson competed for two weeks in Eastern Europe against Russian and Italian teams to prepare for the Olympics. The seven-rider contingent began with races in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a>, continuing to Moscow before finishing in <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>. He was nicknamed "the Sparrow" by the Soviet press because of his slender build. The following month he was in Melbourne for the Olympics, where the team qualified for the team-pursuit semi-finals against Italy; they were confident of defeating South Africa and France but lost to Italy, taking the bronze medal. Simpson blamed himself for the loss for pushing too hard on a turn and being unable to recover for the next.
After the Olympics, Simpson trained throughout his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode in the national 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a <a href="points%20race">points race</a> at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working for a month and struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October before taking a short break from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks' racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at <a href="Herne%20Hill%20Velodrome">Herne Hill Velodrome</a>. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the <a href="Cycling%20at%20the%201958%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20individual%20pursuit">individual pursuit</a> at the <a href="1958%20British%20Empire%20and%20Commonwealth%20Games">British Empire and Commonwealth Games</a> in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) revealed Simpson to be <a href="Color%20blindness">colour blind</a>.

In September 1958, Simpson competed at the amateur world championships in Paris. Against reigning champion of Italy in the opening round of the individual pursuit, he crashed on the concrete track at the end of the race. Simpson was briefly knocked unconscious and sustained a dislocated jaw; however, he won the race since he crashed after the finish line. Although he was in pain, team manager Benny Foster forced Simpson to race in the quarter-final against New Zealand's <a href="Warwick%20Dalton">Warwick Dalton</a>, hoping to unsettle Dalton ahead of a possible meeting with Simpson's teammeate Sheil. Simpson wanted to turn professional, but needed to prove himself first, setting his sights on the world amateur indoor <a href="hour%20record">hour record</a>. <a href="Reg%20Harris">Reg Harris</a> arranged for an attempt at Zürich's <a href="Hallenstadion">Hallenstadion</a> velodrome on Simpson's birthday in November. He failed by 320 metres, covering a distance of and blaming his failure on the low temperature generated by an ice rink in the centre of the velodrome. The following week he travelled to <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, in the Flanders region of Belgium, to ride amateur track races. He stayed at the Café Den Engel, run by Albert Beurick, who organised for him to ride at Ghent's <a href="Kuipke">Kuipke</a> velodrome in the "Sportpaleis" (English: Sport Palace).

Simpson decided to move to the continent for a better chance at success, and contacted French brothers Robert and Yvon Murphy, whom he met while racing. They agreed that he could stay with them in the <a href="Brittany">Breton</a> fishing port of <a href="Saint-Brieuc">Saint-Brieuc</a>. His final event in Britain was at Herne Hill, riding <a href="Motor-paced%20racing">motor-paced</a> races. Simpson won the event and was invited to Germany to train for the 1959 <a href="UCI%20Motor-paced%20World%20Championships">motor-paced world championships</a>, but declined the opportunity in favour of a career on the road. Bicycle manufacturer <a href="Elswick%20Hopper">Elswick Hopper</a> invited him to join their British-based team, but Benny Foster advised him to continue with his plans to move to France.

In April 1959, Simpson left for France with <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>100 savings and two <a href="Carlton%20Cycles">Carlton</a> bikes, one road and one track, given in appreciation of his help promoting the company. His last words to his mother before the move were, "I don't want to be sitting here in twenty years' time, wondering what would have happened if I hadn't gone to France". The next day, his <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">National Service</a> papers were delivered; although willing to serve before his move, he feared the call-up would put his potential career at risk. His mother returned them, with the hope they would understand this.

He applied to local cycling clubs, and joined , racing with an independent (semi-professional) licence from the <a href="British%20Cycling%20Federation">British Cycling Federation</a>. When settled with the Murphy family, 21-year-old Simpson met 19-year-old Helen Sherburn, an <a href="au%20pair">au pair</a> from Sutton, Yorkshire. Simpson began attracting attention, winning races and <a href="criterium">criterium</a>s. He was invited to race in the eight-day <a href="Race%20stage">stage race</a> Route de France by the Saint-Raphaël VC 12e, the amateur club below the professional team . Simpson won the final stage, breaking away from the <a href="peloton">peloton</a> and holding on for victory. After this win, he declined an offer to ride in the <a href="1959%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> for the professional team. Simpson had contract offers from two professional teams, and , which had a British cyclist, <a href="Brian%20Robinson%20%28cyclist%29">Brian Robinson</a>; opting for the latter team, on 29 June he signed a contract for 80,000 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a> (£80 a month).

On Simpson's return to Harworth for Christmas, the RAF were notified and the press ran stories on his apparent draft avoidance. He passed a medical in Sheffield, but history repeated itself and the papers arrived the day after his departure for his team's training camp in <a href="Narbonne">Narbonne</a> in southern France. The French press, unlike the British, found the situation amusing.

In July, four months after leaving England, Simpson rode his first race as a professional, the <a href="Tour%20de%20l%27Ouest">Tour de l'Ouest</a> in west France. He won the fourth stage and took the overall race leader's jersey. He won the next stage's individual time trial, increasing his lead. On the next stage he lost the lead with a punctured tyre, finishing the race in fourteenth place overall.
In August Simpson competed at the world championships in the 5000 m <a href="UCI%20Track%20Cycling%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20individual%20pursuit">individual pursuit</a> at Amsterdam's large, open-air velodrome and the <a href="UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">road race</a> on the nearby <a href="Circuit%20Park%20Zandvoort">Circuit Park Zandvoort</a> motor-racing track. He placed fourth in the individual pursuit, losing by 0.3 seconds in the quarter-finals. He prepared for the road race, eight laps of the track. After a ten-rider <a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23breakaway">breakaway</a> formed; Simpson bridged the <a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23gap">gap</a>. As the peloton began to close in, he tried to <a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23attack">attack</a>. Although he was brought back each time, Simpson placed fourth in a sprint for the best finish to date by a British rider. He was praised by the winner, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Darrigade">André Darrigade</a> of France, who thought that without Simpson's work on the front, the breakaway would have been caught. Darrigade helped him enter criteriums for extra money. His fourth place earned Simpson his nickname, "Major Simpson", from French sports newspaper "<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe">L'Équipe</a>". They ran the headline: ""Les carnets du Major Simpson"" ("The notes of Major Simpson"), referencing the 1950s series of books, "Les carnets du Major Thompson" by <a href="Pierre%20Daninos">Pierre Daninos</a>.

Simpson moved up to 's first team, , for the end-of-season one-day <a href="Classic%20cycle%20races">classic races</a>. In his first appearance in the <a href="1959%20Giro%20di%20Lombardia">Giro di Lombardia</a>, one of the <a href="Cycling%20monument">five "monuments" of cycling</a>, he retired with a tyre puncture while in the lead group of riders. In Simpson's last race of the season, he finished fourth in the <a href="Trofeo%20Baracchi">Trofeo Baracchi</a>, a two-man <a href="team%20time%20trial">team time trial</a> with <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Saint">Gérard Saint</a>, racing against his boyhood idol, Fausto Coppi; it was Coppi's final race before his death. Simpson finished the season with twenty-eight wins.

His first major race of the 1960 season was the one-day "monument" <a href="1960%20Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a> in March, in which the organisers introduced the <a href="Poggio%20di%20San%20Remo">Poggio climb</a> (the final climb) to keep the race from finishing with a <a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23bunch%20sprint">bunch sprint</a>. Simpson broke clear from a breakaway group over the first climb, the <a href="Passo%20del%20Turchino">Turchino</a>, leading the race for before being caught. He lost contact over the Poggio, finishing in 38th place. In April he moved to the Porte de Clichy district of <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, sharing a small apartment with his teammate Robinson.

Days after his move, Simpson rode in <a href="1960%20Paris%E2%80%93Roubaix">Paris–Roubaix</a>, known as "The Hell of the North", the first cycling race to be shown live on <a href="Eurovision%20%28network%29">Eurovision</a>. He launched an attack as an early breakaway, riding alone at the front for , but was caught around a mile from the finish at <a href="Roubaix%20Velodrome">Roubaix Velodrome</a>, coming in ninth. Simpson rode a lap of honour after the race at the request of the emotional crowd. His televised effort gained him attention throughout Europe. He then won the <a href="Mont%20Faron">Mont Faron</a> hill climb and the overall <a href="general%20classification">general classification</a> of the , his first overall win in a professional stage race. He planned to ride in the <a href="Manx%20Trophy">Isle of Man International</a> road race, excited to see to his home fans. There were rumours, which proved correct, that the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Police">Royal Military Police</a> were waiting for him at the airport, so he decided not to travel. This was the last he heard from the authorities regarding his call-up. The British Cycling Federation fined him £25 for his absence.
In June, Simpson made his <a href="Grand%20Tour%20%28cycling%29">Grand Tour</a> debut in the <a href="1960%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> aged 22. Rapha "<a href="directeur%20sportif">directeur sportif</a>" (team manager) <a href="Raymond%20Louviot">Raymond Louviot</a> opposed his participation, but since the race was contested by national teams Simpson accepted the invitation from the British squad. During the first stage, he was part of a thirteen-rider breakaway which finished over two minutes in front of the field; he crashed on the <a href="cinder%20track">cinder track</a> at <a href="King%20Baudouin%20Stadium">Heysel Stadium</a> in Brussels, finishing thirteenth, but received the same time as the winner. Later that day he finished ninth in the time trial, moving up to fifth place overall. During the third stage Simpson was part of a breakaway with two French riders who repeatedly attacked him, forcing him to chase and use energy needed for the finish; he finished third, missing the thirty-second bonus for a first-place finish, which would have put him in the overall race leader's <a href="General%20classification%20in%20the%20Tour%20de%20France">yellow jersey</a>. He dropped to ninth overall by the end of the first week. During stage ten, Simpson crashed descending the <a href="Col%20d%27Aubisque">Col d'Aubisque</a> in the Pyrenees but finished the stage in fourteenth place. In the following stage he was dropped, exhausted, from a chasing group; failing to recover. He finished the Tour in twenty-ninth place overall, losing in weight over the three weeks.

After the Tour, Simpson rode criteriums around Europe until crashing in central France; he returned home to Paris and checked himself into a hospital. Following a week's bed-rest, he rode in the <a href="1960%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">road world championships</a> at the <a href="Sachsenring">Sachsenring</a> in East Germany. During the race Simpson stopped to adjust his shoes on the right side of the road and was hit from behind by a car, sustaining a cut to his head which required five stitches. In the last of the classics, the <a href="1960%20Giro%20di%20Lombardia">Giro di Lombardia</a>, he struggled, finishing eighty-fourth. Simpson had been in constant contact with Helen, who was now working in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, Germany, meeting with her between races. They became engaged on Christmas Day, and originally planned to marry at the end of 1961, but in fact wed on 3 January 1961 in Doncaster, Yorkshire.

Simpson's first major event of the 1961 season was the <a href="1961%20Paris%E2%80%93Nice">Paris–Nice</a> stage race in March. In stage three he helped his team win the team time trial and took the general classification lead by three seconds; however, he lost it in the next stage. In the final stages of the race Simpson's attacks were thwarted, and he finished fifth overall.
On 26 March, Simpson rode in the one-day <a href="1961%20Tour%20of%20Flanders">Tour of Flanders</a>. With 's <a href="Nino%20Defilippis">Nino Defilippis</a>, he chased down an early breakaway. Simpson worked with the group; with about to go he attacked, followed by Defilippis. The finish, three circuits around the town of <a href="Wetteren">Wetteren</a>, was flat; Defilippis, unlike Simpson, was a <a href="Cycling%20sprinter">sprinter</a> and was expected to win. One kilometre from the finish, Simpson launched a sprint; he eased off with 300 m to go, tricking Defilippis into thinking he was exhausted. As Defilippis passed, Simpson jumped again to take victory, becoming the first Briton to win a "monument" classic. Defilippis protested that the finishing banner had been blown down, and he did not know where the finish was; however, the judges noted that the finish line was clearly marked on the road itself. Defilippis' team asked Simpson to agree to a tie, saying no Italian had won a classic since 1953. He replied: "An Englishman had not won one since 1896!"

A week later, Simpson rode in <a href="1961%20Paris%E2%80%93Roubaix">Paris–Roubaix</a> in the hope of bettering his previous year's ninth place. As the race reached the <a href="Sett%20%28paving%29">paved</a> section he went on a solo attack, at which point he was told that rider <a href="Raymond%20Poulidor">Raymond Poulidor</a> was chasing him down. Simpson increased his speed, catching the publicity and press vehicles ahead (known as the "<a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23caravane">caravane</a>"). A press car swerved to avoid a pothole; this forced him into a roadside ditch. Simpson fell, damaging his front wheel and injuring his knee. He found his team car and collected a replacement wheel, but by then the front of the race had passed. Back in the race he crashed twice more, finishing 88th.

At Simpson's next race, the four-day Grand Prix d'Eibar, his first in Spain, his knee injury still bothered him. He won the second stage, but was forced to quit during the following stage. His injury had not healed, even after treatment by various specialists, but for financial reasons he was forced to enter the <a href="1961%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in his knee, which reduced the inflammation. Once healed, he competed in the <a href="1961%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">road world championships</a> in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to <a href="Peter%20Post">Peter Post</a> of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.

Helen became pregnant; Simpson's apartment in Paris was now unsuitable and a larger home in France was not in their means. In October, with help from his friend, Albert Beurick, they moved into a small cottage in Ghent. Low on funds, Simpson earned money in one-day track races in Belgium.

Simpson's contract with Rapha-Gitane-Dunlop had ended with the 1961 season. Tour de France winner <a href="Jacques%20Anquetil">Jacques Anquetil</a> signed with them for 1962, but Simpson wanted to lead a team, and signed with for the 1962 season. After training camp at <a href="Lod%C3%A8ve">Lodève</a> in southern France, he rode in <a href="1962%20Paris%E2%80%93Nice">Paris–Nice</a>. He helped his team win the stage-3a team time trial and finished second overall, behind 's <a href="Jef%20Planckaert">Jef Planckaert</a>. He was unable to ride in <a href="1962%20Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a> when its organisers limited the race to Italian-based teams; instead he rode in <a href="1962%20Gent%E2%80%93Wevelgem">Gent–Wevelgem</a>, finishing sixth, then defended his <a href="Tour%20of%20Flanders">Tour of Flanders</a> title. At the end of the latter, Simpson was in a select group of riders at the head of the race. Although he led over each of the final climbs, at the finish he finished fifth and won the <a href="King%20of%20the%20Mountains">King of the Mountains</a> prize. A week later Simpson finished thirty-seventh in <a href="1962%20Paris%E2%80%93Roubaix">Paris–Roubaix</a>, delayed by a crash.
Coming into the <a href="1962%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>, Simpson was leader of his team; it was the first time since 1929 that company teams were allowed to compete. He finished ninth in the first stage, in a group of twenty-two riders who finished over eight minutes ahead of the rest. Simpson's team finished second to in the stage-2b team time trial; he was in seventh place in the general classification, remaining in the top ten the rest of the first week. During stage 8a he was in a thirty-rider group which gained about six minutes, moving him to second overall behind teammate André Darrigade. At the end of the eleventh stage Simpson was third in the overall, over a minute behind race leader <a href="Willy%20Schroeders">Willy Schroeders</a> () and fifty-one seconds behind Darrigade. Stage twelve from <a href="Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pau</a> to Saint-Gaudens, the hardest stage of the 1962 Tour (known as the "<a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23circle%20of%20death">Circle of Death</a>"), was the Tour's first mountain stage. Simpson saw an opportunity to lead the race. The team now solely concentrated on his interests, since Darrigade was a sprinter and would no longer be involved in the general classification. As the peloton reached the <a href="Col%20du%20Tourmalet">Col du Tourmalet</a>, Simpson attacked with a small group of select riders, finishing eighteenth place in a bunch sprint. As he finished ahead of all the other leaders in the general classification, he became the overall new leader of race, and the first British rider to wear the leader's yellow jersey. Simpson lost the lead on the following stage, a short time trial ending with a steep uphill finish at <a href="Superbagn%C3%A8res">Superbagnères</a>. He finished thirty-first and dropped to sixth overall. On stage nineteen he advanced recklessly descending the <a href="Col%20de%20Porte">Col de Porte</a> in the Alps, crashing on a bend and only saved from falling over the edge by a tree, leaving him with a broken left middle finger. He lost almost eleven minutes in the next stage's time trial, finishing the Tour at Paris' <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a> stadium 17 minutes and 9 seconds behind in 6th place.

After the Tour Simpson rode criteriums before the <a href="1962%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">road world championships</a> in Salò, Italy, where he retired after missing a large breakaway. He began riding <a href="six-day%20racing">six-day</a> track races into his winter break. In December he made an appearance at the Champions' Concert cycling awards held at <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in London. Separately, he won the British Cycling Federation's Personality of the Year. Simpson and Helen were expecting their second child and upgraded to a larger house in <a href="Sint-Amandsberg">Sint-Amandsberg</a>, a sub-municipality of Ghent.

 withdrew its sponsorship of the Gitane team for the 1963 season. Simpson was contracted to their manager, Raymond Louviot; Louviot was rejoining and Simpson could follow, but he saw that as a step backwards. bought the contract from Louviot, which ran until the end of the season. Simpson's season opened with Paris–Nice; he fell out of contention after a series of tyre punctures in the opening stages, using the rest of the race as training. He withdrew from the race on the final stage to rest for his next race, <a href="1963%20Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a>; after breaking away by himself he stopped beside the road, which annoyed his fellow riders. At Milan–San Remo, Simpson was in a four-rider breakaway; his tyre punctured, and although he got back to the front, he finished nineteenth. He placed third in the Tour of Flanders in a three-rider sprint. In <a href="1963%20Paris%E2%80%93Roubaix">Paris–Roubaix</a> Simpson worked for teammate, and winner, <a href="Emile%20Daems">Emile Daems</a>, finishing ninth. In the one-day <a href="Paris%E2%80%93Brussels">Paris–Brussels</a> he was in a breakaway near the Belgian border; with remaining he was left with world road race champion <a href="Jean%20Stablinski">Jean Stablinski</a> of , who attacked on a cobbled climb in Alsemberg outside Brussels. Simpson's bike slipped a gear, and Stablinski stayed away for the victory. After his second-place finish, Simpson led the <a href="Super%20Prestige%20Pernod%20International">Super Prestige Pernod International</a> season-long competition for world's best cyclist. The following week he raced in the <a href="Ardennes%20classics">Ardennes classics</a>, placing thirty-third in <a href="1963%20Li%C3%A8ge%E2%80%93Bastogne%E2%80%93Li%C3%A8ge">Liège–Bastogne–Liège</a>, after he rode alone for about before being caught in the closing kilometres.
On 26 May, Simpson rode in the one-day, <a href="Bordeaux%E2%80%93Paris">Bordeaux–Paris</a>. Also known as the "Derby of the Road", it was the longest he had ever ridden. The race began at 1:58 am; the initial were unpaced until the town of <a href="Ch%C3%A2tellerault">Châtellerault</a>, where <a href="derny">derny</a>s (motorised bicycles) paced each rider to the finish. Simpson broke away in a group of three riders. Simpson's pacer, Fernand Wambst, increased his speed, and Simpson dropped the other two. He caught the lead group, thirteen minutes ahead, over a distance of . Simpson attacked, and with remaining, opening a margin of two minutes. His lead steadily increased, and he finished in the Parc des Princes over five minutes ahead of teammate <a href="Piet%20Rentmeester">Piet Rentmeester</a>.

Simpson announced that he would not ride the Tour de France, concentrating on the world road championships instead. Before, he won the Isle of Man International in treacherous conditions where only sixteen out of seventy riders finished. At the <a href="1963%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">road world championships</a> in Ronse, Belgium, the Belgians controlled the race until Simpson broke free, catching two riders ahead: <a href="Henry%20Anglade">Henry Anglade</a> (France) and <a href="Seamus%20Elliott">Seamus Elliott</a> (Ireland). Anglade was dropped, and Elliott refused to work with Simpson. They were caught; the race finished in a bunch sprint, with Simpson crossing the line in 29th. Simpson's season ended with six-day races across Europe and an invitation only race on the Pacific island of <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, along with other European riders. He skipped his usual winter training schedule for his first skiing holiday at <a href="Saint-Gervais-les-Bains">Saint-Gervais-les-Bains</a> in the Alps, taking Helen and his two young daughters, Jane and Joanne.

After a training camp near Nice in southern France Simpson rode in the one-day <a href="Kuurne%E2%80%93Brussels%E2%80%93Kuurne">Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne</a> in Belgium, finishing second to 's <a href="Arthur%20Decabooter">Arthur Decabooter</a>. The conditions were so cold, he only completed the race to keep warm. Albert Beurick started Simpson's supporters club at the Café Den Engel, raising £250 for him in the first nine months. In <a href="1964%20Paris%E2%80%93Nice">Paris–Nice</a>, his tyre punctured during stage four, losing five minutes and used the rest of the race for training.
On 19 March, two days later, Simpson rode in <a href="1964%20Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a>. Before the race, French journalist <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Latour">René de Latour</a> advised Simpson not to attack early: "If you feel good then keep it for the last hour of the race." In the final , Simpson escaped in group of four riders, which including the 1961 winner, Poulidor of . On final climb, the Poggio, Poulidor launched a series of attacks on the group; only Simpson managed to stay with him and they crossed the summit and descended into Milan. With 500 m to go, Simpson began his sprint; Poulidor could not respond, leaving Simpson to take the victory with a record average speed of .

Simpson spent the next two months training for the <a href="1964%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> at the end of June. After the first week of the Tour, Simpson was in tenth place overall. On the ninth stage, he was part of 22-rider breakaway which finished together at Monaco's <a href="Stade%20Louis%20II%20%281939%29">Stade Louis II</a>; he placed second to Anquetil, moving up to eighth overall. The next day, he finished 20th in the time trial.

He finished the Tour in 14th place overall. Simpson later discovered that he rode the Tour suffering from <a href="Cestoda">tapeworms</a>.

After the race, Simpson prepared for the <a href="1964%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">world road championships</a> with distance training and criteriums. At the world championships on 3 September, the road race consisted of twenty-four laps of a varying circuit at <a href="Sallanches">Sallanches</a> in the French Alps. Simpson crashed on the third lap while descending in wet conditions, damaging a pedal. He got back to the peloton, launching a solo attack on a descent; he then chased down the group of four leaders with two laps to go. On the last lap he was dropped by three riders, finishing six seconds behind. On 17 October, Simpson rode in the <a href="1964%20Giro%20di%20Lombardia">Giro di Lombardia</a>. Halfway through the race he was given the wrong "<a href="Glossary%20of%20bicycling%23musette">musette</a>" (bag) by his team in the <a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23feed%20zone">feed zone</a>, and threw it away. With the head of the race reduced to five riders, <a href="Molteni">Molteni</a>'s <a href="Gianni%20Motta">Gianni Motta</a> attacked. Simpson was the only one who could follow, but he began to feel the effects of not eating. Motta gave him part of his food, which sustained him for a while. On the final climb Simpson led Motta, but was exhausted. Over the remaining of flat terrain, Motta dropped him; Simpson cracked, and was repeatedly overtaken, finishing twenty-first. He closed the year riding track races.

The Simpson family spent Christmas in England, before a trip to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, where Simpson injured himself skiing, suffering a broken foot and a sprained ankle. He recovered, riding six-day races. At the Antwerp six-day, he dropped out on the fourth day with a cold. His cold worsened and he missed most of March. He abandoned <a href="1965%20Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a> at the foot of the Poggio. On 11 April, he finished seventh in <a href="1965%20Paris%E2%80%93Roubaix">Paris–Roubaix</a> after crashing in the lead group. The crash forced him to miss the Tour of Flanders as he struggled to walk on his injured foot. In <a href="1965%20Li%C3%A8ge%E2%80%93Bastogne%E2%80%93Li%C3%A8ge">Liège–Bastogne–Liège</a> he attacked with 's <a href="Felice%20Gimondi">Felice Gimondi</a>, catching an early break. They worked together for , until Gimondi gave up. Simpson rode alone before slipping on oil mixed with water; he stayed with the front group, finishing tenth.

He followed with an appearance at Bordeaux–Paris. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mah%C3%A9">François Mahé</a> () went on a lone break, Simpson attacked in pursuit, followed by Jean Stablinski. Simpson's derny broke down, and he was delayed changing motorbikes. He caught Stablinski, and was joined by Anquetil. Outside Paris Mahé was caught and dropped, after on his own. Anquetil won the race by fifty-seven seconds ahead of Stablinski, who beat Simpson in a sprint. Peugeot manager ordered Simpson to ride the <a href="Grand%20Prix%20du%20Midi%20Libre">Midi Libre</a> stage race to earn a place in the <a href="1965%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>, and he finished third overall. The 1965 Tour was considered open due to Anquetil's absence, and Simpson was among the riders favoured by "L'Équipe". During stage nine he injured his hand crashing on the descent of the Col d'Aubisque in the Pyrenees, finishing tenth in the stage and seventh in general classification. Simpson developed bronchitis after stage fifteen and <a href="Glossary%20of%20cycling%23crack">cracked</a> on the next stage, losing nearly nineteen minutes. His hand became infected, but he rode the next three stages before the Tour doctor stopped him from racing. He was taken to hospital, where they operated on his hand and treated him for blood poisoning, bronchitis and a kidney infection.
After ten days off his bike, Simpson was only contracted to three post-Tour criteriums. His training for the <a href="1965%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">road world championships</a> included <a href="Kermesse%20%28cycling%29">kermesse</a> circuit races in Flanders. Simpson's last race before the world championships was the <a href="Paris%E2%80%93Luxembourg">Paris–Luxembourg</a> stage race, riding as a super-"<a href="domestique">domestique</a>" (lieutenant). On 5 September, Simpson rode in the <a href="1965%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20road%20race">road race</a> at the world championships in <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a>, Spain. The race was a hilly circuit of fourteen laps. The British team had no support; Simpson and his friend Albert Beurick obtained food and drink by stealing from other teams. During the first lap, a strong break was begun by British rider <a href="Barry%20Hoban">Barry Hoban</a>. As his lead stretched to one minute, Simpson and teammates <a href="Vin%20Denson">Vin Denson</a> and <a href="Alan%20Ramsbottom">Alan Ramsbottom</a> bridged the gap, followed by Germany's Rudi Altig. Hoban kept the pace high enough to prevent any of the favourites from joining. Simpson and Altig broke clear with two-and-a-half laps remaining, staying together until the final kilometre, when Simpson launched his sprint; he held off Altig for victory by three bike lengths, becoming the first British world road race champion.

On 16 October, Simpson rode in the <a href="1965%20Giro%20di%20Lombardia">Giro di Lombardia</a>, which featured five mountain passes. He escaped with Motta, and dropped him before the finish in <a href="Como">Como</a> to win his third "monument" classic over three minutes ahead of the rest. Simpson was the second world champion to win in Italy; the first was <a href="Alfredo%20Binda">Alfredo Binda</a> in 1927. Simpson was offered lucrative contracts by teams, including who were prepared to pay him the year's salary in advance. He could not escape his contract with Peugeot, which ran until the end of the 1967 season. For the next three weeks he rode contract races, riding an estimated . He rode 18 races, with each earning him £300–£350.

Simpson ended the year second to Anquetil in the Super Prestige Pernod International, and won the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" Sportsman of the Year, the <a href="Sports%20Journalists%27%20Association">Sports Journalists' Association</a> Sportsman of the Year, presented by the Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, and the <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">BBC Sports Personality of the Year</a>. In British cycling Simpson won the British Cycling Federation Personality of the Year and the <a href="Frederick%20Thomas%20Bidlake">Bidlake</a> Memorial Prize. He was given the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">freedom</a> of Sint-Amandsberg; his family, including his parents, were driven in an open-top car along the crowd-lined route from the Café Den Engel to the .
As in the previous winter, Simpson went on a skiing holiday. On 25 January he fell, breaking his right <a href="tibia">tibia</a>, and his leg was in a plaster cast until the end of February. He missed contract races, crucial training and most of the spring classics. Simpson began riding again in March, and in late April started, but did not finish, <a href="1966%20Li%C3%A8ge%E2%80%93Bastogne%E2%80%93Li%C3%A8ge">Liège–Bastogne–Liège</a>.
Simpson's injury did not stop the press from naming him a favourite for the <a href="1966%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>. He was subdued in the race until stage twelve, when he forced a breakaway with Altig (Molteni), finishing second. Simpson again finished second in the next stage, jumping clear of the peloton in a three-rider group in the final kilometres. After the stage he was eighteenth overall, over seven minutes down. Simpson moved up to 16th after finishing 5th in stage 14b – a short time trial. As the race reached the Alps, he decided to make his move. During stage sixteen he attacked on the descent of the first of three cols, the <a href="Col%20de%20la%20Croix%20de%20Fer">Croix de Fer</a>. He crashed but continued, attacking again. Simpson was joined by 's <a href="Julio%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Julio Jiménez</a> on the climb of the <a href="Col%20du%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9graphe">Télégraphe</a> to the <a href="Col%20du%20Galibier">Galibier</a>. Simpson was caught by a chase group descending the Galibier before he crashed again, knocked off his bike by a press motorcycle. The crash required five stitches in his arm. The next day he struggled to hold the handlebars and could not use the brake lever with his injured arm, forcing him to abandon. His answer to journalists asking about his future was, "I don't know. I'm heartbroken. My season is ruined."

After recovering from his injury Simpson rode 40 criteriums in 40 days, capitalising on his world championship and his attacks in the Tour. He retired from the <a href="1966%20UCI%20Road%20World%20Championships">road world championships</a> at the Nürburgring with <a href="cramp">cramp</a>. His road season ended with retirements from autumn classics Paris–Tours and the Giro di Lombardia. He rode six-day races, finishing fourteenth in the winter rankings. The misfortune he endured during the season made him the first rider named as a victim of the "<a href="curse%20of%20the%20rainbow%20jersey">curse of the rainbow jersey</a>". For the winter Simpson took his family to the island of <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, planning the build of his retirement home.

Simpson's primary objective for 1967 was overall victory in the <a href="1967%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a>; in preparation, he planned to ride stage races instead of one-day classics. Simpson felt his chances were good because this Tour was contested by national, rather than professional teams. He would lead the British team, which – although one of the weakest – would support him totally, unlike Peugeot. During Simpson's previous three years with Peugeot, he was only guaranteed a place on their Tour team if he signed with them for the following year. Free to join a new team for the 1968 season, he was offered at least ten contracts; Simpson had a verbal agreement with Italian team Salvarani, and would share its leadership with Felice Gimondi. In an interview with "Cycling" (now <a href="Cycling%20Weekly">Cycling Weekly</a>) journalist, Ken Evans, in April, Simpson revealed his intention to attempt the hour record in the 1967 season. He also said he wanted retire from road racing aged 33, to ride on the track and spend more time with his family.
In March he rode in the <a href="1967%20Paris%E2%80%93Nice">Paris–Nice</a>. After stage two his teammate, <a href="Eddy%20Merckx">Eddy Merckx</a>, took the overall lead. Simpson moved into the lead the next day as part of a breakaway, missed by Merckx, which finished nearly twenty minutes ahead. Merckx thought Simpson double-crossed him, but Simpson was a passive member of the break. At the start of stage six, Simpson was in second place behind 's <a href="Rolf%20Wolfshohl">Rolf Wolfshohl</a>. Merckx drew clear as the race approached Mont Faron, with Simpson following. They stayed together until the finish in <a href="Hy%C3%A8res">Hyères</a>, with Simpson allowing Merckx to take first place. Simpson finished over a minute ahead of Wolfshohl, putting him in the race leader's white jersey. He held the lead in the next two stages to win the race. Three days later Simpson and Merckx both raced in <a href="1967%20Milan%E2%80%93San%20Remo">Milan–San Remo</a>. Simpson escaped early in a five-rider breakaway lasting about , before Merckx won in a bunch sprint with assistance from Simpson, who finished in seventieth placed. After of <a href="1967%20Paris%E2%80%93Roubaix">Paris–Roubaix</a>, Simpson's bike was unridable and he retired from the race.

In late April Simpson rode in his first <a href="1967%20Vuelta%20a%20Espa%C3%B1a">Vuelta a España</a>, using the eighteen-stage race to prepare for the Tour. During stage two a breakaway group gained over thirteen minutes, dashing his hopes for a high placing. Simpson nearly quit the race before the fifth stage, from Salamanca to Madrid, but rode it because it was easier to get home by air from Madrid. He won the stage, attacking from a breakaway, and finished second in stage seven. On the eleventh stage, concluding in Andorra, Simpson rode away from the peloton on his own. With remaining, he began to lose control of his bike and was halted by Peugeot manager Gaston Plaud until he had recovered, by which time the race had passed. In an interview with "L'Équipe"'s Philippe Brunel in February 2000, Tour de France physician <a href="Pierre%20Dumas">Pierre Dumas</a> revealed that Simpson told him that he was taken to hospital during the Vuelta. Simpson won stage sixteen, which ended in San Sebastián, and finished the Vuelta thirty-third overall.

Simpson was determined to make an impact in the Tour de France; in his eighth year as a professional cyclist, he hoped for larger appearance fees in post-Tour criteriums to help secure his financial future after retirement. His plan was to finish in the top three, or to wear the yellow jersey at some point in the race. He targeted three key stages, one of which was the thirteenth, over <a href="Mont%20Ventoux">Mont Ventoux</a>, and planned to ride conservatively until the race reached the mountains. In the prologue, Simpson finished thirteenth. After the first week he was in sixth place overall, leading the favourites. As the race crossed the Alps, Simpson fell ill, across the Col du Galibier, with diarrhoea and stomach pains. Unable to eat, he finished stage ten in 16th place and dropped to seventh overall as his rivals passed him. Teammate Vin Denson advised Simpson to limit his losses and accept what he had. He placed in 39th position on stage 11 and 7th on 12. In Marseille, on the evening before stage thirteen, Simpson's manager, Daniel Dousset, pressured him for good results. Plaud begged Simpson to quit the race.
The thirteenth stage (13 July) of the 1967 Tour de France measured ; it started in Marseille, crossing Mont Ventoux (the "Giant of Provence") before finishing in Carpentras. At dawn Tour doctor, Pierre Dumas, met journalist, Pierre Chany, near his hotel. Dumas noted the warm temperature, "If the boys stick their nose in a 'topette' [bag of drugs] today, we could have a death on our hands." At the start line, a journalist noticed Simpson looked tired and asked him if the heat was the problem. Simpson replied, "No, it's not the heat, it's the Tour."

As the race reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpson's team mechanic Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid back on his water bottle as he exited a building. Race "<a href="Commissaire%20%28cycling%29">commissaire</a>" (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting <a href="brandy">brandy</a> in his bottle. Near the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture. Simpson was in the front group before slipping back to a group of chasers about a minute behind. He then began losing control of his bike, zig-zagging across the road. A kilometre from the summit, Simpson fell off his bike. Team manager Alec Taylor and Hall arrived in the team car to help him. Hall tried to persuade Simpson to stop, saying: "Come on Tom, that's it, that's your Tour finished", but Simpson said he wanted to continue. Taylor said, "If Tom wants to go on, he goes". Noticing his toe straps were still undone, Simpson said, "Me straps, Harry, me straps!" They got him on his bike and pushed him off. Simpson's last words, as remembered by Hall, were "On, on, on." Hall estimated Simpson rode a further before he began to wobble, and was held upright by spectators; he was unconscious, with his hands locked on the handlebars. Hall and a nurse from the Tour's medical team took turns giving Simpson <a href="Artificial%20ventilation">mouth-to-mouth resuscitation</a>, before Dumas arrived with an oxygen mask. Approximately forty minutes after his collapse, a police helicopter took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:40 p.m. Two empty tubes and a half-full one of <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>s, one of which was labelled "Tonedron", were found in the rear pocket of his jersey. The official cause of death was "heart failure caused by exhaustion."
On the next racing day, the other riders were reluctant to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. France's Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Hoban won the stage, although many thought the stage winner should have been Denson, Simpson's close friend. Media reports suggested that his death was caused by <a href="heat%20exhaustion">heat exhaustion</a>, until, on 31 July 1967 British journalist <a href="J.%20L.%20Manning">J. L. Manning</a> of the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" broke the news about a formal connection between drugs and Simpson's death. French authorities confirmed that Simpson had traces of amphetamine in his body, impairing his judgement and allowing him to push himself beyond his limits. His death contributed to the introduction of mandatory testing for performance-enhancing drugs in cycling, leading to tests in 1968 at the <a href="1968%20Giro%20d%27Italia">Giro d'Italia</a>, <a href="1968%20Tour%20de%20France">Tour de France</a> and <a href="1968%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Olympics</a>. Simpson was buried in Harworth Cemetery, after a service at the 12th-century village church attended by an estimated 5,000 mourners, including Peugeot teammate Eddy Merckx, the only continental rider in attendance. The <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> on Simpson's gravestone in Harworth cemetery reads, "His body ached, his legs grew tired, but still he would not give in", taken from a card left by his brother, Harry, following his death.

Unlike the majority of his contemporaries, Simpson was open about the use of drugs in professional cycling. In 1960, interviewed by <a href="Chris%20Brasher">Chris Brasher</a> for "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" newspaper, Simpson spoke about his understanding of how riders could beat him, saying: "I know from the way they ride the next day they are taking dope. I don't want to have to take it – I have too much respect for my body." Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, "<a href="The%20People">The People</a>", at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked about drugs by <a href="Eamonn%20Andrews">Eamonn Andrews</a> on the BBC <a href="Home%20Service">Home Service</a> radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might get to the top but would not stay there.

In his biography of Simpson, "Put Me Back on My Bike", <a href="William%20Fotheringham">William Fotheringham</a> quoted Alan Ramsbottom as saying, "Tom went on the [1967] Tour de France with one suitcase for his kit and another with his stuff, drugs and recovery things", which Fotheringham said was confirmed by Simpson's roommate <a href="Colin%20Lewis">Colin Lewis</a>. Ramsbottom added, "Tom took a lot of chances. He took a lot of it [drugs]. I remember him taking a course of <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a> to build up to some big event. He showed me the box, and had to take one every few days." although he implied that other competitors were involved. Lewis recalled Simpson acquiring a small box at their hotel. Simpson explained to him: "That's my year's supply of <a href="Mickey%20Finn%20%28drugs%29">Micky Finns</a>'. That lot cost me £800."

Commentator and Simpson's close friend David Saunders stated in his 1971 book, "Cycling in the Sixties", that although he did not condone Simpson's use of drugs, he thought it was not the reason for his death. He said: "I am quite convinced that Simpson killed himself because he just did not know when to stop. All his racing life he had punished his frail body, pushing it to the limits of endurance with his tremendous will-power and single-mindedness and, on Mont Ventoux, he pushed it too far, perhaps the drug easing the pain of it all." Saunders went on to say that Simpson was not alone in the taking of drugs in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because "he was not going to be beaten by a pill".

Simpson in his adolescence was described as fearsome in descent by fellow Scala Wheelers club member George Shaw, who explained that if Simpson dropped behind on a climb, he would come back on the descent. Simpson's risk-taking on descents was evident throughout his career, crashing in four out of the seven Tours de France he competed in. Track rider Norman Sheil recalled: "When racing on a banked velodrome, Simpson would sometimes ride up the advertising boards at the top of the bankings, <a href="Wall%20of%20Death">Wall of Death</a>-style, to please the crowds." Simpson's death was attributed to his unwillingness to admit defeat ascending Mont Ventoux. He described a <a href="near-death%20experience">near-death experience</a> during a race in 1964, the Trofeo Baracchi two-man time trial, to Vin Denson, who recalled: "He said he felt peace of mind and wasn't afraid to die. He said he would have been happy dying."

Simpson looked for any advantage over his opponents. He made his own saddle, a design which is now standard. During his time with Peugeot, he rode bikes made by Italian manufacturer <a href="Masi%20Bicycles">Masi</a> that resembled <a href="Cycles%20Peugeot">Peugeots</a>. Simpson was obsessed with dieting since 1956, when he was mentored by Cyril Cartwright. Simpson understood the value of fruit and vegetables after reading "Les Cures de jus" by nutritionist Raymond Dextreit; during the winter, he would consume of carrots a day. Other unusual food preferences included pigeons, duck and trout skin, raspberry leaves and garlic in large quantities.
A <a href="granite">granite</a> memorial to Simpson, with the words "Olympic medallist, world champion, British sporting ambassador", stands on the spot where he collapsed and died on Ventoux, one kilometre east of the summit. "Cycling" began a fund for a monument a week after Simpson's death, raising about £1,500. The memorial was unveiled in 1968. It has become a site of <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> for cyclists, who frequently leave cycling-related objects, such as water bottles and caps, in tribute. In nearby Bédoin, a <a href="Commemorative%20plaque">plaque</a> was installed in the town square by journalists following the 1967 Tour. The Harworth and Bircotes Sports and Social Club has a small museum dedicated to Simpson, opened by Belgian cyclist <a href="Lucien%20Van%20Impe">Lucien Van Impe</a> in August 2001. In 1997, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, a small plaque was added to the Mont Ventoux memorial, with the words "There is no mountain too high. Your daughters Jane and Joanne, July 13, 1997", and a replica of the memorial was erected outside the museum. In his adopted hometown of Ghent, there is a <a href="Bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a> of Simpson at the entrance to the Kuipke velodrome. Every year since his death, the Tom Simpson Memorial Race has taken place in Harworth.

Ray Pascoe, a fan, made the 1995 film "Something To Aim At", a project he began in the years following Simpson's death; the film includes interviews with those closest to Simpson. The 2005 documentary "Wheels Within Wheels" follows actor <a href="Simon%20Dutton">Simon Dutton</a> as he searches for people and places in Simpson's life. Dutton's four-year project chronicles the <a href="midlife%20crisis">midlife crisis</a> that sparked his quest to rediscover Simpson. British rider <a href="David%20Millar">David Millar</a> won stage twelve of the <a href="2012%20Tour%20de%20France">2012 Tour de France</a> on the 45th anniversary of Simpson's death; previously banned from cycling for using performance-enhancing drugs, he paid tribute to Simpson and reinforced the importance of learning from his – and Simpson's – mistakes. Millar wrote the introduction for a reissue of Simpson's autobiography, "Cycling Is My Life", published in 2009. In 2010, Simpson was inducted into the <a href="British%20Cycling%20Hall%20of%20Fame">British Cycling Hall of Fame</a>. He inspired "Simpson Magazine", which began in March 2013. According to the magazine's creators, “It was Simpson's spirit and style, his legendary tenacity and his ability to suffer that endeared him to cycling fans everywhere as much as the trophies he won”.

Soon after moving to France in 1959 Simpson met Helen Sherburn. They married in 1961, before moving to Ghent, Belgium, the following year. They had two daughters, Jane (born April 1962) and Joanne (born May 1963), who were brought up, and live, in Belgium. After his death, Helen Simpson married Barry Hoban in December 1969. Simpson is the maternal uncle of retired Belgian-Australian cyclist <a href="Matthew%20Gilmore">Matthew Gilmore</a>, whose father, <a href="Graeme%20Gilmore">Graeme</a>, was also a cyclist. The 2000 book "Mr. Tom: The True Story of Tom Simpson", written by Simpson's nephew, Chris Sidwells, focuses on his career and family life.

Simpson spoke fluent French, and was also competent in Flemish and Italian. He was interested in vintage cars, and his driving and riding styles were similar; Helen remembered, "Driving through the West End of London at , was nothing." In January 1966, Simpson was a guest "castaway" on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>"; his favourite musical piece was "Ari's Theme" from "<a href="Exodus%20%281960%20film%29">Exodus</a>" by the <a href="London%20Festival%20Orchestra">London Festival Orchestra</a>, his book choice was "<a href="The%20Pickwick%20Papers">The Pickwick Papers</a>" and his luxury item was golf equipment. Helen said that she chose his records for the show, since he was not interested in music. Simpson's autobiography, "Cycling Is My Life", was first published in 1966.

Privilege of peerage

The privilege of peerage is the body of special privileges belonging to members of the <a href="British%20peerage">British peerage</a>. It is distinct from <a href="parliamentary%20privilege">parliamentary privilege</a>, which applies only to those peers serving in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> and the members of the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>, while <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> is in session and forty days before and after a Parliamentary session.

The privileges have been lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: the right to be tried by other <a href="peers%20of%20the%20realm">peers of the realm</a> instead of <a href="jury">juries</a> of <a href="commoner">commoner</a>s, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, and access to the Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state. The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as extremely limited in application, if at all. The remaining privilege is not exercised and was recommended for formal abolition in 1999, but has never been formally revoked.

Peers also have several other rights not formally part of the privilege of peerage. For example, they are entitled to use <a href="coronet">coronet</a>s and <a href="supporter">supporter</a>s on their <a href="heraldry">achievements of arms</a>.

The privilege of peerage extends to all <a href="temporal%20peer">temporal peer</a>s and peeresses regardless of their position in relation to the House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate from the privilege, and is held by only some peers (see <a href="History%20of%20reform%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">History of reform of the House of Lords</a>). <a href="Peerage%20of%20Scotland">Scottish peers</a> from the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union 1707</a> and <a href="Peerage%20of%20Ireland">Irish peers</a> from the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201800">Act of Union 1800</a>, therefore, have the privilege of peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">United Kingdom House of Commons</a> but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House. Since 1999, hereditary peers of <a href="Peerage%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Peerage%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Peerage%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, and the <a href="Peerage%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> who are not members of the House of Lords may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the <a href="Peerage%20Act%201963">Peerage Act 1963</a> loses all privileges of peerage. The privilege of peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by marriage loses the privilege upon marrying a <a href="commoner">commoner</a>, but a peeress "<a href="suo%20jure">suo jure</a>" does not. Individuals who hold <a href="courtesy%20title">courtesy title</a>s, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. <a href="Lords%20Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a> (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the privilege of peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.

Just as commoners have a right to trial by a jury of their equals (other commoners), peers and peeresses formerly had a right to trial by other peers. The right of peers to trial by their own order was formalized during the 14th century. A statute passed in 1341 provided:
Whereas before this time the peers of the land have been arrested and imprisoned, and their temporalities, lands, and tenements, goods and cattels, asseized in the King's hands, and some put to death without judgment of their peers: It is accorded and assented, that no peer of the land ... shall be brought in judgment to lose his temporalities, lands, tenements, goods and cattels, nor to be arrested, imprisoned, outlawed, exiled, nor forejudged, nor put to answer, nor be judged, but by award of the said peers in Parliament.
The privilege of trial by peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI of England</a>, <a href="Henry%20Beaufort">Henry Beaufort</a> and <a href="John%20Kemp">John Kemp</a>) found <a href="Eleanor%20Cobham">Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester</a>, guilty of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a> and banished her to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers.

By the reign of <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII of England</a>, there were two methods of trial by peers of the realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the <a href="Lord%20High%20Steward">Lord High Steward</a>. The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward's Court.

In the Lord High Steward's Court, a group of Lords Triers, sitting under the chairmanship of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the <a href="Treason%20Act%201695">Treason Act 1695</a>, passed during the reign of King <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.

In the House of Lords, the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court, and the entire House determined both questions of fact and questions of law as well as the verdict. By convention, <a href="Bishop">Bishop</a>s and <a href="Archbishop">Archbishop</a>s did not vote on the verdict, though they were expected to attend during the course of the trial. They sat until the conclusion of the deliberations, and withdrew from the chamber just prior to the final vote. At the end of the trial, peers voted on the question before them by standing and declaring their verdict by saying "guilty, upon my honour" or "not guilty, upon my honour", starting with the most junior <a href="baron">baron</a> and proceeding in order of precedence ending with the Lord High Steward. For a guilty verdict, a majority of twelve was necessary. The entire House also determined the punishment to be imposed, which had to accord with the law. For capital crimes the punishment was death; the last peer to be executed was <a href="Laurence%20Shirley%2C%204th%20Earl%20Ferrers">Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers</a>, who was hanged for murder in 1760.

From 1547, if a peer or peeress was convicted of a crime, except treason or murder, he or she could claim "privilege of peerage" to escape punishment if it was their first offence. In all, the privilege was exercised five times, until it was formally abolished in 1841 when <a href="James%20Brudenell%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Cardigan">James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan</a>, announced he would claim the privilege and avoid punishment if he was convicted of duelling. He was acquitted before the introduction of the bill.

The last trial in the House of Lords was that of <a href="Edward%20Russell%2C%2026th%20Baron%20de%20Clifford">Edward Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford</a>, in 1935 for manslaughter (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but the Commons ignored it. The right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added an amendment to the <a href="Criminal%20Justice%20Act%201948">Criminal Justice Act 1948</a>, which the Commons accepted. Now peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though peers were themselves excused from jury service until the <a href="House%20of%20Lords%20Act%201999">House of Lords Act 1999</a> restricted this privilege to members of the House of Lords. The right to be excused was abolished on 5 April 2004 by the <a href="Criminal%20Justice%20Act%202003">Criminal Justice Act 2003</a>.

The novel "<a href="Clouds%20of%20Witness">Clouds of Witness</a>" (1926) by <a href="Dorothy%20L.%20Sayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a> depicts the fictional trial in the House of Lords of a duke who is accused of murder. Sayers researched and used the then current trial procedures. "<a href="Kind%20Hearts%20and%20Coronets">Kind Hearts and Coronets</a>" (1949) comedy from <a href="Ealing%20Studios">Ealing Studios</a> features an almost identical scene.

The privilege of freedom from arrest applies to members of both Houses of Parliament, because of the principle that they must, whenever possible, be available to give advice to the Sovereign. Several other nations have copied this provision; the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">Constitution of the United States</a>, for example, provides, "The Senators and Representatives ... shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses." Theoretically, even when Parliament is not sitting, peers enjoy the privilege because they continue to serve the Sovereign as counsellors. However, peers are free from arrest in civil cases only; arrests in criminal matters are not covered by the privilege. Until 1770, a peer's domestic servants were also covered by the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil matters.

Most often the privilege was applied in cases of imprisonment in <a href="debtors%27%20prison">debtors' prison</a>s. In 1870, both imprisonment for debt and the privilege in relation to freedom from arrest for bankruptcy were abolished, and as a result the freedom became extremely limited in practical application. Now, civil proceedings involve arrests only when an individual disobeys a court order. Since 1945, the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil cases has arisen in only two cases: "<a href="Stourton%20v%20Stourton">Stourton v Stourton</a>" (1963) and "Peden International Transport, Moss Bros, The Rowe Veterinary Group and Barclays Bank plc v <a href="Benjamin%20Mancroft%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Mancroft">Lord Mancroft</a>" (1989). In the latter most recent case, the trial judge considered the privilege obsolete and inapplicable, and said in proceedings, "the privilege did not apply—indeed ... it is unthinkable in modern times that, in circumstances such as they are in this case, it should".

The Sovereign is traditionally advised by various counsellors, including the peers of the realm. After the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a>, peers were summoned to form the "<a href="magnum%20concilium">magnum concilium</a>", or Great Council, which was one of the four councils belonging to the Sovereign. The other three were the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>, <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> (which was called the "commune concilium", or Common Council), and judges (who are considered counsellors of the Sovereign on legal matters).

A council composed only of peers was often summoned by early English Kings. Such a council, having been in disuse for centuries, was revived in 1640, when <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> summoned all of the peers of the realm using writs issued under the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a>. Though such a council has not been summoned since then, and was considered obsolete at the time, each peer is commonly considered a counsellor of the Sovereign, and, according to <a href="William%20Blackstone">Sir William Blackstone</a> in 1765, "it is usually looked upon to be the right of each particular peer of the realm, to demand an audience of the King, and to lay before him, with decency and respect, such matters as he shall judge of importance to the <a href="common%20good">public weal</a>."

The privilege of access is no longer exercised, but it is possibly still retained by peers whether members of the House of Lords or not. In 1999, the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege recommended the formal abolition of any remaining privilege of peerage.

At one time, the honour of peers was especially protected by the law; while defamation of a commoner was known as <a href="slander%20and%20libel">libel or slander</a>, the defamation of a peer (or of a <a href="Great%20Officer%20of%20State">Great Officer of State</a>) was called "scandalum magnatum". 
Eighteenth century jurist Sir <a href="William%20Blackstone">William Blackstone</a> opined:"The honour of peers is so highly tendered by the law, that it is much more penal to spread false reports of them, and certain other great officers of the realm, than of other men; scandal against them being called by the peculiar name of "scandalum magnatum", and subject to peculiar punishments by divers ancient statutes."
The <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201275">Statute of Westminster</a> of 1275 provided that "from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any false News or Tales, whereby discord, or occasion of discord or slander may grow between the King and his People, or the Great Men of the Realm." "Scandalum magnatum" was punishable under the aforesaid statute as well as under further laws passed during the reign of <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II</a>. "Scandalum magnatum" was both a tort and a criminal offence. The prohibition on "scandalum magnatum" was first enforced by the King's Council. During the reign of <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>, the <a href="Star%20Chamber">Star Chamber</a>, a court formerly reserved for trial of serious offences such as rioting, assumed jurisdiction over "scandalum magnatum", as well as libel and slander, cases. The court, which sat without a jury and in secret, was often used as a political weapon and a device of royal tyranny, leading to its abolition in 1641; its functions in respect of defamation cases passed to the common law courts. However, the number of cases had already dwindled as the laws of libel, slander and contempt of court developed in its place. In the reign of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, "scandalum magnatum" came briefly back into fashion; it was used by the future <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> against <a href="Titus%20Oates">Titus Oates</a>, by <a href="Charles%20Gerard%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Macclesfield">Lord Gerard</a> against his cousin <a href="Alexander%20Fitton">Alexander Fitton</a>, and by the <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Duke of Beaufort</a> against <a href="John%20Arnold%20of%20Monmouthshire">John Arnold</a>. By the end of the 18th century, however, "scandalum magnatum" was obsolete. The prohibition on it was finally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1887.

Fanciful tales of peers with whimsical privileges circulate, such as that of the right to wear a hat in the presence of the Sovereign. The most persistent example of such a legend is that of the <a href="Baron%20Kingsale">Kingsale</a> hat. According to the fable, <a href="John%20de%20Courcy">John de Courcy</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Ulster">Earl of Ulster</a>, obtained from <a href="John%20of%20England">King John</a> the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. Though the tale is untrue—de Courcy was never made an earl and did not receive such a privilege—several authorities on the peerage have seen fit to repeat it. A 19th-century edition of "<a href="Burke%27s%20Peerage">Burke's Peerage</a>" suggests the origins of the privilege:

To reward his singular performance, King John supposedly granted de Courcy the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. The 1823 edition of "<a href="Debrett%27s%20Peerage">Debrett's Peerage</a>" gives an entirely fictitious account of how <a href="Almericus%20de%20Courcy%2C%2023rd%20Baron%20Kingsale">Almericus de Courcy, 23rd Baron Kingsale</a>, asserted the privilege:

Despite such inaccuracies, the tale has been frequently repeated. Individual privileges that did exist have fallen into disuse—for example the <a href="Manor%20of%20Worksop">Lord of the Manor of Worksop</a> (which is not a peerage) was extended the <a href="Manor%20of%20Worksop%23Privileges">privilege and duty of attending</a> the <a href="coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronation of the British monarch</a> until 1937, but the right was not exercised at the <a href="coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">coronation of Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1953 as the manor was under corporate ownership at the time.

Gerard (archbishop of York)

Gerard (died 21 May 1108) was <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> between 1100 and 1108 and <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> of England from 1085 until 1092. A <a href="Normans">Norman</a>, he was a member of the cathedral clergy at <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> before becoming a <a href="Clerk%23History_and_etymology">royal clerk</a> under King <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William I of England</a> and subsequently his son King <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II Rufus</a>. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishopric of Hereford</a> in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king's hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>, within days of William's death.

Soon after Henry's coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant <a href="Diocese%20of%20York">see of York</a>, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Canterbury">see of Canterbury</a> concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure <a href="The%20Pope">papal</a> recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the <a href="Investiture%20Controversy">Investiture Controversy</a> between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.

Gerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a> after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.

Gerard was the nephew of <a href="Walkelin">Walkelin</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>, and <a href="Simeon%20%28abbot%29">Simon, Abbot of Ely</a>. His parents were Osbert and Anna, and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk. Where he was born and raised is unknown; he is documented as <a href="Cantor%20%28church%29">cantor</a> of <a href="Rouen%20Cathedral">Rouen Cathedral</a>, and <a href="precentor">precentor</a> of the same cathedral, although the date of his appointment to either office is unrecorded. By 1091 he had become <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> of Rouen. He served in the <a href="Chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">royal chancery</a> under successive kings of England, William I and William II.

Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor of England in 1085, and was present at William I's deathbed in 1087. He continued as Chancellor to William Rufus until 1092; what precipitated his loss of office is unclear. He retained the king's trust, for Rufus employed him in 1095 along with <a href="William%20Warelwast">William Warelwast</a> on a diplomatic mission to Pope <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Urban II</a> regarding Archbishop Anselm receiving the <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the sign of an archbishop's authority. Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the <a href="Antipope">Antipope</a> <a href="Antipope%20Clement%20III">Clement III</a> in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody, to dispose of as he saw fit. The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> with a papal legate, <a href="Walter%20of%20Albano">Walter</a> the <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">Cardinal</a> <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Suburbicarian%20Diocese%20of%20Albano">Bishop of Albano</a>, who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm's position as archbishop, and at the king's court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.

Although not yet <a href="Holy%20Orders%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">ordained</a>, Gerard was rewarded with the Bishopric of Hereford, and he was <a href="consecration">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096; his <a href="ordination">ordination</a> as a <a href="deacon">deacon</a> and <a href="Priesthood%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">priest</a> had taken place the previous day. He assisted at the consecration of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> in London on 9 June 1096. He may have been a member of the hunting party in the <a href="New%20Forest">New Forest</a> on 2 August 1100 when Rufus was killed, as he witnessed King Henry I's coronation charter – now known as the <a href="Charter%20of%20Liberties">Charter of Liberties</a> – three days later at Winchester, close by the New Forest. Gerard was present at Henry's coronation that same day, along with <a href="Maurice%20%28Archdeacon%20of%20Le%20Mans%29">Maurice, Bishop of London</a>. Henry was probably crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a> states that Gerard crowned Henry in return for a promise of the first vacant archbishopric. Gerard may have assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.

Gerard became Archbishop of York in December 1100. No source mentions him being <a href="Investiture%20Controversy">invested</a> by the king, but as Anselm urged Pope <a href="Pope%20Paschal%20II">Paschal II</a> to give Gerard his pallium, which he would have been unlikely to do if Gerard had been invested by Henry, that possibility seems remote. At Whitsun in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm's support, deprived <a href="Ranulf%20Flambard">Ranulf Flambard</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, of the lands of the see of Durham, because Ranulf had defected to Henry's elder brother <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a>, who also claimed the English throne. Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric. Soon after his <a href="Translation%20%28ecclesiastical%29">translation</a> to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long <a href="Canterbury%E2%80%93York%20dispute">Canterbury–York dispute</a>. At the 1102 <a href="Synods%20of%20Westminster">Council of Westminster</a>, Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's. He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope, to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding <a href="investiture">investiture</a>s. The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced. Their claim was denied by Anselm's representatives and the pope, who <a href="excommunication">excommunicated</a> Gerard until he recanted.

Gerard secured papal recognition of York's <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitan see</a> for the Scots. He subsequently consecrated Roger as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Orkney">Bishop of Orkney</a>, but refused to consecrate <a href="Thurgot">Thurgot</a> to the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20St%20Andrews">see of St Andrews</a> because Thurgot would not recognise the primacy of York. Gerard gave generously to the monasteries of his diocese; the medieval chronicler <a href="Hugh%20the%20Chantor">Hugh the Chantor</a> stated that Thomas II, Gerard's successor, accused Gerard of having dissipated the diocese's endowment. King <a href="Olaf%20I%20of%20the%20Isle%20of%20Man">Olaf I</a> of Man and the Isles wrote to "G", Archbishop of York, asking for the consecration of "our bishop" by York, but it does not appear to have taken place under Gerard or his successor.

During the first four years of Henry's reign Gerard was one of the king's chief advisors, along with <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert of Meulan</a>, <a href="Counts%20of%20Meulan">Count of Meulan</a> in Normandy and later <a href="Earl%20of%20Leicester">Earl of Leicester</a>. Gerard was one of Henry's greatest supporters among the bishops during the <a href="Investiture%20Controversy">Investiture Crisis</a>. In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between Henry and <a href="Robert%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Robert</a>, the <a href="Count%20of%20Flanders">Count of Flanders</a>, which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between Henry and his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between Henry and King <a href="Philip%20I%20of%20France">Philip I of France</a>. After Gerard's return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham. In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused. From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond of Antioch</a>, who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure. In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did. At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.

Gerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.

Gerard also had an uneasy relationship with his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting <a href="prebend">prebend</a>s but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.

Gerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the "<a href="Quadripartitus">Quadripartitus</a>" and the "<a href="Leges%20Henrici%20Primi">Leges Henrici Primi</a>", two 12th-century law books. The medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> charged Gerard with immorality, avarice and the practice of magic. Gerard encouraged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a language not normally studied at the time. Some chroniclers considered his ownership of a Hebrew <a href="psalter">psalter</a> to be disturbing, seeing it as a sign of heresy or secret Judaism. Among the sins that Malmesbury imputed to him was the study of <a href="Julius%20Firmicus%20Maternus">Julius Firmicus Maternus</a>, a late Roman astrologer, every morning, which to Malmesbury meant that Gerard was a sorcerer. Malmesbury further claimed that Gerard was "lewd and lustful". In Gerard's favour, Anselm regarded him as learned and highly intelligent. Some verses composed by Gerard survive in unpublished form, now in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> manuscript collection as part of manuscript <a href="Cotton%20Titus">Cotton Titus</a> D.xxiv. A collection of his letters circulated in the mid-12th century, part of a bequest made to <a href="Bec%20Abbey">Bec Abbey</a> in 1164 by <a href="Philip%20de%20Harcourt">Philip de Harcourt</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bayeux">Bishop of Bayeux</a>, but it is now lost.

Gerard died suddenly on 21 May 1108, at <a href="Southwell%2C%20Nottinghamshire">Southwell</a>, on his way to London to attend a council. His body was found in an orchard, next to a book of "curious arts", his copy of Julius Firmicus. His canons refused to allow his burial within his cathedral, but their hostility probably owed more to Gerard's attempts to reform their lifestyle than to his alleged interest in sorcery. Gerard was at first buried beside the porch at <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>, but his successor, Thomas, moved the remains inside the cathedral church.

HMS Vanguard (23)

HMS "Vanguard" was a British <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a> built during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> and <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> after the end of the war. She was the biggest and fastest of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, the last battleship to be <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> in the world, and the only ship of her class. 

The Royal Navy anticipated being outnumbered by the combined German and Japanese battleships in the early 1940s, and had therefore started building the s. However the time-consuming construction of the triple-16-inch turrets for the "Lion-class" would delay their completion until 1943 at the earliest. The British had enough guns and turrets in storage to allow one ship of a modified "Lion-class" design with four twin-15-inch turrets to be completed faster than the "Lion-class" vessels that had already been <a href="laid%20down">laid down</a>. 

Work on "Vanguard" was started and stopped several times during the war, and her design was revised several times during her construction to reflect war experience. These stoppages and changes prevented her from being completed before the end of the war.

"Vanguard"s first task after completing her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a> at the end of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a> and his family on the first Royal Tour of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> by a reigning monarch. While refitting after her return, she was selected for another <a href="Royal%20visits%20to%20Australia">Royal Tour of Australia</a> and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George's declining health and "Vanguard" briefly became flagship of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, "Vanguard" was involved in a number of training exercises with <a href="NATO">NATO</a> forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>'s <a href="Coronation%20Review%23Elizabeth%20II">Coronation Review</a>. While she was refitting in 1955, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> announced that the ship was going to be put into <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">reserve</a> upon completion of the work. "Vanguard" was sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> and was broken up beginning in 1960.

By early 1939 it was clear that the first two s could not be delivered before 1943 at the earliest and that further battleship construction would be necessary to match the German and Japanese battleships already under construction. The main constraint on the construction of any new battleships was the limited available capacity and the time required to build large-calibre guns and their gun turrets. Using four existing twin 15-inch mountings offered the possibility of bypassing this bottleneck and allowed the construction of a single fast battleship more quickly than building more "Lion"-class ships. The turrets were originally built for the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s and during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, and were removed during the conversions of these ships to <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s in the 1920s. To save time, the "Lion" design was modified to accommodate the four turrets, and preliminary design work began in July 1939. The square or <a href="transom%20%28nautical%29">transom</a> stern was retained as it was estimated to improve speed at full power by . This made "Vanguard" the only British battleship built with a transom stern as the "Lion"s were never finished.

Design work was suspended on 11 September 1939, after the start of the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, but resumed in February 1940 after the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, expressed an interest in the ship. The design was modified to increase protection against shell splinters on the unprotected sides of the ship's hull, the armour of the secondary armament was increased to resist <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">semi-armour-piercing</a> bombs, and the splinter <a href="Belt%20armor">belt's</a> thickness fore and aft of the main armour belt was reduced by in compensation. A small <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> was added aft, and four <a href="Unrotated%20Projectile">Unrotated Projectile</a> mounts were added to supplement the six octuple-barrel <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">2-pounder</a> <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> mounts already planned.

More pressing commitments forced the preliminary design work to be suspended again in June and when it resumed in October, the design was modified again in light of recent war experience. Greater fuel capacity was added and the armour protection improved but these changes deepened the design's <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> so that it exceeded the limit of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. The thickness of the main belt was reduced by to save weight but the primary method chosen to reduce the draught was to increase the <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> by . This exceeded the width of the <a href="Dock%20%28maritime%29">docks</a> at <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> and <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, which severely limited the number of docks that could handle the ship but these changes were approved by the <a href="Board%20of%20Admiralty">Board of Admiralty</a> on 17 April 1941. The ship had already been ordered on 14 March under the 1940 Emergency War Programme, although the drawings were not turned over to <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">John Brown & Company</a> until ten days later.
"Vanguard"s design was revised again, while the ship was under construction in 1942, to reflect lessons learned from the <a href="Sinking%20of%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20and%20Repulse">loss</a> of the battleship and operations with the other battleships. The space between the inboard and outboard propeller shafts was increased from to prevent a torpedo from wrecking both shafts and watertight access <a href="trunk%20%28structural%29">trunks</a> were added to all spaces below the deep waterline to prevent progressive flooding through open watertight doors and hatches as happened to "Prince of Wales". This change and the relocation of some of the ammunition handling rooms from the lower deck to the middle deck seriously delayed the ship's completion. The design requirement that the guns of 'A' turret be capable of firing straight ahead at 0° of elevation was sacrificed to allow her <a href="freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a> forward to be increased, and her bow was reshaped to make it less prone to shipping water and throwing <a href="sea%20spray">sea spray</a> in <a href="head%20sea">head sea</a>s. The ship's fuel supply was increased from to to prevent the fuel shortage problems suffered by and during their pursuit of the . The Unrotated Projectile mounts were deleted from the design and the light anti-aircraft armament was increased to a total of 76 two-pounders in one quadruple and nine octuple mounts and 24 <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm cannon</a> were also added in 12 twin mounts. Space for these was made available by removing the two <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>s, the <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> and their associated facilities.

A proposal was made in 1942 to convert "Vanguard" to an aircraft carrier. The <a href="Director%20of%20Naval%20Construction">Director of Naval Construction</a> stated that doing so along the lines of the would present no major difficulties but would require six months to redesign the ship. The proposal was formally rejected on 17 July.

"Vanguard" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a beam of and a draught of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She displaced at <a href="Standard%20displacement%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> and at deep load. The ship was significantly larger than her predecessors of the class, almost longer and displaced about more than the older ships at deep load. "Vanguard" was overweight by some , which magnified the difference. The ship had a complete <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a> deep and she was divided into 27 main compartments by watertight <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkheads</a>.

The "King George V"-class ships had been built with almost no <a href="sheer%20%28ship%29">sheer</a> to the main deck forwards to allow 'A' turret to fire straight forward at zero elevation, resulting in those ships being wet forward. "Vanguard" was redesigned as a result of this experience, significant sheer and <a href="flare%20%28ship%29">flare</a> being added to the bow. The ship was well regarded as <a href="seaworthy">seaworthy</a>, able to keep an <a href="wikt%3Aeven%20keel">even keel</a> in rough seas. At full load, "Vanguard" had a <a href="metacentric%20height">metacentric height</a> of .

As a fleet <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, her complement was 115 officers and 1,860 men in 1947. <a href="Air%20conditioning">Air conditioning</a> was provided for many of the ship's control spaces, and <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> insulation was provided on exposed areas of the ship's sides, decks and bulkheads. Steam heating was provided for her armament, instruments, look-out positions and other equipment to make "Vanguard" suitable for operations in the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a>. An <a href="Action%20Information%20Center">Action Information Centre</a> was fitted below the main armour deck with facilities to track aircraft and ships around "Vanguard".

To save design time, the four-shaft unit machinery from the "Lion"-class battleship was duplicated with alternating boiler and engine rooms. "Vanguard" had four sets of single-reduction geared <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbines">Parsons</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s housed in separate engine rooms. Each set consisted of one high-pressure and one low-pressure turbine, driving a <a href="propeller">propeller</a> that was in diameter. The turbines were powered by eight <a href="Admiralty%203-drum%20boiler">Admiralty 3-drum boiler</a>s in four boiler rooms at a working pressure of and temperature of . The engines were designed to produce a total of and a speed of but achieved more than during the ship's <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in July 1946, when she reached a speed of . After trials, the three-bladed propellers on the inboard shafts were replaced by five-bladed propellers in a failed attempt to reduce vibrations of the inboard propeller shafts.

"Vanguard" was designed to carry 4,850 long tons of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> and of <a href="diesel%20fuel">diesel fuel</a>. With a clean bottom, she could steam at a speed of for . The ship had four <a href="turbogenerator">turbogenerator</a>s and four <a href="diesel%20generator">diesel generator</a>s that supplied the common <a href="ring%20main">ring main</a> at 220 <a href="volt">volt</a>s. Their total output of was the largest of any British battleship.

The ship's main armament consisted of eight 42-<a href="caliber%20%28artillery%29">calibre</a> <a href="BL%2015%20inch%20Mk%20I%20naval%20gun">BL 15-inch Mk I guns</a> in four twin hydraulically powered <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, 'A', 'B', 'X' and 'Y' from bow to stern. When the turrets were modernised to the Mk I(N) RP12 design, their maximum elevation was increased from 20° to +30°, although the guns were loaded at +5°. They fired projectiles at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of ; this provided a maximum range of . These guns were also capable of firing the same projectiles while using supercharges which gave a maximum range of . Their rate of fire was two rounds per minute. "Vanguard" carried 100 shells per gun.
The 15-inch turrets had been designed when the customary practice was to place the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> above the shell room and it was not cost-effective to modify the ammunition hoists to accommodate the opposite arrangement, which was adopted after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> demonstrated the dangers of exposing the magazines to long-range gunfire. The ship was provided with a powder-handling room above the shell room to mimic the arrangement that turret's hoists were designed to handle, and another set of hoists moved the propellant charges from the magazines to the powder-handling room. The charges were stowed in cases to reduce their exposure to fire.

The secondary armament consisted of sixteen 50-calibre <a href="QF%205.25%20inch%20gun">QF 5.25-inch Mk I*</a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in eight twin gun mounts. They had a maximum depression of −5° and a maximum elevation of 70°. They fired an <a href="British%20ordnance%20terms%23HE">high-explosive</a> shell at a muzzle velocity of . The improved RP10 spec 5.25 turrets on "Vanguard" were claimed to be fully automatic, with a power-rammed breech and automatic tracking and elevation under radar control enabling a rate of fire of about 18 rounds per minute. At maximum elevation, the guns had a maximum range of . 391 rounds were provided for each gun.

Short-range air defence was provided by 73 <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> AA guns in a variety of mountings. "Vanguard" had ten sextuple-barrel power-operated mounts concentrated in the superstructure and stern, a twin-barrel mount on 'B' turret and 11 power-operated single mounts on the upper deck and rear superstructure. All mounts could depress to −10° and elevate to a maximum of +90°. The gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a distance of . The guns' rate of fire was approximately 120 rounds per minute. Space was not available to stow the standard allowance of 1,564 rounds per gun, and "Vanguard" carried only 1,269 rounds per gun. Two of the single guns on the quarterdeck were removed in 1949 and five others during a major refit in 1954. All of her multiple Bofors mounts were removed at this same time.

"Vanguard" was unique among British battleships in having <a href="British%20ordnance%20terms%23RPC">remote power control</a> (RPC) for her main, secondary and tertiary guns along with the <a href="Admiralty%20Fire%20Control%20Table">Admiralty Fire Control Table</a> Mk X for surface fire control of the main armament. There were two <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23DCT">director control towers</a> (DCT) for the 15-inch guns, each carrying a "double cheese" <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20274">Type 274</a> fire-control radar for range finding and spotting the fall of shot. Each DCT could control all four turrets while 'B' turret could control 'A' and 'X' turrets. 'X' turret could only control 'Y' turret. There were four American Mark 37 DCTs for the 5.25-inch guns, each carrying the twin domes of <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20275">Type 275</a> gunnery radar. Each Mark VI sextuple 40 mm Bofors mounting was provided with a separate CRBF ("close range blind fire") <a href="director%20%28military%29">director</a> fitted with a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20262">Type 262</a> radar, although the ship never mounted her complete outfit of those directors. The STAAG Mk II 40 mm Bofors mounting carried its own Type 262 on the mounting itself. Other radar sets carried were Type 960 air and surface search, <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20293">Type 293</a> target indication and <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20277">Type 277</a> height finding.

When the 15-inch gun turrets were modernised, their <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a>s were replaced by ones in all turrets except for 'A' and they were fitted for RPC in azimuth only. The turrets were also provided with de-humidifying equipment and insulation to improve their habitability.

The ship's armour scheme was based on that of the "King George V" class with a thinner <a href="waterline">waterline</a> belt and additional splinter protection. Originally the belt armour was equal to that of the older ships but it had to be reduced to offset weight increases when the design was modified to reflect wartime experience. The waterline main belt was composed of <a href="Krupp%20cemented%20armour">Krupp cemented armour</a> (KCA) thick but increased to abreast the magazines. It was high and tapered to a thickness of at the bottom edge of the belt. Fore and aft of the transverse bulkheads that closed off the central citadel, the belt continued almost to the ends of the ship. Forward it tapered to a thickness of and a height of and aft to the same thickness but a height of . At the aft end of the steering gear compartment was a transverse bulkhead. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Denmark%20Strait">Battle of the Denmark Strait</a> in 1941, non-cemented armour bulkheads were added on the sides of the magazines, to protect them from splinters from any hits from plunging shells that might have penetrated the ship's side beneath her belt.

When the gun turrets from the First World War-era battlecruisers were modernised, their KCA faceplates were replaced by new ones 13 inches thick, and their roofs were replaced by non-cemented armour plates. Their sides remained in thickness. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s for the 15-inch guns were 13 inches thick on the sides but tapered to closer to the centreline of the ship. The side and roof armour of the 5.25-inch turrets was thick. Their ammunition hoists were protected by armour thick.

Intended to resist the impact of a armour-piercing bomb dropped from a height of , "Vanguard"s deck protection was identical to that of the "King George V" class. It consisted of six-inch non-cemented armour over the magazines that reduced to over the machinery spaces. The armour continued forward and aft of the citadel at the lower-deck level. Forward it tapered in steps from five inches down to 2.5 inches near the bow. Aft, it protected the steering gear and propeller shafts with 4.5 inches of armour before tapering to a thickness of 2.5 inches near the stern. Unlike the Germans, French and Americans, the British no longer believed that heavy armour for the conning tower served any real purpose given that the chance of hitting it was very small; "Vanguard"s conning tower was therefore protected with of armour on the face and 2.5 inches on the sides and rear. The secondary conning tower aft had of armour on its sides.

"Vanguard"s underwater protection was enhanced when she was redesigned in 1942 to reflect the lessons learned when "Prince of Wales" was sunk by Japanese <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s. It still consisted of a three-layer system of voids and liquid-filled compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a>. Her enlarged oil tanks reduced the empty spaces that could flood and cause the ship to <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out. The longitudinal bulkheads of the side protection system were raised one deck higher to further subdivide the spaces behind the waterline armour belt. The side protection system had a maximum depth of but this decreased significantly as the ship narrowed at its ends. Over the length of the citadel, this system was found to be proof against of <a href="TNT%20%28explosive%29">TNT</a> during full-scale trials.

"Vanguard" was laid down on 2 October 1941 by <a href="John%20Brown%20and%20Company">John Brown and Company</a> of <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, with the yard number of 567. After the <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Malaya">Japanese invasion of Malaya</a> in December, the ship was given an A1 priority in the hope of finishing her by the end of 1944, and construction of the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> <a href="HMS%20Blake%20%28C99%29">HMS "Bellerophon"</a>, as well as some merchant shipping, was halted to expedite the ship's completion. This was unsuccessful, however, due to a shortage of skilled labour. As a result, it was not until 30 November 1944 that the ship was launched. <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Princess Elizabeth</a> presided over this ceremony, the first ship she ever launched, and was presented with a diamond rose brooch to commemorate the event.

Two yard workers were killed and six others injured when a "blinding explosion ripped" the ship in a fitting-out basin at Clydebank on 16 September 1945.

<a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20Gladstone%20Agnew">William Gladstone Agnew</a> assumed command on 15 October 1945. The end of hostilities following Japan's surrender reduced the need for new warships, and consequently the ship was not commissioned until 12 May 1946. By this time, a total of £11,530,503, including £3,186,868 for the modernisation of the main armament, had been spent on producing "Vanguard".

After commissioning, the ship spent several months conducting sea trials and training until August, when she began the necessary modifications to serve as a <a href="royal%20yacht">royal yacht</a> for the forthcoming royal tour of South Africa. The Admiral's suite was reworked into accommodations for the Royal Family and their staff while the anti-aircraft mount on top of 'B' turret was replaced by a saluting platform. Agnew was promoted to rear-admiral with effect from 8 January 1947. The alterations were complete by December, and "Vanguard" made a shakedown cruise into the Central <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and made a port visit to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on the return voyage. Initially escorted by the destroyers , , , , and , the ship rendezvoused with the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a> on 1 February 1947 to receive a 21-gun salute led by the battleships and , and the aircraft carrier . Later that morning, a <a href="Sikorsky%20R-4">Sikorsky R-4</a> <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a> landed aboard to pick up mail and photographic film.

"Vanguard" arrived in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> on 17 February, escorted by the South African frigates , and on the last leg of her voyage. While the Royal Family toured the country on the first visit by a reigning monarch to South Africa, the ship exercised with ships of the South African and Royal Navies stationed there and made port visits to a number of South African cities. She sailed for home on 22 April and made brief visits to <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> and <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a> en route. "Vanguard" arrived in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on 11 May, and Captain F. R. Parham relieved the newly promoted Agnew on 29 May. In July, the ship began an overhaul in <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport</a>, which lasted until August 1948. While she was refitting, "Vanguard" was tasked to carry the Royal Family on a tour of Australia and New Zealand, planned for January 1949. On 31 August, she began a shakedown cruise to the Mediterranean and returned to Devonport on 12 November. Around this time, "Vanguard" was considered, along with a number of other large warships, for conversion to carry <a href="Surface-to-air%20missile">anti-aircraft missile</a>s, but nothing further was done along these lines.

<a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> was now too ill for travel, and the Royal Tour was indefinitely postponed later that month. "Vanguard" became the flagship of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Arthur%20Power">Arthur Power</a>, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, on 1 March 1949, and the ship made port visits to Algeria, France, Italy, Cyprus, Libya, Lebanon, Greece and Egypt before she arrived back at Devonport on 21 July. The newly promoted Rear Admiral Parham was relieved by Captain G. V. Gladstone a week later. The ship then became the flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral <a href="Edward%20Evans-Lombe">Edward Evans-Lombe</a> on 12 November. While returning from a brief training sortie to Gibraltar, "Vanguard" went to the aid of a small French merchantman whose cargo had shifted in a severe storm on 13 February 1950. The merchantman, , was taken under tow and the cargo was redistributed. Once the storm had abated, "Boffa" was able to resume her voyage under her own power. "Vanguard" reached Weymouth Bay the following day. Later, in March, she fired the salute to <a href="Vincent%20Auriol">Vincent Auriol</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20France">President of France</a>, during his <a href="state%20visit">state visit</a> to Great Britain.
On 13 September 1950 Admiral Sir <a href="Philip%20Vian">Philip Vian</a> hoisted his flag as Commander in Chief, Home Fleet, on "Vanguard" and the ship joined the rest of Home Fleet on exercises with the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a> and the Mediterranean Fleet. On 19 December, Vian transferred his flag to . Nearly two months later, on 10 February 1951, the aircraft carrier collided with "Vanguard" as the carrier docked at Gibraltar. The hole in the battleship's stern was not serious, and Vian re-hoisted his flag in "Vanguard" shortly afterwards. After manoeuvres with "Indomitable", during which her aircraft "sank" the battleship, the ship made port visits in <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> and <a href="Villefranche-sur-Mer">Villefranche-sur-Mer</a> before returning for a brief refit in Devonport on 14 March. After completing her refit in May, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron under Rear Admiral R. M. Dick at the <a href="Isle%20of%20Portland">Isle of Portland</a>. Four months later the admiral transferred his flag to the carrier as "Vanguard" began another refit in preparation to again become the flagship of Home Fleet.

<a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> announced in November that King George VI was planning to take a short cruise for his health aboard "Vanguard", which meant that her Admiral's suite again had to be modified to accommodate him and his staff. Captain <a href="John%20Litchfield%20%28politician%29">John Litchfield</a> assumed command on 21 December while the ship was still refitting, but the King died on 6 February 1952 before he could make his cruise. A detachment from the ship participated in his funeral procession before she departed for her post-refit shakedown cruise on 22 February. After exercising with "Implacable", "Indomitable" and the fast <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a> , "Vanguard" returned home on 29 March. She became flagship of Home Fleet again on 13 May when Admiral Sir <a href="George%20Creasy">George Creasy</a> hoisted his flag. Due to manning and weight problems, "Vanguard" operated with many of her turrets unmanned and with ammunition carried for only two of the 15-inch turrets and only starshell ammunition for the 5.25-inch guns. She participated in exercises with the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Navy">Dutch</a> and American navies, before returning to Portsmouth for the holidays. Litchfield was relieved by Captain R. A. Ewing on 19 January 1953; the ship departed the next day for a brief refit at Gibraltar. After its completion on 2 March, the ship trained with several of the Royal Navy's carriers before arriving back at Portsmouth on 25 March. "Vanguard" participated in Queen Elizabeth's Coronation <a href="Fleet%20Review">Fleet Review</a> at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a> on 15 June 1953. The following September, she participated in NATO's <a href="Exercise%20Mariner">Exercise Mariner</a> in the <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a>.
Admiral Sir <a href="Michael%20Denny">Michael Denny</a> replaced Creasy as Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, on 5 January 1954 and "Vanguard" participated in Exercise Medflex A with Dutch and French ships in March. During the rest of the year she participated in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft exercises as well as making port visits to <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> and <a href="Kristiansand">Kristiansand</a> in Norway and <a href="Helsingborg">Helsingborg</a> in Sweden. She was inspected on 11 July by King <a href="Gustaf%20VI%20Adolf%20of%20Sweden">Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden</a> before returning home later that month. Denny struck his flag on 15 September, and "Vanguard" sailed to Devonport for a £220,000 refit 10 days later. The February 1955 Defence Estimates had intended her as the Home Fleet flagship with a role as a killer, but after the appointment of Earl Mountbatten in April 1955 and with Antony Eden replacing Churchill as prime minister, the government decided instead to maintain two extra cruisers in the fleet, and "Vanguard" was placed in reserve when it completed its 1955 refit. She subsequently became the flagship of the <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Reserve Fleet</a> when <a href="Vice%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Richard%20Onslow%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Richard Onslow</a> hoisted his flag on 28 November. While moored in <a href="Fareham">Fareham Creek</a>, during her time in the reserve fleet, waterline shots of "Vanguard" in Portsmouth Harbour were filmed for the title sequence of the 1957 comedy film "<a href="Carry%20on%20Admiral">Carry on Admiral</a>". Just before decommissioning, scenes for the 1960 film "<a href="Sink%20the%20Bismarck%21">Sink the Bismarck!</a>" were filmed aboard, with "Vanguard" being used to depict interiors of the bridges, Admiral's Quarters and gun turrets for "Hood", "Bismarck" and "King George V".

On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty announced that "Vanguard" would be scrapped, as she was considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> on 7 June 1960 and sold to the <a href="Iron%20and%20Steel%20Corporation%20of%20Great%20Britain">Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain</a> for £560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship was scheduled to be towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at <a href="Faslane">Faslane</a>, Scotland, the whole of the <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a> sea front was packed with people who came to see her off. As "Vanguard" was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still & West <a href="pub">pub</a>. She was pulled off by five <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped.

As a part of the scrapping process, sections of <a href="Low-background%20steel">pre-atomic steel</a> plate uncontaminated with <a href="radionuclide">radionuclide</a>s were recovered from "Vanguard" and used for the shielding of the <a href="Whole%20Body%20Counter">whole body monitor</a> at the Radiobiological Research Laboratory (now <a href="DSTL">DSTL</a>) at <a href="Alverstoke">Alverstoke</a>, <a href="Gosport">Gosport</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England.

Webley Revolver

The Webley Revolver (also known as the Webley Top-Break Revolver or Webley Self-Extracting Revolver) was, in various <a href="Mark%20%28designation%29">marks</a>, a standard issue <a href="service%20pistol">service pistol</a> for the armed forces of the United Kingdom, and the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>, from 1887 until 1963.

The Webley is a <a href="Break-action">top-break</a> revolver and breaking the revolver operates the <a href="extractor%20%28firearms%29">extractor</a>, which removes <a href="cartridge%20%28firearms%29">cartridge</a>s from the <a href="cylinder%20%28firearms%29">cylinder</a>. The Webley Mk I service revolver was adopted in 1887 and the Mk IV rose to prominence during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War of 1899–1902</a>. The Mk VI, introduced in 1915 during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, is perhaps the best-known model.

Firing large <a href=".455%20Webley">.455 Webley</a> cartridges, Webley service revolvers are among the most powerful top-break revolvers ever produced. The .455 calibre Webley is no longer in military service but the <a href=".38/200">.38/200</a> Webley Mk IV variant is still in use as a police sidearm in a number of countries. With a modified, "shaved" cylinder and the use of a half <a href="moon%20clip">moon clip</a>, the Webley Mk VI can fire the <a href=".45%20ACP">.45 ACP</a> cartridge, although standard pressure .45 ACP cartridges exceed Webley proof loads and should not be used.

The British company <a href="Webley%20%26amp%3B%20Scott">Webley & Scott</a> (P. Webley & Son before merger with W & C Scott in 1897) produced a range of <a href="revolver">revolver</a>s from the mid 19th to late 20th centuries. As early as 1853 P. Webley and J. Webley began production of their first patented single action cap and ball revolvers. Later under the trade name of P. Webley and Son, manufacturing included their own .44-caliber rim-fire solid frame revolver as well as licensed copies of Smith & Wesson's Tip up break action revolvers. The quintessential hinged frame, centre-fire revolvers for which the Webley name is best known first began production/development in the early 1870s most notably with the Webley-Pryse (1877) and Webley-Kaufman (1881) models. The W.G. or Webley-Government models produced from 1885 through to the early 1900s, (often incorrectly referred to as the Webley-Green) are the most popular of the commercial top break revolvers and many were the private purchase choice of English military officers and target shooters in the period, coming in a .476/.455 calibre. However other short-barrel solid-frame revolvers, including the Webley RIC (<a href="Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary">Royal Irish Constabulary</a>) model and the <a href="British%20Bulldog%20revolver">British Bulldog revolver</a>, designed to be carried in a coat pocket for self-defence were far more commonplace during the period. Today, undoubtedly best-known are the range of military revolvers, which were in service use across two World Wars and numerous colonial conflicts.

In 1887, the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> was searching for a revolver to replace the largely unsatisfactory .476 <a href="Enfield%20Revolver">Enfield Mk I & Mk II Revolvers</a>, the Enfield having only replaced the solid frame <a href=".450%20Adams">Adams .450</a> revolver which was a late 1860s conversion of the cap and ball <a href="Beaumont%E2%80%93Adams%20revolver">Beaumont–Adams revolver</a> in 1880. Webley & Scott, who were already very well known makers of quality guns and had sold many pistols on a commercial basis to military officers and civilians alike, tendered the .455 calibre Webley Self-Extracting Revolver for trials. The military was suitably impressed with the revolver (it was seen as a vast improvement over the Enfield revolvers then in service, as the American-designed Owen extraction system did not prove particularly satisfactory), and it was adopted on 8 November 1887 as the "Pistol, Webley, Mk I". The initial contract called for 10,000 Webley revolvers, at a price of <a href="%C2%A3sd">£3/1/1</a> each, with at least 2,000 revolvers to be supplied within eight months.

The Webley revolver went through a number of changes, culminating in the Mk VI, which was in production between 1915 and 1923. The large .455 Webley revolvers were retired in 1947, although the Webley Mk IV .38/200 remained in service until 1963 alongside the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver.
Commercial versions of all Webley service revolvers were also sold on the civilian market, along with a number of similar designs (such as the Webley-Government and Webley-Wilkinson) that were not officially adopted for service, but were nonetheless purchased privately by military officers. The Webley records show the last Mk VI being sold from the factory being in 1957 with "Nigeria" noted against the entry.

The Webley Mk IV, chambered in .455 Webley, was introduced in 1899 and soon became known as the "<a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a> Model", on account of the large numbers of officers and <a href="non-commissioned%20officers">non-commissioned officers</a> who purchased it on their way to take part in the conflict. The Webley Mk IV served alongside a large number of other handguns, including the <a href="Mauser%20C96">Mauser C96 "Broomhandle"</a> (as used by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> during the War), earlier <a href="Beaumont%E2%80%93Adams%20revolver">Beaumont–Adams</a> cartridge revolvers, and other top-break revolvers manufactured by gunmakers such as <a href="William%20Tranter">William Tranter</a>, and <a href="Kynoch">Kynoch</a>.

The standard-issue Webley revolver at the outbreak of the First World War was the Webley Mk V (adopted 9 December 1913), but there were considerably more Mk IV revolvers in service in 1914, as the initial order for 20,000 Mk V revolvers had not been completed when hostilities began. On 24 May 1915, the Webley Mk VI was adopted as the standard sidearm for <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British and Commonwealth</a> troops and remained so for the duration of the First World War, being issued first to officers, pipers and range takers, and later to airmen, naval crews, boarding parties, <a href="Trench%20raiding">trench raiders</a>, machine-gun teams, and <a href="tank">tank</a> crews. The Mk VI proved to be a very reliable and hardy weapon, well suited to the mud and adverse conditions of trench warfare, and several accessories were developed for the Mk VI, including a <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a> (made from a converted French Gras bayonet), <a href="speedloader">speedloader</a> devices (the "Prideaux Device" and the Watson design), and a stock allowing for the revolver to be converted into a <a href="carbine">carbine</a>.

Demand exceeded production, which was already behind as the war began. This forced the British
government to buy substitute weapons chambered in .455 Webley from neutral countries. America provided the <a href="Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Wesson%20Triple%20Lock">Smith & Wesson 2nd Model "Hand Ejector"</a> and <a href="Colt%20New%20Service">Colt New Service Revolver</a>s. Spanish gunsmiths in <a href="Eibar">Eibar</a> made decent-quality copies of popular guns and were tapped to cheaply close the gap by making a .455 variant of their 11mm "M1884" or ""S&W Model 7 ONÁ"" revolver, a copy of the <a href="Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Wesson%20Model%203">Smith & Wesson ".44 Double Action First Model"</a>. The "Pistol, Revolver, Old Pattern, No. 1 Mk. 1" was by <a href="Garate%2C%20Anitua%20y%20Cia.">Garate, Anitua y Cia.</a> and the "Pistol, Revolver, Old Pattern, No.2 Mk.1" was by <a href="Trocaola%2C%20Aranzabal%20y%20Cia.">Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia.</a>. <a href="Orbea">Orbea Hermanos y Cia.</a> made 10,000 pistols. <a href="Rexach%20%26amp%3B%20Urgoite">Rexach & Urgoite</a> was tapped for an initial order of 500 revolvers, but they were rejected due to defects.

The official service pistol for the British military during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> was the <a href="Enfield%20No.%202">Enfield No. 2 Mk I</a> .38/200 calibre revolver. Owing to a critical shortage of handguns, a number of other weapons were also adopted (first practically, then officially) to alleviate the shortage. As a result, both the Webley Mk IV in .38/200 and Webley Mk VI in .455 calibre were issued to personnel during the war.

The Webley Mk VI (.455) and Mk IV (.38/200) revolvers were still issued to British and Commonwealth Forces after the Second World War; there were now extensive stockpiles of the revolvers in military stores, yet they suffered from ammunition shortages. This lack of ammunition was instrumental in keeping the Enfield and Webley revolvers in use so long: they were not wearing out because they were not being used. An armourer stationed in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> joked by the time they were officially retired in 1963, the ammunition allowance was "two cartridges per man, per year." 

The Webley Mk IV .38 revolver was not completely replaced by the <a href="Browning%20Hi-Power">Browning Hi-Power</a> until 1963, and saw use in the Korean War, the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>, <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, and the <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Rhodesian Bush War</a>. Many Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolvers were still circulating in British Military service as late as 1970.

The <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Police%20Force">Hong Kong Police</a> and <a href="Singapore%20Police%20Force">Singapore Police Force</a> were issued Webley Mk III & Mk IV (38S&W then.38/200 - Never use 38/200 in a Webley Mark III proofed for black powder 38S&W only) revolvers from the 1930s. Singaporean police (and some other "officials") Webleys were equipped with safety catches, a rather unusual feature in a revolver. These were gradually retired in the 1970s as they came in for repair, and were replaced with <a href="Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Wesson%20Model%2010">Smith & Wesson Model 10</a> .38 revolvers. The <a href="London%20Metropolitan%20Police">London Metropolitan Police</a> were also known to use Webley revolvers, as were most colonial police units until just after the Second World War.

The <a href="Ordnance%20Factories%20Organisation">Ordnance Factory Board of India</a> still manufactures .380 Revolver Mk IIz cartridges, as well as a <a href=".32%20S%26amp%3BW%20Long">.32 calibre</a> revolver (the <a href="IOF%20.32%20Revolver">IOF .32 Revolver</a>) with barrel which is clearly based on the Webley Mk IV .38 service pistol.

There were six different marks of .455 calibre Webley British Government Model revolvers approved for British military service at various times between 1887 and the end of the First World War:

At the end of the First World War, the British military decided that the .455 calibre gun and cartridge was too large for modern military use and—after numerous tests and extensive trials—that a pistol in .38 calibre firing a 200-grain (13 g) bullet would be just as effective as the .455 for stopping an enemy.

Webley & Scott immediately tendered the <a href=".38/200">.38/200</a> calibre Webley Mk IV revolver, which as well as being nearly identical in appearance to the .455 calibre Mk VI revolver (albeit scaled down for the smaller cartridge), was based on their .38 calibre Webley Mk III pistol, designed for the police and civilian markets.

Much to their surprise, the British Government took the design to the <a href="Royal%20Small%20Arms%20Factory">Royal Small Arms Factory</a> at <a href="Enfield%20Lock">Enfield Lock</a>, which came up with a revolver that was externally very similar looking to the .38/200 calibre Webley Mk IV, but was internally different enough that no parts from the Webley could be used in the Enfield and vice versa.

The Enfield-designed pistol was quickly accepted under the designation "<a href="Enfield%20No.%202">Pistol, Revolver, No. 2 Mk I</a>", and was adopted in 1932, followed in 1938 by the Mk I* (spurless hammer, double action only), and finally the Mk I** (simplified for wartime production) in 1942.

Webley & Scott sued the British Government over the incident, claiming £2250 as "costs involved in the research and design" of the revolver.

This was contested by RSAF Enfield, which quite firmly stated that the <a href="Enfield%20No.%202%20Mk%20I">Enfield No. 2 Mk I</a> was designed by Captain Boys (the Assistant Superintendent of Design, later of <a href="Rifle%2C%20Anti-Tank%2C%20.55%20in%2C%20Boys">Boys Anti-Tank Rifle</a> fame) with assistance from Webley & Scott, and not the other way around. Accordingly, their claim was denied.

By way of compensation, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors eventually awarded Webley & Scott £1250 for their work.

RSAF Enfield proved unable to manufacture enough No. 2 revolvers to meet the military's wartime demands, and as a result Webley's Mk IV was also widely used within the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in World War Two.

Whilst the top-break, self-extracting revolvers used by the British and Commonwealth militaries are the best-known examples of Webley Revolvers, the company produced a number of other highly popular revolvers largely intended for the police and civilian markets.

The Webley RIC (<a href="Royal%20Irish%20Constabulary">Royal Irish Constabulary</a>) model was Webley's first double-action revolver, and adopted by the RIC in 1868, hence the name. It was a solid frame, gate-loaded revolver, chambered in .442 Webley. General <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a> was known to have owned a pair, which he is believed to have used at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Little%20Bighorn">Battle of the Little Bighorn</a> in 1876.

A small number of early examples were produced in the huge .500 Tranter calibre, and later models were available chambered for the .450 Adams and other cartridges. They were also widely copied in Belgium.

The British Bull Dog model was an enormously successful solid-frame design introduced by Webley in 1872. It featured a barrel and was chambered for five .44 Short Rimfire, .442 Webley, or .450 Adams cartridges. A .44 calibre Belgian-made British Bulldog revolver was used to assassinate US President <a href="James%20Garfield">James Garfield</a> on 2 July 1881 by <a href="Charles%20Guiteau">Charles Guiteau</a>. (Webley later added smaller scaled five chambered versions in .320 and .380 calibres, but did not mark them British Bull Dog.)

It was designed to be carried in a coat pocket or kept on a night-stand, and many have survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.

A highly unusual example of an "automatic revolver", the Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver was produced between 1900 and 1915, and available in both a six-shot .455 Webley version, and an eight-shot <a href=".38%20ACP">.38 ACP</a> (not to be confused with <a href=".380%20ACP">.380 ACP</a>) version.
Unusually for a revolver, the Webley-Fosbery had a safety catch, and the light trigger pull, solid design, and reputation for accuracy ensured that the Webley-Fosbery remained popular with target shooters long after production had finished.

Cosima Wagner

Cosima Wagner (born Francesca Gaetana Cosima Liszt; 24 December 1837 – 1 April 1930) was the illegitimate daughter of the Hungarian pianist and composer <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> and <a href="Marie%20d%27Agoult">Marie d'Agoult</a>. She became the second wife of the German composer <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, and with him founded the <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth Festival</a> as a showcase for his stage works; after his death she devoted the rest of her life to the promotion of his music and philosophy. Commentators have recognised Cosima as the principal inspiration for Wagner's later works, particularly "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>".

In 1857, after a childhood largely spent under the care of her grandmother and with governesses, Cosima married the conductor <a href="Hans%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans von Bülow</a>. Although the marriage produced two children, it was largely a loveless union, and in 1863 Cosima began a relationship with Wagner, who was 24 years her senior. She married him in 1870; after his death in 1883 she directed the Bayreuth Festival for more than 20 years, increasing its repertoire to form the <a href="Bayreuth%20canon">Bayreuth canon</a> of ten operas and establishing the festival as a major event in the world of musical theatre.

During her directorship, Cosima opposed theatrical innovations and adhered closely to Wagner's original productions of his works, an approach continued by her successors long after her retirement in 1907. She shared Wagner's convictions of German cultural and racial superiority, and under her influence, Bayreuth became increasingly identified with <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a>. This was a defining feature of Bayreuth for decades, into the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi</a> era which closely followed her death in 1930. Thus, although she is widely perceived as the saviour of the festival, her legacy remains controversial.

In January 1833 the 21-year-old Hungarian pianist and composer <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> met Marie d'Agoult, a Parisian socialite six years his senior. Marie's antecedents were mixed; her German mother, from a prominent Frankfurt banking family, had married a French nobleman, the Comte de Flavigny. Marie had been married since 1827 to Charles, Comte d'Agoult, and had borne him two daughters, but the union had become sterile. Drawn together by their mutual intellectual interests, Marie and Liszt embarked on a passionate relationship. In March 1835 the couple fled Paris for Switzerland; ignoring the scandal they left in their wake, they settled in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> where, on 18 December, Marie gave birth to a daughter, Blandine-Rachel.

In the following two years Liszt and Marie travelled widely in pursuit of his career as a concert pianist. Late in 1837, when Marie was heavily pregnant with their second child, the couple were at <a href="Como">Como</a> in Italy. Here, on 24 December in a lakeside hotel in <a href="Bellagio%2C%20Lombardy">Bellagio</a>, a second daughter was born. They named her Francesca Gaetana Cosima, the unusual third name being derived from <a href="Saints%20Cosmas%20and%20Damian">St Cosmas</a>, a patron saint of physicians and apothecaries; it was as "Cosima" that the child became known. With her sister she was left in the care of <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a>s (a common practice at the time), while Liszt and Marie continued to travel in Europe. Their third child and only son, Daniel, was born on 9 May 1839 in Venice.

In 1839, while Liszt continued his travels, Marie took the social risk of returning to Paris with her daughters. Her hopes of recovering her status in the city were dented when her influential mother, Madame de Flavigny, refused to acknowledge the children; Marie would not be accepted socially while her daughters were clearly in evidence. Liszt's solution was to remove the girls from Marie and place them with his mother, Anna Liszt, in her Paris home while Daniel remained with nurses in Venice. By this means, both Marie and Liszt could continue their independent lives. Relations between the couple cooled, and by 1841 they were seeing little of each other; it is likely that both engaged in other affairs. By 1845 the breach between them was such that they were communicating only through third parties. Liszt forbade contact between mother and daughters; Marie accused him of attempting to steal "the fruits of a mother's womb", while Liszt insisted on his sole right to decide the children's future. Marie threatened to fight him "like a lioness", but soon gave up the struggle. Though they were living in the same city, she did not see either of her daughters for five years, until 1850.

Cosima and Blandine remained with Anna Liszt until 1850, joined eventually by Daniel. Cosima's biographer <a href="George%20Richard%20Marek">George Marek</a> describes Anna as "a simple, uneducated, unworldly but warmhearted woman ... for the first time [the girls] experienced what it was to be touched by love". Of the sisters, Blandine was evidently the prettier; Cosima, with her long nose and wide mouth was described as an "<a href="ugly%20duckling">ugly duckling</a>". Although Liszt's relations with his children were formal and distant, he provided for them liberally, and ensured that they were well educated. Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard's, an exclusive boarding school, while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lycée Bonaparte.

In 1847 Liszt met Princess <a href="Carolyne%20zu%20Sayn-Wittgenstein">Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein</a>, the estranged wife of a German prince who lived in Russia. By the autumn of 1848 she and Liszt had become lovers, and their relationship lasted for the remainder of his life. She quickly assumed responsibility for the management of Liszt's life, including the upbringing of his daughters. Early in 1850 Liszt had been disturbed to learn that Blandine and Cosima were seeing their mother again; his response, guided by the princess, was to remove them from their school and place them into the full-time care of Carolyne's old governess, the 72-year-old Madame Patersi de Fossombroni. Liszt's instructions were clear—Madame Patersi was to control every aspect of the girls' lives: "She alone is to decide what is to be permitted them and what forbidden".

Blandine and Cosima were subjected to the Patersi curriculum for four years. Cosima's biographer <a href="Oliver%20Hilmes">Oliver Hilmes</a> likens the regime to that used for breaking in horses, though Marek describes it as exacting but ultimately beneficial to Cosima: "Above all, Patersi taught her how a 'noble lady' must behave, how to alight from a carriage, how to enter a drawing room, how to greet a duchess as against a commoner ... and how not to betray herself when she was hurt". On 10 October 1853 Liszt arrived at the Patersi apartment, his first visit to his daughters since 1845. With him were two fellow-composers: <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>. Carolyne's daughter Marie, who was present, described Cosima's appearance as "in the worst phase of adolescence, tall and angular, sallow ... the image of her father. Only her long golden hair, of unusual sheen, was beautiful". After a family meal, Wagner read to the group from his text for the final act of what was to become "<a href="G%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung">Götterdämmerung</a>". Cosima seems to have made little impression on him; in his memoirs he merely recorded that both girls were very shy.

As his daughters approached womanhood, Liszt felt that a change in their lives was called for and in 1855 he arranged (over their mother's bitter protests) for them to move to Berlin. Here they were placed in the care of Franziska von Bülow, whose son <a href="Hans%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans</a> was Liszt's most outstanding pupil; he would take charge of the girls' musical education while Frau von Bülow supervised their general and moral welfare. Hans von Bülow, born in 1830, had abandoned his legal education after hearing Liszt conduct the premiere of Wagner's "<a href="Lohengrin">Lohengrin</a>" at <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a> in August 1850, and had decided to dedicate his life to music. After a brief spell conducting in small opera houses, Bülow studied with Liszt, who was convinced that he would become a great concert pianist. Bülow was quickly impressed by Cosima's own skill as a pianist, in which he saw the stamp of her father, and the pair developed romantic feelings for each other. Liszt approved the match, and the marriage took place at <a href="St.%20Hedwig%27s%20Cathedral">St. Hedwig's Cathedral</a>, Berlin, on 18 August 1857. During their honeymoon, along with Liszt they visited Wagner at his home near Zurich. This visit was repeated the following year, when Cosima, on taking her leave, shocked Wagner with an emotional demonstration: "[S]he fell at my feet, covered my hands with tears and kisses ... I pondered the mystery, without being able to solve it".

Cosima, a Parisian by upbringing, found it hard to adjust to life in Berlin, which was then a more provincial city than Paris. Her attempts to mix with local society, according to Marie zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, were handicapped by "[h]er exaggerated self-esteem and innate causticity", which alienated the men and women in her circle. At least initially, Cosima took an interest in her husband's career, encouraging him to extend his activities into composition. On one occasion she provided him with a scenario she had written for an opera based on the story of <a href="Merlin">Merlin</a>, court magician to <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a>. However, nothing came of this project. Bülow's crowded professional schedule left Cosima alone for long periods, during which she worked for the French-language magazine "Revue germanique" as a translator and contributor. In December 1859 she was saddened by the death of her brother Daniel, at the age of twenty, after a long wasting illness. Cosima's first child, a daughter born on 12 October 1860, was named Daniela in Daniel's memory. A further, unexpected blow for Cosima fell in September 1862, when her sister Blandine, who had shared much of her upbringing, died in childbirth—she had been married to <a href="%C3%89mile%20Ollivier">Émile Ollivier</a>, a Parisian lawyer, since October 1857. Cosima's second daughter, born in March 1863, was named Blandina Elisabeth Veronica.

Bülow was committed to Wagner's music; in 1858 he had undertaken the preparation of a vocal score for "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>", and by 1862 he was making a <a href="wikt%3Afair%20copy">fair copy</a> of "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg</a>". A social relationship developed, and during the summer of 1862 the Bülows stayed with Wagner at the composer's home at <a href="Biebrich%20%28Wiesbaden%29">Biebrich</a>. Wagner records that Cosima became "transfigured" by his rendering of "Wotan's Farewell" from "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>". In October 1862, just after Blandine's death, Wagner and Bülow shared conducting duties at a concert in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>; Wagner records that, during a rehearsal, "I felt utterly transported by the sight of Cosima ... she appeared to me as if stepping from another world". In these years Wagner's emotional life was in disarray. He was still married to his first wife, <a href="Minna%20Planer">Minna Planer</a> (she was to die in 1866), and was involved in several extramarital relationships. On 28 November 1863 Wagner visited Berlin; while Bülow was rehearsing a concert, Wagner and Cosima took a long cab ride through Berlin and declared their feelings for each other: "with tears and sobs", Wagner later wrote, "we sealed our confession to belong to each other alone".

In 1864 Wagner's financial position was transformed by his new patron, the 18-year-old <a href="Ludwig%20II%20of%20Bavaria">King Ludwig II of Bavaria</a>, who paid off the composer's debts and awarded him a generous annual stipend. Ludwig also provided Wagner with a lakeside retreat at <a href="Lake%20Starnberg">Lake Starnberg</a>, and a grand house in Munich. At Wagner's instigation, von Bülow accepted a post as Ludwig's "royal pianist"; he and Cosima moved to Munich, and took a house conveniently close to Wagner's, ostensibly so that Cosima could work as the composer's secretary. From 29 June 1864 Cosima spent more than a week alone with Wagner at Lake Starnberg, before von Bülow joined them on 7 July. According to Wagner's housekeeper, Anna Mrazek, "it was easy to tell that something was going on between Frau Cosima and Richard Wagner". Mrazek said that later in the visit von Bülow found his wife in Wagner's bedroom, but nevertheless made no demands for an explanation, either from Wagner or from his wife. Nine months after this visit, on 10 April 1865, Cosima gave birth to a daughter, <a href="Isolde%20Beidler">Isolde</a>. Such was von Bülow's devotion to Wagner that he accepted the child as his own, and registered her as "the legitimate daughter" of Hans and Cosima von Bülow. Wagner attended the Catholic baptism on 24 April. On 10 June 1865, at the <a href="Bavarian%20State%20Opera">Munich Hofoper</a>, von Bülow conducted the premiere of Wagner's "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>".

Wagner's role at Ludwig's court became controversial; in particular, Ludwig's habit of referring Wagner's policy ideas to his ministers alarmed the court. When Wagner demanded the sacking both of Ludwig's cabinet secretary and of his prime minister, there was a public outcry, and in December 1865 Ludwig reluctantly told Wagner to leave Bavaria. The king did not, however, withdraw his patronage or financial support. After a few months' wandering, in March 1866 Wagner arrived in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, where Cosima joined him. They travelled together to <a href="Lucerne">Lucerne</a> where they found a large lakeside house, the <a href="Tribschen">Villa Tribschen</a>. Wagner made immediate arrangements to rent the house, at the king's expense, and by 15 April was installed in his new home.

Immediately upon signing the lease, Wagner invited the von Bülows and their children to stay with him. They spent the summer there, returning briefly to Munich before von Bülow left for <a href="Basel">Basel</a> while Cosima went back to Tribschen. By now von Bülow understood his wife's relationship with Wagner; he wrote to a friend that "since February 1865 I was in absolutely no doubt about the extremely peculiar nature of the situation". Wagner, anxious to avoid associating Cosima in a public scandal, deceived Ludwig into issuing a statement in June 1866 which declared the unbroken sanctity of the von Bülows' marriage, and promised retribution for those daring to suggest otherwise. By this time Cosima was pregnant with her second child by Wagner; a daughter, Eva, was born at Tribschen on 17 February 1867. Through all this, von Bülow retained his devotion to Wagner's music. He had been appointed music director of the Munich Hofoper, and threw himself into the preparations for the premiere of "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg". This took place on 21 June 1868 under his baton, and was a great success. Shortly afterwards, Cosima rejoined Wagner at Tribschen; Wagner explained to the king that she could not bear the insults to which she was continually subjected in Munich, and wished to escape from the world.

In October 1868 Cosima asked her husband for a divorce, to which he would not initially agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately after the birth of her and Wagner's third and final child, <a href="Siegfried%20Wagner">Siegfried</a>, Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what she called a "final attempt at an understanding". His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: "You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of your heart and mind to a higher being: far from censuring you for this step, I approve of it". Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.

Wagner and Cosima were married at Lucerne, on 25 August 1870, in a Protestant church. Cosima's journal for that day records: "May I be worthy of bearing R's name!" Liszt was not informed in advance of the wedding, and learned of it first through the newspapers. The year ended on a high note for the Wagners: on 25 December, the day on which Cosima always celebrated her birthday although she had been born on the 24th, she awoke to the sounds of music. She commemorated the event in her journal: "...music was sounding, and what music! After it had died away, R ... put into my hands the score of his "Symphonic Birthday Greeting. ... R had set up his orchestra on the stairs, and thus consecrated our Tribschen forever!" This was the first performance of the music that became known as the "<a href="Siegfried%20Idyll">Siegfried Idyll</a>".

Wagner's deception over his relationship with Cosima had seriously damaged his standing with Ludwig. Matters were worsened by Ludwig's insistence, over Wagner's objections, that the premieres of the two completed "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Ring</a>" operas, "<a href="Das%20Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a>" and "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>", be given at once, in Munich, rather than as part of a complete "Ring" cycle on some future date at a venue of Wagner's choosing. To Wagner's mortification these premieres took place, under <a href="Franz%20W%C3%BCllner">Franz Wüllner</a>, on 22 September 1869 and 26 June 1870 respectively. The need for a theatre of his own, and full artistic control, was now clear to Wagner. On 5 March 1870 Cosima, according to her journal, advised him to "look up the article on Baireuth in the encyclopaedia". Wagner knew the town from a short visit he had made there in 1835; he was attracted to it by its central location and by its quiet non-fashionability. When he and Cosima visited in April 1871 they decided immediately that they would build their theatre there, and that the town would be their future home.

Wagner announced the first Bayreuth Festival for 1873, at which his full "Ring" cycle would be performed. Aware of the honour that such an event would bring to the town, the local council donated a large plot of land—the "Green Hill"—overlooking the town, as a site for the theatre. Since Ludwig had declined to finance the project, the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the initial festival was deferred. By the spring of 1873 only a third of the required funds had been raised; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored, but early in 1874, with the entire project on the verge of collapse, the king relented and provided a loan. The full building programme included a handsome villa, "Wahnfried", into which Wagner, with Cosima and the children, moved from their temporary accommodation on 18 April 1874. The theatre was completed in 1875, and the festival scheduled for the following year. Commenting on the struggle to finish the building Wagner remarked to Cosima: "Each stone is red with my blood and yours".

During this period Cosima admitted to Liszt, who had taken <a href="minor%20orders">minor orders</a> in the Catholic Church, that she intended converting to Protestantism. Her motive may have been more the desire to maintain solidarity with Wagner than from religious conviction; Hilmes maintains that at heart, "Cosima remained a pietistic Catholic until her dying day". On 31 October 1872 Cosima received her first Protestant sacrament alongside Wagner: "a deeply moving occasion ... what a lovely thing religion is! What other power could produce such feelings!"

In March 1876, Cosima and Wagner were in Berlin when they learned that Marie d'Agoult had died in Paris. Unable to attend the funeral, Cosima expressed her feelings in a letter to her daughter Daniela: "There is nothing left for me to do, except to grieve for the woman that brought me into the world".

From June onwards, Cosima's journal entries consist almost entirely of comments on the forthcoming festival's rehearsals, sometimes warmly approving, often critical and anxious; for example, she found the costumes "reminiscent throughout of Red Indian chiefs ... all the marks of provincial tastelessness". From the beginning of August 1876 distinguished guests began to converge on the town; Ludwig, incognito, attended the final dress rehearsals between 6 and 9 August, but then left the town, reappearing in time to attend the final performances of the festival. Among other royal visitors were <a href="William%20I%2C%20German%20Emperor">the German emperor Wilhelm I</a>, <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Dom Pedro II of Brazil</a> and an assortment of princes and grand dukes from the European royal families. Many of Europe's leading composers came: <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Bruckner</a>, <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Saint-Saëns</a>, and Cosima's father, Liszt, who held court at Wahnfried among the notables who gathered there. Also in Bayreuth was Wagner's current mistress, <a href="Judith%20Gautier">Judith Gautier</a>. It is unlikely that Cosima knew of the affair at this time, though she may have harboured a degree of suspicion. Cosima's demeanour as the festival's hostess was described by a young American visitor in fulsome terms: "Mme Wagner is exceedingly gracious and affable ... a magnificent-looking woman, a perfect queen ..."

The festival began on 13 August and lasted until 30th. It consisted of three full "Ring" cycles, all under the baton of <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a>. At the end, critical reactions ranged between that of the Norwegian composer <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Edvard Grieg</a>, who thought the entire work "divinely composed", and that of the French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" who called the music "the dream of a lunatic". Wagner himself was far from satisfied; in a letter to Ludwig he denounced the singers <a href="Albert%20Niemann%20%28tenor%29">Albert Niemann</a> and <a href="Franz%20Betz">Franz Betz</a> as "theatrical parasites" and complained that Richter had not got a single tempo correct. Months later, Cosima records, his attitude towards the productions was "Never again, never again!".

After the conclusion of the festival and the departure of the guests, Wagner and Cosima left with the children for Venice, where they remained until December. The festival had accumulated a large financial deficit; this, and Wagner's deep artistic dissatisfaction, precluded the possibility of any repeat in the near future. Wagner's mood was such that he seriously contemplated giving up the entire Bayreuth project; he was distracted from such thoughts by an invitation to conduct a series of concerts in London. Leaving the children behind, he and Cosima enjoyed a two-month break in England where, among others, Cosima met the novelist <a href="George%20Eliot">George Eliot</a>, the poet <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a>, and the painter <a href="Edward%20Burne-Jones">Edward Burne-Jones</a> (who made a number of sketches of Cosima from which no finished painting emerged). On 17 May both Wagners were received by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. 

The English tour raised little money but restored Wagner's spirits. On his return he began work on what would prove to be his final stage work, "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>", a project that would occupy him for most of the next five years. Cosima's influence was such that Wagner asserted that he would not have written another note, had she not been there. On a practical level, when the festival's creditors began to press for payment, Cosima's personal plea to Ludwig in 1878 persuaded the king to provide a loan to pay off the outstanding debt and open the door to the prospect of a second Bayreuth Festival. For Cosima's birthday on 25 December 1878, Wagner hired an orchestra to play the newly composed prelude to "Parsifal". The concert also included the "Siegfried Idyll"; Cosima wrote afterwards: "There stands he who has called forth these wonders, and he loves me. He loves me!".

Progress on "Parsifal" was hampered by Wagner's recurrent ill-health, but by late 1880 he announced the next festival for 1882, to be devoted entirely to the new work. Wagner secured Ludwig's agreement that "Parsifal" should be staged exclusively at Bayreuth, but in return, Ludwig required that his current Munich <a href="Kapellmeister">Kapellmeister</a>, <a href="Hermann%20Levi">Hermann Levi</a>, should conduct the festival. Wagner objected on the grounds of Levi's Jewish faith; "Parsifal", he maintained, was a "Christian" opera. Both he and Cosima were vehement anti-Semites; Hilmes conjectures that Cosima inherited this in her youth, from her father, from Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, probably from Madame Patersi and, a little later, from Bülow, "an anti-Semite of the first order". Thus Cosima's anti-Semitism predates her association with Wagner, although Marek observes that he nurtured it in her, to the extent that derogatory references to Jews occur, on average, on every fourth page of her 5,000-page journal. The musicologist Eric Werner argues that Wagner's anti-Semitism derived in part from his initial revolutionary philosophy; as a disciple of <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Proudhon</a> he saw Jewry as "the embodiment of possession, of monopoly capitalism". Cosima's had no such basis, and whereas Wagner retained an ability to revise his views on the basis of his experiences, Cosima's anti-Semitism was visceral and remained unchanged. Cosima records Levi's astonishment on being informed of his appointment. Ludwig was insistent that, despite Wagner's objections, the appointment would stand. Levi would subsequently establish himself as the supreme conductor of the work, held by critical opinion to be "beyond praise".

At the second Bayreuth Festival "Parsifal" was performed 16 times; at the last performance on 29 August, Wagner himself conducted the final scene. Cosima wrote afterwards of how different the orchestra and singers sounded under Wagner. Overall, she and Wagner were entirely satisfied with the outcome of the festival which, unlike its predecessor, had made a handsome profit.: "[N]ot once did the spirit of toil and dedication on the part of the artists abate ... I believe one may be satisfied". One dissident voice was that of <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, once a devoted friend of Wagner's but latterly a harsh critic. Nietzsche considered "Parsifal" an abomination for which Cosima was responsible; she had corrupted Wagner, and as a non-German she had no business meddling in matters of German culture.

At the conclusion of the festival the Wagner family departed for an extended stay in Venice. To accommodate the large party of children, servants and expected guests they took a spacious apartment in the <a href="Palazzo%20Vendramin%20Calergi">Palazzo Vendramin Calergi</a>, overlooking the <a href="Grand%20Canal%20%28Venice%29">Grand Canal</a>. The principal concern during the autumn and winter months was Wagner's declining health; his heart spasms had become so frequent that on 16 November 1882 Cosima recorded: "Today he did "not" have a spasm!". Cosima's journal entry for 12 February 1883—the last she was to make—records Wagner reading <a href="Friedrich%20de%20la%20Motte%20Fouqu%C3%A9">Fouqué's</a> novel "<a href="Undine%20%28novella%29">Undine</a>", and playing the Rhinemaidens' lament from "Das Rheingold" on the piano. However, an underlying cause of domestic friction may have surfaced concerning Carrie Pringle, an English soprano from the "Parsifal" cast who was rumoured to be having an affair with Wagner. According to Isolde, recalling the occasion much later, the Pringle suspicions led to a furious row between Cosima and Wagner on the morning of 13 February. There is no solid evidence of an affair between Wagner and Pringle, nor is Isolde's story of a row supported by any other testimony. At around noon on that day, Wagner suffered a fatal heart attack, and died in the middle of the afternoon.

Cosima sat with Wagner's body for more than 24 hours, refusing all refreshment or respite. During the embalming process, which occupied the next two days, Cosima sat with the body as often as possible, to the dismay of her children. She also asked her daughters to cut her hair, which was then sewn into a cushion and placed on Wagner's breast. On 16 February the journey back to Bayreuth began, and on Sunday 18 February the cortège processed to Wahnfried, where, following a brief service, Wagner was buried in the garden. Cosima remained in the house until the ceremonies were over; according to her daughter Daniela she then went to the grave "and for a long time lay down on the coffin until Fidi (Siegfried) went to fetch her". Afterwards she went into seclusion for many months, barely even seeing her children, with whom she communicated mainly through written notes. Among many messages, she received a telegram from Bülow: "Soeur il faut vivre" ("Sister, it is necessary to live").

Wagner had left neither a will, nor instruction on the management of the Bayreuth Festival after his death. He had written of the future: "I ... cannot think of a single person who could say what I believe needs to be said ... there is practically no one on whose judgement I could rely". The festival's uncertain outlook was aggravated by Cosima's total withdrawal from all contact except that of her daughters and her friend and adviser Adolf von Groß. Without Cosima's participation the 1883 festival, as planned by Wagner—12 performances of "Parsifal"—went ahead, with <a href="Emil%20Scaria">Emil Scaria</a> (who sang the role of Gurnemanz in the opera) doubling as artistic director. The cast was largely that of 1882, and Levi remained as conductor.

At the conclusion of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be a critical factor in determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual</a>. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.

In 1885 Cosima announced that she would direct the 1886 festival. Her tenure as Bayreuth's director lasted for 22 years, until 1907. During that time she oversaw 13 festivals, and by gradually increasing the repertory established the "<a href="Bayreuth%20canon">Bayreuth canon</a>" of ten mature Wagner works. Her triumvirate of conductors—Levi, Richter and <a href="Felix%20Mottl">Felix Mottl</a>—shared the musical direction until 1894, when Levi left. Richter and Mottl served throughout Cosima's years, joined by several of the leading conductors of the day, although Bülow resisted all offers to participate. In the course of her long stewardship Cosima overcame the misgivings of the hardline Wagnerites patrons who believed, like Nietzsche in his early years, that Wagner's works should not be entrusted to a non-German. Under her watch the festival moved from an uncertain financial basis into a prosperous business undertaking that brought great riches to the Wagner family.

Although the festival's historian, Frederic Spotts, suggests that Cosima was more creative than she affected to be, the primary purpose of all her productions was to follow the instructions and reflect the wishes of the Master: "There is nothing left for us here to create, but only to perfect in detail". This policy incurred criticism, among others from <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>, who in 1889 mocked Cosima as the "chief remembrancer". Shaw scorned the idea that Wagner's wishes were best represented by the slavish copying in perpetuity of the performances he had witnessed. Ten years later Shaw highlighted as a feature of the "Bayreuth style" the "intolerably old-fashioned tradition of half rhetorical, half historical-pictorial attitudes and gestures", and the characteristic singing, "sometime tolerable, sometimes abominable". The subordination of the music to text, diction and character portrayal was a specific feature of the Bayreuth style; Cosima, according to Spotts, turned the principle of clear enunciation into "a fetish ... The resulting harsh declamatory style came to be derided as ... the infamous Bayreuth bark".

"Parsifal" was shown alongside other works at each of Cosima's festivals except for 1896, which was devoted to a revival of the "Ring" cycle. In 1886, her first year in charge, she added "Tristan und Isolde" to the canon. Amid the bustle of the festival Cosima refused to be distracted by the illness of her father, Liszt, who collapsed after attending a performance of "Tristan" and died several days later. Cosima supervised her father's funeral service and burial arrangements, but refused a memorial concert or any overt display of remembrance. According to Liszt's pupil <a href="Felix%20Weingartner">Felix Weingartner</a>, "Liszt's passing was not of sufficient importance to dim the glory of the Festival, even for a moment".

"Die Meistersinger" was added in 1888, "<a href="Tannh%C3%A4user%20%28opera%29">Tannhäuser</a>" in 1891, "<a href="Lohengrin%20%28opera%29">Lohengrin</a>" in 1894 and "<a href="The%20Flying%20Dutchman%20%28opera%29">Der fliegende Holländer</a>" in 1901. After the 1894 festival Levi resigned, the years of working in an anti-Semitic ambience having finally had their effect. At the 1896 festival Siegfried made his Bayreuth conducting debut in one of the five "Ring" cycles; he remained one of Bayreuth's regular conductors for the remainder of Cosima's tenure.

In common with Wagner, Cosima was willing to shelve her anti-Semitic prejudices in the interests of Bayreuth, to the extent of continuing to employ Levi for whom she developed considerable artistic respect. However, she frequently undermined him behind his back in private letters, and allowed her children to mimic and mock him. Cosima expressed to Weingartner the view that "between Aryan and Semite blood there could exist no bond whatever". In accordance with this doctrine, she would not invite <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a> (born Jewish though a convert to Catholicism) to conduct at Bayreuth, although she frequently took his advice over artistic matters.

Cosima was determined to preserve Bayreuth's exclusive right, acknowledged by Ludwig, to perform "Parsifal". After Ludwig's death in 1886 this right was briefly challenged by his successor, an attempt swiftly defeated by Cosima with the help of Groß. A more serious threat arose from the German copyright laws, which only protected works for 30 years following the creator's death; thus "Parsifal" would lose its protection in 1913 regardless of any agreement with the Bavarian court. In anticipation, in 1901 Cosima sought to have the period of copyright protection extended by law to 50 years. She lobbied members of the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Reichstag</a> tirelessly, and was assured by <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> of his support. These efforts failed to bring about any change in the law. In 1903, taking advantage of the lack of a copyright agreement between the United States and Germany, <a href="Heinrich%20Conried">Heinrich Conried</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Metropolitan%20Opera">New York Metropolitan Opera</a> announced that he would stage "Parsifal" later that year. Cosima was enraged, but her efforts to prevent him were to no avail; the first of 11 performances took place on 24 December 1903. The enterprise was a popular and critical success, though in Cosima's view it was a "rape"; her hostility towards the Metropolitan lasted for the remainder of her life.

By the beginning of the new century three of Cosima's daughters had married: Blandina to Count Biagio Gravina in the closing days of the 1882 festival, Daniela to <a href="Henry%20Thode">Henry Thode</a>, an art historian, on 3 July 1886, and Isolde, Cosima's first child by Wagner, who married a young conductor, , on 20 December 1900. The youngest daughter, Eva, rejected numerous suitors to remain her mother's secretary and companion for the rest of Cosima's tenure.

On 8 December 1906, having directed that year's festival, Cosima suffered an <a href="Adams%E2%80%93Stokes%20syndrome">Adams-Stokes seizure</a> (a form of heart attack) while visiting her friend <a href="Hermann%2C%20Prince%20of%20Hohenlohe-Langenburg">Prince Hohenlohe</a> at <a href="Langenburg">Langenburg</a>. By May 1907 it was clear that her health was such that she could no longer remain in charge at Bayreuth; this responsibility now passed to Siegfried, her long-designated heir. The succession was accomplished against a background of family disagreement; Beidler thought that he had rights, based partly on his greater conducting experience and also because he and Isolde had produced Wagner's only grandchild, a son born in October 1901, who could establish a dynastic succession. Beidler's claims were dismissed by Cosima and by Siegfried; he never conducted at Bayreuth again, and the rift between the Beidlers and Cosima developed in due course into a major family feud.

Cosima moved into rooms to the rear of Wahnfried, away from the house's daily bustle, where she passed her days surrounded by Wagner's possessions and numerous family portraits. Although at first Siegfried discussed his festival plans with her, she avoided the Festpielhaus, content to read reports of the productions. Siegfried made few changes to the production traditions set by Wagner and Cosima; Spotts records that "whatever had been laid down by his parents was preserved unchanged out of a sense of strict filial duty". Only in matters on which they had not spoken was he prepared to exercise his own judgement. As a result, the original "Parsifal" sets remained in use even when they were visibly crumbling; the view of Cosima and her daughters was that no changes should ever be made to stage sets "on which the eye of the Master had rested".

In December 1908 Eva, then 41, married <a href="Houston%20Stewart%20Chamberlain">Houston Stewart Chamberlain</a>, a British-born historian who had adopted as his personal creed a fanatical form of German nationalism based on principles of extreme racial and cultural purity. He had known Cosima since 1888, though his affinity with Wagner extended back to 1882, when he had attended the premiere of "Parsifal". He had successively courted Blandina and then Isolde, before settling on Eva. Cosima had considerable empathy with his theories; according to Carr "she came to love him as her son—perhaps even more". Chamberlain became the dominant figure within the Wagner circle, and was largely responsible for the increasing alienation of the Beidlers. Cosima may have been unaware of Isolde's attempts at rapprochement, because Eva and Chamberlain withheld Isolde's letters. In 1913 Isolde was effectively disinherited when she sought to confirm her rights as a co-heir to the considerable Wagner fortunes in a court case, which she lost. After this she withdrew, and to the time of her death in 1919 never again saw or communicated directly with Cosima.

A happier family event from Cosima's standpoint was Siegfried's marriage in 1915, at the age of 46, to <a href="Winifred%20Wagner">Winifred Williams</a>, the 18-year-old foster-daughter of <a href="Karl%20Klindworth">Karl Klindworth</a> who had been friends with both Wagner and Liszt. When the couple's first son, <a href="Wieland%20Wagner">Wieland</a>, was born on 5 January 1917, Cosima celebrated by playing excerpts from the "Siegfried Idyll" on Wagner's piano.

The outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> curtailed the 1914 festival; the conflict and the political and economic upheavals that followed the war closed the Festpielhaus until 1924. Plans for the festival's resumption coincided with an upsurge in Germany of extreme nationalist politics. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, a fervent Wagner admirer, first visited Wahnfried in 1923, and although he was not received by Cosima he befriended the family and was thereafter a regular visitor. The Chamberlains, together with Winifred, became enthusiastic members of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>, and the 1924 festival became an overt rally for the party and its leading supporters. That year Cosima, then 86, ended her long absence from the theatre by attending the dress rehearsals for "Parsifal", and watching the first act at the opening performance on 23 July. The tenor <a href="Lauritz%20Melchior">Lauritz Melchior</a> remembered Siegfried returning from frequent visits to a small gallery above the stage and saying "Mama wants..."

By 1927, the year of her 90th birthday, Cosima's health was failing. The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by the naming of a street in her honour, although she was unaware; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would overexcite her. In her last years she was virtually bedridden, became blind, and was only lucid at intervals. She died, aged 92, on 1 April 1930; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to <a href="Coburg">Coburg</a> and cremated.

Cosima's life mission was total service to Wagner and his works; in the words of the music critic <a href="Eric%20Salzman">Eric Salzman</a> she "submitted herself body and soul to the Master". In Wagner's lifetime she fulfilled this purpose primarily by recording in her journal every facet of his life and ideas. After his death the journal was abandoned; she would henceforth serve the master by perpetuating his artistic heritage through the Bayreuth Festival. Guided by Groß, but also using her own acumen—Werner calls her a "superb business woman"—she succeeded in making the festival first solvent, then profitable.

While acknowledging that Cosima was an effective "keeper of the flame", commentators have criticised the nature of her legacy. The "Ring" historian J.K. Holman describes it as one of "stifling conservatism". Her policy of sticking to Wagner's original stage conceptions was not fully abandoned until after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, when a new generation took charge of the festival. Hilmes likens Cosima's role to that of the abbess of a religious community: "a cohesive, quasi-religious congregation of Bayreuthians sharing a common philosophical outlook". Anti-Semitism was integral to this philosophy; although in 1869 Cosima had opposed the re-publication of Wagner's anti-Jewish treatise "<a href="Das%20Judenthum%20in%20der%20Musik">Jewishness in Music</a>", this was on grounds of commercial prudence rather than sensitivity. In 1881 she encouraged Wagner to write his essay "Know Thyself", and to include in it a tirade against Jewish assimilation.

The critic and one-time librettist <a href="Philip%20Hensher">Philip Hensher</a> writes that "under the guidance of her repulsive racial-theorist son-in-law [Chamberlain]... Cosima tried to turn Bayreuth into a centre for the cult of German purity." Thus, he continues, "By the time she died, Wagner's reputation was ... at the forefront of a terrible political dynamism: antique stagings of his works were presented to audiences of Brownshirts". The close association of the festival with Hitler and the Nazis during the 1930s was much more the work of Winifred—an overt Hitler supporter—than of Cosima, though Hensher asserts that "Cosima was as much to blame as anyone".

In the immediate aftermath of Cosima's death, some writers heaped copious praise on her. <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a>, Wagner's biographer, called her "the greatest figure that ever came within [Wagner's] circle"; Richard du Moulin Eckart, Cosima's first biographer, introduced her as "the greatest woman of the century". In time judgements became more measured, and divided. Marek closes his account by emphasising her role not only as Wagner's protector but as his muse: "Without her there would have been no "Siegfried Idyll", no Bayreuth, and no "Parsifal"". In Hensher's judgement, "Wagner was a genius, but also a fairly appalling human being. Cosima was just an appalling human being." In 1977, 47 years after her death, Cosima's urn was recovered from Coburg and buried alongside Wagner in the Wahnfried garden.

The symbol indicates work's Bayreuth premiere. Under Cosima Wagner "Parsifal" was performed 97 times, "Tristan und Isolde" 24, "Die Meistersinger" 22, "Tannhäuser" 21, "Lohengrin" 6, the "Ring" cycle 18 and "Der fliegende Holländer" 10.

Science Fantasy (magazine)

Science Fantasy, which also appeared under the titles Impulse and SF Impulse, was a British <a href="fantasy%20fiction%20magazine">fantasy</a> and <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as a companion to Nova's "<a href="New%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">New Worlds</a>". <a href="Walter%20Gillings">Walter Gillings</a> was editor for the first two issues, and was then replaced by <a href="John%20Carnell">John Carnell</a>, the editor of "New Worlds", as a cost-saving measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by <a href="Roberts%20%26amp%3B%20Vinter">Roberts & Vinter</a>, who hired <a href="Kyril%20Bonfiglioli">Kyril Bonfiglioli</a> to edit "Science Fantasy"; Bonfiglioli changed the title to "Impulse" in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to "SF Impulse" for the last few issues. "Science Fantasy" ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.

Gillings had an inventory of material that he had acquired while editing "<a href="Fantasy%20%281946%20magazine%29">Fantasy</a>", and he drew on this for "Science Fantasy", as well as incorporating his own <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>, "Science Fantasy Review", into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, "Science Fantasy" typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Bulmer">Ken Bulmer</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, whose <a href="debut%20novel">first novel</a> "<a href="Non-Stop%20%28novel%29">Nonstop</a>" appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during the latter half of the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish <a href="Thomas%20Burnett%20Swann">Thomas Burnett Swann</a>'s well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of "Science Fantasy" was always higher than that of "New Worlds", and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo</a> nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including <a href="Keith%20Roberts">Keith Roberts</a>, <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a> and <a href="Josephine%20Saxton">Josephine Saxton</a>. In the opinion of science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, the final year of "Impulse", as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.

In early 1946, British fan <a href="John%20Carnell">John Carnell</a> launched a new science fiction magazine titled "<a href="New%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">New Worlds</a>", published by Pendulum Publications. The first issue appeared in July 1946 and failed to sell well. The second issue, in October of that year, sold better, but Pendulum went out of business before the end of 1947 with only one more issue released. A group of sf fans, including Carnell and Frank Cooper, decided to restart the magazine under their own control, and formed Nova Publications Ltd. The fourth issue appeared in April 1949.

At the same time that the first issue of "New Worlds" appeared, a separate British magazine called "<a href="Fantasy%20%281946%20magazine%29">Fantasy</a>" was launched by <a href="Walter%20Gillings">Walter Gillings</a>, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. "Fantasy" lasted for only three issues before dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of "Fantasy" by publishing a <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>, titled "Fantasy Review", beginning in March 1947.

In 1950, with "New Worlds" on a stable quarterly schedule, Nova Publications decided to launch a companion, "Science Fantasy". They chose Gillings as the editor, and his fanzine, which had been retitled "Science Fantasy Review" in 1949, was incorporated in the new magazine as a department. The first issue was dated Summer 1950, but printing disputes meant that the second issue was delayed until winter. <a href="Rationing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Paper">Paper rationing</a> delayed the third issue to Winter 1951, but before it appeared, Nova decided that it could no longer afford to have separate editors for "New Worlds" and "Science Fantasy", and Gillings was let go. According to Carnell, there were also "fundamental differences of opinion" that led to the decision to replace him.

After the Spring 1953 issue Nova Publications decided to switch printers, in order to cut costs and bring the cover price down from <a href="%C2%A3sd">2/-</a> (10 p) to 1/6 (7.5 p). The new printers, The Carlton Press, failed to keep to the agreed printing schedule, and produced poor quality work; there were also printers' strikes, and this disruption caused extended delays in the appearance of the seventh issue. While the dispute with the printers was going on, Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith, a journalist acquaintance of Carnell's, put together a small conference of well-known science fiction authors, including <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>. Goldsmith covered the conference for "<a href="Illustrated%20%28magazine%29">Illustrated</a>", a weekly magazine, and the article caught the attention of <a href="Maclaren%20%26amp%3B%20Sons%20Ltd">Maclaren & Sons Ltd</a>, a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine. Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications, but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova Publications, with a commitment to produce "New Worlds" on a monthly basis and "Science Fantasy" on a bimonthly schedule. Maclaren's legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute with The Carlton Press, and the seventh issue of "Science Fantasy" finally appeared with a cover date of March 1954.

In 1958, Nova decided to launch a British reprint of the American magazine "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Adventures%20%281956%20magazine%29">Science Fiction Adventures</a>", under the same title. The British "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Adventures%20%28British%20magazine%29">Science Fiction Adventures</a>" lasted until May 1963, when it was felled by declining sales. "New Worlds", Nova's flagship title, and "Science Fantasy" were also suffering from poor sales, with circulation estimated at about 5,000, though a switch from bimonthly to a monthly schedule was also considered that year for "Science Fantasy". In September Nova decided to close down both remaining titles, and in preparation for the change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, "<a href="New%20Writings%20in%20SF">New Writings in SF</a>", for publisher <a href="Dennis%20Dobson">Dennis Dobson</a>. Readers' responses to news of the planned demise of the magazines included a letter from <a href="Michael%20Moorcock">Michael Moorcock</a>, published in the April 1964 "New Worlds", asking how the British market would now be able to train writers to sell to the higher-paying U.S. magazines.

In early 1964, David Warburton of <a href="Roberts%20%26amp%3B%20Vinter">Roberts & Vinter</a>, an established publisher, heard from the printer of "Science Fantasy" and "New Worlds" that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided that having a respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts & Vinter's books: "Science Fantasy" and "New Worlds" both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, <a href="John%20Menzies">John Menzies</a> and <a href="W%20H%20Smith">W.H. Smith</a>. Carnell did not want to continue to edit the magazines in addition to "New Writings in SF", and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; <a href="Kyril%20Bonfiglioli">Kyril Bonfiglioli</a>, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose "New Worlds", and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of "Science Fantasy". Roberts & Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli's control was number 65, dated June–July 1964. The schedule was initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart—for example, June–July 1964 was followed by July–August 1964. From March 1965 a regular monthly schedule was begun.

Bonfiglioli often bought material from writers without an established reputation; he did not make any special effort to acquire stories from well-known names. He was known for writing long and helpful rejection letters to newcomers, but he also had a reputation for laziness, and much of the day-to-day editorial work was done by assistants—first James Parkhill-Rathbone, and then Keith Roberts.

Bonfiglioli disliked the title of the magazine, feeling that it "promised the worst of both worlds"; he proposed "Caliban" as the new title, but the publisher dissuaded him. He settled on "Impulse" instead, and the magazine appeared under the new title starting with the March 1966 issue. The paperback format was unchanged, but the volume numeration was restarted at volume 1 number 1, to "sever all connections with "Science Fantasy"", in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley. The name change proved to be disastrous; there was already a magazine called "Impulse", and this caused distribution problems. In addition, treating "Impulse" as a new magazine meant a fresh distribution contract was needed. Bonfiglioli attempted to repair the damage by changing the name to "SF Impulse" starting in August 1966, but the result was a dramatic drop in circulation.

By late 1966 Bonfiglioli had made enough money from his antiques dealing to be able to retire to <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a>. <a href="J.G.%20Ballard">J.G. Ballard</a> was briefly involved with the magazine in an editorial role, but his aims for the magazine were too far from the publisher's goals and he was quickly replaced by <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a>. Harrison almost immediately had to leave England and handed over much of the day-to-day management of the magazine to Keith Roberts. Despite the setback from Bonfiglioli's title change, the magazine was still profitable, but in July 1966 Roberts & Vinter's distributor, <a href="Thorpe%20%26amp%3B%20Porter">Thorpe & Porter</a>, went bankrupt while owing Roberts & Vinter a substantial sum. The resulting financial pressure led Roberts & Vinter to decide to focus on their more profitable magazines, and the February 1967 issue of "SF Impulse" was the last, though "New Worlds", the sister magazine, survived via an <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Arts Council</a> grant obtained by Brian Aldiss's efforts. The title was merged with "New Worlds" with effect from the March 1967 issue, though nothing of "SF Impulse"s content was retained.

In the first issue, Gillings declared that he was interested in science fantasy "in all its forms: with its significant ideas, its surprising prophecies, its sheer fictions, its evolution as a fascinating literature". Stories in the first issue, drawn from Gillings' inventory of material acquired for "Fantasy", included "The Belt", by <a href="James%20Morgan%20Walsh">J.M. Walsh</a>; "Time's Arrow", by <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>; and "Monster", by <a href="Samuel%20Youd">John Christopher</a>, writing as Christopher Youd. Gillings also included several non-fiction features, such as his fanzine, "Science Fantasy Review", incorporated into "Science Fantasy" as a department, and condensed to a few pages. In the first issue Gillings reviewed an article about science fiction by <a href="Jacob%20Bronowski">Jacob Bronowski</a> which had appeared in the "<a href="Daily%20Mail%23Continental%20and%20Overseas%20Daily%20Mail">Continental Daily Mail</a>". There were also three book review columns: two by Gillings, writing under pseudonyms, and one by John Aiken, the son of poet <a href="Conrad%20Aiken">Conrad Aiken</a>.

When Carnell took over, he planned to distinguish "Science Fantasy" from its sister magazine, "New Worlds", by adding more fantasy, while printing nothing but sf in "New Worlds", though it took some time for the two magazines to develop separate personalities. Carnell also dropped the non-fiction features, though he did start a series of guest editorials, starting with Gillings in the third issue and <a href="H.%20J.%20Campbell">H.J. Campbell</a> in the fourth issue. The acquisition of Nova Publications by Maclaren gave Carnell access to the publishing facilities of a well-established company, and to established distribution channels, which freed him to focus on his editorial duties. Carnell tended to put longer stories in "Science Fantasy" than in "New Worlds", and "Science Fantasy" typically ran a long lead novelette with several short stories. Stories that would not have suited "New Worlds" began to appear, such as <a href="William%20F.%20Temple">William F. Temple</a>'s "Eternity" (February 1955), in which aliens mysteriously provide haloes to thousands of people, and Dal Stiven's "Free Will", which featured robot ghosts. Stories in the whimsical fantasy tradition that had been started by "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>", however, did not often appear in "Science Fantasy".

Many of the lead novelettes in the 1950s were provided by <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Bulmer">Ken Bulmer</a>. Brunner's first appearance was in September 1955 with "The Talisman"; over the next few years he wrote both science fiction and fantasy for "Science Fantasy", including "A Time to Read" (December 1956), an alternate-world fantasy, and "Lungfish" (December 1957), a <a href="generation%20ship">generation starship</a> story. Bulmer's first appearance in "Science Fantasy" was in June 1955, with "Psi No More"; he contributed regularly thereafter. A short version of Brian Aldiss's first novel, <a href="Non-Stop%20%28novel%29">Nonstop</a>, appeared in the February 1956 issue, and Aldiss subsequently contributed some experimental stories. From 1956 onwards the magazine contained substantially more fantasy than sf.

In Carnell's opinion, the literary quality of "Science Fantasy" was "far higher" than that of "New Worlds", but "New Worlds" was always the better-selling of the two magazines. Carnell's determination to keep the quality high led him to delay publishing issue 20 for two months because of a "lack of suitable material". His efforts were rewarded by frequent appearances of stories from "Science Fantasy" in the annual "Year's Greatest SF" anthology series edited by <a href="Judith%20Merril">Judith Merril</a>. Carnell occasionally used reprints, often selecting stories in line with the magazine's focus on offbeat fantasy, such as <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s "Space-Time for Springers", and <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>'s "The Graveyard Reader". Towards the end of the 1950s Carnell began to reintroduce non-fiction, and starting in 1959 he printed a series of articles by <a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a> on key figures in the early history of science fiction, such as <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>; these articles, which had first appeared in American magazines such as "<a href="Satellite%20Science%20Fiction">Satellite Science Fiction</a>", were later collected as "Explorers of the Infinite". The artwork was of variable quality, in the opinion of critic <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a>; among the better covers Stableford cites the work of <a href="Brian%20Lewis%20%28artist%29">Brian Lewis</a>, who supplied almost all "Science Fantasy"s cover art from 1958 through 1961. Historian David Kyle commented on the "remarkable" cover by R.M. Bull for the third issue, which he regarded as "strikingly reminiscent of the work of Margaret Brundage for "Weird Tales" in the thirties."

In the early 1960s, <a href="Thomas%20Burnett%20Swann">Thomas Burnett Swann</a> became strongly associated with "Science Fantasy". He had published a couple of genre short stories before beginning to sell to Carnell with "The Dryad-Tree" in the August 1960 issue. Swann's speciality was historical fantasy, and "Where Is the Bird of Fire?", his retelling of the <a href="Romulus%20and%20Remus">Romulus and Remus</a> myth, which was serialised in "Science Fantasy" in 1962, "received more praise than any other [novelette] in recent years", according to Carnell. Swann was one of the three mainstays of "Science Fantasy" in the early 1960s: the others were Michael Moorcock and J.G. Ballard. Ballard's first story in "Science Fantasy" was "Prima Belladona", which appeared in the December 1956 issue; his work over the next few years was ideally suited to "Science Fantasy" and he became a regular contributor. He published some conventional stories in the British magazines, but over the next few years Ballard's more traditional science fiction material appeared mostly in the American market, with "Science Fantasy" and "New Worlds" reserved for more experimental material that was a harbinger of <a href="New%20Wave%20science%20fiction">New Wave science fiction</a>. Moorcock's <a href="Elric%20of%20Melnibon%C3%A9">Elric of Melniboné</a> series, about a <a href="sword%20and%20sorcery">sword and sorcery</a> anti-hero, began with "The Dreaming City" in the June 1961 "Science Fantasy", and Moorcock appeared frequently thereafter: he had either a story or an essay (and sometimes both) in all but four of the remaining issues edited by Carnell. <a href="Terry%20Pratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s first story, "The Hades Business", appeared in the August 1963 issue. Ashley regards the early 1960s as one of the high points of the magazine; it was nominated for the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for each of the last three years in which Carnell edited it, from 1962 to 1964, but it never won.

When Kyril Bonfiglioli took over in 1964, he complained in his first editorial that he had "just read through a quarter of a million words of ms [manuscript] and half of it was so bad it made me blush". He asked Brian Aldiss to help; the only unsold stories Aldiss had were from his early days, "written before I got the hang of things", but Bonfiglioli told Aldiss, "They can't possibly be worse than the rubbish that's being submitted". Aldiss provided four stories for the first two issues, under his own name and two pseudonyms, "Jael Cracken" and "John Runciman". Bonfiglioli's third issue included <a href="Keith%20Roberts">Keith Roberts</a>' first two stories: "Escapism", a <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a> tale, and "Anita", the first in a series about a witch; Roberts became a frequent contributor both under his own name and as "Alistair Bevan", and also provided the artwork for several covers. "The Day of the Minotaur", another historical fantasy by Thomas Burnett Swann, began serialisation in the same issue under the title "The Blue Monkeys". Swann's novel "The Weirwoods" was also serialised in the magazine, with no change of title. Other new writers that began to appear under Bonfiglioli's editorship included <a href="Josephine%20Saxton">Josephine Saxton</a> and Brian Stableford. Bonfiglioli's focus on stories that he liked personally, rather than on a specific editorial policy, led author Christopher Priest to describe "Science Fantasy" under Bonfiglioli's editorship as "a literate and charmingly eccentric magazine, with an atmosphere all its own".

At the <a href="23rd%20World%20Science%20Fiction%20Convention">World Science Fiction Convention</a> in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli persuaded several well-known writers to appear in an "all-star issue ... with specially written stories round the theme of 'sacrifice. The issue in question was the first one under the new title of "Impulse", in March 1966; it included fiction by <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>, <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>, and Keith Roberts, who contributed "The Signaller", the first story in his "<a href="Pavane%20%28novel%29">Pavane</a>" sequence. The second issue was also high quality, with another "Pavane" story and a short story by John Brunner from his "Traveller in Black" series. Subsequent issues did not sustain this high level, but overall, in Ashley's opinion, the twelve issues of "Impulse" contained "some of the best SF and fantasy ever published in British magazines". <a href="Christopher%20Priest%20%28novelist%29">Christopher Priest</a>'s first story, "The Run", appeared in the May 1966 issue, and <a href="Chris%20Boyce">Chris Boyce</a>'s second story, "George", was published in June 1966. Two novels were serialised in "Impulse", both well-received: Harry Harrison's "<a href="Make%20Room%21%20Make%20Room%21">Make Room! Make Room!</a>" (later made into the movie "<a href="Soylent%20Green">Soylent Green</a>"), and Moorcock's "The Ice Schooner". Other notable stories listed by Ashley include <a href="Thomas%20Disch">Thomas Disch</a>'s "The Roaches" and "The Number You Have Just Reached", and Aldiss's "The Eyes of the Blind King". Stableford also praises the covers for the last few issues, which were mostly done by Keith Roberts in a semi-abstract style unlike conventional genre art.

The editorial succession at "Science Fantasy" was as follows:

The publisher was Nova Publications until April 1964, and Roberts & Vinter Ltd thereafter.

"Science Fantasy" was <a href="digest%20size">digest-sized</a> for its first two issues. The size increased to a large digest for the next four issues, but with issue seven it returned to a small digest again, and remained in that format until the June–July 1964 issue, which was issued in paperback format. The remaining issues, including all those under the "Impulse" title, were published as paperbacks. It initially was priced at 2/-; the price was cut to 1/6 for the third issue, but returned to 2/- with the seventh issue. With issue 11 (December 1954) the price returned to 2/-, and it rose to 2/6 with issue 46 and to 3/- with issue 61. When the format changed to paperback with issue 65 the price dropped again to 2/6, and remained there until the title change to Impulse. All the twelve "Impulse" issues were priced at 3/6. The page count began at 96, and rose to 128 with issue 7. Issues 36 through 63 were 112 pages, and the final digest-sized issue was 124 pages. The paperback issues were 128 pages under the "Science Fantasy" title, and 160 pages for the "Impulse" issues. Volume numbering began with two volumes of three issues, but the second volume began with volume 2, number 4 instead of restarting the issue number at 1 as would usually be done. From issue 7 the volume number was dropped completely.

The schedule was initially quite irregular, with the first two issues, in Summer and Winter 1950, followed almost a year later by a Winter 1951–52 issue. Spring and Autumn 1952 were followed by Spring 1953 and then another long delay to the seventh issue which was dated 1954, without a month or season given. The schedule became more regular thereafter, with May 1954 inaugurating a bimonthly schedule that lasted till November 1955, except that September 1954 was followed by a December issue, and June 1955 was followed by September. After February, May and August 1955, the December 1956 issue began a regular bimonthly sequence that was marred only by the appearance of a November 1959 issue between the August and December issues. After the switch to paperback, the sequence ran as follows: June–July 1964, July–August 1964, September–October 1964, December 1964 – January 1965, January–February 1965, and then monthly from March 1965 to the end.

There have been no anthologies drawn solely from the pages of "Science Fantasy", but "Weird Shadows From Beyond", edited by John Carnell, and published by <a href="Transworld%20%28company%29">Corgi Books</a> in 1965, drew eight of its ten stories from the magazine.

In 2013, a 371-page volume written by John Boston and curated by Damien Broderick, titled "Strange Highways: Reading" Science Fantasy, "1950–1967" was published by Borgo/Wildside in the US. It discusses, sometimes in detail, every issue, story, writer, cover, and even advertisement of the magazine.

Lanny King McDonald (born February 16, 1953) is a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> former professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> player for the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, <a href="Colorado%20Rockies%20%28NHL%29">Colorado Rockies</a> and <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL). He played over <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201%2C000%20games%20played">1,100 games</a> during a 16-year career in which he scored <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%20500%20goals">500 goals</a> and over <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201%2C000%20points">1,000 points</a>. His total of 66 goals in <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982–83</a> remains the Flames' franchise record for a single season.

McDonald was selected by the Maple Leafs as the fourth overall pick in the <a href="1973%20NHL%20Amateur%20Draft">1973 NHL Amateur Draft</a> and established himself as an offensive forward with three consecutive 40-goal seasons in Toronto in the mid-1970s. His trade to the Rockies in 1979 resulted in Toronto fans protesting the deal in front of <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>. He played parts of three seasons in Denver, before he was sent to Calgary in 1981 where he spent the remainder of his career. He <a href="Captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">co-captained</a> the Flames to a <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship in his final season of <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NHL%20season">1988–89</a>.

McDonald is among the most popular players in Flames history and his personality and bushy red moustache made him an iconic figure within the sport. McDonald won the <a href="Bill%20Masterton%20Memorial%20Trophy">Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</a> for dedication and sportsmanship in 1983 and in 1988 was named the inaugural winner of the <a href="King%20Clancy%20Memorial%20Trophy">King Clancy Memorial Trophy</a> for his leadership and humanitarian presence, in particular through his long association with the <a href="Special%20Olympics">Special Olympics</a>.

Internationally, McDonald represented <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> as a player on two occasions and in a management role three times. His assist created the tournament winning overtime goal of the inaugural <a href="1976%20Canada%20Cup">1976 Canada Cup</a>, and he was director of player personnel of Canada's <a href="2004%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2004 World Championship</a> winning team.

The Flames <a href="List%20of%20National%20Hockey%20League%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> McDonald's uniform number 9 in 1990. McDonald was inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1992, the <a href="Alberta%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Alberta Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 1993 and <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canada's Sports Hall of Fame</a> in 2017. In 2015, he was named chairman of the board of the Hockey Hall of Fame, after serving nine years on the Hall's selection committee.

McDonald was born February 16, 1953, in <a href="Hanna%2C%20Alberta">Hanna, Alberta</a>. He is the youngest of four children after brother Lynn and sisters Donna and Dixie. His father, Lorne, tended the family farm near the hamlet of <a href="Craigmyle%2C%20Alberta">Craigmyle</a>, outside Hanna. The young Lanny viewed his father as his hero, often following Lorne around helping with whatever chores he could. McDonald credits his father for teaching him the value of honesty and hard work. His mother, Phyllis, was a full-time teacher who was frequently involved with community events.

Learning to skate at the age of five, McDonald immediately developed a passion for hockey. He served as a stick boy, helping manage equipment, for his father's community team and grew up listening to the famous <a href="Foster%20Hewitt">Foster Hewitt</a> radio broadcasts of "<a href="Hockey%20Night%20in%20Canada">Hockey Night in Canada</a>". McDonald shared his father's passion for the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>; he was given his middle name, King, after Maple Leafs' star <a href="King%20Clancy">King Clancy</a>. He began playing organized hockey at the age of six and, despite both having full-time commitments, his parents drove him and Lynn to Hanna for their practices and games. McDonald recalled that half of his time in youth hockey was spent in Hanna, and the other half in the car. He completed high school while playing in Lethbridge, choosing to remain with his <a href="junior%20ice%20hockey">junior A</a> team in 1970–71 rather than join the <a href="Medicine%20Hat%20Tigers">Medicine Hat Tigers</a> of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">Western Canada Hockey League</a> (WCHL) so that he could complete his diploma.

McDonald began his junior career in 1969 with the <a href="Lethbridge%20Sugar%20Kings">Lethbridge Sugar Kings</a> of the tier II <a href="Alberta%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Alberta Junior Hockey League</a> (AJHL). He appeared in 34 games for the Sugar Kings as a 16-year-old, scoring two goals. The following season, 1970–71, he emerged as a leading scorer, recording 37 goals and 82 <a href="point%20%28ice%20hockey%29">points</a> in 45 games. He was voted the league's most valuable player and named to the Second All-Star team. Additionally, McDonald appeared in six WCHL games with the <a href="Calgary%20Centennials">Calgary Centennials</a>.

The Medicine Hat Tigers acquired McDonald's playing rights in a <a href="trade%20%28sports%29">trade</a> during the <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20WCHL%20season">1970–71 WCHL season</a>. He joined the team the following year, finishing eighth in league scoring with 114 points, including 50 goals. He improved to 62 goals and 139 points in <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20WCHL%20season">1972–73</a> to finish third overall in league scoring and was named to the WCHL All-Star Team at <a href="Forward%20%28ice%20hockey%29">forward</a>. McDonald added 37 points in the playoffs as the Tigers won the <a href="Ed%20Chynoweth%20Cup">league championship</a>.

In McDonald's draft year of 1973, the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) was in competition with the rival <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA) for talent. McDonald was considered a top junior prospect and was recruited by both leagues. The <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> had the third overall selection in the <a href="1973%20NHL%20Amateur%20Draft">NHL draft</a> and were interested in drafting him, but opted against it when McDonald made it clear he would likely go to the WHA rather than play with Vancouver. Instead, he went to the Toronto Maple Leafs with the fourth overall pick. In the <a href="1973%20WHA%20Amateur%20Draft">WHA draft</a>, he was selected 10th overall by the <a href="Cleveland%20Crusaders">Cleveland Crusaders</a>. McDonald chose to play in the NHL, signing a contract with the Maple Leafs that was considered to be among the richest in the league. The deal, worth between $175,000 and $200,000 per season, came as a result of the competition between the two leagues and McDonald found that some of the older players in Toronto resented him as a result.

McDonald made his NHL debut with the Leafs on October 10, 1973, against the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>. He assisted on two goals in the game, but also suffered a concussion and required several stitches after landing on his head as a result of a check by <a href="Rick%20Martin">Rick Martin</a>. Following the custom of most NHL players at the time, he played the game without wearing a helmet. It was the only time in his career he did so, as he felt that his injury contributed to his early struggles in the NHL. McDonald scored his first NHL goal on October 17 against <a href="Michel%20Larocque">Michel Larocque</a> of the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>, but finished the season with only 14 goals and 30 points in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20NHL%20season">1973–74</a>. His continued inability to score early in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20NHL%20season">1974–75</a> season nearly resulted in a trade. <a href="Atlanta%20Flames">Atlanta Flames</a> general manager <a href="Cliff%20Fletcher">Cliff Fletcher</a> sought to take advantage of the Maple Leafs' early disappointment in McDonald and agreed in principle to a trade for the young forward in exchange for <a href="Curt%20Bennett">Curt Bennett</a>. However, McDonald scored three goals in his following two games causing Toronto to back out of the deal. McDonald recorded a modest improvement over his rookie campaign: 17 goals and 44 points.
The patience the Maple Leafs had shown McDonald in his first two seasons was rewarded in <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20NHL%20season">1975–76</a> when he rediscovered his offensive touch, scoring 37 goals and adding 56 assists. Following the season, he earned an invite to the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian national team's</a> summer camp in advance of the <a href="1976%20Canada%20Cup">1976 Canada Cup</a>. McDonald was named to the roster, and appeared in five of Team Canada's seven games. He recorded two assists in the tournament, one of which came on <a href="Darryl%20Sittler">Darryl Sittler</a>'s overtime goal that clinched the inaugural <a href="Canada%20Cup">Canada Cup</a> championship.

A 43-goal season in <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20NHL%20season">1976–77</a> earned McDonald several accolades. He was named to the <a href="Wales%20Conference">Wales Conference</a> team at the <a href="30th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">1977 All-Star Game</a> where he scored two goals in a 4–3 victory over the <a href="Campbell%20Conference">Campbell Conference</a>. He was also named a <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Team">Second Team All-Star</a> at right wing following the season. It was the first of three consecutive 40-goal seasons for McDonald, and he finished in the top ten in NHL scoring in both <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20NHL%20season">1977–78</a> and <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20NHL%20season">1978–79</a>. He appeared in his <a href="31st%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">second All-Star Game</a> in 1978 and played for the NHL All-Stars in the <a href="1979%20Challenge%20Cup%20%28ice%20hockey%29">1979 Challenge Cup</a> against the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Soviet national team</a>.

The highlight of McDonald's career in Toronto came in the <a href="1978%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1978 Stanley Cup playoffs</a> against the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a>. The Maple Leafs were viewed as <a href="Underdog%20%28term%29">underdogs</a> in the series against an Islanders team that was considered to be among the best in the league. Toronto overcame a 2–0 series deficit to force a seventh and deciding game. Playing despite breaking both his wrist and nose during the series, McDonald scored the overtime winning goal that eliminated the Islanders and allowed the Maple Leafs to advance to the league semi-finals for the first time in 11 years. Toronto was then eliminated by Montreal, who swept the series with four consecutive victories.

<a href="Punch%20Imlach">Punch Imlach</a> was named Toronto general manager prior to the <a href="1979%E2%80%9380%20NHL%20season">1979–80 season</a> and immediately clashed with team captain Darryl Sittler. Imlach wanted to move Sittler to another team, but the player refused to waive his no trade clause. Imlach responded by trading teammates friendly to Sittler instead. On December 28, 1979, Imlach dealt McDonald to the <a href="Colorado%20Rockies%20%28NHL%29">Colorado Rockies</a>, along with <a href="Joel%20Quenneville">Joel Quenneville</a>, in exchange for <a href="Wilf%20Paiement">Wilf Paiement</a> and <a href="Pat%20Hickey">Pat Hickey</a>. The deal came as a surprise even to Toronto's head coach.

McDonald was devastated by the trade, particularly because he and his wife were expecting their second child and had just purchased a new house. In his 1987 autobiography, he argued that Imlach made the trade out of spite. McDonald had also come into conflict with Imlach while serving as the team's representative of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20Players%27%20Association">National Hockey League Players' Association</a> (NHLPA) when the general manager refused to honour an increase in the per diem paid to each player. The trade outraged fans in Toronto, where McDonald was among the team's most popular players. While fans picketed outside <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> in protest, McDonald told the media that he felt fortunate to have been traded away from the unsettled situation the Leafs were in and blamed Imlach for the team's failures on the ice. Sittler resigned as the team's captain following the trade.

Arriving in Colorado, McDonald found himself at the centre of another power struggle. Sympathetic to the fact that his wife was less than two weeks away from giving birth, head coach <a href="Don%20Cherry">Don Cherry</a> gave McDonald permission to leave the team on off-days to return to his wife in Toronto. But he did so without gaining the approval of general manager <a href="Ray%20Miron">Ray Miron</a>, who disagreed frequently with Cherry and fired him following the season. On the ice, McDonald scored 35 goals with the Rockies and finished with a total of 40 between the two teams.

Rumours circulated following the season that Maple Leafs owner <a href="Harold%20Ballard">Harold Ballard</a> had told the media that he was attempting to reacquire McDonald. The Rockies disputed that any such negotiations had taken place and Ballard quickly apologized for the news story after Colorado threatened to file tampering charges against the Maple Leafs' owner. McDonald served as the Rockies' captain, and scored 35 goals and 81 points in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20NHL%20season">1980–81</a>, his only full season with the team.

Stating that his team needed to add character and leadership, Cliff Fletcher finally completed a trade for McDonald seven years after his first attempt. McDonald was acquired by the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, along with a draft pick, in exchange for <a href="Bob%20MacMillan">Bob MacMillan</a> and <a href="Don%20Lever">Don Lever</a> on November 25, 1981. The deal occurred one day after the last place Rockies lost to the Flames by a 9–2 score. Once the team's plane landed in Winnipeg, McDonald was informed of the trade and told to return to Calgary. Angered at first, he viewed the deal as an insult, that the worst team in the NHL had rejected him.

McDonald also felt the pressure of having to replace two popular ex-Flames in MacMillan and Lever while also working to overcome a separated shoulder he suffered earlier in the year with the Rockies. He made his debut with the Flames the following night, a 7–1 victory over the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>, after which McDonald remarked that it was the most fun he had playing the game in a long time. He was given a loud ovation by the fans who immediately embraced him as a local hero, even though it took him seven games before he scored his first goal as a member of the Flames. He scored 34 goals in Calgary, and combined with the 6 scored in Colorado, finished with his fifth 40-goal campaign in six years.
The <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982–83 season</a> was dominated by McDonald's battle with <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> of the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> for the league lead in goals. Amidst the best offensive season of his career, McDonald scored a <a href="hat%20trick">hat trick</a> against Pittsburgh to give him 47 goals at the mid-season break for the <a href="35th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">1983 All-Star Game</a>, a total that tied his career high. He was named to the starting lineup for the All-Star Game and was the league's leading goal scorer at that point, two ahead of Gretzky. McDonald finished with 66 goals, five short of Gretzky's 71. At that time, only Gretzky, <a href="Mike%20Bossy">Mike Bossy</a> and <a href="Phil%20Esposito">Phil Esposito</a> had ever scored more goals in one NHL season. McDonald was named to the Second All-Star Team for the second time in his career and was voted the winner of the <a href="Bill%20Masterton%20Memorial%20Trophy">Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</a>, given to the player who "best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey". His 66 goals remains a Flames' <a href="List%20of%20Calgary%20Flames%20records">single season record</a>.

Following the trade of <a href="Phil%20Russell%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Phil Russell</a> in the summer of 1983, McDonald and <a href="Doug%20Risebrough">Doug Risebrough</a> were named co-captains for the <a href="1983%E2%80%9384%20NHL%20season">1983–84 season</a>. They were joined by <a href="Jim%20Peplinski">Jim Peplinski</a> the following season. McDonald missed 15 games due to injuries which reduced his scoring to 33 goals and 66 points, but he played in his <a href="36th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">fourth All-Star Game</a>. He scored the first Flames goal in the <a href="Olympic%20Saddledome">Olympic Saddledome</a>, on the building's opening night of October 15, 1983.

McDonald became the 21st player in NHL history to score 400 career goals, reaching the mark in a 7–4 loss in Los Angeles on December 21, 1983. He was initially credited with scoring the milestone goal in his previous game, against the <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets">Winnipeg Jets</a>, but after reviewing a replay of the goal himself, McDonald asked the league to credit it to teammate <a href="Ed%20Beers">Eddy Beers</a> who had deflected his shot. His injury problems worsened in <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20NHL%20season">1984–85</a> as he missed the start of the season with pulled muscles and was limited to just 43 games.

As the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20NHL%20season">1985–86 season</a> approached, McDonald endured questions about whether he was reaching the point where age and injuries meant he could no longer be an effective NHL player. Hoping to prove himself, he set a goal of playing all 80 games for the Flames. He succeeded, and scored 28 goals and 71 points in the process, despite dislocating his thumb in the pre-season and suffering minor knee and hip injuries during the course of the year. He later said it was a matter of pride to him not to miss a game. In the playoffs, McDonald was witness to one of the most infamous mistakes in NHL history. With the score tied at two in the seventh game of the Smythe Division final against Edmonton, McDonald chased Oilers' rookie <a href="Steve%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%2C%20born%20in%20Scotland%29">Steve Smith</a> around the Edmonton net. Smith attempted to pass the puck forward, but inadvertently hit the back of goaltender <a href="Grant%20Fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a>'s skate, deflecting the puck into his own net.

It turned out to be the winning goal for Calgary who eliminated Edmonton to clinch the Smythe Division championship. The victory over their <a href="Battle%20of%20Alberta">provincial rivals</a> also touched off a celebration amongst the fans, of which over 20,000 greeted the team with wild cheering when their plane landed at <a href="Calgary%20International%20Airport">Calgary International Airport</a>. A series win over the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> led McDonald and the Flames into their first <a href="1986%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a>, against Montreal. The series ended in disappointment: He watched from the bench as his teammates unsuccessfully attempted to tie the deciding game in the final minute and the Canadiens defeated the Flames in five games to win the Stanley Cup.

Two separate knee injuries limited McDonald in <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20NHL%20season">1986–87</a>. His total of 14 goals in 58 games was his fewest since his rookie season. He reached a milestone in the Flames' final game of the season, appearing in the <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201%2C000%20games%20played">1,000th game</a> of his career. Following a 10-goal campaign in 60 games in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20NHL%20season">1987–88</a>, McDonald reached two additional major milestones in the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NHL%20season">1988–89 season</a>. On March 7, 1989, he scored the <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201%2C000%20points">1,000th point</a> of his career with a wraparound goal from behind the net against <a href="Bob%20Essensa">Bob Essensa</a> in a 9–5 victory against the <a href="Winnipeg%20Jets%20%281972%E2%80%9396%29">Winnipeg Jets</a>. Two weeks later, on March 21, he scored the <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%20500%20goals">500th goal</a> of his career on a nearly identical wraparound against <a href="Mark%20Fitzpatrick">Mark Fitzpatrick</a> of the New York Islanders. It was the final regular season goal of McDonald's career.
At 36 years old and approaching the end of his career, the <a href="1989%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1989 Stanley Cup playoffs</a> was potentially his last chance at winning the Stanley Cup. The Flames defeated the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a>, Los Angeles Kings and <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> to set up a <a href="1989%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a> rematch of the <a href="1986%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1986 Stanley Cup Finals</a> with the Montreal Canadiens. McDonald was left out of the Flames' lineup for the third, fourth and fifth games, but with Calgary leading the series three wins to two, head coach <a href="Terry%20Crisp">Terry Crisp</a> felt that if the Flames were to win the championship, McDonald deserved to be in the game. Crisp's decision paid dividends, as midway through the sixth game, McDonald stepped onto the ice after serving a penalty to join <a href="H%C3%A5kan%20Loob">Håkan Loob</a> and <a href="Joe%20Nieuwendyk">Joe Nieuwendyk</a> in a three-on-one rush toward the Montreal goal. Loob passed the puck up to Nieuwendyk, who saw a streaking McDonald coming up the right side of the ice. McDonald received the pass then shot the puck over Montreal goaltender <a href="Patrick%20Roy">Patrick Roy</a>'s glove to give the Flames a 2–1 lead. <a href="Doug%20Gilmour">Doug Gilmour</a> added two goals, and Calgary won the game 4–2 to earn the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship. League president <a href="John%20Ziegler%20%28ice%20hockey%29">John Ziegler</a> presented the trophy to McDonald, co-captain Jim Peplinski and alternate <a href="Tim%20Hunter%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Tim Hunter</a>. Wearing the captain's "C" for the game, McDonald was the first member of the Flames to carry the trophy as the team paraded it around the Forum in celebration.

McDonald announced his retirement as a player on August 28, 1989, stating in a press conference that he made the determination before the 1988–89 season began that it would be his last. He also revealed that he had received an offer from another, unnamed, team to play in <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20NHL%20season">1989–90</a> but felt that it was the right time to end his career. The Flames made McDonald their Vice President in Charge of Corporate and Community Affairs. He chose the corporate position partly due to a fascination with the business world, and partly to remain close to his family as a role in hockey operations would have necessitated more travel. His interest in business grew following his trade to Calgary as he was featured in numerous commercials and signed endorsements throughout southern Alberta. He had also previously served as a vice president of the NHLPA in the early 1980s. McDonald changed roles in 1992 as he was named the team's Vice President of Marketing. After serving four years in that position, McDonald became the Vice President of Corporate Development in 1996.

McDonald was part of a committee tasked with hiring a new management team in June 2000. The media speculated that after several years in a corporate position, he hoped to land a role as a vice president within hockey operations. He received no such role, and two months after the hiring of <a href="Craig%20Button">Craig Button</a> as executive vice president and general manager of the Flames, McDonald announced he was leaving the organization. McDonald denied claims from team sources that he was upset at not gaining a new role when Button was hired. He stated that after "nineteen great years here in one organization", it was the right time to retire. He retained a small role in the organization, serving as a board member of the <a href="Scotiabank%20Saddledome%23Saddledome%20Foundation">Saddledome Foundation</a>.

Ken King, newly hired president of the Flames, lured McDonald back into the organization a year later by naming him an executive assistant to hockey operations. McDonald held the position until 2003. He also served in hockey operations roles with <a href="Hockey%20Canada">Hockey Canada</a>. McDonald was the general manager of Team Canada for the <a href="2001%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2001</a> and <a href="2002%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2002</a> <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">World Championships</a>. He returned in <a href="2004%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2004</a> in a role as director of player personnel of Canada's gold medal-winning squad.

McDonald was known primarily as an offensive player with a hard shot. His <a href="wrist%20shot">wrist shot</a> was considered to be effective, and his scoring exploits in junior hockey earned him the nickname "Machine-Gun Lanny". <a href="Red%20Kelly">Red Kelly</a>, McDonald's coach in his first NHL seasons, recalled that he was impressed with his young player's skill handling the puck and defended McDonald against critics who wanted him moved out of Toronto due to his early struggles. In his NHL career, McDonald led his team in goal scoring six times: <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs%20season">1976–77</a>, <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs%20season">1977–78</a> and <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs%20season">1978–79</a> with Toronto, <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20Colorado%20Rockies%20season">1980–81</a> with Colorado, and <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Calgary%20Flames%20season">1981–82</a> and <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20Calgary%20Flames%20season">1982–83</a> in Calgary. He was also a physical player, willing to play a hard-hitting style in the corners.

As age and injuries took their toll, McDonald's role with the Flames changed. His playing time decreased in his later years as he was no longer counted on to be the team's primary offensive threat. Often left out of the lineup in his final season, McDonald was expected to provide a boost to the team when he drew into the lineup. He was counted on to provide a veteran presence and to act as a mentor for the team's younger players.

The Flames arrived in Calgary after relocating from Atlanta for the 1980–81 season. The organization entered a transitional phase, as many players used to the warm weather and relaxed atmosphere of Atlanta were unable or unwilling to adapt to the higher expectations fans in Calgary placed on them. <a href="David%20Poile">David Poile</a>, then Flames assistant general manager, stated that the team had an identity crisis as a result. It was in this atmosphere that general manager Cliff Fletcher made the trade for McDonald on November 25, 1981, claiming that McDonald added two characteristics the Flames lacked: character and leadership.

McDonald's arrival in Calgary was considered a turning point for the organization, one where his personality, demeanor and on-ice play came to define the Flames in the 1980s. Poile argued that it signaled the true beginning of the team in its new market: "The trade for Lanny McDonald was the start of the Calgary Flames franchise. It gave us that Calgary identity, that Western Canadian flavor." Columnist and co-author of McDonald's autobiography, <a href="Steve%20Simmons">Steve Simmons</a>, agreed. He added that the personal and professional disappointments McDonald endured in Toronto and Colorado resulted in his gaining a greater appreciation of both the game and himself. McDonald was extremely popular with his teammates and the fans wherever he played, as well as with the media – he was named Colorado's athlete of the year in 1980 by the state's sportswriters.

Renowned for his leadership ability, McDonald cultivated the respect of the team's younger players. He came into the NHL at a time when the battle with the rival WHA for talent led to rookies signing for far more money than the previous generation of players commanded. Consequently, McDonald faced the resentment of several of Toronto's veteran players and resolved to show greater respect to those that followed him. His efforts left a lasting impression on his peers; among them was <a href="Tiger%20Williams">Tiger Williams</a> who called McDonald "a great ambassador" for the NHL.

The Flames made McDonald the first player in franchise history to have his jersey <a href="List%20of%20National%20Hockey%20League%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> when they raised his number 9 to the rafters of the Olympic Saddledome in a ceremony on March 17, 1990. As part of its 1992 class, he was also the first former Flame to gain induction into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>. One year later he was inducted into the <a href="Alberta%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Alberta Sports Hall of Fame</a>. McDonald's image endured well into retirement; in 2008, he was the only athlete named in a list of Alberta's ten greatest citizens compiled by the "<a href="Calgary%20Herald">Calgary Herald</a>". In 2017, McDonald was inducted into <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canada's Sports Hall of Fame</a>.

McDonald met his wife Ardell while playing junior hockey for the Medicine Hat Tigers. They were married in 1975, and have four children: daughters Andra and Leah, and sons Barrett and Graham. The family settled in Calgary after McDonald's trade to the Flames. They also maintain a summer home in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, where the family has invested in restaurants and a <a href="Microbrewery">craft brewery</a> in the community of <a href="Lakeside%2C%20Montana">Lakeside</a>. Co-owned by Andra, the brewery considers McDonald its inspiration, and produces "Old 'Stache Porter" in his honour.

His giant, walrus-style moustache is McDonald's most defining physical characteristic and helped him become an iconic figure in the sport. He developed it in 1974, spending the summer seeing what kind of beard he could grow. Knowing that the Maple Leafs did not allow players to maintain beards at the time, he settled on what he described as a "normal moustache" once he returned to Toronto. Some time later, he was inspired by baseball player <a href="Sparky%20Lyle">Sparky Lyle</a>'s moustache and chose to grow one in a similar style. It became a symbol for the Flames as some fans took to wearing fake red moustaches during playoff runs. Razor manufacturers offered endorsements if he would shave it, which he refused.
Among his charitable and humanitarian efforts, McDonald is best known for his participation with the <a href="Special%20Olympics">Special Olympics</a>. He first became involved with the organization in 1974 when the Maple Leafs asked him to represent the team at the Special Olympics Summer Games. The event began a decades long association for McDonald. He was the honorary coach of the 1986 Special Olympics Summer Games in Calgary, and served as a head coach for the Canadian Special Olympics floor hockey team. In 1988, McDonald's contributions to the Special Olympics as a coach and co-chairman of the organization's fundraising efforts, as well as his work with the Alberta <a href="Children%27s%20Miracle%20Network%20Hospitals">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</a>, were recognized by the NHL as he was named the inaugural recipient of the <a href="King%20Clancy%20Memorial%20Trophy">King Clancy Memorial Trophy</a>. The award is given to the hockey player who best exemplifies leadership on the ice with humanitarian contributions off of it. McDonald was previously honoured by the Flames as the first winner of the <a href="List%20of%20Calgary%20Flames%20award%20winners%23Ralph%20T.%20Scurfield%20Humanitarian%20Award">Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award</a> in 1987, which he won again in 1989.

McDonald's autobiography, "Lanny", co-written by Steve Simmons, was published in 1987. A Canadian best-seller, it was an unexpected success for publisher <a href="McGraw-Hill">McGraw-Hill</a>. The book sold 10,000 copies in its first couple months of publication, for which the publisher made a donation of $10,000 to the Special Olympics. In 2008, McDonald was given an honorary doctorate from the <a href="University%20of%20Calgary">University of Calgary</a>.

Aberfan disaster

The Aberfan disaster was the catastrophic collapse of a <a href="colliery">colliery</a> <a href="spoil%20tip">spoil tip</a> at around 9:15 am on 21 October 1966. The tip had been created on a mountain slope above the Welsh village of <a href="Aberfan">Aberfan</a>, near <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a> and overlaid a natural spring. A period of heavy rain led to a build-up of water within the tip which caused it to suddenly slide downhill as a <a href="slurry">slurry</a>, killing 116 children and 28 adults as it engulfed the local <a href="junior%20school">junior school</a> and other buildings. The tip was the responsibility of the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a> (NCB), and the <a href="Aberfan%20Disaster%20Tribunal">subsequent inquiry</a> placed the blame for the disaster on the organisation and nine named employees.

There were seven spoil tips on the slopes above Aberfan; Tip 7—the one that slipped onto the village—was begun in 1958 and, at the time of the disaster, was high. In contravention of the NCB's official procedures, the tip was partly based on ground from which water springs emerged. After three weeks of heavy rain the tip was saturated and approximately of spoil slipped down the side of the hill and onto the Pantglas area of the village. The main building hit was Pantglas Junior School, where lessons had just begun; 5 teachers and 109 children were killed in the school.

An official inquiry was chaired by <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20judge%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Lord Justice</a> <a href="Edmund%20Davies%2C%20Baron%20Edmund-Davies">Edmund Davies</a>. The report placed the blame squarely on the NCB. The organisation's chairman, <a href="Alfred%20Robens%2C%20Baron%20Robens%20of%20Woldingham">Lord Robens</a>, was criticised for making misleading statements and for not providing clarity as to the NCB's knowledge of the presence of water springs on the hillside. Neither the NCB nor any of its employees were prosecuted and the organisation was not fined.

The Aberfan Disaster Memorial Fund (ADMF) was set up on the day of the disaster. It received nearly 88,000 contributions, totalling £1.75 million. The remaining tips were removed only after a lengthy fight by Aberfan residents, against resistance from the NCB and the government on the grounds of cost. Clearing was paid for by a government grant and a forced contribution of £150,000 taken from the memorial fund. In 1997 the British government paid back the £150,000 to the ADMF, and in 2007 the <a href="Welsh%20Assembly">Welsh Assembly</a> donated £1.5 million to the fund and £500,000 to the Aberfan Education Charity as recompense for the money wrongly taken. Many of the village's residents suffered medical problems, and half the survivors have experienced <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> at some time in their lives.

<a href="Aberfan">Aberfan</a> is situated toward the bottom of the western valley slope of the Taff Valley, on the eastern slope of <a href="Mynydd%20Merthyr">Mynydd Merthyr</a> hill, approximately south of <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a>. When the <a href="Merthyr%20Vale">Merthyr Vale</a> Colliery was sunk on 23 August 1869 by <a href="John%20Nixon%20%28mining%20engineer%29">John Nixon</a> and partners, Aberfan consisted of two cottages and an inn frequented by local farmers and bargemen. By 1966 its population had grown to approximately 5,000, most of whom were employed in the coal industry. Since the <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> of the <a href="Coal%20mining%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British coal industry</a> in 1947, Aberfan's colliery had been under the control of the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a> (NCB). Regulation in the coal industry was provided by <a href="HM%20Inspectorate%20of%20Mines">HM Inspectorate of Mines</a>. The inspectors had worked as engineers in the coal industry, and were former employees of the NCB. The <a href="River%20Taff">River Taff</a> runs north-to-south through the village; at the upper side of the settlement, on the western outskirts, a disused canal bed and a railway embankment run parallel to the river.

The first <a href="overburden">spoil</a> from the coal mine was deposited on the valley's lower slopes, east of the canal, but during the 1910s the first tip was started on the western slopes, above the canal line and the village. By 1966 there were seven spoil heaps, comprising approximately of waste. Tips 4 and 5 were conical mounds at the apex of the slope, although Tip 4 was misshapen from an earlier slip; the remaining five were lower down; all were directly above the village. Tip 7 was the only one being used in 1966. About high, it contained of spoil, which included of <a href="tailings">tailings</a>—waste from the chemical extraction of coal, fine particles of coal and ash which took on the similar properties to <a href="quicksand">quicksand</a> when wet.

Tip stability is affected by water conditions. Tips 4, 5 and 7 had been sited on streams or springs. The presence of the springs was common knowledge in the area, and they had been marked on the <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> and <a href="Geological%20Society%20of%20London">Geological Society</a> maps since 1874. Tip 4 at Aberfan, which had been used between 1933 and 1945, was large, and had been started on boggy ground between two streams. At the time of its planning, the Merthyr Tydfil borough engineer thought that despite the position, it would be unlikely to avalanche. Following some ground movements in the tip in the early 1940s, a drainage channel was dug in early 1944. In November that year part of the tip slid down the mountain to stop approximately above the village. In May 1963 Tip 7 shifted slightly; in November that year there was a more substantial slide. The NCB stated that the movement had not been a "slide", but was instead a "tailings run"—a run-off of tailings from the surface of the tip—which left its stability unaffected. After the slide, the NCB stopped tipping tailings on number 7, but normal spoil continued to be deposited.

Aberfan is in an area of relatively high rainfall, an average of a year. In 1960 it was , the heaviest of recent years in the run-up to the disaster. Between 1952 and 1965, there was severe flooding in the Pantglas area of Aberfan on at least 11 occasions. Residents complained that the flood water was black and left a greasy residue when it receded. Complaints had been made by residents to <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil%20County%20Borough%20Council">Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council</a>, who corresponded with the NCB between July 1963 and March 1964 on the topic of the "Danger from Coal Slurry being tipped at the rear of the Pantglas Schools". In early 1965 meetings were held between the council and the NCB at which the Board agreed to take action on the clogged pipes and drainage ditches that were the cause of the flooding. No action had been taken by October 1966.

During the first three weeks of October 1966 there was of rainfall, nearly half of which was in the third week. During the night of 20–21 October the peak of Tip 7 subsided by and the rails on which the spoil was transported to the top of the tip fell into the resulting hole. The spoil movement was discovered at 7:30am by the first members of the morning shift manning the heaps. One of the workers walked to the colliery to report the slip; he returned with the supervisor for the tips, and it was decided that no further work would be done that day, but that a new tipping position would be decided on the following week.
At 9:15am a significant amount of <a href="soil%20liquefaction">water-saturated debris</a> broke away from tip 7 and flowed downhill at in waves high. G. M. J. Williams, a consultant engineer who gave evidence at the subsequent tribunal, stated that the 9:15 am movement:

took part of the saturated material past the point where liquefaction occurred. This initially liquefied material began to move rapidly, releasing energy which liquefied the rest of the saturated portion of the tip, and almost instantaneously the nature of the saturated lower parts of Tip No. 7 was changed from that of a solid to that of a heavy liquid of a density of approximately twice that of water. This was 'the dark glistening wave' which several witnesses saw burst from the bottom of the tip.

Approximately of spoil slid down the mountain, destroying two farm cottages and killing the occupants. Around travelled across the canal and railway embankment and into the village. The flow destroyed two <a href="water%20mains">water mains</a> buried in the embankment and the additional water further saturated the spoil. Those who heard the avalanche said the sound reminded them of a low-flying jet or thunder.

The avalanche struck Pantglas Junior School on Moy Road, demolishing and engulfing much of the structure and filling classrooms with thick mud, sludge and rubble; 109 children were killed in the school, from 240 attendees, and five teachers. The pupils of Pantglas Junior School had arrived only minutes earlier for the last day before the half-term holiday, which was due to start at 12.00 pm. The teachers had just begun to record the children's attendance in the registers when the landslide hit. The adjacent secondary school was also damaged, and 18 houses on surrounding roads were destroyed. Mud and water from the slide flooded other houses in the vicinity, forcing many to evacuate their homes. Once the slide material had come to a halt, it re-solidified. A huge mound of slurry up to high blocked the area. The acting headmaster of the secondary school recalled:

The Girls' Entrance [of the secondary school] was approximately two-thirds to three-quarters full of rubble and waste material ... I climbed onto the rubble in the doorway ... when I looked directly in front of me ... I saw that the houses in Moy Road had vanished in a mass of tip-waste material and that the Junior School gable-ends, or part of the roof, were sticking up out of this morass. I looked down to my right and I saw that the Moy Road houses had gone.

Some staff died trying to protect the children. Nansi Williams, the school meals clerk, used her body to shield five children, who all survived; Williams did not, and was found by rescuers still holding a pound note she had been collecting as lunch money. Dai Benyon, the deputy headmaster, tried to use a blackboard to shield himself and five children from the slurry pouring through the school. He and all 34 pupils in his class were killed. When the avalanche stopped, so did the noise; one resident recalled that "in that silence you couldn't hear a bird or a child".

After the landslide stopped, local residents rushed to the school and began digging through the rubble, moving material by hand or with garden tools. At 9:25 am Merthyr Tydfil police received a phone call from a local resident who said "I have been asked to inform that there has been a landslide at Pantglas. The tip has come down on the school"; the <a href="fire%20brigade">fire brigade</a>, based in Merthyr Tydfil, received a call at about the same time. Calls were then made to local hospitals, the ambulance service and the local <a href="Civil%20Defence%20Corps">Civil Defence Corps</a>. The first miners from the Aberfan colliery arrived within 20 minutes of the disaster, having been raised from the coal seams where they had been working. They directed the early digging, knowing that unplanned excavation could lead to collapse of the spoil and the remnants of the buildings; they worked in organised groups under the control of their pit managers.

The first casualties from the wreckage of the school arrived at <a href="St%20Tydfil%27s%20Hospital">St Tydfil's Hospital</a> in Merthyr Tydfil at 9.50 am; the remaining rescued casualties all arrived before 11.00 am: 22 children, one of whom was dead on arrival, and 5 adults. A further 9 casualties were sent to the <a href="East%20Glamorgan%20General%20Hospital">East Glamorgan General Hospital</a>. No survivors were found after 11.00 am. Of the 144 people who died in the disaster, 116 were children, mostly between the ages of 7 and 10; 109 of the children died inside Pantglas Junior School. Five of the adults who died were teachers at the school. An additional 6 adults and 29 children were injured.

The 10:30 am BBC news summary led with the story of the accident. The result was that thousands of volunteers travelled to Aberfan to help, although their efforts often hampered the work of the experienced miners or trained rescue teams.

With the two broken water mains still pumping water into the spoil in Aberfan, the slip continued to move through the village, and it was not until 11:30 am that the water authorities managed to turn off the supply. It was estimated that the mains added between of water to the spoil slurry. With movement in the upper slopes still a danger, at 12:00 noon NCB engineers began digging a drainage channel, with the aim of stabilising the tip. It took two hours to reroute the water to a safer place, from where it was diverted into an existing water course.

An NCB board meeting that morning, headed by the organisation's chairman, <a href="Alfred%20Robens%2C%20Baron%20Robens%20of%20Woldingham">Lord Robens</a>, was informed of the disaster. It was decided that the company's Director-General of Production and its Chief Safety Engineer should inspect the situation, and they left for the village immediately. In his autobiography, Robens stated that the decision for him not to go was because "the appearance of a layman at too early a stage inevitably distracts senior and essential people from the tasks upon which they should be exclusively concentrating". Instead of visiting the scene, that evening Robens went to the ceremony to invest him as the chancellor of the <a href="University%20of%20Surrey">University of Surrey</a>. NCB officers covered up for him when contacted by <a href="Cledwyn%20Hughes%2C%20Baron%20Cledwyn%20of%20Penrhos">Cledwyn Hughes</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Wales">Secretary of State for Wales</a>, falsely claiming that Robens was personally directing relief work.

Hughes visited the scene at 4:00 pm for an hour. He telephoned <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, and confirmed Wilson's own thought that he should also visit. Wilson told Hughes to "take whatever action he thought necessary, irrespective of any considerations of 'normal procedures', expenditure or statutory limitations". Wilson arrived at Aberfan at 9.40 pm, where he heard reports from the police and civil defence forces, and visited the rescue workers. Before he left, at midnight, he and Hughes agreed that a high-level independent inquiry needed to be held. That evening the mayor of Merthyr Tydfil launched an appeal for financial donations—soon formally named the Aberfan Disaster Fund—to alleviate financial hardship and to help rebuild the area.

A makeshift mortuary was set up in the village's Bethania Chapel on 21 October and operated until 4 November, from the disaster site; members of the <a href="South%20Wales%20Police">South Wales Police</a> force assisted with the identification and registration of the victims. Two doctors examined the bodies and issued death certificates; the cause of death was typically <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a>, fractured skull or multiple crush injuries. Cramped conditions in the chapel meant that parents could only be admitted one at a time to identify the bodies of their children. The building also acted as a missing persons bureau and its vestry was used by <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> volunteers and <a href="St%20John%20Ambulance">St John Ambulance</a> stretcher-bearers. Four hundred embalmers volunteered to assist with the cleaning and dressing of the corpses; a contingent that flew over from Northern Ireland removed the seats of their plane to transport child-sized coffins. The smaller Aberfan Calvinistic Chapel nearby was used as a second mortuary from 22 to 29 October.

By the morning of Saturday 22 October, 111 bodies had been excavated, of which 51 had been identified. At daybreak the <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen's</a> brother-in-law <a href="Antony%20Armstrong-Jones%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Snowdon">Lord Snowdon</a> visited and spoke with workers and parents; at 11:00 am <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, visited the scene and talked to rescue workers. In the early afternoon light rain began falling, which became increasingly heavy; it caused further movement in the tip, which threatened the rescue work and raised the possibility that the area would have to be evacuated.

Robens arrived in Aberfan on Saturday evening. After visiting the colliery and the disaster site, he gave a press conference at which he stated that the NCB would work with any public inquiry. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", Robens said the organisation "will not seek to hide behind any legal loophole or make any legal quibble about responsibility". Robens returned to the village the following morning to see the situation in daylight. He was interviewed by a television news team while examining the tip. When asked about the responsibility of the NCB for the slide, he answered:

I wouldn't have thought myself that anybody would know that there was a spring deep in the heart of a mountain, any more than I can tell you there is one under our feet where we are now. If you are asking me did any of my people on the spot know that there was this spring water, then the answer is, No—they couldn't possibly. ... It was impossible to know that there was a spring in the heart of this tip which was turning the centre of the mountain into sludge.
On 23 October assistance was provided by the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a>. This was followed by the arrival of naval ratings from and members of the <a href="King%27s%20Own%20Royal%20Border%20Regiment">King's Own Royal Border Regiment</a>. That day Wilson announced the appointment of <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20judge%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Lord Justice</a> <a href="Edmund%20Davies%2C%20Baron%20Edmund-Davies">Edmund Davies</a> as the chairman of the <a href="Aberfan%20Disaster%20Tribunal">inquiry into the disaster</a>; Davies had been born and schooled in the nearby village of <a href="Mountain%20Ash%2C%20Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taf">Mountain Ash</a>. A <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">coroner's inquest</a> was opened on 24 October to give the causes of death for 30 of the children located. One man who lost his wife and two sons called out when he heard their names mentioned: "No, sir—buried alive by the National Coal Board"; one woman shouted that the NCB had "killed our children". The first funerals, for five of the children, took place the following day. A mass funeral for 81 children and one woman took place at Bryntaf Cemetery in Aberfan on 27 October. They were buried in a pair of trenches; 10,000 people attended.

Because of the vast quantity and consistency of the spoil, it was a week before all the bodies were recovered; the last victim was found on 28 October. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Aberfan on 29 October to pay their respects to those who had died. Their visit coincided with the end of the main rescue phase; only one contracting firm remained in the village to continue the last stages of the clear-up.

On 25 October 1966, after resolutions in both Houses of Parliament, the Secretary of State for Wales formally appointed a tribunal to inquire into the disaster. Before the tribunal began, the <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General</a> cautioned the media that commenting on matters to be investigated by the tribunal could lay them open to the same consequences as <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a>. Sitting alongside Lord Justice Davies on the inquiry were the civil engineer <a href="Harold%20Harding">Harold Harding</a> and Vernon Lawrence, the former Clerk to the <a href="Monmouthshire%20County%20Council">Monmouthshire County Council</a>. The inquiry had an initial public meeting on 2 November 1966 and took evidence in public for 76 days, spread over the next five months; during that time 136 witnesses testified. The tribunal report stated "much of the time of the Tribunal could have been saved if ... the National Coal Board had not stubbornly resisted every attempt to lay the blame where it so clearly must rest—at their door".

Aberfan's MP, <a href="S.%20O.%20Davies">S. O. Davies</a>, gave evidence to the tribunal and stated that he had long held concerns that the tip "might not only slide, but in sliding might reach the village"; he added that he had not spoken out because he had "more than a shrewd suspicion that that colliery would be closed". Brian Gibbens, <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a>, the <a href="counsel">counsel</a> for the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Mineworkers%20%28Great%20Britain%29">National Union of Mineworkers</a> (NUM), challenged Davies's evidence and stated that if the testament "is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection ... then he bears what must be one of the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". Gibbens requested that Davies's testimony be rejected, on the basis that he "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal agreed, and stated that "we doubt that he fully understood the grave implication of what he was saying".

Initially the tribunal decided not to call Robens to testify—they took his comment to the media about the existence of the spring being unknown as hearsay, and thought that his evidence could not help. The counsel for the families, <a href="Desmond%20Ackner%2C%20Baron%20Ackner">Desmond Ackner</a>, QC, attacked Robens for making the statement about the spring, saying it was "a public scandal"; he added that "at no stage throughout this Inquiry has the National Coal Board taken the initiative to correct this sentence". Ackner also criticised Robens's absence from the inquiry, saying that "no explanation has been proffered by or on behalf of Lord Robens and his absence, therefore, and in this regard has been conspicuous." The tribunal members decided that Robens should be able to defend his position and he was invited to attend. Under <a href="cross-examination">cross-examination</a> by Ackner, Robens gave evidence inconsistent with that provided by the NCB, particularly on the point of whether the disaster was foreseeable; counsel for the organisation asked the tribunal to ignore Robens's testimony.

The tribunal concluded its hearings on 28 April 1967 and published its report on 3 August. Among their findings was that "[b]lame for the disaster rests upon the National Coal Board. ... This blame is shared (though in varying degrees) among the National Coal Board headquarters, the South Western Divisional Board, and certain individuals." They added that the "legal liability of the National Coal Board to pay compensation for the personal injuries (fatal or otherwise) and damage to property is incontestable and uncontested". In its introduction the inquiry team wrote that it was their

strong and unanimous view ... that the Aberfan disaster could and should have been prevented. ... the Report which follows tells not of wickedness but of ignorance, ineptitude and a failure in communications. Ignorance on the part of those charged at all levels with the siting, control and daily management of tips; bungling ineptitude on the part of those who had the duty of supervising and directing them; and failure on the part of those having knowledge of the factors which affect tip safety to communicate that knowledge and to see that it was applied.

Nine employees of the NCB were censured by the inquiry, with "many degrees of blameworthiness, from very slight to grave", although McLean and Johnes consider that some senior staff whom the evidence shows to have been culpable were omitted, and one junior member of staff named in the report should not have been blamed. The tribunal decided that no blame lay with Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council or the NUM.

The tribunal made several recommendations, including the need for the extension of the Mines and Quarries Act 1954 to cover tips, and the formation of a National Tip Safety Committee to advise the government. The inquiry report also advised that "action needs to be taken to safeguard the future condition of the tips at Aberfan".

The sociologist Barry Turner, in a 1976 study, identified several errors that led to the Aberfan disaster. These included years of rigid and unrealistic disregard for the importance of the safety of the above-ground tips (as opposed to dangers within the mines); a flawed decision-making process which ignored or minimised the likelihood and the scale of the emergent danger; a dismissive attitude toward the complaints from Aberfan residents, discounting the validity of their concerns; and an incomplete and inadequate response to conditions which caused those complaints.

McLean and Johnes observe that HM Inspectorate of Mines went largely unchallenged by the tribunal, although the two consider that the organisation failed in their duty; in doing so, they created a situation of <a href="regulatory%20capture">regulatory capture</a>, where rather than protecting the public interest—in this case the citizens of Aberfan—their regulatory failures fell in line with the interests of the NCB, the organisation they were supposed to be overseeing.

During the rescue, the shock and grief of parents and villagers was exacerbated by insensitive behaviour from the media—one rescue worker recalled hearing a press photographer asking a child to cry for her dead friends because it would make a good picture. The response of the general public in donating to the memorial fund, together with over 50,000 letters of condolence that accompanied many of the donations, helped many residents come to terms with the disaster. One bereaved mother said "People all over the world felt for us. We knew that with their letters and the contributions they sent ... They helped us build a better Aberfan."

A study published in the "<a href="British%20Journal%20of%20Psychiatry">British Journal of Psychiatry</a>" (BJP) in 2003 found that half the survivors of the disaster had experienced <a href="post-traumatic%20stress%20disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) at some time in their lives, that they were more than three times more likely to have developed lifetime PTSD than a comparison group of individuals who had experienced other life-threatening traumas, and that 34 per cent of survivors who took part in the study reported that they still experienced bad dreams or difficulty sleeping because of intrusive thoughts about the disaster. In 2005 <a href="Imperial%20Tobacco">Imperial Tobacco</a> settled out of court to end an <a href="Unfair%20dismissal%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">unfair dismissal</a> suit brought against the company by an Aberfan survivor, who had been employed by the company's <a href="Rizla">Rizla</a> cigarette paper factory near <a href="Pontypridd">Pontypridd</a>. She had been sacked after she refused to continue working night shifts, stating that it had brought on flashbacks from 1966, when she had been buried waist-deep in the landslide while walking to school. She survived, but a friend who had been walking with her was killed.

The BJP study also found that there was no significant rise in the risk of <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a> or <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a> in survivors. Some parents of deceased children reported <a href="Survivor%20guilt">extreme feelings of guilt</a>, as did one of the pupils who survived, who reported:

There was none of the discipline we used to have ... We didn't go out to play for a long time because those who'd lost their own children couldn't bear to see us. We all knew what they were feeling and we felt guilty about being alive.

The residents of Aberfan experienced medical problems after the disaster. Many survivors reported suffering from "sleeping difficulties, nervousness, lack of friends, unwillingness to go to school and <a href="enuresis">enuresis</a>". In the year following the tip slide, close relatives of the victims had a death rate seven times higher than the norm. One local doctor later wrote "By every statistic, patients seen, prescriptions written, deaths, I can prove that this is a village of excessive sickness." Despite these problems, during the five years after the disaster the birth rate rose considerably, in marked contrast to that of Merthyr Tydfil.

The NCB as an organisation was not prosecuted, and no NCB staff were demoted, sacked or prosecuted as a consequence of the Aberfan disaster or for evidence given to the inquiry. During a parliamentary debate on the disaster, <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>—then the opposition spokesman on power—raised the situation of one witness, criticised by the inquiry, who had subsequently been promoted to a board-level position at the NCB by the time the report was published.

In 2000 Iain McLean, a professor of politics, and Martin Johnes, a research fellow in Welsh history, undertook a study of the Aberfan disaster and its repercussions; their work included government papers released in 1997 under the <a href="thirty-year%20rule">thirty-year rule</a>. Their opinion is that "the Coal Board '<a href="Spin%20%28propaganda%29">spin-doctored</a>' its way out of trouble, controlling the public agenda from the day of the disaster until the tips were finally removed". Robens had received a copy of the inquiry report ten days before its official publication and began a campaign to strengthen his position. He went on a tour of British coalfields, giving speeches that promoted the use of coal and criticised the increasing popularity of <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a>. All messages of support to him were catalogued by the NCB, and copies of some were leaked to the press; the manoeuvring led to criticism in an editorial in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", which stated that "the Coal Board's behaviour has ... been rather unseemly in the circumstances".

In August 1967—following the publication of the inquiry report—Robens discussed his position with the Minister of Power, <a href="Richard%20Marsh%2C%20Baron%20Marsh">Richard Marsh</a>. After receiving assurances that his role at the NCB was secure, he offered to resign; in line with the agreement between the two men, the offer was rejected. In parliament, the Welsh MP <a href="Leo%20Abse">Leo Abse</a> said that "when I saw what I regarded as the graceless <a href="pavane">pavane</a> danced by Lord Robens and the Minister, as the Chairman of the Coal Board coyly offered his resignation and, equally coyly, the Minister rejected the offer, I thought that it was a disgraceful spectacle".

Initially the NCB offered bereaved families £50 in compensation, but this was raised to £500 for each bereaved family; the organisation called the amount "a good offer". Many families thought the amount insufficient and petitioned the NCB for an increase; NCB insurance staff advised Robens that "it is only the hard core [of bereaved parents] who are trying to capitalize".

The fund set up by the mayor of Merthyr Tydfil grew rapidly, and within a few months nearly 88,000 contributions had been received, totalling £1,606,929; the final total raised was £1.75 million. No specific aims for the fund had been outlined by the mayor until it was put on a firm legal footing under the auspices of a permanent committee with clear local representation. They drew up a deed that outlined the purposes of the fund as:
In 1967 the <a href="Charity%20Commission%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Charity Commission</a> advised that any money paid to the parents of bereaved families would be against the terms of the trust deed. After arguments from lawyers for the trust, they agreed that there was an "unprecedented emotional state" surrounding Aberfan, and suggested that sums of no more than £500 should be paid. Members of the trust told the commission that £5,000 was to be paid to each family; the commission agreed that the amount was permissible, but stated that each case should be examined before payment "to ascertain whether the parents had been close to their children and were thus likely to be suffering mentally", according to one member of the Charity Commission. In November 1967 the commission threatened to remove trustees of the disaster fund or make a financial order against them if they made grants to parents of children who were physically uninjured but who were suffering mentally—some surviving children complained of being afraid of the dark and loud noises, while some refused to sleep alone; the commission informed them that any payments would be "quite illegal". The decision affected 340 physically uninjured children.

Other grants made by the trust were less controversial: for those who lost their house, or whose property suffered significant damage, the trust donated £100 to assist with evacuation, and additional funds to help replace damaged effects. £100,000 was set aside for the future needs of the eight children physically injured in the disaster, and £5,000 was placed in trust for them for when they came of age. The charity funded the building of a community centre in the village and a memorial garden, which was opened by the <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen</a> in March 1973. The garden is on the site of Pantglas Junior School and includes stone walls to show where the classrooms stood.

McLean and Johnes consider that "the Commission protected neither donors nor beneficiaries. It was caught between upholding an outdated and inflexible law ... and fulfilling the varied expectations of donors, beneficiaries and the fund's management committee". In a study of the fund, the UK government <a href="Cabinet%20Office">Cabinet Office</a> judged that "as far the fund is concerned and what it achieved, it is important to note that it did help in alleviating the suffering and was a focus for the grief of many". In 1988 the Aberfan Disaster Fund was separated into two entities: the Aberfan Memorial Charity and the Aberfan Disaster Fund and Centre, the second of which is administered by Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. The Aberfan Memorial Charity oversees the upkeep of the memorial garden and Bryntaf Cemetery, and provides financial assistance to "all those who have suffered as a result of the Aberfan Disaster by making grants of money or providing or paying for items, services or facilities calculated to reduce the need, hardship or distress of such persons".

The tribunal report quoted one expert who said that Tip 5 "has been standing and is standing at a very low factor of safety"; the quote was read out by Thatcher in the October 1967 parliamentary debate on the inquiry report. S. O. Davies spoke in the debate on the same point:

We must be under no illusion that the Aberfan tips have been made safe by today. They have not been made safe. There are two tips right at the top of the old tip, to be seen glaring at us every day, full of threat. They might come down and cover some part of the village again. The Aberfan people insist—and I insist with them—that what is left of those tips must be removed. I hope that the Minister and the Secretary of State for Wales will be with us on this matter.

The residents of Aberfan petitioned <a href="George%20Thomas%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Tonypandy">George Thomas</a>, who had succeeded Hughes as Secretary of State for Wales in April 1968, for the tips to be removed; they entered the <a href="Welsh%20Office">Welsh Office</a> and left a small pile of coal slurry on the table in front of him to make their point; Thomas later stated the tips "constitute a psychological, emotional danger" to the people of Aberfan. The NCB had received a range of estimated costs for removing the tips, from £1.014 million to £3.4 million. Robens informed <a href="HM%20Treasury">HM Treasury</a> that the cost would be £3 million, and informed them that the NCB would not pay for the removal; between November 1967 and August he lobbied to avoid having the NCB pay. The <a href="Chief%20Secretary%20to%20the%20Treasury">Chief Secretary to the Treasury</a> also refused to pay, and said that the costs were too high. Although the government had initially favoured landscaping—an option cheaper than removal—they were eventually persuaded that removal was preferable.

To pay for the removal of the tips, £150,000 was taken from the disaster fund—lowered from the initial £250,000 first requested—the NCB paid £350,000 and the government provided the balance, with the proviso it was only up to a million. The final cost of the removal was £850,000. The trustees of the fund voted to accept the request for payment after realising that there was no alternative if they wanted the tips removed. S. O. Davies, the only member of the committee to vote against the payment, resigned in protest. There was a reminder of the danger for the residents of Aberfan when, in August 1968, heavy rain caused slurry to be washed down the village's streets. At the time, the Charity Commission made no objection to this action; the political scientists Jacint Jordana and <a href="David%20Levi-Faur">David Levi-Faur</a> consider the payment "unquestionably unlawful" under charity law.

In 1969, as a result of concerns raised by the disaster, and in line with the findings of the tribunal report, the government framed new legislation to remedy the absence of laws and regulations governing mine and quarry spoil tips. The <a href="long%20title">long title</a> of the Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969 was "An Act to make further provision in relation to tips associated with mines and quarries; to prevent disused tips constituting a danger to members of the public; and for purposes connected with those matters". The Act was an extension of the earlier Mines and Quarries Act 1954, which did not legislate over tips. According to McLean and Johnes, "the general commitment to public safety that the Tribunal had envisaged was not implemented" through the act, as the tribunal had advised wider legislation that should "consider the safety, health and welfare of all persons going about their lawful business in the vicinity of a mine, including the safety of their property".

In May 1970 <a href="Barbara%20Castle">Barbara Castle</a>, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Employment%20and%20Productivity">Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity</a>, appointed Robens to chair the Committee on Health and Safety at Work, to review legislation in the area and recommend the provisions that should be made for workers and the general public. In 1972 the committee published its findings in the Robens Report which led to the creation of the <a href="Health%20and%20Safety%20at%20Work%20etc.%20Act%201974">Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974</a> and the formation of the <a href="Health%20and%20Safety%20Commission">Health and Safety Commission</a> and the <a href="Health%20and%20Safety%20Executive">Health and Safety Executive</a>.

In addition to news and historical coverage, the Aberfan disaster and its aftermath have been described in books, including histories of what happened, personal memoirs from those involved and collections of poetry, in music, song and on film.

Merthyr Vale Colliery closed in 1989. In 1997 <a href="Ron%20Davies%20%28Welsh%20politician%29">Ron Davies</a>, the Secretary of State for Wales in the incoming Labour government, repaid to the disaster fund the £150,000 that it had been induced to contribute towards the cost of tip removal. No allowance was made for inflation or the interest that would have been earned over the intervening period, which would have been £1.5 million in 1997. The payment was made in part after Iain McLean's examination of the papers released by the government. In February 2007 the <a href="Welsh%20Government">Welsh Government</a> announced a donation of £1.5 million to the Aberfan Memorial Charity and £500,000 to the Aberfan Education Charity, which represented an inflation-adjusted amount of the money taken. The money to the memorial charity was used in the upkeep of the memorials to the disaster.

In May 1997 the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh planted a tree at the Aberfan Memorial Garden. In October 2016, the fiftieth anniversary of the disaster, memorial events took place at the garden and at the cemetery; the <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> represented the Queen, and government ministers were present to pay tribute. At the time of the anniversary <a href="Huw%20Edwards%20%28journalist%29">Huw Edwards</a>, the <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> journalist and presenter, described the need to continue learning lessons from Aberfan; he wrote:

What we can do, however—in this week of the 50th anniversary—is try to focus the attention of many in Britain and beyond on the lessons of Aberfan, lessons which are still of profound relevance today. They touch on issues of public accountability, responsibility, competence and transparency.

Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area

The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine known exposed <a href="formation%20%28geology%29">formation</a>s, all visible in <a href="Zion%20National%20Park">Zion National Park</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Utah">Utah</a>. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a>-aged <a href="sedimentation">sedimentation</a> in that part of <a href="geology%20of%20North%20America">North America</a>. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the <a href="Grand%20Staircase">Grand Staircase</a>, the formations exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments that range from the warm shallow seas of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations, <a href="stream">stream</a>s and <a href="lake">lake</a>s of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations to the large <a href="desert">desert</a>s of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry near shore environments of the Carmel Formation.

Subsequent uplift of the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a> slowly raised these formations much higher than where they were deposited. This steepened the <a href="stream%20gradient">stream gradient</a> of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the <a href="plateau">plateau</a>. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the <a href="Virgin%20River">Virgin River</a> in this way. <a href="Lava">Lava</a> flows and <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a>s covered parts of the area during the later part of this process.

Zion National Park includes an elevated plateau that consists of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary</a> formations that dip very gently to the east. This means that the oldest <a href="stratum">strata</a> are exposed along the Virgin River in the Zion Canyon part of the park, and the youngest are exposed in the <a href="Kolob%20Canyons">Kolob Canyons</a> section. The plateau is bounded on the east by the Sevier Fault Zone, and on the west by the Hurricane Fault Zone. <a href="Weathering">Weathering</a> and erosion along north-trending <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a> and fractures influence the formation of landscape features, such as canyons, in this region.

The Grand Staircase is an immense sequence of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a> layers that stretch south from <a href="Bryce%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Bryce Canyon National Park</a> through Zion National Park and into the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>. Within this sequence, the oldest exposed formation in the Zion and Kolob canyons area is the youngest <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Grand%20Canyon%20area">exposed formation in the Grand Canyon</a>—the Kaibab <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. Bryce Canyon to the northeast continues where the Zion and Kolob areas end by presenting <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>-aged rocks. In fact, the youngest formation seen in the Zion and Kolob area is the oldest <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Bryce%20Canyon%20area">exposed formation in Bryce Canyon</a>—the Dakota Sandstone.

In the <a href="Permian">Permian</a> period, the Zion and Kolob area was a relatively flat <a href="Sedimentary%20basin">basin</a> near <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> on the western margin of the supercontinent <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a>. Sediments from surrounding <a href="mountain">mountain</a>s added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the <a href="isostasy">same elevation</a>. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the <a href="Toroweap%20Formation">Toroweap Formation</a>, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south but not in the Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its <a href="basement%20rock">basement rock</a>.

In later Permian time, the Toroweap Basin was invaded by the warm, shallow edge of the vast <a href="Panthalassa">Panthalassa</a> ocean in what local geologists call the Kaibab Sea. At that time, Utah and Wyoming were near the <a href="equator">equator</a> on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea.
Starting 260 million years ago, the yellowish-gray limestone of the <a href="fossil">fossil</a>-rich <a href="Kaibab%20Limestone">Kaibab Limestone</a> was laid down as a limy ooze in a tropical <a href="climate">climate</a>. During this time, <a href="sea%20sponge">sponge</a>s, such as "<a href="Actinocoelia%20meandrina">Actinocoelia meandrina</a>", proliferated, only to be buried in lime mud and their internal silica needles (spicules) dissolved and recrystallized to form discontinuous layers of light-colored <a href="chert">chert</a>. In the park, this formation can be found in the <a href="Hurricane%20Cliffs">Hurricane Cliffs</a> above the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center and in an <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> along <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20Utah">Interstate 15</a> as it skirts the park. This is the same formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the south.

Farther to the west, a complex <a href="island%20arc">island arc</a> assemblage formed above a <a href="subduction%20zone">subduction zone</a>. To the east, in western <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the <a href="White%20Rim%20Sandstone">White Rim Sandstone</a>, now <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Capitol%20Reef%20area">exposed in Capitol Reef National Park area</a>, to the east suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward in response to a relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not exposed in the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating <a href="karst%20topography">karst topography</a> and channels reaching 30 m (100 ft) in depth.

<a href="Volcano">Volcano</a>es continued to erupt through the Early <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> on the north–south trending island arc to the west, which was located along what is now the border between <a href="California">California</a> and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>. Shallow, marine water stretched from eastern Utah to eastern Nevada over a beveled <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>. As the sea withdrew around 230 million years ago, fluvial, mudflat, <a href="sabkha">sabkha</a>, and shallow marine environments developed, depositing <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> (from <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> <a href="evaporite">evaporite</a>s), <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>s, limestones, <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>s, <a href="shale">shale</a>s, and <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>s.

It took many thousands of thin layers of these sediments to form the thick <a href="Moenkopi%20Formation">Moenkopi Formation</a>. A prograding shoreline laid down muddy delta sediments which mixed with limy marine deposits. The fossilized plants and animals in the Moenkopi are evidence of a climate shift to a warm tropical setting that may have experienced <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>al, wet-dry conditions.

The Red Canyon Conglomerate, the basal member of the Moenkopi, fills broad east-flowing paleochannels carved into the Kaibab Limestone. Some of these channels are up to several tens of feet deep and may reach 200 ft (61 m) deep in the St. George area. A thin, poorly developed soil, or regolith, formed over the paleotopographic high areas between the channels.

The depositional environment was a nearshore one where the seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, <a href="red%20bed">red bed</a> layers separate the transgressive strata. <a href="Ripple%20marks">Ripple marks</a>, <a href="mudcrack">mud cracks</a>, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.

Outcrops of this brightly colored red, brown, and pink banded formation can be seen in the Kolob Canyons section of the park and in <a href="butte">butte</a>s on either side of <a href="Utah%20State%20Route%209">State Route 9</a> between <a href="Rockville%2C%20Utah">Rockville, Utah</a> to the south and <a href="Virgin%2C%20Utah">Virgin, Utah</a> to the southwest of the park borders. Progressively higher beds are exposed until the top of the formation is reached at the mouth of Parunweap Canyon (when traveling to the park on Route 9).

Later, uplift exposed the Moenkopi Formation to <a href="erosion">erosion</a> and Utah became part of a large interior basin drained by north and northwest-flowing
rivers in the Upper Triassic. Shallow river deposition along with <a href="volcanic%20ash">volcanic ash</a> eventually became the <a href="mineral">mineral</a>-rich <a href="Chinle%20Formation">Chinle Formation</a>. The irregular contact zone, or <a href="unconformity">unconformity</a>, between the Chinle and the underlying Moenkopi can be seen between <a href="Rockville%2C%20Utah">Rockville</a> and <a href="Grafton%2C%20Utah">Grafton</a> in southwestern Utah.
<a href="Petrified%20wood">Petrified wood</a> and fossils of animals adapted to <a href="swamp">swamp</a>y environments, such as <a href="phytosaur">phytosaur</a>s, <a href="lungfish">lungfish</a>, and lacustrine <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s, have been found in this formation as well as <a href="conifer">conifer</a> trees, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, <a href="fern">fern</a>s, and <a href="horsetail">horsetail</a>s. Relatively plentiful <a href="uranium">uranium</a> ore, such as <a href="carnotite">carnotite</a> and other uranium-bearing minerals, has also been found. The purple, pink, blue, white, yellow, gray, and red colored Chinle also contains shale, gypsum, limestone, sandstone, and <a href="quartz">quartz</a>. <a href="Iron">Iron</a>, <a href="manganese%20oxide">manganese oxide</a>s and <a href="copper%20sulfide">copper sulfide</a> are often found filling gaps between pebbles. Purplish slopes made of the Chinle can be seen above the town of Rockville.

The sand, <a href="gravel">gravel</a>, and <a href="petrified%20wood">petrified wood</a> which made up these deposits were later strongly cemented by dissolved <a href="silica">silica</a> (probably from volcanic ash from the west) in <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a>. Much of the bright coloration of the Chinle is due to soil formation during the Late Triassic. The lowermost member of the Chinle, the <a href="Shinarump%20Conglomerate">Shinarump</a>, consists of a white, gray, and brown <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a> made of coarse sandstone, and thin lenses of sandy mudstone, along with plentiful petrified wood. The Shinarump was laid down in braided streams that flowed through valleys eroded into the underlying Moenkopi Formation. This member of the Chinle forms prominent cliffs with thickness up to , and its name comes from a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> word meaning "wolf's rump" (a reference to the way this member erodes into gray, rounded hills).

A succession of volcanic-ash-rich mudstone and sandstone with a thickness of make up the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle, which was deposited by lakes, highly sinuous rivers and on the surrounding floodplains. This is the same bright, multicolored part of the Chinle that is exposed in <a href="Petrified%20Forest%20National%20Park">Petrified Forest National Park</a> and the <a href="Painted%20Desert%2C%20Arizona">Painted Desert</a>. Petrified wood is, of course, also common in this member.

Early Jurassic uplift created an unconformity above the Chinle Formation that represents about ten million years of missing sedimentation between it and the next formation, the <a href="Moenave%20Formation">Moenave</a>. Periodic incursions of shallow seas from the north during the Jurassic flooded parts of Wyoming, Montana, and a northeast–southwest trending trough on the Utah/Idaho border. The Moenave was deposited in a variety of river, lake, and flood-plain environments.
The oldest beds of this formation belong to the Dinosaur Canyon Member, a reddish, slope-forming rock layer with thin beds of siltstone that are interbedded with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.

The upper member of the Moenave is the pale reddish-brown with a thickness of and cliff-forming Springdale Sandstone. It was deposited in swifter, larger, and more voluminous streams than the older Dinosaur Canyon Member. Fossils of large <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>-like freshwater <a href="fish">fish</a> have been found in the beds of the Springdale Sandstone. The next member in the Moenave Formation is the thin-bedded Whitmore Point, which is made of mudstone and <a href="shale">shale</a>. The lower red cliffs visible from the Zion Human History Museum (until 2000 the Zion Canyon Visitor Center) are accessible examples of this formation.
At thick, the <a href="Kayenta%20Formation">Kayenta Formation</a>'s sand and <a href="silt">silt</a> were laid down in early <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> time in slower-moving, intermittent streambeds in a semiarid to <a href="tropical">tropical</a> environment. Interbedded sandstone, basal conglomerates, siltstones, mudstones, and thin cross-beds are typical channel and floodplain deposits found in the Kayenta. Paleocurrent studies show that the Kayenta rivers flowed in a general westward to southwestward direction.

Fossilized <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> <a href="ichnite">footprints</a> from <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s have been found in this formation near the Left Fork of North Creek. Mountains in Nevada and California continued to rise in the Lower Jurassic as plate motions forced North America
northward. Eventually, this created a <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> and brought widespread <a href="desertification">desertification</a>. Today the Kayenta is a red and mauve rocky slope-former that can be seen throughout Zion Canyon.

Approximately 190 to 136 million years ago in the <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> the Colorado Plateau area's <a href="climate">climate</a> increasingly became <a href="arid">arid</a> until 150,000 square miles (388,000 km²) of western <a href="North%20America">North America</a> became a huge <a href="desert">desert</a>, not unlike the modern <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>. For perhaps 10 million years sometime around 175 million years ago <a href="sand%20dune">sand dune</a>s accumulated, reaching their greatest thickness in the Zion Canyon area; about 2,200 feet (670 m) at the Temple of Sinawava () in Zion Canyon.

Most of the sand, made of 98% translucent, rounded-grain <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, was transported from coastal sand dunes to the west, in what is now central <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>. Today the <a href="Navajo%20Sandstone">Navajo Sandstone</a> is a geographically widespread, pale tan to red cliff and <a href="monolith">monolith</a> former with very obvious sand dune cross-bedding patterns (). Typically the lower part of this remarkably homogeneous formation is reddish from <a href="iron%20oxide">iron oxide</a> that percolated from the overlaying iron-rich Temple Cap formation while the upper part of the formation is a pale tan to nearly white color. The other component of the Navajo's weak <a href="cement">cement</a> matrix is <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>, but the resulting sandstone is friable (crumbles easily) and very porous. Cross-bedding is especially evident in the eastern part of the park where Jurassic wind directions changed often. The crosshatched appearance of Checkerboard Mesa is a good example ().

Springs, such as Weeping Rock (), form in canyon walls made of the porous Navajo Sandstone when water hits and is channeled by the underlying non-porous Kayenta Formation. The principal <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a> in the region is contained in Navajo Sandstone. Navajo is the most prominent formation exposed in Zion Canyon with the highest exposures being West Temple and Checkerboard Mesa. The monoliths in the sides of Zion Canyon are among the tallest sandstone cliffs in the world.

Utah and western Colorado were deformed as the rate of subduction off the west coast increased in the Middle Jurassic <a href="Sevier%20Orogeny">Sevier Orogeny</a>. At the same time, an inland sea began to encroach on the continent from the north. Broad tidal flats and streams carrying iron oxide-rich mud formed on the margins of the shallow sea to the west, creating the Sinawava member of the <a href="Temple%20Cap%20Formation">Temple Cap Formation</a>. Flat-bedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones filled depressions left in the underlying eroded strata. Streams eroded the poorly cemented Navajo Sandstone, and water caused the sand to slump.

Desert conditions returned briefly, creating the White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of <a href="clay">clay</a> and silt mark the end of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much the lower half of the <a href="Navajo%20Formation">Navajo Formation</a>.
A warm, shallow inland sea started to advance into the region (transgress) 150 million years ago, finishing the job of flattening the sand dunes. Limy ooze with some sand and fossils were laid down as thick sedimentation beds from Mid to Late <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> time. Some calcareous silt percolated down into the buried sand dunes (carrying red oxides with it) and eventually cemented them into the sandstone of the Navajo Formation. The limy ooze above would later <a href="lithify">lithify</a> into the hard and compact limestone of the <a href="Carmel%20Formation">Carmel Formation</a>, thick.

Many unique environments were created by the migrating Sevier thrust system, and the four members of the Carmel Formation in southwest Utah capture these changing environments. Both open marine (<a href="crinoid">crinoid</a>s) and restricted marine (<a href="pelecypod">pelecypod</a>s, <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a>s) environments are represented in the Co-op Creek member. Sandstone and gypsum in the Crystal Creek and <a href="Paria%20River">Paria River</a> members signal a return to desert conditions in a coastal setting.

Outcrops of the Carmel Formation are most notably exposed on <a href="Horse%20Ranch%20Mountain">Horse Ranch Mountain</a> () in the Kolob Canyons section of the park and near Mt. Carmel Junction east of the park. Other formations totaling thick may have been deposited in the region during Late <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> and Early <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> only to be uplifted and entirely removed by erosion.

Mountains continued to rise in the Sevier orogenic belt to the west during the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> while the roughly north-south trending Western Interior Basin expanded. Rifting in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> helped the southern end of the basin to subside, which allowed marine water to advance northward. At the same time, the shoreline advanced inland from the Arctic region. The seas advanced and retreated many times during the Cretaceous until one of the most extensive interior seaways ever, called the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a>, drowned much of western North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a>. The western shoreline of the seaway was in the vicinity of <a href="Cedar%20City%2C%20Utah">Cedar City, Utah</a> while the eastern margin was part of the low-lying, stable platform ramp in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> and <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>.

The pebble to cobble <a href="conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a> and tan fossil-rich sandstone of the resulting thick <a href="Dakota%20Sandstone">Dakota Sandstone</a> include <a href="alluvial%20fan">alluvial fan</a> and <a href="alluvial%20plain">alluvial plain</a> sediments that grade laterally into coastal plain, marginal marine, and marine deposits. A small remnant of the Dakota is exposed on top of the -high Horse Ranch Mountain (). This formation is the youngest one exposed in the Zion area but the oldest exposed in Bryce Canyon to the northeast. Deposition continued but the resulting formations were later uplifted and eroded away. The <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Bryce%20Canyon%20area">exposed formations in the Bryce Canyon area</a> likely represent these lost layers.

East–west-directed compression from subduction off the west coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> time by folding and <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust fault</a>ing strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period can be seen in the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same formation in the Taylor Creek Thrust Fault Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.

Tensional forces forming the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range</a> physiogeographic province to the west about 20 to 25 million years ago in Tertiary time created the two faults that bound the <a href="Markagunt%20Plateau">Markagunt Plateau</a> (which underlies the park): the Sevier Fault on the east and the Hurricane Fault on the west. The Hurricane fault zone is a major, active, steeply west-dipping <a href="normal%20fault">normal fault</a> that stretches at least 155 miles (250 km) from south of the Grand Canyon northward to <a href="Cedar%20City%2C%20Utah">Cedar City, Utah</a>. Along the southern boundary of the park, tectonic displacement along this fault is about 3,600 ft (1,098 m). Several other normal faults also developed on the plateau.

Subsequent <a href="Tectonic%20uplift">uplift</a> of the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a> and tilting of the Markagunt Plateau started 13 million years ago. This steepened the <a href="stream%20gradient">stream gradient</a> of the ancestral <a href="Virgin%20River">Virgin River</a> (Zion Canyon section of the park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and <a href="downcutting">downcut</a> faster into the underlying Markagunt Plateau. Downcutting continues to be especially rapid after heavy <a href="rainstorm">rainstorm</a>s and winter runoff when the water contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. Uplift and downcutting are so fast that <a href="slot%20canyon">slot canyon</a>s (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the <a href="The%20Narrows%20%28Zion%20National%20Park%29">Zion Narrows</a>, formed.

Explosive <a href="andesite">andesitic</a> volcanism dominated the area to the west of Zion during <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> and early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> time and probably inundated the region with hundreds of feet of <a href="welded%20tuff">welded tuff</a> that has since eroded away. Three of these tuff layers are preserved on top of Brainhead Peak. About 21 million years ago the Pine Valley <a href="laccolith">laccolith</a> formed. This typical mushroom-shaped laccolith is one of the largest intrusions of this type in the world. Debris flows carried boulders of this intrusion onto the Upper <a href="Kolob%20Plateau">Kolob Plateau</a> indicating that the Hurricane Cliffs could not have been present at the time.
Then from at least 1.4 million to 250,000 years ago in <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> time <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic lava flowed intermittently in the area, taking advantage of uplift-created weaknesses in the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s crust. Volcanic activity was concentrated along the Hurricane Fault west of the park that today parallels <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20Utah">Interstate 15</a>. Evidence of the oldest flows can be seen at Lava Point and rocks from the youngest are found at the lower end of Cave Valley. Some <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a>s were constructed much later in the southwest corner of the park.

Some of these lava flows blocked rivers and streams, impounding small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000 years ago, basalt from the largest <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a> in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area. The lava traveled into Coalpits and Scoggins Washes to the south and accumulated to a depth of over 400 ft (122 m) in the ancestral Virgin River valley near the present-day ghost town of <a href="Grafton%2C%20Utah">Grafton, Utah</a>. Water impounded behind the two blockages, forming Coalpits Lake and Lake Grafton respectively.

Lake Grafton was the largest of at least 14 lakes that have periodically formed in the park (most were from landslides; see below). Thirteen lava flows are mapped in and near Zion dating from 1.5 million to 100,000 years ago. More recent flows of less than 10,000 years in age occurred north of Zion and east of <a href="Cedar%20Breaks%20National%20Monument">Cedar Breaks National Monument</a>.

Stream downcutting continued along with canyon-forming processes such as <a href="mass%20wasting">mass wasting</a>; sediment-rich and abrasive flood stage waters would undermine cliffs until vertical slabs of rock sheared away. This process continues to be especially efficient with the vertically jointed Navajo Sandstone.

All erosion types took advantage of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of <a href="lithification">lithification</a>, and the presence of cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting <a href="inverted%20relief">inverted relief</a> consists of ridges capped by basalt which are separated by adjacent drainages.

In all about of sediment were removed from atop the youngest exposed formation in the park (the Late Cretaceous-aged Dakota Sandstone). The Virgin River carved out of sediment in about 1 million years. This is a very high rate of downcutting, about the same rate as occurred in <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> during its most rapid period of erosion. About 1 million years ago, Zion Canyon was only about half as deep as it is today in the vicinity of Zion Lodge. Assuming that erosion was fairly constant over the past 2 million years, then the upper half of Zion Canyon was carved between about 1 and 2 million years ago and only the upper half of the Great White Throne was exposed 1 million years ago and The Narrows were yet to form.

Downcutting and canyon widening continue today as the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500 ft³/s (6 to 125 m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300 m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the <a href="Colorado%20River%20%28U.S.%29">Colorado River</a> to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.

Landslides more than once dammed the Virgin River and created lakes where sediment accumulated. Every time the river eventually breached the slide and drained the lake, leaving a flat-bottomed <a href="valley">valley</a>. About 7,000 years ago, the relatively thin wall between two closely spaced joints in the Navajo Sandstone collapsed. The resulting Sand Bench landslide blocked Zion Canyon just east of The Sentinel, creating Sentinel Lake. Another notable stand was created about 4,000 years ago when Sentinel Slide impounded the North Fork Virgin River, creating a lake that backed up to Weeping Rock. The current site of <a href="Zion%20Lodge">Zion Lodge</a> was under about of water for around 700 years. Evidence of valley floors created by these lakes can be seen from Zion Canyon Scenic Drive south of Zion Lodge near Sentinel Slide. Recent landslides in 1923, 1941, and 1995 have temporarily dammed the Virgin River. Prior to the initial Sand Bench landslide, the Virgin River flowed 70 ft (21 m) lower in elevation than it does today.

The area is periodically rocked by mild to moderate <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s, which often trigger <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s. For example, on September 2, 1992 a <a href="Richter%20Magnitude">Richter Magnitude</a> 5.8 earthquake caused 14 million cubic meters (18 million cubic yards) of mostly Moenave Formation to slide downslope atop the weak claystone of the Petrified Forest member of the Chinle Formation. The quake was centered on the Washington Fault, about southwest. Three houses and two water tanks were destroyed when the slope they were built on dropped and extended laterally a similar distance over a period of several hours. The landslide is visible just outside the park's entrance in <a href="Springdale%2C%20Utah">Springdale, Utah</a>.

Dungeon Siege

Dungeon Siege is an <a href="Action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing</a> video game developed by <a href="Gas%20Powered%20Games">Gas Powered Games</a> and published by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> in April 2002, for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and the following year by <a href="Destineer">Destineer</a> for <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a>. Set in the pseudo-medieval kingdom of Ehb, the <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> game follows a young farmer and his companions as they journey to defeat an invading force. Initially only seeking to warn the nearby town of the invasion of a race of creatures named the Krug, the farmer and the companions that join him along the way are soon swept up in finding a way to defeat another race called the Seck, resurgent after being trapped for 300 years. Unlike other <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s of the time, the world of "Dungeon Siege" does not have <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> but is a single, continuous area without <a href="loading%20screen">loading screen</a>s that the player journeys through, fighting hordes of enemies. Also, rather than setting <a href="character%20class">character class</a>es and manually controlling all of the characters in the group, the player controls their overall tactics and weapons and magic usage, which direct their character growth.

"Dungeon Siege" was the first title by Gas Powered Games, which was founded in May 1998 by <a href="Chris%20Taylor%20%28game%20designer%29">Chris Taylor</a>, then known for the 1997 <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> game "<a href="Total%20Annihilation">Total Annihilation</a>". Joined by several of his coworkers from <a href="Cavedog%20Entertainment">Cavedog Entertainment</a>, Taylor wanted to create a different type of game, and after trying several concepts they decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. Taylor also served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the other lead designer and producer and <a href="Neal%20Hallford">Neal Hallford</a> as the lead story and dialogue writer. The music was composed by <a href="Jeremy%20Soule">Jeremy Soule</a>, who had also worked on "Total Annihilation". Gas Powered Games concentrated on making a role-playing game that was stripped of the typical genre elements they found slow or frustrating, to keep the player focused on the action. Development took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two; completing the game within even four years required the team to work 12- to 14-hour days and weekends for most of the time.

The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> as the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002. Critics praised the graphics and seamless world, as well as the fun and accessible gameplay, but were dismissive of the plot. "Dungeon Siege" sold over 1.7 million copies, and was nominated for the 2003 Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year award by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a>. Gas Powered Games emphasized creating and releasing tools for players to use in making <a href="Mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">mods</a> for the game during development, which resulted in an active modding community after release. An <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a>, "Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna", was released in 2003, and a further series of games was developed in the franchise, consisting of "<a href="Dungeon%20Siege%20II">Dungeon Siege II</a>" (2005) and its own expansion "" (2006), a spinoff <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> game titled "" (2006), and a third main title, "<a href="Dungeon%20Siege%20III">Dungeon Siege III</a>" (2011). A trilogy of movies, with the first loosely inspired by the plot of "Dungeon Siege", were released as "<a href="In%20the%20Name%20of%20the%20King">In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale</a>" (2007, theaters), "" (2011, <a href="home%20video">home video</a>), and "" (2014, home video).

"Dungeon Siege" is an <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a> set in a pseudo-medieval <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> world, presented in <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> with a third-person <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">virtual camera system</a> under the control of the player, in which the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>s navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player chooses the gender and customizes the appearance of the main character of the story prior to the start of the game and typically controls them. The main character is joined by up to seven other characters, which are controlled via <a href="artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a>; the player may switch which character they are controlling at any time. The other characters move in relation to the controlled character according to the <a href="tactical%20formation">formation</a> and level of aggression towards enemies chosen by the player. The additional characters can be disbanded from the group and re-recruited.

The game world is not broken up into <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>, but is instead one large area not separated by <a href="loading%20screen">loading screen</a>s. As the player journeys through the largely linear world, they encounter numerous monsters and enemies of varying types that attack whenever the party of player characters approach. The party defends themselves and attacks enemies using melee and ranged weapons, and nature and combat magic. The player does not select a <a href="character%20class">character class</a> for the characters, unlike other <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s; instead, using weapons or magic of a particular type increases the character's skill with them over time. Whenever a player gains enough <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s from killing enemies and reaches a new level in that weapon type, they gain some amount of points in their strength, dexterity, or intelligence statistics, which in turn relate to the amount of <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">health points</a> and <a href="magic%20%28gaming%29">mana</a> that they have, and damage that they do with weapons.

Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, which provide attack or defense points, or give bonuses to some other statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, breaking containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an <a href="inventory%20%28videogames%29">inventory</a>, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.

"Dungeon Siege" has both a <a href="single-player%20video%20game">single-player</a> and <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> mode. The single-player mode consists of a single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The <a href="cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative multiplayer</a> mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps can be created by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches can be created and joined via <a href="local%20area%20network">local area network</a>s, direct <a href="IP%20address">IP address</a>es, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the <a href="MSN%20Games">Microsoft Zone</a> matchmaking service.

"Dungeon Siege" is set in the Kingdom of Ehb, a varied region on the continent of Aranna containing deserts, swamps, forests, and mountains, created three centuries earlier at the dissolution of the Empire of Stars. At the beginning of the game, the player character's farming village is attacked by a race of creatures named the Krug. The main character, a farmer with no given background who is named by the player, journeys through the Krug forces to the town of Stonebridge. Upon breaking the siege of the town, and gaining their first companion, the player character is tasked by the town's garrison leader Gyorn with journeying to the town of Glacern and alerting the Ehb military forces, called the 10th Legion, of the incursion and defeating any forces they encounter along the way. After journeying through crypts, mines, and mountains, the player character reaches Glacern, where they are informed that the Krug invasion happened the same day that the Grand Mage Merik disappeared, and are charged with traveling over the mountains to Fortress Kroth to assist the legion there. In the mountains they find Merik, who informs them that the Krug invasion is part of a larger invasion by the Seck, who destroyed the Empire of Stars before being imprisoned underneath Castle Ehb, and who have escaped and taken the castle. Merik asks the player to help recover the Staff of Stars from the Goblins. Prior to its theft, the Staff had kept the Seck imprisoned in the Vault of Eternity.

The player fights through monsters and bandits in crystal caves, a forest, a swamp, and an underground Goblin fortress filled with mechanical war machines. After recovering the Staff from the Goblins, the player character meets a division of the 10th Legion and is pointed towards Fortress Kroth, which has been overrun with <a href="undead">undead</a>. After clearing the fortress and fighting monsters and a dragon in the Cliffs of Fire, they march on Castle Ehb. The player characters then storm the castle and fight through the Seck forces to rescue King Konreid. He informs the party that the Seck's leader, Gom, is seeking the magical weapons from the Empire of Stars stored in the Chamber of Stars, and that the characters must secure the weapons and then defeat the remaining Seck. The player character collects the weapons and fights through lava caves and the Vault of Eternity where the Seck had been imprisoned. The player character kills Gom, defeating the Seck and saving the kingdom.

<a href="Wargaming%20Seattle">Gas Powered Games</a> was founded in May 1998 by <a href="Chris%20Taylor%20%28game%20designer%29">Chris Taylor</a>, then known for the 1997 <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> game "<a href="Total%20Annihilation">Total Annihilation</a>". Joined by several of his coworkers from <a href="Cavedog%20Entertainment">Cavedog Entertainment</a>, Taylor wanted to create a different type of game than before, and after trying several concepts the team decided to make an action role-playing game as their first title. As well as helping create the initial concept, Taylor served as one of the designers for the game, joined by Jacob McMahon as the game's other lead designer and producer and <a href="Neal%20Hallford">Neal Hallford</a> as the game's lead story and dialogue writer. Hallford was brought onto the project after it had already started; Taylor had devised the start and end of the game but left the intervening details and background story to him. The game's music was composed by <a href="Jeremy%20Soule">Jeremy Soule</a>, who had also worked on "Total Annihilation". The development team included around thirty people during development, with changes over time, and reached forty at the project's conclusion. The development of the game took over four years, though it was initially planned to take only two.

"Dungeon Siege" was inspired by prior <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing games</a> such as "<a href="Baldur%27s%20Gate">Baldur's Gate</a>" and the "<a href="Ultima%20%28series%29">Ultima</a>" series, but primarily by "<a href="Diablo%20%28video%20game%29">Diablo</a>", which Taylor admired for having an experience that "concentrated on action" that players could jump into without first researching the gameplay details and settings. Taylor wanted to expand that concept into a streamlined, immersive, and action-heavy role-playing game that removed common elements of the genre that he found boring, frustrating, or slow. Taylor also wanted to make the gameplay itself simpler than contemporary role-playing games, so as to appeal to a wider audience. To that end, he asked Hallford to craft a narrative that was also fast and streamlined; he had him write a detailed backstory for the game, which would not be presented to players but would inform and inspire the developers, leaving the in-game text restrained to keep players engaged with the action. Hallford described the process of writing for the game as similar to other game projects, besides a greater emphasis on brevity, though he has said that he was brought onto the project much later than he usually is, which meant that he had to create a story that worked as a background to the set pieces that had already been developed. The plot of the game was intended by Taylor to be subordinate to the gameplay; to that end, he was unconcerned that his overall story arc was considered, even by the development team, to be somewhat of a <a href="clich%C3%A9">cliché</a>, as he felt that journeying to defeat an "ultimate evil" was very motivating to players. Taylor and Hallford discussed producing a "Dungeon Siege" novel to explore Hallford's story, though it never came to fruition.

Taylor wanted to further improve on the "Diablo" role-playing game formula by removing the concept of picking a <a href="character%20class">character class</a> at all and omitting "Diablo"s long loading times. The development team also tried to make the game more streamlined by removing the need to backtrack to previously visited towns to sell items, by adding inventories to companion characters and pack mules. At one point in development, they planned to have a "helper" character who would pick up items dropped by enemies to let the player avoid doing so themselves. The developers also changed some elements that were standard in role-playing games that Taylor and the other developers found frustrating, such as letting players resell items to vendors for the same price that they were bought for instead of a steep discount, and "sipping" or only partially using potions instead of always using up the whole item.

Gas Powered Games included their <a href="game%20development%20tool">game development tool</a>, called the Siege Editor, as a tool for players to <a href="mod%20%28video%20gaming%29">mod</a> the game. Having seen the output of players creating mods for "Total Annihilation", Taylor wanted to "take that to the extreme" and provide a full set of tools to foster a community of players enhancing and changing the game after release. He felt that the tools, which could allow players to make new game worlds, characters, and gameplay, would help support a large, long-term community of players around the game. Gas Powered Games hoped that providing what <a href="Daily%20Radar">Daily Radar</a> called "one of the most comprehensive level toolsets we've ever seen" would allow players to quickly and easily create small game regions, as well as allow more serious modders the ability to develop entire parallel games using the "Dungeon Siege" <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>. They also hoped that this modding community would be able to enhance and extend the multiplayer gameplay beyond what they could release. Taylor attributed his enthusiasm for releasing their own development tools for modding to both his enjoyment of seeing mods for "Total Annihilation" produced years after its release as well as the lack of negative consequences to <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a> and <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s historical tendency to release the entire <a href="source%20code">source code</a> to their games. Taylor later estimated that the company spent around twenty percent of their budget on developing the modding tools.

After the first year of development, Gas Powered Games found that they were not going to be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the seamless world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features they could put into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">virtual camera system</a> could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the <a href="OpenGL">OpenGL</a> graphics library only to switch to <a href="Direct3D">Direct3D</a>. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.

By 2000, Gas Powered Games had begun to search for a publisher for the game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers were interested in the game, but he was convinced by <a href="Ed%20Fries">Ed Fries</a> to partner with the newly established <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> PC publishing group. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due to the size of the game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. "Dungeon Siege" was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning and polishing the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features. "Dungeon Siege" was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on April 5, 2002, by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, and for <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> on May 2, 2003, by <a href="Destineer">Destineer</a>.

"Dungeon Siege" was commercially successful, selling over 1.7 million copies. According to the <a href="The%20NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, preorders of the game in the month before its release made it the eighth-best selling computer game of March 2002, and upon release in the following month it rose to second-best selling, after "<a href="The%20Sims%20%28video%20game%29%23Vacation">The Sims: Vacation</a>". It fell to seventh and then thirteenth place the following two months, and finished in 14th place for the year overall. By August 2006, it had sold 360,000 copies and earned $14.5 million in the United States alone. This led "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" to declare it the country's 44th-best selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. By September 2002, "Dungeon Siege" had also received a "Gold" certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

The game was highly rated by critics upon release; it is listed by review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> as the third-highest rated computer role-playing game of 2002, behind "<a href="Neverwinter%20Nights">Neverwinter Nights</a>" and "", and the twenty-first-highest computer game overall for the year. The graphics were highly praised; Dan Adams of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called it "ridiculously pretty to watch", while reviewers for <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> and "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" praised the environments as being detailed and varied. Robert Coffey of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" and Greg Vederman of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" similarly lauded the detailed environments, while Andy McNamara and Kristian Brogger of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" and <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Peter Suciu called out the seamless world without loading screens as especially worthy of note. Suciu further praised how the freeform, seamless map was used to create areas that were not shaped like rectangular regions with a winding path filling up the space, as was typical with other role-playing games of the time. The IGN and "GamePro" reviewers commended the sound effects as excellent and for helping to create the atmosphere of the game, while the IGN and GameSpot reviewers also praised the "ambient orchestral score".

The gameplay was similarly lauded; the "GamePro" review claimed that ""Dungeon Siege"s gameplay is perhaps its biggest and most transparent improvement over previous titles in the genre." Several reviewers compared it favorably to "<a href="Diablo%20II">Diablo II</a>" (2000), then one of the most popular computer action role-playing games, with Adams of IGN claiming that it was very similar to "Diablo II" with some changes and improvements, and Coffey of "Computer Gaming World" stating that the only thing keeping it from being directly rated as better was that the shift to a more tactical gameplay made it too different of a game to directly compare. "PC Gamer"s Vederman, "Computer Gaming World"s Coffey, and the GameSpot reviewer praised the gameplay as being streamlined and accessible; they liked the tactical nature of controlling a party of adventurers who improved according to how they were used rather than directly controlling their actions and statistics. IGN's Adams, however, said that the gameplay could get monotonous, Vederman of "PC Gamer" felt that the gameplay combat choices were somewhat limited, and GameSpy's Suciu disliked the linearity of the single-player game. Adams further added that many of the tactical choices in the game were inconsequential, as all battles quickly devolved into brawls, and that the freeform system of leveling was essentially the same as four character classes as pursuing multiple tracks was ineffective.

The multiplayer content received mixed reviews: Adams praised the amount of additional content, while Suciu and the GameSpot reviewer noted that the multiplayer gameplay could easily become unbalanced between different players. The single-player plot was generally dismissed as inconsequential: the "GamePro" reviewer termed it "skeletal" and the "Game Informer" reviewers "lackluster", and the GameSpot reviewer called it "bland and forgettable" and concluded that players who wanted a "deeper role-playing game" would be disappointed. Overall, Vederman of "PC Gamer" called "Dungeon Siege" "one of the best, most enjoyable games of the year" and "GamePro"s reviewer claimed it "walks all over its competition with almost effortless grace", while Adams of IGN concluded that it was entertaining but had "untapped potential".

After it was showcased at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 2000, "Dungeon Siege" proceeded to win the Best RPG award from <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> and Most Immersive Role-playing Game award from GameSpot. After release, it was nominated for the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a>'s 2003 <a href="D.I.C.E.%20Awards">Annual Interactive Achievement Awards</a> in the Computer Role-Playing Game of the Year and Innovation in Computer Gaming categories, though it did not win either, losing to "Neverwinter Nights" and "<a href="Battlefield%201942">Battlefield 1942</a>", respectively. The game was also a nominee for "PC Gamer US"s "2002 Best Roleplaying Game" award, but lost again to "Neverwinter Nights". It did win the Best PC Game Graphics award from IGN.

Gas Powered Games' release of the Siege Editor did spark the rise of a modding community around the game; even before release several modding groups announced intentions to use the engine to create large-scale mods remaking games from the "<a href="Ultima%20%28series%29">Ultima</a>" series of role playing games. After the game's release, numerous mods were created, including several "total conversion" mods that made wholly new games and stories such as "The Lands of Hyperborea" and "Elemental". Gas Powered Games released one mod of their own in July 2002 titled "Yesterhaven", created by six designers over six weeks, which provided a short multiplayer storyline for low-level characters wherein they defended a town from three thematic plagues of monsters. It was followed up by "Legends of Aranna", a full <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a> developed by <a href="Mad%20Doc%20Software">Mad Doc Software</a> and released on November 11, 2003 for Windows and Mac OS X by Microsoft. The expansion pack added little new gameplay besides new terrains, creatures, and items, but featured an entirely separate story from the original game. In "Legends", the player controls another unnamed farmer; after the Staff of Stars is stolen by a creature called the Shadowjumper, they set off to retrieve it. After fighting their way through monsters in icy hills, jungles, and islands, the player arrives at the mystical Great Clock, a giant artifact which controls Aranna's seasons. There they defeat the Shadowjumper and retrieve the Staff of Stars. It received generally less positive reviews than the original, with critics praising the amount of content but criticizing the lack of changes to the base gameplay.

Several other games have been released in the "Dungeon Siege" series, beginning with "<a href="Dungeon%20Siege%20II">Dungeon Siege II</a>" (2005). That game received its own expansion pack, "" (2006), and was followed by a spinoff <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> game titled "" (2006) and a third main title, "<a href="Dungeon%20Siege%20III">Dungeon Siege III</a>" (2011). A movie directed by <a href="Uwe%20Boll">Uwe Boll</a> and inspired by the original game, "<a href="In%20the%20Name%20of%20the%20King">In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale</a>", was released in theaters in 2007; it has been described as being "loosely based" on the game, and was a commercial and critical failure. It was followed by the <a href="home%20video">home video</a> sequels "" (2011) and "" (2014).

North Ronaldsay sheep

The North Ronaldsay or Orkney is a <a href="List%20of%20sheep%20breeds">breed</a> of <a href="sheep">sheep</a> from <a href="North%20Ronaldsay">North Ronaldsay</a>, the northernmost island of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>, off the north coast of Scotland. It belongs to the <a href="Northern%20European%20short-tailed%20sheep">Northern European short-tailed sheep</a> group of breeds, and has evolved without much <a href="cross-breeding">cross-breeding</a> with modern breeds. It is a smaller sheep than most, with the rams (males) horned and ewes (females) mostly <a href="polled%20livestock">hornless</a>. It was formerly kept primarily for wool, but now the two largest flocks are <a href="feral">feral</a>, one on North Ronaldsay and another on the Orkney island of <a href="Linga%20Holm">Linga Holm</a>. The <a href="Rare%20Breeds%20Survival%20Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a> lists the breed as "vulnerable", with fewer than 600 registered breeding females in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

The semi-feral flock on North Ronaldsay is the original flock that evolved to subsist almost entirely on <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> – they are one of few mammals to do this. They are confined to the shoreline by a 1.8 m (6 ft) tall <a href="dry%20stone">drystane dyke</a>, which completely encircles the island, forcing the sheep to evolve this unusual characteristic. The wall was built as <a href="kelping">kelping</a> (the production of soda ash from seaweed) on the shore became uneconomical. Sheep were confined to the shore to protect the fields and <a href="Crofting">crofts</a> inside, and afterwards subsisted largely on seaweed.

This diet has caused a variety of adaptations in the sheep's digestive system. These sheep have to extract the trace element copper far more efficiently than other breeds as their diet has a limited supply of copper. This results in them being susceptible to <a href="copper%20toxicity">copper toxicity</a>, if fed on a grass diet, as copper is toxic to sheep in high quantities. Grazing habits have also changed to suit the sheep's environment. To reduce the chance of being stranded by an incoming tide, they graze at low tide and then <a href="Ruminant">ruminate</a> at high tide.

A range of <a href="Wool">fleece</a> colours are exhibited, including grey, brown and red. Meat from the North Ronaldsay has a distinctive flavour, described as "intense" and "gamey", due, in part, to the high iodine content in their diet of seaweed. The meat has <a href="List%20of%20United%20Kingdom%20food%20and%20drink%20products%20with%20protected%20status">Protected Geographical Status</a> in European Union law, so only meat from North Ronaldsay sheep can be marketed as Orkney Lamb.

The sheep are descended from the <a href="Northern%20European%20short-tailed%20sheep">Northern European short-tailed sheep</a>. Their arrival onto North Ronaldsay is not known precisely but it may have been as early as the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, which would make them potentially the earliest ovines to arrive in Britain. Because of their isolated location, they have evolved without much <a href="Crossbreed">admixture</a> from imported Roman and European breeds. They share some characteristics, including their colour range and short tails, with <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n sheep introduced when the islands were under <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> control, between the 9th and 15th centuries.

In 1832, a <a href="dry%20stone">drystane dyke</a> was erected on the island. Its construction was part of the response to the collapse of the kelping industry, which was the production of <a href="soda%20ash">soda ash</a> by the burning of seaweed. To provide a livelihood for those previously employed in kelping, the inland farmlands were reorganized, and the sheep kept away from the fields or <a href="Crofting">crofts</a>. Since then, the flocks on the island have been <a href="Feral%20animal">feral</a>. The wall also unintentionally reduced the chances of crossbreeding, which would have diluted the <a href="gene%20pool">gene pool</a> of an already vulnerable breed. The wall circles the entire coast of the island, 19 km (12 mi), and is 1.8 metres (6 ft) high, making it one of the largest <a href="dry%20stone">dry stone</a> walls in the world. In 1999, <a href="Historic%20Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> described it as a "unique and important structure" and designated it an 'A'-list site requiring conservation. This status affords it special protection; any development has to be approved with conservation in mind.

Since the wall was erected, the human population of North Ronaldsay has fallen from 500 to around 50, and current residents lack the skills to maintain the wall. Successive storms, the most damaging of which was in December 2012, have created large holes in the structure and the cost of repairs has been estimated at £3 million, in part due to the lack of natural material and skilled labour. (In 1902, it cost only <a href="Pre-decimal%20British%20Coinage">4 pence</a> per hour to repair the wall, using stone taken from the shoreline.) Stone is now imported for small repairs, but it was estimated in September 2015 by Historic Scotland that of the wall's needs repair and that the rate of damage is outstripping the pace of repair.

The punds, or pounds, also listed with Historic Scotland, are nine small enclosures situated across the island to contain the sheep for <a href="Sheep%20shearing">shearing</a>, counting, <a href="Domestic%20sheep%20reproduction">lambing</a> and slaughtering. The sheep are herded inside these punds twice a year, the only time they have access to grass feed. Even at these times, many of them prefer to consume seaweed. Between February and August, the sheep are brought into the punds, once for lambing and once for shearing. The lambs are born on the grass between February and May. At this time, the sheep are counted, lambs are given <a href="Ear%20tag">ear-tags</a>, and records are entered with the island's sheep court to record ownership. Shearing takes place in July and August, and the whole island community is involved in herding and shearing the sheep. Slaughtering takes place only in winter when the meat is needed, and when the animals are fatter and yield more meat, since seaweed is more abundant in winter.

In 1839, just after the wall was erected, the North Ronaldsay sheep court was created. A group of eleven appointed islanders were responsible for the maintenance of the wall, the health of the sheep flock, and recording ownership of the sheep. Today, the sheep court remains the regulatory body responsible for organising ownership of the sheep, but <a href="European%20Union%20law">European Union legislation</a> has suggested that it may have to be reorganised into a Grazing Committee.

The North Ronaldsay Sheep Fellowship is the primary organisation concerned with the survival of the breed. They maintain the <a href="Breed%20registry">flock book</a>, established in 1974, which is the breed registry containing all <a href="Purebred">purebred animals</a>. This book reports that there are fewer than 600 breeding females and roughly 3700 sheep in total. The <a href="Rare%20Breeds%20Survival%20Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a> (RBST) lists the North Ronaldsay as "vulnerable".

There are only two main populations of the breed. One is on the island of North Ronaldsay itself; the other was established in 1974 when the RBST took 178 sheep off the island to establish new populations. One group of sheep was sent to the mainland, and 150 were relocated to the uninhabited island of <a href="Midgarth">Linga Holm</a>, which was purchased by the RBST. The relocation was meant to protect the sheep from potential natural disasters, such as an oil spill; <a href="North%20Sea%20oil">North Sea oil</a> extraction was expanding at the time.

Modern <a href="DNA">DNA</a> <a href="DNA%20profiling">analysis</a> has shown little crossbreeding with other sheep breeds from mainland Britain. Testing carried out under the National <a href="Scrapie">Scrapie</a> Plan looked for the ARQ <a href="allele">allele</a>, which protects against the scrapie disease and is present in modern <a href="Selective%20breeding">selectively bred</a> sheep, and found it in only 1.3 per cent of North Ronaldsay sheep.

Further DNA studies comparing the bones of the North Ronaldsay with remains of North European short-tailed sheep found on a <a href="Skara%20Brae">Skara Brae</a> site dating from around 3000 BCE have shown a very close match, suggesting that the North Ronaldsay has not genetically mixed with other breeds.

North Ronaldsays are very small sheep, an adaptation to the harsh, cold environment. Rams typically weigh around , and ewes rarely exceed , both standing around high at the <a href="withers">withers</a> (shoulders). The sheep are slow growing and a full-size carcass may weigh only .

The North Ronaldsay is a descendant of the primitive European short-tailed sheep breed. As the name of the descent parent would suggest, they have naturally short tails. Their bones are finer than other breeds and their head is dished (sloping inwards). Rams are all horned; these horns are typically ridged and spiraled. Only 20 percent of the ewes are horned; the rest are <a href="Polled%20livestock">polled</a> (hornless).

North Ronaldsay sheep have a highly unusual diet consisting almost solely of seaweed. This has evolved due to their unique location, confined to the shoreline by a 1.8 m (6 ft) high dry stone wall, leaving only seaweed for food. Apart from the <a href="marine%20iguana">marine iguana</a>, native to the <a href="Galapagos%20Islands">Galapagos Islands</a>, it is the only land animal known to have such a diet. Studies have shown that, due to preference and availability, the sheep eat mainly <a href="brown%20kelp">brown kelp</a>s. This discovery led to suggestions that kelp may be of use as an alternative food source for other livestock.

The grazing habits of the sheep have also adapted to their unusual diet: instead of <a href="Diurnality">grazing during the day</a> and <a href="Ruminant">ruminating</a> (digesting) at night as other sheep generally do, the North Ronaldsays graze as the <a href="tide">tide</a> uncovers the shore (twice in 24 hours), ruminating at high water. Feeding begins around 3.5 hours after high tide as the areas of kelp and seaweed are exposed. Four hours later, which is just after the low tide, feeding ends, allowing rumination to begin. This cycle reduces the chance of the sheep becoming stranded at sea by the incoming tide.

Unusually for sheep, the North Ronaldsay fattens in winter when storms throw larger amounts of kelp and seaweed onto the shore and food is abundant.

The sheep's source of fresh water is limited to the few freshwater lakes and ponds along the seashore. This has led them to become very <a href="Halotolerance">salt tolerant</a>, as their diet is salt-rich, and access to fresh water is limited. Compared with other breeds of sheep, they can far better handle elements present in the <a href="sea%20salt">sea salt</a>. These empirical conclusions were drawn in a 1997 study, but the underlying biological mechanism has yet to be understood.

The sheep have <a href="Natural%20selection">evolved</a> a somewhat different <a href="physiology">physiology</a> from other sheep, due to their unusual diet – their digestive system has adapted to extract the sugars in seaweeds more efficiently. A 2005 study at the <a href="University%20of%20Liverpool">University of Liverpool</a> found that they have a greater susceptibility to <a href="copper%20toxicity">copper toxicity</a>, when compared with a more traditional breed such as the <a href="Cambridge%20sheep">Cambridge</a>. This is because seaweed has a chemical which inhibits the absorption of copper, so the sheep have to absorb copper more efficiently to obtain the required amount. The levels of copper found in typical sheep feed, including grass, are toxic for this breed. Studies at the Universities of Liverpool and <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">Minnesota</a> suggest that they can extract four times more copper from their diet than more traditional breeds.

<a href="Accelerator%20mass%20spectrometry">Accelerator mass spectrometry</a> has shown a higher ratio of <a href="Carbon-12">carbon 12</a> to <a href="Carbon-13">carbon 13</a> (<a href="%CE%9413C">δC</a>) in this breed than in any breed of grass-fed sheep, 13 parts per thousand. In a 2005 study, enamel samples were taken from the sheep and analysed for this ratio, to determine the diet of the sheep. This study showed that some sheep fed exclusively on seaweed, whereas others had a diet half consisting of grass in the summer months.

Lamb meat and mutton from the sheep have been specially designated by the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, meaning that only pure-bred lambs can be marketed as "Orkney Lamb". The meat has a unique, rich flavour, which has been described as "intense and almost <a href="Game%20%28hunting%29">gamey</a>", and has a darker colour than most mutton, due in part to the animals' <a href="iodine">iodine</a>-rich diet.

Despite their slight size, North Ronaldsay sheep were historically raised for their wool. It comes in a variety of colours and is very similar to the <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> breed, due to their common ancestor. More common typical colours are the whites and greys, but browns, beiges, reds (also called tanay) and blacks, with coarser hair, are all exhibited. A full fleece weighs about .

The North Ronaldsay is a double-coated breed, meaning they have a wool undercoat and overcoat. The undercoat tends to be finer and soft, suitable for garments that would touch the skin, whereas the overcoat is coarser, with long hair that protects the sheep from the cold, wet weather of their natural environment. This fibre is more durable and tends to be used in overgarments.

Washington State Route 522

State Route 522 (SR 522) is a <a href="State%20highways%20in%20Washington">state highway</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> that serves the <a href="Seattle%20metropolitan%20area">Seattle metropolitan area</a>. Approximately long, it connects the city of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> to the northeastern suburbs of <a href="Kenmore%2C%20Washington">Kenmore</a>, <a href="Bothell%2C%20Washington">Bothell</a>, <a href="Woodinville%2C%20Washington">Woodinville</a>, and <a href="Monroe%2C%20Washington">Monroe</a>. Its western half is primarily an <a href="arterial%20street">arterial street</a>, named Lake City Way and Bothell Way, that follows the northern shore of <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a>; the eastern half is a <a href="grade%20separation">grade-separated</a> <a href="freeway">freeway</a> that runs between Woodinville and Monroe. SR 522 connects several of the metropolitan area's major highways, including <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">Interstate 5</a> (I-5), <a href="Interstate%20405%20%28Washington%29">I-405</a>, <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%209">SR 9</a>, and <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Washington">U.S. Route 2</a> (US 2).

The present-day route of SR 522 was built in stages between 1907 and 1965, beginning with the Red Brick Road from Seattle to Bothell, then part of the <a href="Pacific%20Highway%20%28U.S.%29">Pacific Highway</a> and later <a href="U.S.%20Route%2099">US 99</a>. The road later became a branch of <a href="Primary%20State%20Highway%202%20%28Washington%29">Primary State Highway 2</a> (PSH 2) in 1937, and was extended east to <a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond</a> and <a href="North%20Bend%2C%20Washington">North Bend</a>. A branch of the <a href="Stevens%20Pass%20Highway">Stevens Pass Highway</a> was built to connect PSH 2 in Bothell and Monroe in 1965, and was incorporated into <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20202">SR 202</a> after it was designated in 1964. The Bothell–Monroe highway was re-designated as part of SR 522 in 1970, leaving SR 202 on the Bothell–North Bend highway.

Since the late 1990s, the SR 522 corridor between Woodinville and Monroe has been partially converted to a freeway to address safety concerns and a growing population. Portions of the highway near Woodinville and Monroe were widened between 2001 and 2014, while other sections near <a href="Maltby%2C%20Washington">Maltby</a> remain two lanes wide and <a href="undivided%20highway">undivided</a>, with improvement projects left unfunded.

SR 522, named Lake City Way within Seattle <a href="city%20limits">city limits</a>, begins at an interchange with <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Washington">I-5</a> in the <a href="Roosevelt%2C%20Seattle">Roosevelt</a> neighborhood of northern Seattle, east of <a href="Green%20Lake%20%28Seattle%29">Green Lake</a>. The interchange only allows movements south towards <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a> on I-5, and includes a connection to the freeway's <a href="Reversible%20lane">reversible</a> <a href="express%20lane">express lane</a> system. The highway travels northeast from the interchange, tunneling under the intersection of Roosevelt Way NE and NE 75th Street; the intersection itself is connected to SR 522 by a series of ramps to collector streets. Lake City Way continues northeast through <a href="Maple%20Leaf%2C%20Seattle">Maple Leaf</a> as a four-lane arterial street before turning north on its approach to <a href="Thornton%20Creek">Thornton Creek</a>. After crossing the creek, the highway enters the <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20Seattle">Lake City</a> neighborhood, passing several car dealerships. Lake City itself is a designated <a href="urban%20village">urban village</a>, with <a href="mixed-use%20development">mixed-use development</a> and apartment buildings that are centered around the intersection of Lake City Way between NE 125th Street and NE 145th Street. At NE 145th Street, SR 522 intersects <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20523">SR 523</a> and crosses into <a href="Lake%20Forest%20Park%2C%20Washington">Lake Forest Park</a>.

Beyond Seattle, the highway is named Bothell Way and follows the northern shore of <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a>. SR 522 intersects Ballinger Way (<a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20104">SR 104</a>) at the central shopping center in Lake Forest Park, and is joined by the <a href="Burke-Gilman%20Trail">Burke-Gilman Trail</a>, a <a href="multi-use%20trail">multi-use trail</a> running along the lakefront on a former <a href="railroad%20grade">railroad grade</a>. Bothell Way continues east along the northern shore of Lake Washington through the city of <a href="Kenmore%2C%20Washington">Kenmore</a>, located on the mouth of the <a href="Sammamish%20River">Sammamish River</a> and home to the <a href="Kenmore%20Air%20Harbor">Kenmore Air Harbor</a> <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> base. SR 522 travels upriver through a narrow valley that makes a sharp turn north towards <a href="Bothell%2C%20Washington">Bothell</a>. The highway turns east and continues downhill of the city's downtown business district, staying near the Sammamish River (and the <a href="Sammamish%20River%20Trail">Sammamish River Trail</a>) and intersecting Bothell Way (formerly <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20527">SR 527</a>). Leaving Bothell, SR 522 then travels around the southern edge of <a href="University%20of%20Washington%20Bothell">University of Washington Bothell</a> campus and intersects <a href="Interstate%20405%20%28Washington%29">I-405</a>, becoming a grade-separated <a href="freeway">freeway</a>.

East of I-405, SR 522 enters <a href="Woodinville%2C%20Washington">Woodinville</a> and follows Little Bear Creek as it turns north away from the city's downtown, intersecting <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20202">SR 202</a>. The freeway enters <a href="Snohomish%20County%2C%20Washington">Snohomish County</a> and intersects <a href="Washington%20State%20Route%209">SR 9</a> south of the <a href="Brightwater%20sewage%20treatment%20plant">Brightwater sewage treatment plant</a>. It continues through several sharp turns that follow the <a href="Eastside%20Rail%20Corridor">Eastside Rail Corridor</a>, a former railroad grade that runs northeasterly through the predominantly rural area near <a href="Grace%2C%20Washington">Grace</a>. In <a href="Maltby%2C%20Washington">Maltby</a>, the freeway reaches an <a href="at-grade%20intersection">at-grade intersection</a> with Paradise Lake Road (<a href="Washington%20State%20Route%20524">SR 524</a>) and becomes a two-lane <a href="undivided%20highway">undivided highway</a>. SR 522 travels northeast from Maltby, intersecting Echo Lake Road in a <a href="single-point%20urban%20interchange">single-point urban interchange</a>, and crosses the <a href="Snohomish%20River">Snohomish River</a> into <a href="Monroe%2C%20Washington">Monroe</a>. Within Monroe, the highway widens to a four-lane freeway with median separation and intersects Main Street in a <a href="dogbone%20interchange">dogbone interchange</a> near the <a href="Monroe%20Correctional%20Complex">Monroe Correctional Complex</a>. SR 522 cuts across suburban housing areas in Monroe, and crosses over <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Washington">US 2</a> and the <a href="BNSF%20Railway">BNSF Railway</a> near the <a href="Evergreen%20State%20Fair">Evergreen State Fair</a>grounds. The highway makes a 180-degree turn south to intersect with US 2, where it terminates; the intersection also has a direct offramp for eastbound traffic from SR 522 to eastbound US 2.

The entire route of SR 522 is designated as part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The <a href="Government%20of%20Washington%20%28state%29">State of Washington</a> also designates the SR 522 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities throughout the state. The highway is the primary route for Seattle-area residents to access <a href="Stevens%20Pass">Stevens Pass</a> and other parts of the <a href="Cascade%20Mountains">Cascade Mountains</a>. SR 522 is maintained by the <a href="Washington%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Washington State Department of Transportation</a> (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a>. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 96,000 vehicles used SR 522 at its interchange with I-405 and 12,000 vehicles used it at its eastern terminus in Monroe, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively.

Logging settlements were established on the northern shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The <a href="Seattle%2C%20Lake%20Shore%20and%20Eastern%20Railway">Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway</a> was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.

Bothell businessman and <a href="good%20roads">good roads</a> advocate Gerhard Ericksen successfully lobbied the <a href="Washington%20State%20Legislature">Washington State Legislature</a> to fund the construction of a road from Seattle to Bothell as a State Aid Road and Permanent Highway in 1903. The first section of the highway, traveling from <a href="Ravenna%20Park">Ravenna Park</a> in Seattle to Lake Forest Park, was completed in 1907 and was pronounced by "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" as one of the "finest pieces of road to be found anywhere in the United States". From 1911 to 1913, the state and county government paved of the highway between Lake Forest Park and Bothell with <a href="brick">brick</a>s. The highway, named the Ericksen Road after its promoter and Bothell Road after the city of Bothell, was opened on January 10, 1914, in an event named the "Boulevard Blowout" that featured 50 automobiles traversing the entire route between Seattle and Bothell. Most of the brick road was replaced in 1934, but a section south of downtown Bothell was preserved and remains known as Red Brick Road Park.

The Bothell Road became part of the <a href="Pacific%20Highway%20%28United%20States%29">Pacific Highway</a> in 1915, forming part of the highway that would continue north from Bothell towards <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>. In 1922, the original road alignment through modern-day Lake City was bypassed by the new, concrete-paved Victory Way, dedicated in the memory of <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">World War I veterans</a>. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into a new <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">national highway system</a> that was approved by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> on November 11, 1926, and numbered as <a href="U.S.%20Route%2099">US 99</a>. On October 15, 1927, the North Trunk Highway was opened between Seattle and Everett, providing a shorter and more direct route that would later be designated as US 99 and the Pacific Highway. The Bothell Highway was renovated from Seattle to Lake Forest Park in 1939, including a widening to four lanes and straightening of some segments. Part of the highway in Seattle city limits was renamed to Lake City Way in 1967, after lobbying from Lake City businessmen.

An unpaved extension of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, <a href="Redmond%2C%20Washington">Redmond</a>, and <a href="Fall%20City%2C%20Washington">Fall City</a>, was designated as a branch of the <a href="Sunset%20Highway%20%28Washington%29">Sunset Highway</a> (State Road 2) in 1925. The highway was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the Sunset Highway (re-designated as <a href="Primary%20State%20Highway%202%20%28Washington%29">Primary State Highway 2</a>) in 1937, running from <a href="Downtown%20Seattle">Downtown Seattle</a> to Fall City. The branch highway was extended to <a href="North%20Bend%2C%20Washington">North Bend</a> after the opening of a Sunset Highway bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.

Another branch of the Bothell Road, from Bothell to the <a href="Stevens%20Pass%20Highway">Stevens Pass Highway</a> (Primary State Highway 15) in Monroe, was proposed by the <a href="Good%20Roads%20Movement">state good roads association</a> in the late 1930s. In 1941, funding for this segment was rejected by the <a href="Washington%20State%20Senate">state senate</a>, in favor of completing the highway between Everett and Monroe first. The Bothell–Monroe Cutoff was designated as a branch of Primary State Highway 15 in 1943, with a provision that the highway would be constructed after the completion of the Everett–Monroe route. Construction of the highway was pushed back to 1961, and it was further delayed by rainy weather. The Bothell–Monroe Cutoff opened on February 10, 1965, costing $5.3 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) and cutting 20 minutes in travel time between Seattle and the Stevens Pass ski area.

In 1963, the Washington State Legislature commissioned a <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28Washington%29">new state highway numbering system</a> to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, initially with State Route 522 (SR 522) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State Route 202 (SR 202) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SR 522 had been moved to the Bothell–Monroe Cutoff, while SR 202 was moved to the Woodinville–North Bend highway.

The North Seattle section of the Everett–Seattle Freeway (now I-5) opened on August 28, 1963, including access to Bothell Way in the Roosevelt neighborhood. SR 522 was truncated to I-5, removing Roosevelt Way and Eastlake Avenue from the state highway system. A four-level freeway interchange with I-405 east of Bothell was completed in 1969, creating a connection between SR 522 and SR 202.

In 1968, the state highway department proposed the conversion of SR 522 into a freeway bypassing Lake City Way and Bothell Way. The plan drew heavy opposition from local residents, who feared bottlenecks and a reduction in quality of life, and was removed from regional freeway plans in 1973. Freeway plans in Monroe moved forward instead, with the completion of a bypass to the west of downtown in 1972. SR 522 was moved from its routing on Main Street to the new freeway, which terminated at US 2 and removed a railroad <a href="grade%20crossing">grade crossing</a> from the route.

Since the 1980s, population growth in Monroe and around the SR 522 has resulted in increased traffic congestion and safety issues, including a rise in accidents and crashes. The highway was originally designed for eventual conversion into a four-lane freeway, with leftover <a href="right-of-way">right-of-way</a> and bridge approaches built in 1965. Between 1980 and 1995, the stretch of SR 522 between Woodinville and Monroe was the site of over 1,100 accidents and 40 deaths. SR 522 has been named as one of the most dangerous highways in the United States by "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" in 1995 and "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" in 2007, among other lists. The rock band "State Route 522" formed in 1995 by local indie rock musician <a href="Jake%20Snider">Jake Snider</a> was named for the highway.

In response to the crashes on SR 522, local residents organized a <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> campaign ("Citizens Rallying for a Safer Highway") to petition the state for safety improvements and a highway widening. In 1993, the state legislature allocated $180 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) in funding towards a five-stage widening project, but the funds were transferred to the general fund at the behest of Governor <a href="Mike%20Lowry">Mike Lowry</a>. The 1994 supplemental transportation budget included $2 million for engineering studies on SR 522, with construction of a four-lane freeway funded through other means. State lawmakers recommended <a href="toll%20road">tolling</a> SR 522 to pay off construction <a href="municipal%20bond">bonds</a>, but the plan was pulled back after opposition from local residents.

Existing state funds were used for the first stages of the SR 522 corridor project, including the addition of <a href="median%20%28road%29">median</a> <a href="rumble%20strip">rumble strip</a>s and improved pavement markers in 1995, which helped reduce head-on collisions. The city of Monroe replaced the eastern half of SR 522 interchange with Main Street (164th Street Southeast) with a <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a>, the first to be built in Snohomish County, in 2001. The first stage of the corridor project was completed in 2001 and widened a section between SR 9 and Paradise Lake Road (SR 524) in Maltby, at a cost of $22 million. The second stage, a new single-point urban interchange at Echo Lake Road southwest of Monroe, was completed in 2006 at a cost of $37 million. The third stage of the SR 522 corridor project was completed in 2014, widening the highway to four lanes across the Snohomish River and through Monroe to US 2, where a new eastbound offramp was also constructed separately in 2012. A new roundabout at the 164th Street Southeast interchange was also opened as part of the project, completing the dogbone interchange.

The remaining stages of the SR 522 corridor project between Maltby and the Snohomish River were planned to be funded by the <a href="Roads%20and%20Transit">Roads and Transit</a> ballot measure in 2007, before it was rejected by local voters. The 2015 state transportation package included $10 million in design funding for an interchange at Paradise Lake Road in Maltby, to be made available in 2025, but construction of the interchange and widening of the remaining segment remains unfunded. The preliminary design options for the future diamond interchange would place the main ramps at either SR 524 or Paradise Lake Road. A coalition of politician and business leaders named "Finish522" was formed in 2018 to lobby the state government for barriers and complete grade separation in the wake of several fatal crashes in the mid-2010s. Long-term plans from WSDOT to address increasing traffic congestion in downtown Monroe include the construction of a highway bypass for US 2 to the north of the city. The project would include a northern extension of SR 522 to intersect the realigned US 2 near Kelsey Street and Chain Lake Road.

The western portion of SR 522, including Lake City Way and Bothell Way, is a major <a href="public%20transport">public transit</a> corridor for the region and is served by <a href="Sound%20Transit%20Express">Sound Transit Express</a> and <a href="King%20County%20Metro">King County Metro</a> bus routes. <a href="Bus%20lane">Bus lane</a>s were added to sections of SR 522 in Seattle, Lake Forest Park, and Kenmore in the 1990s, and were expanded in the 2000s. In 2002, <a href="Sound%20Transit">Sound Transit</a> launched express Route 522, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Woodinville.

Sound Transit plans to run a <a href="Stride%20%28bus%20rapid%20transit%29">Stride</a> <a href="bus%20rapid%20transit">bus rapid transit</a> line on SR 522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus as part of its <a href="Sound%20Transit%203">Sound Transit 3</a> program, approved in 2016. The line is scheduled to begin service in 2024 and will terminate at the <a href="NE%20145th%20Street%20station">NE 145th Street light rail station</a> in <a href="Shoreline%2C%20Washington">Shoreline</a>. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid-20th century, including the failed <a href="Forward%20Thrust">Forward Thrust</a> ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the <a href="Seattle%20Monorail%20Project">Seattle Monorail Project</a>, and <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> in the Sound Transit long-range plan.

Eagle (British comics)

Eagle was a British children's <a href="British%20comics">comics</a> periodical, first published from 1950 to 1969, and then in a relaunched format from 1982 to 1994. It was founded by <a href="Marcus%20Morris%20%28publisher%29">Marcus Morris</a>, an <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> vicar from <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. Morris edited a <a href="Southport">Southport</a> parish magazine called "The Anvil", but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively. Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children's literature, he and "Anvil" artist <a href="Frank%20Hampson">Frank Hampson</a> created a dummy comic based on Christian values. Morris proposed the idea to several <a href="Fleet%20Street">Fleet Street</a> publishers, with little success, until <a href="Hulton%20Press">Hulton Press</a> took it on.

Following a huge publicity campaign, the first issue of "Eagle" was released in April 1950. Revolutionary in its presentation and content, it was enormously successful; the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Featured in colour on the front cover was its most recognisable story, "<a href="Dan%20Dare">Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future</a>", created by Hampson with meticulous attention to detail. Other popular stories included "Riders of the Range" and "P.C. 49". "Eagle" also contained news and sport sections, and educational cutaway diagrams of sophisticated machinery. A members club was created, and a range of related merchandise was licensed for sale.

Amidst a takeover of the periodical's publisher and a series of acrimonious disputes, Morris left in 1959; Hampson followed shortly thereafter. Although "Eagle" continued in various forms, a perceived lowering of editorial standards preceded plummeting sales, and it was eventually subsumed by its rival, "<a href="Lion%20%28comics%29">Lion</a>", in 1969. "Eagle" was relaunched in 1982 and ran for over 500 issues before being dropped by its publisher in 1994.

"Eagle" was founded by <a href="Marcus%20Morris%20%28publisher%29">John Marcus Harston Morris</a> (1915–1989). Morris was born in the <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> town of <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a>, and in 1918 moved to Southport. He graduated from <a href="Brasenose%20College%2C%20Oxford">Brasenose College, Oxford</a> with a second-class degree in "<a href="Literae%20Humaniores">Literae Humaniores</a>", and at <a href="Wycliffe%20Hall%2C%20Oxford">Wycliffe Hall</a> gained a second in <a href="theology">theology</a> in 1939. He became a <a href="Priest%23Abrahamic%20religions">priest</a> the following year, and served as a <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Volunteer%20Reserve">Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve</a> from 1941 to 1943.

In 1945 he became vicar of St. James' Church in <a href="Birkdale">Birkdale</a>. Morris had long felt that the <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> church was not publicising its message effectively enough; four years earlier he had written an unpublished article, intended for the "Yarmouth Mercury" and entitled "Christian Hypocrisy", in which he questioned the difference that the Christian church had made to society in general. Morris also felt that the church was completely out of touch with the people whom it was supposed to represent. He gradually expanded the parish magazine—printed on four pages of cheap paper— into "The Anvil", a widely circulated Christian magazine based on the humour and arts magazine "<a href="Lilliput%20%28magazine%29">Lilliput</a>". Morris managed to employ several notable contributors on "Anvil", such as <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> and <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>. 

In 1948 he employed young artist <a href="Frank%20Hampson">Frank Hampson</a>, a war veteran who had enrolled at the Southport School of Arts and Crafts, where he was described by his tutor as an "outstanding draughtsman 'prepared to go to endless trouble to get a thing right. He worked as the illustrator on "Anvil", and later became the full-time artist for Interim, a Christian publicity society formed during a conference of diocesan editors, with ambitions to produce a <a href="comic%20strip">strip cartoon</a> magazine aimed at children.

Children's comics such as "<a href="The%20Rover%20%28story%20paper%29">The Rover</a>", "<a href="The%20Hotspur">The Hotspur</a>", "<a href="Schoolgirls%27%20Own">Schoolgirls' Own</a>", "<a href="The%20Magnet">The Magnet</a>" and "Adventure" usually contained a mixture of adventure stories, presented as text rather than strip cartoons, and some British boys were buying American <a href="horror%20comics">horror comics</a> produced for <a href="G.I.%20%28military%29">G.I.s</a>. Morris was impressed by the high standard of artwork in the US magazines, but disgusted by their content, which he described as "deplorable, nastily over-violent and obscene, often with undue emphasis on the supernatural and magical as a way of solving problems". He realised that a market existed for a children's comics periodical which featured action stories in cartoon form, but which also would convey to children the standards and morals he advocated. Morris was instrumental in launching the short-lived Society for Christian Publicity, formed to take control of "The Anvil" and to perhaps produce further Christian publications, and in January 1949 the "Daily Mirror" published an optimistic piece about the rumoured publication by the Society of a "new children's comic". This intrigued local journalist Norman Price, and the following month he met Morris, and helped him express his desire to see such a magazine by co-writing with him "Comics that bring horror to the nursery", published in the "<a href="Sunday%20Dispatch">Sunday Dispatch</a>". Morris's article provoked a strong reaction from its readers; letters of support flooded into his home.

Morris envisioned a character called Lex Christian, "a tough, fighting parson in the slums of the East End of London", whose adventures would be told in strip cartoon form, illustrated by Hampson. The idea gained the support of <a href="Terence%20Horsley">Terence Horsley</a>, editor of the "<a href="Sunday%20Empire%20News">Sunday Empire News</a>", but Horsley was killed in a gliding accident shortly thereafter. Morris suggested to Hampson that they instead create an entirely new children's publication. Hampson was enthusiastic about the idea, and in May that year the two began work on a dummy of it. Lex Christian became Chaplain Dan Dare of the Inter-Planet Patrol, and featured on the cover. On the inside, two pages of Secret City featured a character named Jimmy Swift, and on the back page was a religious story about <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Saint Paul</a>. Short strips included Joe from Strawberry Farm and Ernie, Always Unlucky. Other features included Morris's Editor's Letter and a range of news articles. Three photocopies of the dummy were made, each hand-coloured by Hampson.
By then deeply in debt from the publication of "The Anvil" and the production costs of the dummy, Morris formed Anvil Productions Ltd. Its prospectus declared: "The Company proposes to publish a new children's coloured 'comic' paper, which will be of a much higher and more mature quality than anything published in England and in appearance and format will be modelled more on the American comic papers which are so far in advance of our own." Initially he sought to keep the project under his control, but his escalating debts forced him to try to sell the idea. To that end, he made several trips to London, where—armed with the dummy—he pitched his idea to several Fleet Street publishers. He met John Myers at <a href="Hulton%20Press">Hulton Press</a>, who referred him to Montague Haydon at <a href="Amalgamated%20Press">Amalgamated Press</a>. He then met Neville Pearson at <a href="George%20Newnes">George Newnes, Ltd.</a>, whose executives claimed that the publication was "not an economic proposition". The US comics reprinter <a href="Denis%20McLoughlin%23Boardman%20Books">Boardmans</a> was next, followed by Mike Wardell of the "<a href="Sporting%20Record">Sporting Record</a>". Neither "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" nor "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" were interested, and at "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" the personal assistant to <a href="Gomer%20Berry%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Kemsley">Gomer Berry, 1st Viscount Kemsley</a>, presumed that Morris was asking for a charitable donation. In autumn 1949 however, Hulton Press contacted Morris with the instruction "definitely interested do not approach any other publisher".

In October that year Morris sold "The Anvil"—by then selling about 3,560 copies monthly—for £1,250, plus a £200 annual contract to continue as editor. Morris wanted to produce a comic the pages of which would be filled with role models whose behaviour and moral outlook he felt was socially desirable. Foreigners would not be depicted as either enemies or villains, and at least one child in any group of children would be from an ethnic minority. Religious values would not be imposed upon the reader, although their underlying moral tones would be made obvious on each page. These were innovative but somewhat risky ideas, as nothing similar existed in the market, and Hulton therefore commissioned extensive research into the new comic, which by then, inspired by the design of her <a href="Pulpit">church lectern</a>, had been christened "Eagle" by Hampson's wife. Layout and typography were designed by Morris's friend, <a href="Ruari%20McLean">Ruari McLean</a>, assisted by Charles Green, and faced with an initial print run of 1 million copies, <a href="Aintree">Aintree</a> printer Eric Bemrose designed and built a new ten-unit <a href="rotogravure">rotogravure</a> machine in about twelve weeks. The comic was heavily publicised before its release; copies were mailed direct to several hundred thousand people who worked with children, and a "Hunt the Eagle" scheme was launched, whereby large <a href="papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">papier-mâché</a> golden eagles were set on top of several <a href="Humber%20Hawk">Humber Hawk</a> cars, and toured across the UK. Those who spotted an eagle were offered tokens worth <a href="Threepence%20%28British%20coin%29">3d</a>, which could be exchanged at newsagents for a free copy of "Eagle".

Despite its relatively high price, the comic was an immediate success; released on 14 April 1950, and despite government paper quotas, the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. Eight of its twenty pages were presented in four-colour rotogravure. "Eagle" was designed to entertain and educate its readers; although a typical issue might contain such characters as Cavendish Brown, <a href="Harris%20Tweed%20%28character%29">Harris Tweed</a>, Jack O'Lantern, <a href="Storm%20Nelson">Storm Nelson</a> and <a href="Luck%20of%20the%20Legion">Luck of the Legion</a>, it also included a special news section, a sports page, and school stories. Each issue also featured a centre-spread full-colour cutaway illustration of a piece of machinery—the first detailed the inner workings of the <a href="British%20Rail%2018000">British Rail 18000</a> locomotive. Such high quality strips as Riders of the Range and P.C. 49 helped ensure a weekly circulation of almost a million copies, but it was the adventures of <a href="Dan%20Dare">Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future</a>, which most captivated readers. Created by Hampson—now a full-time staff artist with his own team—Dan Dare was the UK's first science-fiction comic strip of any significance. Readers were thrilled by the square-jawed British spaceman's weekly exploits, and his struggles with <a href="The%20Mekon">The Mekon</a>.
While Morris (who by now had resigned from St James) edited the magazine from Hulton's premises at Shoe Lane in London, the comic was created in a converted bakery in the Churchtown district of Southport. The building was described by "Eagle" artist Greta Tomlinson as "very basic, a flagstone floor and a tin roof; there was cold running water in the corner. It was freezing cold in the winter and boiling hot in the summer". Working to a tight schedule, Hampson created each Dan Dare episode first in pencil, and then in ink and colour. He and his team of artists posed for photographs, in the positions drawn in his pencil sketches (Hampson usually posed for Dan Dare). These photographs were combined with the rough sketches, and his colleagues then worked on the strip while he tackled the opening frame of each week's story. His drawings of the technology Dan Dare employed were meticulous, and were based on a large body of research and reference material, as well as space ship models, plaster heads, mocked-up space suits, and a complete model of a space station. He also wrote the dialogue for several of the comic's pages. Hampson was assisted in his work by expert consultants, among them <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> (then an aspiring young science fiction writer). Scriptwriters included Anglican priest <a href="Chad%20Varah">Chad Varah</a> (founder of <a href="Samaritans%20%28charity%29">Samaritans</a>). Varah also accompanied Morris on tours of Cathedrals often filled with "Eagle" readers keen to meet the comic's creators. <a href="Peter%20Ling">Peter Ling</a> and <a href="Macdonald%20Hastings">Macdonald Hastings</a> were contributors, as was Harris Tweed's creator <a href="John%20Ryan%20%28cartoonist%29">John Ryan</a>, who was also responsible for <a href="Captain%20Pugwash">Captain Pugwash</a>, printed in the first 19 issues.

Children were encouraged to submit their good deeds to the comic; those that had their stories printed were called MUGs, a not-so-subtle dig at the "spivs" who made fun of them. The best of these stories were awarded the title of "MUG of the Month", or "MUG of the Year". Readers were also invited to join an "Eagle" club. Upon payment of a subscription, members would be given a gilt "Eagle" badge, a rulebook, and a list of privileges. The club proved extremely popular, attracting within months a membership of about 100,000, but it also served as a research tool for Hulton; questionnaires were sent to a random selection of members, asking each to rate certain aspects of the comic. "Eagle"s production costs were funded partly by advertising revenue, although advertisers were required to integrate their designs so as to match the comic's high standards. Another of Hampson's strips, <a href="Tommy%20Walls">Tommy Walls</a>, was the first commercial cartoon in any comic, and an obvious advertisement for <a href="Wall%27s%20ice%20cream">Wall's ice cream</a>. "Eagle" also spawned a large range of merchandise, which included toothpaste, pyjamas, and toy <a href="ray%20gun">ray gun</a>s. Several annuals were printed; the first was announced in a September 1951 issue, in Morris's regular letter to his readers.

"Eagle" became immensely popular with people of all ages and walks of life. Copies brought into school regularly found their way into the hands of staff, who enjoyed them almost as much as the children they taught. "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>" reported on one doctor who read "Eagle" on his rounds. It was sent to soldiers in <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, to refugee camps, and was praised by <a href="Geoffrey%20Grigson">Geoffrey Grigson</a> on the <a href="BBC%20Home%20Service">BBC Home Service</a>. <a href="Wolf%20Mankowitz">Wolf Mankowitz</a> proclaimed Dan Dare a "Hero of Our Time", and the <a href="George%20Jellicoe%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Jellicoe">Earl of Jellicoe</a> was reported to have read the comic in the library of <a href="Westminster%20Palace">Westminster Palace</a>. <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a> supposedly placed a subscription order for his nephew, <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>, and on one occasion rang Hulton to complain that the comic had not arrived; a replacement was quickly despatched. Years later Morris sent the prince a copy of "The Best of Eagle" (1977); Charles replied and thanked him for the "fond memories". The comic was not universally popular, however, as it was quickly banned in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.
Despite settling some of his debts, Morris once again found himself in financial trouble, with unexpected tax bills and arguments with Hulton over payments. In 1955 he sold the copyright of his signature to Hulton for £7,250 (a portion of which was a loan). 45% of his £5,000 per annum salary was paid to the taxman. With only one other profit-making magazine ("<a href="Farmers%20Weekly">Farmers Weekly</a>"), Hulton sought to curb "Eagle"s costs, complaining about the use of taxis, expensive stationery, electricity and telephone bills, restaurant bills, and staff expenses. At their 1957 AGM Hulton's Chairman reported a fall in profits, from £298,000 to £36,000, blaming reduced revenue from another of their magazines, "<a href="Picture%20Post">Picture Post</a>", and increased production costs. Several of Morris's friends later left the company, and following a short period of internal turmoil Morris gave up the editor's chair in 1959. The following year "Eagle" was taken over by <a href="Odhams%20Press">Odhams Press</a>. Hampson's studio (by then in Epsom) was disbanded, and following creative differences he retired from the comic. His duties on Dan Dare were taken up by <a href="Frank%20Bellamy">Frank Bellamy</a>, described by Morris as "a most fastidious artist and scrupulous draftsman, and like Hampson at his best, often consumed with anxiety." With <a href="Keith%20Watson%20%28artist%29">Keith Watson</a> and <a href="Don%20Harley">Don Harley</a>, the three worked from a studio in Fleet Street. The front cover was redesigned, the Eagle name appearing across the top of the page rather than in one corner, coinciding with a new-look Dare. Many readers found Bellamy's changes to Dare (made at the behest of "Eagle"s publisher) objectionable. Bellamy was succeeded by Harley, who in 1962 was followed by Watson, who had returned from a short stint working on "Eagle"s rival, "Lion". Watson stopped drawing Dan Dare in 1967, and was succeeded by <a href="Bruce%20Cornwell">Bruce Cornwell</a>. Following Hampson's departure, the emphasis on Dan Dare's exploration of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> had changed instead to include <a href="interstellar%20travel">interstellar travel</a>. Continuity became strained, and production on Dan Dare ceased in 1967, when it was replaced by reprints from earlier editions.

"Eagle" continued to be published through the 1960s, under a succession of editors (Morris was succeeded by his deputy, Clifford Makins). Regular changes in emphasis, including an increasing number of features on contemporary music and sport, were not enough to ensure the comic's continued survival. Although in 1961 its circulation was still about 500,000, under IPC, then "Eagle"s owners, the comic suffered a drastic fall in quality. The centre spreads were replaced with the historically inaccurate Last of The Saxon Kings, and letters of complaint poured in to the comic. Within months the comic's circulation fell to 150,000, and continued to drop. By 1966 it was in decline. IPC continued production until the comic's last issue, on 26 April 1969. Just short of its 1,000th edition, the comic was merged with its rival, IPC's "<a href="Lion%20%28comic%29">Lion</a>".

A modified Dan Dare was briefly featured in <a href="IPC%20Media">IPC Media</a>'s "<a href="2000%20AD%20%28comics%29">2000 AD</a>" (1977–1979). The public reaction to this, along with news of a planned television series, persuaded IPC's comic arm <a href="Fleetway">Fleetway</a> to relaunch "Eagle" in 1982, as a weekly comic edited by Dave Hunt. The original Dan Dare was no longer a feature of the comic, his eponymous great-great grandson taking on the mantle of space explorer instead. Drawn by <a href="Gerry%20Embleton">Gerry Embleton</a>, and later <a href="Ian%20Kennedy%20%28comic%20artist%29">Ian Kennedy</a>, and set 200 years after the original story, the first story-arc featured the return of Dan Dare's earliest nemesis, The Mekon. IPC were unable to recreate the popularity of the original strip, and in 1989 the original Dan Dare returned to the comic, in a six-part story illustrated by original "Eagle" artist Keith Watson.

In an attempt to emulate the success that Fleetway had had with girls' magazines, the relaunched "Eagle" initially contained a large number of photo stories such as "<a href="Doomlord">Doomlord</a>", "<a href="Sgt.%20Streetwise">Sgt. Streetwise</a>" and "<a href="Manix">Manix</a>", but this style was soon replaced by the more traditional comic-strip format. Along with IPC's entire comics line, "Eagle" was sold to <a href="Robert%20Maxwell">Robert Maxwell</a> in 1987. Although not as successful as its predecessor, over 500 issues were published. A change to a monthly anthology caused by falling sales was a portent of the comic's future. Toward the end of its life issues contained reprints of earlier work, alongside new Dan Dare stories written by <a href="Tom%20Tully%20%28comic%20writer%29">Tom Tully</a> and illustrated by <a href="David%20Pugh%20%28comics%29">David Pugh</a>. The relaunched "Eagle" was dropped in 1994.

In the twentieth century it was standard practice in the British comics industry to merge a comic into another one when it declined in sales. Typically, three stories from the cancelled comic would continue for a while in the surviving comic, and both titles would appear on the cover (one in a smaller font than the other) until the title of the cancelled comic was eventually dropped. In this way, two comics were merged with the original "Eagle", "<a href="Swift%20%28comic%29">Swift</a>" in 1963 and "<a href="Boys%27%20World">Boys' World</a>" in 1964, before the "Eagle" itself came to an end when it was merged with "<a href="Lion%20%28comics%29">Lion</a>" in 1969.

"Lion" was merged with "<a href="Valiant%20%28comics%29">Valiant</a>" in 1974, "Valiant" in turn was merged with "<a href="Battle%20Picture%20Weekly">Battle Picture Weekly</a>" in 1976, and finally "Battle" was merged into the revived "Eagle" in 1988. In a sense, the new "Eagle" was descended from the old.

The new "Eagle" also consumed "<a href="Scream%21%20%28comics%29">Scream!</a>" in 1984, "<a href="Tiger%20%28Fleetway%29">Tiger</a>" in 1985, "<a href="M.A.S.K.%23Comics">M.A.S.K.</a>" in 1988 and "<a href="Wildcat%20%28UK%20comic%29">Wildcat</a>" in 1989. The story "<a href="The%20Thirteenth%20Floor%20%28comic%20strip%29">The Thirteenth Floor</a>" from "Scream!" continued in the "Eagle" until 1987, and its lead character, Max, purported to be the comic's editor for several years after the story finished.

"Eagle" inspired several imitators, such as "<a href="Valiant%20%28comic%29">Valiant</a>", "<a href="Tiger%20%28comic%29">Tiger</a>", and "Lion" (which featured a Dan Dare clone, "Captain Condor") but such adventure tales were less palatable for girls. Female characters like Dan Dare's Professor Peabody (one of only two female main characters in the strip), were generally given less important roles than the men, and as a result a trend developed toward producing comics aimed specifically at either boys or girls. "<a href="Girl%20%28comic%29">Girl</a>", a sister title to "Eagle", appeared in November 1951, and featured youthful capers in boarding schools, and tales of equestrian adventure. Later comics such as "<a href="Jackie%20%28magazine%29">Jackie</a>", descended from contemporary women's magazines, were more cosmopolitan in flavour. "Girl" was followed in 1953 by "<a href="Robin%20%28magazine%29">Robin</a>", which was aimed at younger children, and in March 1954 by "<a href="Swift%20%28comic%29">Swift</a>", for older readers.

"Eagle"'s previously unheard-of circulation figures helped define the content of most comics produced during the 1950s, including war. In contrast to other, earlier publications, "Eagle" attempted to educate the reader with factual, text-based historical stories, such as the life of <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, as presented in "The Happy Warrior." A detailed account of the Second World War was given, while one strip lambasted German paratroopers, who on seeing British infantry below them, shouted "Donner und Blitzen! Der Englander!" During the mid-1950s however, comics began sensationalising their covers with war imagery, and "Eagle" followed suit in the 1960s.

Morris went on to become editorial director of the <a href="Nat%20Mags">National Magazine Company</a>, and later its managing director and editor-in-chief. He launched "<a href="Cosmopolitan%20%28magazine%29">Cosmopolitan</a>" in the UK, and with <a href="Cond%C3%A9%20Nast%20Publications">Condé Nast</a> he formed COMAG, one of the UK's largest media distribution companies. He was appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a> in 1983, retired the following year, and died in March 1989. Despite his later work however, he is best remembered as the founder of "Eagle". His memorial service at <a href="St%20Bride%27s%20Church">St Bride's Church</a> in Fleet Street was filled to overflowing.

Hampson was embittered by his departure from "Eagle". Although he created Dan Dare, he and Morris had signed contracts which made the space adventurer the copyright of its publisher. This made it difficult for him to get hold of his original artwork, and excluded him from any profits Hulton made from the huge range of Dan Dare and "Eagle" merchandise it licensed. He called Odhams, the comic's owner after 1960, "<a href="Treens">Treens</a>". Hampson later worked on various advertising commissions, and illustrated seven <a href="Ladybird%20Books">Ladybird books</a>. He recovered from cancer to become a graphics technician at Ewell Technical College, and in 1975 at the <a href="Lucca%20Comics%20%26amp%3B%20Games">Lucca comics convention</a> was declared as the best writer and illustrator of strip cartoons since the end of the Second World War. At the 1976 <a href="Comics%20101">Comics 101</a> British comics convention he was given the <a href="Ally%20Sloper%20Award">Ally Sloper Award</a>, as the best British strip cartoon artist. He died at Epsom in July 1985. His original Dan Dare drawings now command high prices, and have inspired a range of modern artists;

<a href="Gerald%20Scarfe">Gerald Scarfe</a> and <a href="David%20Hockney">David Hockney</a> were first published in "Eagle". <a href="X-Men">X-Men</a> comic scriptwriter <a href="Chris%20Claremont">Chris Claremont</a> read and enjoyed "Eagle", and cites Hampson's work as influential on his career. Watchmen co-creator <a href="Dave%20Gibbons">Dave Gibbons</a> has also praised Hampson's work, and the author <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a>, in his foreword to "Living with Eagles" (1998), cites the stories printed in "Eagle" as helping "me in my story-telling efforts through musicals many years on." Professor <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, when asked about the influence Dan Dare had on him, replied: "Why am I in cosmology?", and the entertainer <a href="Kenny%20Everett">Kenny Everett</a> chose an "Eagle Annual" as his book on "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>".

The comic industry's <a href="Eagle%20Award%20%28comics%29">Eagle Awards</a>, first presented in the late 1970s, are named after "Eagle", and a fan club, the Eagle Society, regularly publishes the quarterly "Eagle Times".

Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery

Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery (née de Rothschild; 27 July 1851 – 19 November 1890) was the daughter of <a href="Mayer%20Amschel%20de%20Rothschild">Baron Mayer de Rothschild</a> and his wife Juliana ("née" <a href="Cohen%20%28surname%29">Cohen</a>). After inheriting her father's fortune in 1874, she became the richest woman in <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a>. In 1878, Hannah de Rothschild married <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery</a>, and was thereafter known as the Countess of Rosebery.

During the final quarter of the 19th century her husband, the <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Earl of Rosebery</a>, was one of the most celebrated figures in Britain, an influential millionaire and politician, whose charm, wit, charisma and public popularity gave him such standing that he ""almost eclipsed royalty."" Yet his <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish wife, during her lifetime regarded as dull, overweight and lacking in beauty, remains an enigmatic figure largely ignored by historians and often regarded as notable only for financing her husband's three ambitions: to marry an heiress, win <a href="Epsom%20Derby">The Derby</a>, and become <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> (the second and third of these possibly apocryphal ambitions were achieved after her death). In truth, she was her husband's driving force and motivation.

Her marriage into the aristocracy, while controversial at the time, gave her the social cachet in an <a href="antisemitic">antisemitic</a> society that her vast fortune could not. She subsequently became a political hostess and philanthropist. Her charitable work was principally in the sphere of public health and causes associated with the welfare of working-class Jewish women living in the poorer districts of London.

Having firmly assisted and supported her husband on his path to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted. His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic, and lasted barely a year. For over thirty years following her death, he wandered in a political wilderness, directionless and exceedingly eccentric, until his own death in 1929.

Hannah de Rothschild was born in 1851 into a world of great wealth and luxury. She was the granddaughter of <a href="Nathan%20Mayer%20Rothschild">Baron Nathan Mayer Rothschild</a>, who had founded <a href="N%20M%20Rothschild%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">N M Rothschild & Sons</a>, the English branch of the Rothschilds' banking empire. <a href="Niall%20Ferguson">Niall Ferguson</a> states in his "History of the House of Rothschild" that by the mid-19th century <a href="Rothschild%20family">the Rothschilds</a> regarded themselves as the nearest thing the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Europe">Jews of Europe</a> had to a <a href="royal%20family">royal family</a>, and the equals of royalty. Whether or not this was strictly true, the many Rothschild homes and their art collections, in England, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, France and Germany, certainly rivaled those of the crowned heads of Europe, Mentmore in particular being one of the most outstanding art collections of its kind anywhere in the world.

Hannah de Rothschild's father Baron Meyer Amschel de Rothschild <a href="cousin%20marriage">married his cousin</a> Juliana Cohen in 1850. The marriage provided the impetus for Meyer to create what he described as ""an enduring monument,"" a <a href="country%20house">country house</a> of monumental proportions. His daughter Hannah, aged just six months, laid the <a href="foundation%20stone">foundation stone</a> on 31 December 1851.

Within a few years of the mansion's completion, attracted by the good hunting and proximity to London, Hannah's relatives began to build estates nearby, all within a carriage drive of each other; thus, Hannah grew up in an almost private world of unimaginable splendour and security. <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Pevsner</a> has described <a href="Rothschild%20properties%20in%20England">this enclave of Rothschild properties</a> as ""the most conspicuous and significant aspect of Victorian architecture in Buckinghamshire."" In addition to Mentmore, Baron and Baroness Meyer de Rothschild had a large house in London, 107 <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, and "The Zenaide", a luxurious <a href="yacht">yacht</a>, upon which Hanna's mother died in 1877, the year before her marriage. 

As an only child growing up in what were, in all but name, palaces, her childhood appears to have been lonely. She was a companion to her <a href="hypochondria">hypochondria</a>c mother and, in later life, a hostess with her father during her mother's long periods of indisposition. She was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons, subjects in which she was accomplished. Her parents were very protective of her, attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty. As a result, she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the Rothschilds' estates. A cousin, Constance, Lady Battersea, who never liked her, claimed that Hannah was so sheltered that the phrase "the poor" was just a meaningless euphemism to her. This is likely to be an exaggeration, as from her teens onwards she used much of her fortune to improve the lot of the poor, in housing and education. Whatever the faults of her education, she possessed great confidence, impressing her Rothschild relations, who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at Mentmore for the <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a> while only 17 years of age. A year later, in 1869, Hannah made her formal entrance into society as a [debutante]], when she was presented to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> by her mother.

Mayer Amschel de Rothschild died in 1874, leaving his daughter not only Mentmore (with its priceless art collection), his London mansion, and innumerable investments, but also the sum of two million <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds sterling</a> in cash (equivalent to £ in present day terms ). Thus, Hannah de Rothschild became the wealthiest woman in England.

Hannah de Rothschild was first introduced to her future husband, the 28-year-old <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Earl of Rosebery</a>, by <a href="Mary%20Disraeli%2C%201st%20Viscountess%20Beaconsfield">Lady Beaconsfield</a>, the wife of <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>, at <a href="Newmarket%20Racecourse">Newmarket Racecourse</a>. The Disraelis were close friends and neighbours of the Rothschilds in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>.

Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had inherited his title from <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">his grandfather</a> in 1868, when aged 21, together with an income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000 acres (160 km²) in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and land in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, Hertfordshire, and <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%20Lord%20Dalmeny">His father</a> had died when he was eight and he had been brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married <a href="Harry%20Powlett%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Cleveland">Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland</a>. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The <a href="Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Earls of Rosebery</a>, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant future was forecast for him by his tutors at both <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a> and <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>.

As early as 1876, there were rumours of an engagement. However, several hurdles had to be overcome before a marriage could take place. While the Jewish Rothschilds were accepted into society, and indeed were close friends of some members of the royal family including the <a href="King%20Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a>, as elsewhere in Europe, antisemitic feelings were prevalent in the upper echelons of society and particularly so among those closest to the Queen at court, where following the death of the <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Consort</a> in 1861 the Rothschilds became pointedly excluded. The Queen's <a href="equerry">equerry</a> <a href="Arthur%20Edward%20Hardinge">Arthur Edward Hardinge</a> referred to the Rothschild's dining tables as ""resplendent with the Hebrew gold"" going so far as to say a visiting Russian royal needed a "corrective" visit to <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> following acceptance of Rothschild hospitality. Queen Victoria herself expressed antisemitic views in 1873 when it was proposed that <a href="Lionel%20de%20Rothschild">Lionel de Rothschild</a> be elevated to the peerage the Queen refused and expressed a reluctance to make a Jew a peer – saying ""to make a Jew a peer is a step she could not consent to"" and furthermore stated to give ""a title and mark of her approbation to a Jew"". <a href="John%20Spencer%2C%205th%20Earl%20Spencer">Lord Spencer</a> advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against attending a Rothschild ball with the words ""The Prince ought only to visit those of undoubted position in Society"." However, this did not prevent the Prince from accepting Rothschild's invitations and gifts privately. While one could be friends with Jews and accept their hospitality, their social status was still not sufficiently elevated to include marriage into the peerage without unfavourable comment.

Rosebery's own mother was horrified at the thought of a Jewish woman, even a Rothschild, in the family. Rosebery too felt there was an impassable barrier of faith; at this time, it was inconceivable that any children could be reared as <a href="Jews">Jews</a>. Although it has been stated that Rosebery himself was devoid of any antisemitic views, this was not always true, especially in later life.

This factor also worked in reverse; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery, she was also aware of many obstacles, the foremost being that she was devoted to her faith, and to leave it would be a severe moral wrench. Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself: it was their custom to <a href="cousin%20marriage">marry cousins</a> to keep their fortune within the family. Ironically, Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin <a href="Annie%20de%20Rothschild">Annie de Rothschild</a> to the Christian <a href="Eliot%20Yorke">Eliot Yorke</a>, the son of the <a href="Charles%20Yorke%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Hardwicke">Earl of Hardwicke</a>, in 1866. In fact, she was to be the third daughter of the family's English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith, but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made. The "<a href="Jewish%20Chronicle">Jewish Chronicle</a>" announced its ""most poignant grief"" at the prospect, and cryptically added, ""If the flame seize on the cedars, how will fare the hyssop on the wall: if the leviathan is brought up with a hook, how will the minnows escape,"" demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the Jewish faith the Jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage. The quotation, originally from the <a href="Babylonian%20Talmud">Babylonian Talmud</a>, can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the Jewish faith should set a good example by strictly following the teachings of the Jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions.

The formal engagement of marriage was announced on 3 January 1878, a day Rosebery forever afterwards regarded as sacred. Writing to a friend in January 1878, Rosebery described his wife as ""very simple, very unspoilt, very clever, very warm-hearted and very shy ... I never knew such a beautiful character"." The marriage was celebrated in London on 20 March 1878 at the Board Room of Guardians in Mount Street, and also in a Christian ceremony at Christ Church in Down Street, <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>. To show "official" disapproval, no male member of the Rothschild family attended the ceremonies. However, any shortcomings in the guest list were compensated for by the guest of honour—the Prince of Wales—and Disraeli, who gave the bride away.

For the first few years following their marriage, the Roseberys resided in London in the Piccadilly house Lady Rosebery had inherited from her father. However, as the couple's social and political interests increased from 1882, they leased the larger <a href="Lansdowne%20House">Lansdowne House</a>. Lansdowne House was one of the finest of the aristocratic palaces in London, well suited to be the home of the political salon which Hannah Rosebery was to establish. Here political and social leaders of the day mixed with royalty, authors such as <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a> and <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, and other prominent social and intellectual figures of the time. Henry James, an occasional guest in the Roseberys' homes, delivered one of the most unflattering condemnations of Lady Rosebery describing her as "..".large, coarse, Hebrew-looking with hair of no particular colour and personally unattractive"".

The Roseberys divided their year among their various homes: London for the social season and parliament, Mentmore at weekends to entertain both political and <a href="Hunting%23United%20Kingdom">shooting</a> house-parties. In August the household would move north to Dalmeny for the grouse shooting. In between, occasional days and the weeklong <a href="Epsom%20Derby">Derby meeting</a>
would be spent at their home "The Durdans" in <a href="Epsom">Epsom</a>. Though small by comparison to their other homes, this mansion was described by Henry James as the most homely and comfortable of the Roseberys' many homes and as a delightful house full of books and sporting pictures, with just a few <a href="Thomas%20Gainsborough">Gainsboroughs</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Watteau">Watteaux</a>. Together the Earl and Countess of Rosebery added greatly to not only the Mentmore collection but also to that housed at <a href="Dalmeny%20House">Dalmeny House</a>, Rosebery's Scottish seat, amassing a great library of rare and continental volumes and a collection of artefacts formerly belonging to the Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon I</a>.

Published commentators on the Roseberys claim their marriage was happy, and there is no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.

There were times when Lady Rosebery's devotion to her husband was tested. Rosebery may have not been antisemitic before his marriage; however, the acerbic wit for which he was famous led him to make remarks that could have been taken in such a way, once his marriage had secured the Rothschild fortune. Rosebery seems to have disliked his first son, who he claimed looked "Jewish." On seeing his son for the first time he remarked ""Le Jew est fait, rien ne vas plus"," which must have been disconcerting for the child's very Jewish mother. Rosebery, who has been described as febrile and supercilious, replied in a letter of congratulations on the birth of his heir from <a href="Mary%20Gladstone">Mary Gladstone</a>: ""I cannot pretend to be much excited by an event which occurs to almost every human being and which may cause me a great deal of annoyance"." Rosebery then left his newborn child and wife (who was again pregnant) for a year-long tour of Australia. On another occasion, when the Roseberys were travelling in <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>, Rosebery is reported to have announced ""I will travel ahead, Hannah and the rest of the heavy baggage will follow the next day"."

While the marriage was based on warmth and esteem on Rosebery's side and adoration on Hannah's, it seems that Rosebery often found his wife's devotion irritating, and this sometimes caused him to be impatient with her. He was often abrupt with her in public. She, by contrast, was completely enraptured by him, and would frequently ignore her neighbours at a dinner party to listen to her husband's conversation further down the table, a faux pas almost considered a crime in Victorian society. Those who saw the couple alone at home ""could not doubt the affection as well as the comprehension that united them"."

However, at times Rosebery's behaviour could be eccentric. Gladstone remarked that Rosebery was, perhaps, rather too concerned with his health. Early in the marriage Rosebery decided to renovate the small ruined <a href="Barnbougle%20Castle">Barnbougle Castle</a> (the original Rosebery family seat), close to, and within sight of, Dalmeny House. Once renovation was complete in 1882, Rosebery used it as a private retreat from his family, and began to spend his nights there alone. Always an insomniac, he claimed that the ""stillness of the waters" [the nearby <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>] "were conducive to sleep"." Books were his passion, and he assembled a huge library in the small castle. Thus Rosebery was able to lead a life at Dalmeny with his wife, but also quite apart from her.

During their marriage the Roseberys travelled extensively, usually without their children. In September 1883 the couple left their children in the care of the nannies and nursery maids, supervised by Rosebery's sister Lady Leconfield, for a long tour of America and Australia. Lady Rosebery owned large investments in North America, including ranches in <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and mines in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. Their arrival in New York was widely reported, and a full and flattering description of Lady Rosebery was reported in "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Glasgow%29">The Herald</a>". The newspaper went on to describe Rosebery as looking like a prosperous farmer. Lady Rosebery was very taken with California, from where she wrote: ""The inhabitants are very entertaining ... the women are very handsome, think nothing of dresses costing £80, "fix up" their faces very frequently and are generally divorced"." Having toured and been fêted in America, the party moved on to Australia via <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. In Australia, Rosebery chose to indulge his habit of solitude, installing his wife in a hotel in Sydney, while he went off alone to tour the <a href="outback">outback</a>.

Rosebery's frequent absences from his wife fuelled gossip that he was a secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a <a href="paedophile">paedophile</a> housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the <a href="John%20Douglas%2C%209th%20Marquess%20of%20Queensberry">Marquess of Queensberry</a> did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.

The relationship between the couple appears at times to have been almost that of a mother and child. Rosebery, a self-centred, reserved man, prone to depression, pessimism and insecurity, had a difficult relationship with his mother who had been distant and openly preferred his younger brother. Lady Rosebery, an orphan and only child, appears to have been desperate to lavish affection. Once upon entering a book shop she told her children they were entering a toy shop, and when the disappointed children pointed out the obvious she replied ""to your father this is a toy shop."" Lord Rosebery's friend <a href="Edward%20Walter%20Hamilton">Edward Hamilton</a> recorded her ""notable faculty of getting other people to work and quickening their energies."" It seems she was the driving force of the relationship, with her feet firmly on the ground. She made herself the link between the world and her ""thin skinned and neurotic"" husband. While her husband sulked or withdrew with hurt pride from a situation, she came to the forefront to plead his case or cause. If she was aware of his faults she gave no indication of it.

The marriage produced four children: <a href="Lady%20Sybil%20Grant">Lady Sybil Primrose</a>, born in 1879; <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Primrose">Lady Margaret Primrose</a>, born in 1881; the heir <a href="Harry%20Primrose%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Harry Primrose, Lord Dalmeny</a> (later 6th Earl of Rosebery), born in 1882; and finally the <a href="Neil%20Primrose%20%28politician%29">Honourable Neil Primrose</a>, born the same year as his elder brother.

As a mother, Lady Rosebery was presented with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly after the birth of their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German <a href="spa">spa</a> (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.

More revealing is a comment Lady Rosebery herself made to her husband, ""I sometimes think it is wrong that I have thought less of the children in comparison to you"" shortly before her death in 1890, suggesting that when a choice between her children and husband was forced on her, she always chose her husband. However, the same comment also hints that she was not unaware that her choice was at the cost of her children.

When assessing Lady Rosebery's behaviour to her children it should be remembered that she lived in an era of plentiful <a href="nanny">nannies</a>, <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a>s, <a href="nursemaid">nursemaid</a>s and <a href="governess">governess</a>es which the upper classes employed as the norm. These people were employed regardless of the mother's affection towards her children; it was inconceivable that a countess would nurse her own children, and to do so would have been breaking social conventions. Hence her seeming lack of attention to her children was not unusual – she was following the upper class conventions and "<a href="stiff%20upper%20lip">stiff upper lip</a>" philosophies of her era. However, in spite of their prolonged absences from their children, the Roseberys do not appear to have been very distant or remote figures in the earliest stages of their children's lives. <a href="Margot%20Asquith">Margot Asquith</a> records how Rosebery loved to play and romp on the floor with the children.

It has been said of Hannah de Rothschild that she grew up with a good sense and presence of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled with his good looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.

From the outset of the marriage, political members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>. As a <a href="hereditary%20peer">hereditary peer</a>, he already had a seat in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> and had made his <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a> there on attaining his <a href="Age%20of%20majority">majority</a>. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. <a href="Granville%20Leveson-Gower%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Granville</a> in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her ""If you keep him up to the mark, [he] is sure to have his page in history."" The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his "page in history" was to become her "<a href="wikt%3Araison%20d%27%C3%AAtre">raison d'être</a>". Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: ""She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, it is easy to see that she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career"." Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact ""his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against"." However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the <a href="husting">husting</a>s of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly "political wife" in Britain.

This first became evident in the great campaign to re-elect Gladstone. Known today as the <a href="Midlothian%20campaign">Midlothian campaign</a>, it was masterminded by the Roseberys. Rosebery used his influence to have Gladstone invited to stand as parliamentary candidate for <a href="Midlothian%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29%20%281708-1918%29">Midlothian</a>, near to Rosebery's Dalmeny estate. <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">Gladstone</a> had nominally retired from politics after losing his <a href="Greenwich%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Greenwich</a> seat in 1874, when Disraeli had been swept to power. The campaign was based at Dalmeny where Lady Rosebery hosted a series of large political <a href="house%20party">house parties</a> throughout the long campaign. The <a href="Tory">Tories</a> were later to claim that Rosebery had paid for Gladstone's campaign. Rosebery later admitted to spending £50,000.

The Roseberys' house party would leave Dalmeny and tour towns and cities across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the speakers often addressing vast crowds from the back of an American-designed <a href="Pullman%20car">Pullman car</a> specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings have been described as something between a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.

Throughout all this, Gladstone was supported not only by the popular and charismatic Rosebery but also by an array of well-dressed women including Lady Rosebery and Gladstone's daughter Mary. These fashionable people – the celebrities of their day (newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the doings of the upper classes) – were as much a crowd-puller as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were fainting: 70,000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6,500. Lady Rosebery reported, ""I had never heard Archie (Lord Rosebery) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute I felt I could never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection"." [sic] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the dutifully supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how ""They (the crowds) patted me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive."" Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time (the caretaker liberal leader <a href="Spencer%20Compton%20Cavendish%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Lord Hartington</a> retired in favour of Gladstone). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political electioneering asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it ""she had cut her spurs.""

Her political mettle and ambitions for her husband were however to be more severely tested following the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> victory. Rosebery was, as expected, offered a position in Government by Gladstone. It had been rumoured that the position of <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Viceroy of Ireland</a> or a cabinet place would be proffered, but it turned out to be the job of Under Secretary of the <a href="India%20Office">India Office</a>. Rosebery immediately declined the post, giving as his reason that it would appear that he was being repaid for running Gladstone's campaign (as though the Viceregal position would not). When pressed further he cited ill health—he had been suffering from <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a> during the Midlothian campaign and now also appeared to be suffering a minor nervous breakdown. Political leaders urged Lady Rosebery to influence him, but she defended his decision, while stressing that his deterioration in health was only temporary. She had to be careful—if it appeared her husband had declined the offer on the grounds that it was too lowly, it would give substance to the claims being made that he was conceited and petulant. Whatever the truth, and it may be Rosebery's own explanation that he ""disliked hard work,"" Lady Rosebery continued to solicit Gladstone for a job for Rosebery within the cabinet. In August 1880, when Gladstone told her firmly that ""There is nothing I can give him"," she claimed she had not been seeking a cabinet post and Gladstone had misunderstood her. At the same time she was canny enough to mention that Sir <a href="William%20Vernon%20Harcourt%20%28politician%29">William Harcourt</a> and Sir <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Dilke%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Charles Dilke</a>, both radicals opposed to Gladstone's policies, were ""visiting them"" and ""thoughtful"." Lady Rosebery also began to befriend those politicians such as <a href="Thomas%20Baring%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northbrook">Lord Northbrook</a> who empathised with her husband, while others such as <a href="Granville%20Leveson-Gower%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Granville</a> and <a href="Spencer%20Cavendish%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Lord Hartington</a> she identified as aloof. She dismissed <a href="John%20Spencer%2C%205th%20Earl%20Spencer">Lord Spencer</a> with ""I can never look on him as a great motive power, besides he does not mention Archie" [Rosebery] "to me"." This was the same Lord Spencer who had advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against visiting the homes of wealthy Jews.

Finally her soliciting paid off and in 1881, Rosebery was offered a government position acceptable to him, that of Under Secretary at the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> with special responsibility for <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. He had sought the position feeling that Scotland was neglected by the Liberal Government who were more interested in Ireland. However, immediately upon assuming the job he began to demand a place in the cabinet. The office he sought was that of <a href="Lord%20Privy%20Seal">Lord Privy Seal</a>, a position Gladstone refused on account of Rosebery's inexperience in Government. It appeared that Rosebery was showing his true colours and he was accused of behaving like a spoilt child, with doubts cast over the honourableness of his reasons for refusing the Under Secretaryship of the India Office. Lady Rosebery, ""conscious of her husband's supreme ability"," wanted him in the cabinet and was furiously agitating her husband's discontent until Rosebery threatened to resign his Home Office position. Lady Rosebery had an angry row with Gladstone's wife, where Mrs Gladstone pointed out that if Rosebery resigned he would have nothing but horse racing to interest him, and that Lady Rosebery should be patient as her husband was young. Rosebery, accepting that a cabinet place was not going to be forthcoming, resigned from Government. Lady Rosebery, realising further appeal to the Gladstones was pointless, tried a new avenue—<a href="Spencer%20Cavendish%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Lord Hartington</a>, the immensely influential <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>, who was already quarrelling with Gladstone over the <a href="Irish%20home%20rule">Irish home rule</a> problem, and whom she allegedly met by chance at <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a> Railway Station. Inviting him into her carriage for the journey to London, she pleaded her husband's case for three hours to her captive listener. The Roseberys then immediately left England and their children for a long trip to America and Australia. On their return in 1885 Rosebery was appointed Lord Privy Seal, complete with the seat in the cabinet which he sought.

Gladstone resigned as Prime Minister in 1885 following a Government defeat over the Irish home rule question. The new Tory government was led by <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>. However, as a minority administration it was not expected to last, and a swift return of the former administration was anticipated. During this period serious (if unproven) charges of plotting and ruthless ambition were about to be levelled against Lady Rosebery. Sir Charles Dilke, considered as a likely replacement for Gladstone, and thus a rival to Rosebery in government, was implicated in one of the most scandalous and ruinous divorce cases of the era. Involvement in any divorce was social suicide in the 19th century, but the facts which emerged were enough to ensure it was political suicide as well. A friend of the Roseberys, <a href="Donald%20Crawford">Donald Crawford</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a>, sued his wife Virginia for divorce naming Dilke as <a href="co-respondent">co-respondent</a>. There was little evidence and Dilke denied the charge, which could have been ultimately forgotten, if Virginia had not suddenly decided to sign a confession giving such lurid details that a great scandal was unavoidable. She claimed that not only had Dilke slept with her and taught her "French vices", but also slept with her mother and partaken in a three-in-a-bed orgy with Virginia and a maid. Dilke denied everything, but his hopes of high political office were ruined forever. Dilke claimed the whole thing was an embroidery of lies and conspiracies by his political enemies. Rumours began to circulate that the Roseberys, and Lady Rosebery in particular, were at the bottom of Dilke's misfortune. In his futile quest to exonerate himself, and grasping at rumour, Dilke wrote to Rosebery accusing Lady Rosebery of having paid Virginia to make the confession. An outraged Rosebery denied all on his wife's behalf, while in December 1885 Lady Rosebery's only response on being told of Virginia Crawford's confessions was: ""Dilke's behaviour is very astonishing in some reports, though it is not an actual surprise to me"." Early the following year Gladstone was returned to power and Rosebery was appointed <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> in Gladstone's third but brief term of office. Dilke's political career was ruined, and for years afterwards he continued to expound the Rosebery conspiracy theory. Nothing was ever proven against Lady Rosebery and no tangible evidence exists to substantiate the claim.

The impartiality demanded by Rosebery's new office forced him to sell many of his business interests, which had come by the way of the Rothschild family, to be seen to be avoiding a conflict of interest. However, his wife's ambition and part in his rise to power was not only being recognised in high places, but clearly starting to irritate. On being told that Lady Rosebery was very keen for her husband to become Foreign Secretary, Gladstone replied ""She would think herself capable of being Queen of the Realm and think the place only just good enough for her"." Rosebery was now on the path to political greatness, but Gladstone's government fell the same year. Lady Rosebery was not to see her husband achieve the highest political office.

Like many other women of her class and era, Lady Rosebery patronised a great number of charities. Upon her inheriting her fortune, one of her first acts was to found a lifeboat station in memory of her father, in 1875, at a cost of £2,000. However, her chief causes appear to have all been connected specifically to the assistance and welfare of women. She was president of the <a href="Scottish%20Home%20Industries%20Association">Scottish Home Industries Association</a>, a charity which encouraged Scottish women to work profitably from home making <a href="plaid%20%28pattern%29">plaid</a> or other items of <a href="needlework">needlework</a> and the like. In this way women, especially widowed mothers, remained in their homes able to care for their often large families while still earning an income.

Queen Victoria appointed her president of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Nursing%20Institute">Queen Victoria Jubilee Institute for Nurses</a> in Scotland, the beginning of the <a href="district%20nurse">district nurse</a> system, which was to revolutionise health care for the rural poor and sick in Britain. She was also interested in general improvements in standards of nursing.

Like many of her Rothschild relatives she was also deeply involved with the welfare of young working-class women of the Jewish faith who inhabited the poorer areas of London, in particular <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a>. There she founded the <a href="Club%20for%20Jewish%20Working%20Girls">Club for Jewish Working Girls</a>. She also donated to numerous other charities connected with Jewish causes. However, within a week of her death her husband began to cancel many of these subscriptions, prompting charges of antisemitism.

Her interest in education has been one of her most obvious surviving charitable legacies. She founded schools in all the villages surrounding the Roseberys' estates. The Mentmore estate alone was serviced by three schools founded by her at Wingrave, Cheddington and Mentmore itself. Not only were the children educated at her expense by trained teachers, each was also provided with seasonal gifts of new clothes. Cheddington School remains in its original building with her <a href="Monogram">cypher</a> on its walls, while Wingrave School, which opened in 1877, survives in new premises.

One of her more pioneering and innovative charitable causes was the <a href="Manualism%20and%20oralism">oral instruction</a> of what were then called the <a href="Deaf-mute">deaf and dumb</a>.

Lady Rosebery died of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> at <a href="Dalmeny">Dalmeny</a> in 1890. She fought the disease, but it was found that she was also suffering from <a href="Bright%27s%20disease">Bright's disease</a>, which had weakened her, making it impossible to survive the attack. She was buried in accordance with the rites of the Jewish faith. Rosebery found this particularly hard to bear, and wrote to Queen Victoria of the pain he experienced when ""another creed steps in to claim the corpse."" It was only after her death that the doctors who had treated her disclosed to Rosebery that her kidney condition would have killed her within two years even if she had not contracted typhoid.

Her funeral was held on 25 November 1890 at <a href="Willesden%20Jewish%20Cemetery">Willesden Jewish Cemetery</a>. As is the Jewish tradition, the service was attended only by male mourners, who included most members of Gladstone's <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">cabinet</a>.

There is no evidence that Lady Rosebery drove her husband to follow her own political agenda, or that of her family. For her the rewards seem to have been the pleasure of seeing a husband she undoubtedly adored in the high office of which she felt him worthy. There is no doubt that she tempered her husband's more radical views. Immediately following his wife's death Rosebery retired from politics, writing in October 1891 ""The sole object of my ambition has disappeared with the death of my wife."" Proof of the widespread belief in society that Lady Rosebery was the stable element of the partnership was confirmed shortly after her death, by Queen Victoria, following a then rare public speech by Rosebery, in which he supported Home Rule for Ireland. The Queen was shocked and thought the speech ""almost communistic"" and went on to attribute Rosebery's ""shocking and disappointing"" behaviour to the fact that ""poor Lady Rosebery is not there to keep him back."" While Queen Victoria always personally liked Rosebery, she mistrusted his politics. The Queen had thoroughly liked Lady Rosebery and wrote Rosebery several letters of condolence, likening his loss to the untimely death of her own consort, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>. It seems that the Queen's antipathy to Jews was confined to elevating them to the peerage. This view had softened by 1885. In 1890 she accepted a luncheon invitation from Lady Rosebery's cousin <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a> and toured <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a> albeit eating in a separate dining room to the Jewish members of the party.

Shortly after his wife's death, Rosebery left his grieving children and went alone on a tour of Spain. Following a visit to <a href="El%20Escorial">El Escorial</a> he wrote on the sepulchral wonders of the building, but added ""for the dead alone the <a href="Taj%20Mahal">Taj</a> is of course supreme"." On his return home he had designed for his wife a <a href="Victorian%20Gothic">Victorian Gothic</a> version of the Taj Mahal in miniature. For the remainder of his life he wore black and used black edged writing paper. Once, when talking with his daughter Sybil, he asked her what mourning she thought her mother would have worn had the situation been reversed. Sybil replied, ""She would not have worn any, she would have died at once.""

<a href="Ronald%20Munro%20Ferguson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Novar">Ronald Munro Ferguson</a> has been quoted in 1912 as saying ""many things would have gone otherwise had Lady Rosebery lived. Her loss is today as great a calamity from every point of view as it was at the time of her death"."

Widowhood changed Rosebery, both mentally and physically: he aged overnight, and began to refer to himself as an old man. Two years after her death, friends were still concerned that he was <a href="suicide">suicidal</a>. <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> thought him maimed by her death, and later said of her ""she was a remarkable woman on whom Rosebery leaned, she was ever a pacifying and composing element in his life which he was never able to find again because he could never give full confidence to anyone else.""

Sir <a href="Edward%20Walter%20Hamilton">Edward Hamilton</a>, Rosebery's closest friend, wrote:

Her qualities were portrayed in literature when Lady Rosebery was reputed to be the model for Marcella Maxwell in <a href="Mary%20Augusta%20Ward">Mrs Humphry Ward's</a> novels "Marcella" (1894) and "Sir George Tressady" (1909). The author lived at <a href="Stocks%20House">Stocks</a> close to Lady Rosebery's home at Mentmore and would certainly have known her, while in the books Marcella's house is based on <a href="Hampden%20House">Hampden House</a>, also in Buckinghamshire.

The Liberals did not return to office until 1892. Lord Rosebery was eventually persuaded to enter government, becoming once again Foreign Secretary serving under Gladstone as Prime Minister. In 1894 on Gladstone's retirement he achieved his wife's ambitions and became Prime Minister, but by then Lady Rosebery was dead. Without her, Rosebery was a shadow of his former self, taking huge doses of morphine to combat insomnia and nerves. His Prime Ministership lasted barely a year, marred by problems and difficulties. For the remainder of his life and without his wife, as Queen Victoria phrased it, ""to hold him back"", he became more and more eccentric and controversial in his decisions. His final years were blighted by ill health and a self-enforced seclusion in Scotland. He died in 1929.

Before their marriage and his full-time entry into politics, Rosebery's future wife had written with extraordinary foresight and ambition to him: ""I work only to help you, if you are Prime Minister, let me imitate <a href="Montagu%20Corry%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rowton">Montagu Corry</a>."" Corry had been Disraeli's influential private secretary on whom he had relied. Rosebery only ever trusted his wife. Without her to calm and order his life he was a neurotic wreck.

Lady Rosebery's eldest son, <a href="Harry%20Primrose%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Harry</a>, who was less successful in politics than his father and brother, distinguished himself by becoming captain of <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey County Cricket Club</a> and owning two Epsom Derby-winning horses. He succeeded his father as 6th Earl of Rosebery and died in 1974. Margaret married her father's old friend and biographer the <a href="Robert%20Crewe-Milnes%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Crewe">Marquess of Crewe</a>. Such was still the fame of her parents that London traffic was brought to a standstill on her wedding day in 1899. Lady Crewe became one of the first women <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>s in Britain; she died in 1955. Lady <a href="Sybil%20Grant">Sybil</a> has been summarised by one of her father's biographers: ""Even more eccentric than her father, she spent much of her time living in a caravan."" <a href="Neil%20James%20Archibald%20Primrose">Neil</a>, the second of the Roseberys' sons, entered politics and a promising future was foretold for him. However, on the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> he joined the army, and was killed leading a charge at <a href="Gezer">Gezer</a> in 1917.

Of Hannah Rosebery's homes, the lease on Lansdowne House was surrendered shortly before her death, when the Roseberys purchased 38 Berkeley Square. This property was transformed into one of London's most luxurious town houses. However, Lady Rosebery did not live to see the work completed. Her son Harry sold the house in 1938, and it was demolished. A year later a bomb landed on the empty site during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Durdans was bequeathed to her daughter, Sybil, in 1929 and was sold together with its contents in 1955. Lord and Lady Rosebery's library there was given to the nation at this time. Mentmore, the grandest of the Roseberys' homes, was sold by Lady Rosebery's grandson, the 7th Earl of Rosebery, in 1977, together with the Rothschild art collection, which Lady Rosebery had not only been intensely interested in but had enlarged considerably. She personally catalogued the collection, and prophetically wrote in the preface ""In time to come, when, like all collections, this will be dispersed (and I hope this will be long after my death) this book may be of value."" Her two-volume work and the collection it described remained so unknown that "" (a group attempting to halt the sale of Mentmore to keep the collection within Britain) failed largely due to widespread public ignorance of both house and collection. A few pieces of furniture and paintings were taken to Dalmeny, (the only house to remain in the family) where they are displayed today, and three pictures including <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Hubert%20Drouais">Drouais</a>' "<a href="Madame%20de%20Pompadour">Madame de Pompadour</a>" were purchased for the <a href="National%20Gallery%20%28London%29">National Gallery</a>. The remainder of the collection was dispersed in a week-long sale and is now scattered across the globe. A further sale of the "Continental Library," to which she had added, was conducted in 1995 at the <a href="Aeolian%20Hall%20%28London%29">Aeolian Hall</a>, London by <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a>. In June 2011, <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> auctioned a set of pearl and diamond jewels (a tiara, brooch and bracelet) that were originally in Lady Rosebery's ownership.

Today, Hannah, Countess of Rosebery is only referred to in biographies of her husband or better known Rothschild relations; no published biography of her has been written. Her husband, once one of the ""most celebrated figures in Britain,"" is now regarded as one of Britain's less successful Prime-Ministers. Thus Hannah, Countess of Rosebery, in her day celebrated in the worlds of politics, philanthropy, and high society, has become a historical footnote to her husband's better documented career.

Tokyo Mew Mew

The series was adapted into a 52 episode <a href="anime">anime</a> series by <a href="Studio%20Pierrot">Studio Pierrot</a>. It debuted in Japan on April 6, 2002, on both <a href="Aichi%20Television%20Broadcasting">TV Aichi</a> and <a href="TV%20Tokyo">TV Tokyo</a>; the final episode aired on March 29, 2003. A two-volume sequel to the manga, "Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode", was serialized in "Nakayoshi" from April 2003 to February 2004. The sequel introduces a new Mew Mew, Berry Shirayuki (meaning "White Snow Berry"), who becomes the temporary leader of the Mew Mews, while Ichigo (meaning "Strawberry") is on a trip to England. Two video games were also created for the series: a <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle</a> <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> system and a <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>.

<a href="Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a> originally licensed the manga series for English-language publication in North America and released the complete original series as well as the sequel, with <a href="Kodansha%20Comics">Kodansha Comics</a> planning to re-publish the series with a new translation in September 2011. <a href="4Licensing%20Corporation">4Kids Entertainment</a> licensed the anime series for North American broadcast under the name Mew Mew Power. Heavily <a href="editing%20of%20anime%20in%20American%20distribution">edited</a> and <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dubbed</a>, 23 episodes of "Mew Mew Power" aired on and <a href="4Kids%20TV">4Kids TV</a> in the United States and the entire 26 episodes aired on <a href="YTV%20%28TV%20channel%29">YTV</a> in Canada. 4Kids Entertainment was unable to license the remaining 26 episodes of the series, thus were unable to complete its broadcast. They have never released the series to home video.

Well received by English-language readers, several volumes of the manga series appeared in the Top 50 sales lists for graphic novels in their respective months of release. Critics praised the manga as a cute and entertaining series with free-flowing style and character designs. "à la mode" received praise as a good continuation of the series, but was also criticized for offering nothing new. The anime adaptation received high ratings while airing in Japan, resulting in numerous marketing tie-ins. Despite criticism for extensive editing that removed most of the Japanese elements, the "Mew Mew Power" dub became the highest rated 4Kids show during its broadcast. It was licensed for regional release in several other countries instead of the original Japanese series.

In <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, a young girl named <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Ichigo%20Momomiya">Ichigo Momomiya</a> attends an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> exhibit with her "<a href="Puppy%20love">crush</a>" <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Masaya%20Aoyama">Masaya Aoyama</a>. After an earthquake, Ichigo and four other girls are bathed in a strange light. A cat appears before Ichigo, then merges with her. The next day, she begins acting like a cat and making cat puns. After meeting <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Ry%C3%B4%20Shirogane">Ryô Shirogane</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Keiichir%C3%B4%20Akasaka">Keiichirô Akasaka</a>, Ichigo learns that she was infused with the DNA of the <a href="Iriomote%20cat">Iriomote cat</a>. Ryou and Keiichirou explain that this allows her to transform into Mew Ichigo, a powerful heroic <a href="catgirl">cat girl</a>. She is ordered to defeat Chimera Animas—alien parasites which infect animals and turn them into monsters. Ryou and Keiichirou instruct Ichigo to find the four other girls from the exhibit—the remaining Mew Mews.

The first Mew Mew Ichigo encounters is <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Minto%20Aizawa">Minto Aizawa</a>, a spoiled, wealthy girl and ballerina who is infused with the genes of the <a href="blue%20lorikeet">blue lorikeet</a>; <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Retasu%20Midorikawa">Retasu Midorikawa</a>, a shy but smart girl who endures constant bullying from three girls and absorbs the genes of the <a href="finless%20porpoise">finless porpoise</a>; a hyper and yet young girl named <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Bu-Ling%20Huang">Bu-Ling Huang</a> who receives the genes of the <a href="golden%20lion%20tamarin">golden lion tamarin</a>; and <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Zakuro%20Fujiwara">Zakuro Fujiwara</a>, a professional actress and model infused with the genes of the <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolf</a>.

The five Mew Mews battle the Chimera Animas and their alien controllers <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Quiche">Quiche</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Pie">Pie</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Tart">Tart</a>. Quiche falls in love with Ichigo where he tries to gain her love despite the fact that he is trying to eliminate the other Mew Mews. Pie and Tart later join Quiche in trying to destroy the Mew Mews.

As the fighting intensifies, the Mew Mews are tasked with finding "Mew Aqua", a material created from pure water that contains immense power for combating the alien attacks and can be sensed by the Mew Mews. During a battle with Quiche at an aquarium, Ichigo is in danger of losing when the mysterious <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Blue%20Knight">Blue Knight</a> appears and rescues her. He returns periodically throughout the series, protecting Ichigo from various dangers. It is later revealed that the Blue Knight is in fact Masaya. Shortly after this discovery, Masaya collapses and transforms again. This time, he transforms into Deep Blue, the alien leader who wants to destroy humanity. After explaining to Ichigo that Masaya was a false form for temporary use, Deep Blue attacks the Mew Mews. Pie and Tart try to stop the other mew mews while Ichigo goes after Deep Blue. He and Quiche battle and Deep Blue wins. 
Masaya's personality briefly reappears and he uses the Mew Aqua inside Deep Blue to save Ichigo and tokyo, killing himself in the process. Crying over his body, Ichigo pours her power into Masaya to save his life, losing her own in the process. Masaya kisses her, changing her back to a human and revives her. Ryou gives Pie the remaining Mew Aqua to save the aliens' world, after which Quiche, Pie, and Tart say their goodbyes and return to their own world.

In the two-volume sequel "Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode", Ichigo and Masaya move to England to study endangered species. The remaining Mew Mews continue to eliminate the Chimera Animas left behind by the aliens. They face a new threat in the form of the <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Saint%20Rose%20Crusaders">Saint Rose Crusaders</a>: humans with special powers who desire to conquer the world and create a <a href="utopia">utopia</a> while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas. <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Berry%20Shirayuki">Berry Shirayuki</a> becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo's place as the leader. Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a>, the <a href="Andean%20mountain%20cat">Andean mountain cat</a> and the <a href="Amami%20rabbit">Amami rabbit</a>. As one of the strongest Mew Mews, Berry is targeted by two of the Crusaders, who attack her at school. Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle. For their final attack, two Crusaders <a href="hypnosis">hypnotize</a> the citizens of Tokyo and set them against the Mew Mews. Berry and her childhood friend <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Tasuku%20Meguro">Tasuku Meguro</a> use their new-found feelings of love to reverse the hypnosis and cause a change of heart in the Crusaders.

<a href="Mia%20Ikumi">Mia Ikumi</a> spent a year designing the "Tokyo Mew Mew" <a href="manga">manga</a> before the release of the first volume in February 2001. The story she originally presented to her editors, "Tokyo Black Cat Girl", featured a heroine named Hime Azumi. An intergalactic police officer named Masha gave her the ability to transform into a cat-girl and asked her to aid him in defeating alien invaders called the Bugs. After the production team decided to focus on five female superheroes, Ikumi was asked to reconstruct the lead character. She had reservations about the changes, as the character was originally designed for a more dramatic series.

As "Tokyo Mew Mew" became a viable project, Kodansha hired <a href="Reiko%20Yoshida">Reiko Yoshida</a> to be the series' scenario writer and story supervisor. Yoshida and two other editors determined each volume's plot, created a scenario by adding <a href="Stage%20%28theatre%29%23Stage%20directions">stage directions</a> and dialogue, and presented it to Ikumi. Ikumi added her own ideas and changes, creating the <a href="manuscript">manuscript's</a> first draft, which was taken to the publishers for final review and approval. This differs from most manga series, in which the manga writer also creates the scenarios and stories before submitting to their editor for approval.

After the first volume's release, a two-day "Tokyo Mew Mew" festival was held during the <a href="Golden%20Week%20%28Japan%29">Golden Week holiday</a>—a week-long span in late April and early May during which four public holidays occur—to promote the series. Events included a "Tokyo Mew Mew" art gallery and the release of new merchandise. Ikumi, the series' artist, created a special poster for the event, featuring all twelve characters. She also <a href="cosplay">cosplay</a>ed as characters from the series, as <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Minto%20Aizawa">Minto Aizawa</a> on one day and <a href="List%20of%20Tokyo%20Mew%20Mew%20characters%23Retasu%20Midorikawa">Retasu Midorikawa</a> on the other.

Written by <a href="Reiko%20Yoshida">Reiko Yoshida</a> and illustrated by <a href="Mia%20Ikumi">Mia Ikumi</a>, "Tokyo Mew Mew" was first serialized in "<a href="Nakayoshi">Nakayoshi</a>" magazine between September 2000 and February 2003. The twenty-nine chapters were then compiled into seven "<a href="tank%C5%8Dbon">tankōbon</a>" volumes by <a href="Kodansha">Kodansha</a>. The first volume was released on February 1, 2001, with the final volume released April 4, 2003. In April 2003, a sequel called "Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode" premiered in "Nakayoshi". Running until February 2004 and written solely by Mia Ikumi, the sequel was published as two volumes.

"Tokyo Mew Mew" and "Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode" are licensed for an English-language release in North America by <a href="Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a>. The first volume of the main series was released on June 1, 2004, with volumes released subsequently until the seventh volume was published on December 15, 2005. The two volumes of "Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode" were released on June 7 and September 13, 2005, respectively. Unlike the Japanese releases, each Tokyopop chapter is named. The main series is licensed for an English language release in Singapore by <a href="Chuang%20Yi">Chuang Yi</a>. <a href="Carlsen%20Verlag">Carlsen Comics</a> has licensed the series, through its regional divisions, and released the series in German, Danish and Swedish. The series is also licensed for regional language releases in French by <a href="Pika%20%C3%89dition">Pika Édition</a>, in Polish by <a href="Japonica%20Polonica%20Fantastica">Japonica Polonica Fantastica</a>, and in Finnish by <a href="Sangatsu%20Manga">Sangatsu Manga</a>. "Tokyo Mew Mew" was one of the first manga series released in Spanish in North America by Public Square Books. <a href="Kodansha%20Comics">Kodansha Comics</a> released an omnibus version of the series, featuring a new translation in September 2011.

<a href="Pierrot%20%28company%29">Pierrot</a>, Tokyu Agency and AEON adapted "Tokyo Mew Mew" into a fifty-two episode anime series, directed by Noriyuki Abe. Broadcast on both <a href="Aichi%20Television%20Broadcasting">TV Aichi</a> and <a href="TV%20Tokyo">TV Tokyo</a>, the series premiered on April 6, 2002, and aired weekly until its conclusion on March 29, 2003. Most of the music for the series was produced by Shin Yoshimura and composed by <a href="Takayuki%20Negishi">Takayuki Negishi</a>. Two pieces of theme music were also used for the anime series. "My Sweet Heart", performed by <a href="Rika%20Komatsu">Rika Komatsu</a>, was the series opening theme. The ending theme "Koi wa A La Mode" is performed by the five <a href="seiy%C5%AB">voice actors</a> who play the Mew Mews. In Japan, the series was released across nine <a href="DVD%20region%20code%232">Region 2</a> <a href="DVD">DVD</a> volumes. The ninth volume included a bonus DVD containing extra content. At some point during the TV broadcast, AEON changed its name to We've.

"Tokyo Mew Mew" was later licensed for an English-language dubbed release by <a href="4Kids%20Entertainment">4Kids Entertainment</a>. In its announcement about the series, 4Kids originally noted that the show would be renamed to "Hollywood Mew Mew" and that they would be heavily editing and localizing episodes so that viewers would not recognize its Japanese origins. Subsequent 4Kids press releases about the series referred to the new series as "The Mew Mews" and its original name "Tokyo Mew Mew". When the series premiered on <a href="4Kids%20TV">4Kids TV</a> on February 19, 2005, it aired under the name as "Mew Mew Power". Characters and episodes were renamed, scenes were cut and storylines were modified. The music was replaced with a new score and the opening theme was replaced with the song "Team Up", performed by <a href="Bree%20Sharp">Bree Sharp</a> and Mollie Weaver. Twenty-six episodes of "Mew Mew Power" aired on <a href="4Licensing%20Corporation">4Kids Entertainment</a> in the United States because 4Kids was unable to get a merchandising deal for the series and the English dub had stopped production. The 4Kids episodes aired on <a href="YTV%20%28TV%20channel%29">YTV</a> in Canada and on the <a href="Pop%20Girl">Pop Girl</a> <a href="satellite">satellite</a> <a href="television%20channel">television channel</a> in the United Kingdom; these included three dubbed episodes not broadcast in the United States.

Although "Mew Mew Power" has not been released to <a href="home%20video">home video</a> in North America, ten of the 4Kids episodes have been released to <a href="DVD%20region%20code%234">Region 4</a> DVD in Australia and New Zealand by <a href="Magna%20Pacific">Magna Pacific</a> and all twenty-six 4Kids episodes were released to <a href="DVD%20region%20code%232">Region 2</a> DVD in South Africa. "Mew Mew Power" was licensed for regional airing in French by Arès Films, which released nine dubbed 4Kids episodes to DVD in February 2006 as a single volume through Warner Home Vidéo France. The French dub aired on <a href="Teletoon">Teletoon</a> as part of their Code F block. The company also licensed the remaining twenty-six episodes of the series that 4Kids had not obtained, releasing them in two DVD box sets through AK Vidéo.

The series also aired in Hungary under the name of "Vadmacska Kommandó."

Two video games based on the "Tokyo Mew Mew" series were launched in 2002 by <a href="Takara">Takara</a>. The first, , a <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle</a> <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, was released in Japan on July 11, 2002.

The second title, , was released in Japan on December 5, 2002. It is a <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> <a href="Turn-based%20game">turn-based</a> role-playing video game in which the player controls a new Mew Mew, , as well as the original five heroines. They must defend Ringo's island from Quiche, the Chimera Animas and a new alien named . Both Ringo Akai and Gateau were created by the manga's artist, Mia Ikumi, following design specifications from Takara. The game uses voice actors from the anime series, with the two new characters voiced by <a href="Taeko%20Kawata">Taeko Kawata</a> and <a href="Ry%C5%8Dtar%C5%8D%20Okiayu">Ryōtarō Okiayu</a>, respectively. Ikumi was pleased with how both characters turned out and expressed a desire to use Ringo as a regular character in a future manga series. Ringo later joined the other Mew Mews in the "Petite Mew Mew" bonus story in the second volume of "Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode".

Multiple music and character <a href="Compact%20Disc">CDs</a> have been released for the "Tokyo Mew Mew series" by <a href="King%20Records%20%28Japan%29">King Records</a>. The first, a CD single, contained the full and <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> versions of "Koi wa A La Mode", performed by the five <a href="seiy%C5%AB">voice actors</a> who played the Mew Mews, and a second song performed by <a href="Saki%20Nakajima%20%28voice%20actress%29">Saki Nakajima</a>, who voices Ichigo.

On July 24, 2002, a five-disc <a href="Special%20edition%23Limited%20edition%20prints">limited edition</a> collector's box set was released containing character songs for each of the Mew Mews, performed by their respective voice actors and a <a href="remix">remix</a> of "Koi wa A La Mode." The individual character song discs were released as standalone CDs on September 4, 2002. An additional character CD set, containing remixed versions of two songs from each individual album, followed on December 25, 2002. A second character CD for Ichigo, containing five new tracks performed by Nakajima, was released on February 26, 2003.

The first full anime soundtrack, "Tokyo Mew Mew Original Soundtrack" was released on September 25, 2002, by <a href="NEC">NEC</a>. The CD included the series opening and ending themes and twenty-seven pieces of series background music. NEC released a second <a href="soundtrack">soundtrack</a> on January 22, 2003; it contains the opening and closing themes, along with an additional twenty-nine tracks of background music. On March 26, 2003, two "best of" CDs were released for the anime series: "Tokyo Mew Mew Super Best Hit – Cafe Mew Mew side" and "Tokyo Mew Mew Super Best Hit – Tokyo Mew Mew side". Each CD includes ten of the series' "most popular" musical pieces.

The "Tokyo Mew Mew" manga series was well received by English-speaking audiences. In March and April 2003, the first volume sold an estimated 1,597 and 1,746 copies respectively. This put the volume at the low end of the top 50 sales for each month. By 2004, with most of the series released, it became a mild success for licensor Tokyopop. It was ranked number 16 on the list of Manga Top 50 for the first quarter of 2004 in the "ICv2 Retailers Guide to Anime/Manga", based on sales from both mainstream bookstores and <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> shops. Sales of the sixth and seventh volumes dropped slightly; however, both were among the top 100 best-selling graphic novels in March and May 2004. The first volume of "Tokyo Mew Mew à la Mode" debuted 63rd on the list of top 100 best-selling graphic novels of May 2005, with nearly double the sales figures of the last volume of the main series. On the Nielsen Bookscan charts, the volume debuted at rank 39 before quickly climbing to the 14th spot. The second volume of "à la Mode" saw similar success, debuting in the 69th slot before advancing to the 12th position, a result of the "Mew Mew Power" show appearing on <a href="4Kids%20TV">4Kids TV</a>.

"Tokyo Mew Mew" was generally well received by reviewers, who described it as cute and entertaining. Though "AnimeFringe" Patrick King notes that it is not a very intellectual series and that it avoids complex plot points, he lauded it as engrossing "brain candy" and an "endearing action-romance" that has no "delusions of grandeur". Critics praised the artwork in both "Tokyo Mew Mew" and the sequel "Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode". Ikumi's "free flowing" style and character designs were seen as a perfect fit for the series. Criticism of Ikumi's art focused on images which regularly spilled out of panel borders and speech bubbles with ambiguous speakers. Patrick King of "Animefringe" stated: "one of the most attractive aspects of Tokyo Mew Mew is easily Mia Ikumi's ultra-cute artwork. Big eyes, cat ears, fuzzy tails, and short skirts all come together in a cuteness combo that's hard to resist." According to Carlo Santos of "<a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a>", "Mia Ikumi's artwork is perfectly suited to the story, and it is not even all that wispy and frilly compared to other "shōjo" material. Like many budding manga artist, Ikumi's greatest strength is in carefully posed character portraits, and her prolific use of tones creates unique effects while also sidestepping the challenge of backgrounds." Conversely, in writing for "", <a href="Shaenon%20Garrity">Shaenon Garrity</a> criticizes the series, calling it "uninspired", "insipid" and "creative[ly] bankrupt" and feeling it was "clearly designed by its publisher to ride the magical girl tsunami for all it was worth: the creators' marginal notes are filled with references to big book signings, photo shoots, and models hired to dress as the scantily clad preteen heroines." She also remarks that the series makes poor use of its endangered species theme, while still having a "preachy environmental theme".

Over all "Tokyo Mew Mew à La Mode" had more mixed reviews. Critics praised it for being a modern manga that typifies the <a href="magical%20girl">magical girl</a> formula, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses. Mike Dungan, of Mania Entertainment, considered the original series to be "quite charming" and felt that "à la Mode" was a good continuation of the series with the "same fun and excitement" as its predecessor. Others felt Berry was an overly shallow heroine and that the sequel offered nothing new for readers with the Saint Rose Crusaders' costumes and plans being nothing more than concepts borrowed from "Sailor Moon". Janet Crocker, Shannon Fay and Chris Istel of "Animefringe" criticized "à la Mode" for having the character Duke, the main villain of the arc, dressed in a white robe similar to those used by the white supremacy group, the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Garrity felt "à La Mode" was a vehicle for referencing "Tokyo Mew Mew" fandom and merchandise and that Berry was a "transparent wish-fulfillment protagonist".

The anime adaptation has been compared to "<a href="Sailor%20Moon">Sailor Moon</a>" due to both having female protagonists, five original team members with signature colors and powers, and similar plot lines, as have many magical girl series. "Tokyo Mew Mew" received high ratings in Japan with extensive merchandizing tie ins and marketing events to promote the series. When 4Kids announced their licensing of the anime, heavily edited and localized, fans of the series were openly dismayed and began multiple campaigns to convince the company to release an uncut version of the series. After previews of the retooled series were released, viewers were less disappointed, but still annoyed by the cultural shifting and still desired an uncut <a href="DVD">DVD</a> release. "Mew Mew Power" became a successful broadcast series for 4Kids, becoming the highest rated 4Kids show at the start of the fall 2005 season, but it was never released to DVD in North America. The 4Kids dub, rather than original Japanese version, was subsequently licensed for broadcast in France, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Greece, South Africa and Israel.

Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649 (1898), is a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case in which the Court ruled that "a child born in the United States, of parents of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China", automatically became a <a href="Citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">U.S. citizen</a> at birth. This decision established an important <a href="Stare%20decisis">precedent</a> in its interpretation of the <a href="Citizenship%20Clause">Citizenship Clause</a> of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution</a>.

Wong Kim Ark, who was born in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> in 1873, had been denied re-entry to the United States after a trip abroad, under <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">a law restricting Chinese immigration</a> and prohibiting immigrants from <a href="Qing%20dynasty">China</a> from becoming <a href="naturalized">naturalized</a> U.S. citizens. He challenged the government's refusal to recognize his citizenship, and the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, holding that the citizenship language in the Fourteenth Amendment encompassed the circumstances of his birth and could not be limited in its effect by an act of <a href="Congress%20%28United%20States%29">Congress</a>.

The case highlighted disagreements over the precise meaning of one phrase in the Citizenship Clause—namely, the provision that a person born in the United States who is "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" acquires automatic citizenship. The Supreme Court's majority concluded that this phrase referred to being required to obey U.S. law; on this basis, they interpreted the language of the Fourteenth Amendment in a way that granted U.S. citizenship to children born of foreigners (a concept known as "<a href="jus%20soli">jus soli</a>"), with only a limited set of exceptions mostly based in <a href="English%20common%20law">English common law</a>.. The court's dissenters argued that being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States meant not being subject to any foreign power—that is, not being claimed as a citizen by another country via "<a href="jus%20sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a>" (inheriting citizenship from a parent)—an interpretation which, in the minority's view, would have excluded "the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country".

In the words of a 2007 legal analysis of events following the "Wong Kim Ark" decision, "The parameters of the "jus soli" principle, as stated by the court in "Wong Kim Ark", have never been seriously questioned by the Supreme Court, and have been accepted as dogma by lower courts." A 2010 review of the history of the Citizenship Clause notes that the "Wong Kim Ark" decision held that the guarantee of <a href="birthright%20citizenship">birthright citizenship</a> "applies to children of foreigners present on American soil" and states that the Supreme Court "has not re-examined this issue since the concept of 'illegal alien' entered the language". Since the 1990s, however, controversy has arisen over the longstanding practice of granting automatic citizenship to U.S.-born children of <a href="Illegal%20immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">illegal immigrants</a>, and legal scholars disagree over whether the "Wong Kim Ark" precedent applies when alien parents are in the country illegally. Attempts have been made from time to time in Congress to restrict birthright citizenship, either via <a href="statutory">statutory</a> redefinition of the term "jurisdiction", or by overriding both the "Wong Kim Ark" ruling and the Citizenship Clause itself through an <a href="List%20of%20proposed%20amendments%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">amendment to the Constitution</a>, but no such proposal has been enacted.

United States <a href="citizenship">citizenship</a> law is founded on two traditional principles—"<a href="jus%20soli">jus soli</a>" ("right of the soil"; a "<a href="common%20law">common law</a>" doctrine), and "<a href="jus%20sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a>" ("right of the blood"; a "<a href="civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a>" doctrine). Under "jus soli", a child's citizenship would be acquired by birth within a country's territory, without reference to the political status or condition of the child's parents. Under "jus sanguinis", the citizenship of a child would not depend on his or her place of birth, but instead follow the status of a parent (specifically, the father—or, in the case of an <a href="illegitimate">illegitimate</a> birth, the mother).

Throughout the history of the United States, the dominant legal principle governing citizenship has been "jus soli"—the principle that birth within the territorial limits of the United States confers automatic citizenship, excluding <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a> before the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. Although there was no actual definition of citizenship in United States law until after the Civil War, it was generally accepted that anyone born in the United States was automatically a citizen. This applicability of "jus soli", via the common law inherited in the United States from England, was upheld in an 1844 <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> state case, "Lynch v. Clarke", in which it was held that a woman born in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, of alien parents temporarily sojourning there, was a U.S. citizen.

United States citizenship could also be acquired at birth via "jus sanguinis" (birth outside the country to a citizen parent), a right confirmed by Congress in the <a href="Naturalization%20Act%20of%201790">Naturalization Act of 1790</a>. Additionally, <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">alien immigrants to the United States</a> could acquire citizenship via a process of <a href="naturalization%23United%20States">naturalization</a>—though access to naturalization was originally limited to "free white person[s]". 

<a href="Ethnic%20groups%20of%20Africa">African</a> <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a> were originally excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> held in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>" that slaves, former slaves, and their descendants were not eligible under the Constitution to be citizens. Additionally, <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indians</a> were not originally recognized as citizens, since Indian tribes were considered to be outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.

After the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and the subsequent abolition of slavery, Congress enacted the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>. One provision of this law declared as citizens, not only the freed slaves, but "all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed".

Concerns were raised that the citizenship guarantee in the Civil Rights Act might be repealed by a later Congress or struck down as unconstitutional by the courts. Soon after the passage of the Act, Congress drafted the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution</a> and sent it to the states for ratification (a process which was completed in 1868). Among the Fourteenth Amendment's many provisions was the <a href="Citizenship%20Clause">Citizenship Clause</a>, which entrenched a guarantee of citizenship in the Constitution by stating, "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."

The Citizenship Clause was proposed by Senator <a href="Jacob%20M.%20Howard">Jacob M. Howard</a> of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> on May 30, 1866, as an amendment to the joint resolution from the House of Representatives which had framed the initial draft of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment. The heated debate on the proposed new language in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> focused on whether Howard's proposed language would apply more broadly than the wording of the 1866 Civil Rights Act.

Howard said that the clause "is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already, that every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and national law a citizen of the United States." He added that citizenship "will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons" —a comment which would later raise questions as to whether Congress had originally intended that U.S.-born children of foreign parents were to be included as citizens. Responding to concerns expressed by <a href="Edgar%20Cowan">Edgar Cowan</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> that liberalizing the right to citizenship might result in certain states being taken over by large populations of undesirable foreign immigrants, <a href="John%20Conness">John Conness</a> of California predicted that the Chinese population in California would likely remain very small, in large part because Chinese immigrants almost always eventually returned to China, and also because very few Chinese women left their homeland to come to the United States.

<a href="James%20R.%20Doolittle">James R. Doolittle</a> of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> objected that the citizenship provision would not be sufficiently narrow to exclude American Indians from citizenship, and in an attempt to address this issue, he proposed to add a phrase taken from the Civil Rights Act—"excluding Indians not taxed". Although most Senators agreed that birthright citizenship should not be extended to the Indians, a majority saw no need to clarify the issue, and Doolittle's proposal was voted down. Upon its return to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, the proposed Fourteenth Amendment received little debate; no one spoke in opposition to the Senate's addition of the Citizenship Clause, and the complete proposed amendment was approved by the House on June 13, 1866, and declared to have been ratified on July 28, 1868.

In 2006, <a href="Goodwin%20Liu">Goodwin Liu</a>, then an assistant professor at the <a href="Boalt%20Hall">Boalt Hall</a> law school of the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, and later an <a href="Associate%20Justice">Associate Justice</a> of the <a href="California%20Supreme%20Court">California Supreme Court</a>, wrote that although the legislative history of the Citizenship Clause is "somewhat thin", the clause's central role is evident in the historical context of the post-Civil War period. Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center (a <a href="Progressivism">progressive</a> <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a>), argues that both supporters and opponents of the Citizenship Clause in 1866 shared the understanding that it would automatically grant citizenship to all persons born in the United States (except children of foreign ministers and invading armies)—an interpretation shared by <a href="Texas">Texas</a> Solicitor General James C. Ho. Richard Aynes, dean of the <a href="University%20of%20Akron">University of Akron</a> School of Law, takes a different view, proposing that the Citizenship Clause had "consequences which were unintended by the framers".

Like many other immigrants, Chinese were drawn to the United States—initially to participate in the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> of 1849, then moving on to railroad construction, farming, and work in cities. An 1868 treaty (named the <a href="Burlingame%20Treaty">Burlingame Treaty</a> after one of the American negotiators) expanded trade and migration between the United States and China. The treaty did not address the citizenship of children born in the United States to Chinese parents, or vice versa. Regarding <a href="naturalization">naturalization</a> (acquisition of citizenship other than at birth), the treaty contained a provision stating that "nothing herein contained shall be held to confer naturalization ... upon the subjects of China in the United States."

Chinese immigrants to the United States were met with considerable distrust, resentment, and discrimination almost from the time of their first arrival. Many politicians argued that the Chinese were so different in so many ways that they not only would never (or even could) assimilate into American culture, but that they represented a threat to the country's principles and institutions. In this climate of popular anti-Chinese sentiment, Congress in 1882 enacted the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Act">Chinese Exclusion Act</a>, which placed limits on Chinese immigration to the United States. (The original Chinese Exclusion Act was amended several times—such as by the 1888 <a href="Scott%20Act%20%281888%29">Scott Act</a> and the 1892 <a href="Geary%20Act">Geary Act</a>—and as a result it is sometimes referred to in the plural as the "Chinese Exclusion Acts".) Chinese already in the U.S. were allowed to stay, but they were ineligible for naturalization and, if they left the U.S. and later wished to return, they needed to apply anew and obtain approval again. Chinese laborers and miners were specifically barred from coming (or returning) to the United States under the terms of the law.

After the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 and prior to the "Wong Kim Ark" case, the question of "jus soli" citizenship for children of aliens arose only with reference to <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indians</a> and Chinese. The Supreme Court ruled in an 1884 case ("<a href="Elk%20v.%20Wilkins">Elk v. Wilkins</a>") that an Indian born on a <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservation</a> did not acquire United States citizenship at birth (because he was not subject to U.S. jurisdiction) and could not claim citizenship later on merely by moving to non-reservation U.S. territory and renouncing his former tribal allegiance. American Indians were subsequently granted citizenship by <a href="Indian%20Citizenship%20Act">an act of Congress</a> in 1924.

The question of whether the Citizenship Clause applied to persons born in the United States to Chinese immigrants first came before the courts in an 1884 case, "In re Look Tin Sing". Look Tin Sing was born in <a href="Mendocino%2C%20California">Mendocino, California</a> in 1870 to Chinese immigrants. In 1879, his merchant father sent him to China; but upon returning from China in 1884 at age 14, he was barred from reentering the United States by officials who objected to his not having met the documentation requirements imposed at the time on Chinese immigrants under the Restriction Acts of 1882 or of 1884. Look's case was heard in the <a href="United%20States%20Circuit%20Court">federal circuit court</a> for California by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice <a href="Stephen%20J.%20Field">Stephen J. Field</a> and two other federal judges. Lucy Salyer, a history professor at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Hampshire">University of New Hampshire</a>, writes that Justice Field "issued an open invitation to all lawyers in the area to give their opinions on the constitutional questions involved" in the case. Field focused on the meaning of the "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" phrase of the Citizenship Clause, held that Look was indeed subject to U.S. jurisdiction at the time of his birth irrespective of the alien status of his parents, and on this basis ordered U.S. officials to recognize Look as a citizen and allow him to enter the United States. The "Look Tin Sing" ruling was not appealed and was never reviewed by the Supreme Court. A similar conclusion was reached by the federal circuit court for Oregon in the 1888 cases of "Ex parte Chin King" and "Ex parte Chan San Hee". 

In an 1892 case, "Gee Fook Sing v. U.S.", a federal appeals court in California for the same circuit (by this time known as the <a href="Ninth%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>) concluded that a Chinese man would have been recognized as a United States citizen if he could have presented satisfactory evidence that he had in fact been born in the U.S. This case was also never brought before the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court's 1873 "<a href="Slaughterhouse%20Cases">Slaughterhouse Cases</a>" decision contained the statement that "The phrase, 'subject to its jurisdiction,' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States." However, since the "Slaughterhouse Cases" did not deal with claims of birthright citizenship, this comment was dismissed in "Wong Kim Ark" and later cases as a passing remark ("<a href="obiter%20dictum">obiter dictum</a>") lacking any force as a controlling <a href="precedent">precedent</a>. As to whether the "Wong Kim Ark" decision was correct on this point or not, modern scholars are divided.

Wong Kim Ark (; <a href="Taishanese%20dialect">Taishanese</a>: Wōng Gim-ak) was born in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Various sources state or imply his year of birth as being 1873, 1871, or 1868. His father, Wong Si Ping (), and mother, Wee Lee (), were immigrants from China and were not United States citizens, as the <a href="Naturalization%20Law%20of%201802">Naturalization Law of 1802</a> had made them ineligible for naturalization either before or after his birth. Wong worked in San Francisco as a cook.

Wong visited China in 1890, and upon his return to the United States in July 1890, he was readmitted without incident because of his U.S. citizenship. In November 1894, Wong sailed to China for another temporary visit, but when he returned in August 1895, he was detained at the <a href="Port%20of%20San%20Francisco">Port of San Francisco</a> by the Collector of <a href="United%20States%20Customs%20Service">Customs</a>, who denied him permission to enter the country, arguing that Wong was not a U.S. citizen despite his having been born in the U.S., but was instead a Chinese subject because his parents were Chinese. Wong was confined for five months on steamships off the coast of San Francisco while his case was being tried.

According to Salyer, the San Francisco attorney George Collins had tried to persuade the federal <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Justice Department</a> to bring a Chinese birthright citizenship case before the Supreme Court. An article by Collins was published in the May/June 1895 "American Law Review", criticizing the "Look Tin Sing" ruling and the federal government's unwillingness to challenge it, and advocating the international law view of "jus sanguinis" citizenship. Eventually, Collins was able to convince U.S. Attorney Henry Foote, who "searched for a viable test case and settled on Wong Kim Ark".
With the assistance of legal representation by the <a href="Chinese%20Consolidated%20Benevolent%20Association">Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association</a>, Wong Kim Ark challenged the refusal to recognize his <a href="Birthright%20citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">birth claim</a> to U.S. citizenship, and a petition for a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" was filed on his behalf in <a href="federal%20district%20court">federal district court</a>. The arguments presented before District Judge <a href="William%20W.%20Morrow">William W. Morrow</a> centered on which of two competing interpretations of the phrase "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" in the Citizenship Clause should govern a situation involving a child born in the United States to alien parents. Wong's attorneys argued that the phrase meant subject to the laws of the United States,' comprehending, in this expression, the allegiance that aliens owe in a foreign country to obey its laws"—an interpretation, based on the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> inherited by the United States from England, that would encompass essentially everyone born in the U.S. via the principle of "<a href="jus%20soli">jus soli</a>" (citizenship based on place of birth). The U.S. government claimed that "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" meant "to be subject to the political jurisdiction of the United States"—an interpretation, based on <a href="international%20law">international law</a>, which would exclude parents and their children who owed allegiance to another country via the principle of "<a href="jus%20sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a>" (citizenship inherited from a parent).

The question of the citizenship status of U.S.-born children of alien parents had, up to this time, never been decided by the Supreme Court. The U.S. government argued that Wong's claim to U.S. citizenship was ruled out by the Supreme Court's interpretation of jurisdiction in its 1873 "<a href="Slaughterhouse%20Cases">Slaughterhouse Cases</a>" ruling, but the district judge concluded that the language in question was "obiter dictum" and not directly relevant to the case at hand. The government also cited a similar statement in "Elk v. Wilkins", but the judge was not convinced by this argument either.

Wong's attorneys cited the "Look Tin Sing" case, and the district judge agreed that in the absence of clear direction from the Supreme Court, this case definitively settled the question of citizenship for Wong and others like him as far as federal courts in the <a href="Ninth%20Circuit">Ninth Circuit</a> were concerned. The judge saw the "Look Tin Sing" holding reaffirmed in the "Gee Fook Sing" case and noted further that another part of the Supreme Court's "Slaughterhouse Cases" opinion said that "it is only necessary that [a man] should be born or naturalized in the United States to be a citizen of the Union." Concluding that the "Look Tin Sing" decision constituted a controlling <a href="precedent">precedent</a> in the Ninth Circuit, Judge Morrow ruled that "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" referred to being subject to U.S. law (the first of the two proposed interpretations). On January 3, 1896, the judge declared Wong Kim Ark to be a citizen because he was born in the U.S.

The U.S. government <a href="appealed">appealed</a> the district court ruling directly to the United States Supreme Court. According to Salyer, government officials—realizing that the decision in this case "was of great importance, not just to Chinese Americans, but to all American citizens who had been born to alien parents", and concerned about the possible effect of an early ruling by the Supreme Court on the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">1896 presidential election</a>—delayed the timing of their appeal so as to avoid the possibility of a decision based more on policy concerns than the merits of the case. Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held on March 5, 1897. <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">Solicitor General</a> <a href="Holmes%20Conrad">Holmes Conrad</a> presented the government's case; Wong was represented before the Court by <a href="Maxwell%20Evarts">Maxwell Evarts</a>, former U.S. Assistant <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> J. Hubley Ashton, and Thomas D. Riordan.

The Supreme Court considered the "single question" in the case to be "whether a child born in the United States, of parent[s] of Chinese descent, who, at the time of his birth, are subjects of the Emperor of China, but have a permanent domicil and residence in the United States, and are there carrying on business, and are not employed in any diplomatic or official capacity under the Emperor of China, becomes at the time of his birth a citizen of the United States." It was conceded that if Wong was a U.S. citizen, "the acts of congress known as the 'Chinese Exclusion Acts,' prohibiting persons of the Chinese race, and especially Chinese laborers, from coming into the United States, do not and cannot apply to him."

In a 6–2 decision issued on March 28, 1898, the Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark had acquired U.S. citizenship at birth and that "the American citizenship which Wong Kim Ark acquired by birth within the United States has not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth." The opinion of the Court was written by Associate Justice <a href="Horace%20Gray">Horace Gray</a> and was joined by Associate Justices <a href="David%20J.%20Brewer">David J. Brewer</a>, <a href="Henry%20B.%20Brown">Henry B. Brown</a>, <a href="George%20Shiras%20Jr.">George Shiras Jr.</a>, <a href="Edward%20Douglass%20White">Edward Douglass White</a>, and <a href="Rufus%20W.%20Peckham">Rufus W. Peckham</a>.

Upholding the concept of "jus soli" (citizenship based on place of birth), the Court held that the Citizenship Clause needed to be interpreted in light of English common law, which had included as <a href="British%20subject">subjects</a> virtually all native-born children, excluding only those who were born to foreign rulers or diplomats, born on foreign public ships, or born to enemy forces engaged in hostile occupation of the country's territory. The court's majority held that the "subject to the jurisdiction" phrase in the Citizenship Clause excluded from U.S. citizenship only those persons covered by one of these three exceptions (plus a fourth "single additional exception"—namely, that <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian tribes</a> "not taxed" were not considered subject to U.S. jurisdiction). The majority concluded that none of these four exceptions to U.S. jurisdiction applied to Wong; in particular, they observed that "during all the time of their said residence in the United States, as domiciled residents therein, the said mother and father of said Wong Kim Ark were engaged in the prosecution of business, and were never engaged in any diplomatic or official capacity under the emperor of China".

Quoting approvingly from an 1812 case, "<a href="The%20Schooner%20Exchange%20v.%20M%27Faddon">The Schooner Exchange v. M'Faddon</a>", in which <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a> said, "The jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute"—and agreeing with the district judge who had heard Wong's original "habeas corpus" petition that comments in the "Slaughterhouse Cases" about the citizenship status of children born to non-citizen parents did not constitute a binding precedent—the Court ruled that Wong was a U.S. citizen from birth, via the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the restrictions of the Chinese Exclusion Act did not apply to him. An act of Congress, they held, does not trump the Constitution; such a law "cannot control [the Constitution's] meaning, or impair its effect, but must be construed and executed in subordination to its provisions." The majority opinion referred to "<a href="Calvin%27s%20Case">Calvin's Case</a>" (1608) as stating the fundamental common law principle that all people born within the King's "allegiance" were subjects, including children of "aliens in amity".

Chief Justice <a href="Melville%20Fuller">Melville Fuller</a> was joined by Associate Justice <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan">John Harlan</a> in a dissent which, "for the most part, may be said to be predicated upon the recognition of the international law doctrine". The dissenters argued that the history of U.S. citizenship law had broken with English common law tradition after <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">independence</a>—citing as an example the embracing in the U.S. of the right of expatriation (giving up of one's native citizenship) and the rejection of the contrary British doctrine of <a href="History%20of%20British%20nationality%20law%23Early%20English%20and%20British%20nationality%20law">perpetual allegiance</a>. The dissenters argued that the principle of "<a href="jus%20sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a>" (that is, the concept of a child inheriting his or her father's citizenship by descent regardless of birthplace) had been more pervasive in U.S. legal history since independence. Based on an assessment of U.S. and Chinese <a href="treaty">treaty</a> and naturalization law, the dissenters claimed that "the children of Chinese born in this country do not, "<a href="ipso%20facto">ipso facto</a>", become citizens of the United States unless the fourteenth amendment overrides both treaty and statute."

Pointing to the language of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, an act of Congress which declared to be citizens "all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed", and which was enacted into law only two months before the Fourteenth Amendment was proposed by Congress, the dissenters argued that "it is not open to reasonable doubt that the words 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof,' in the amendment, were used as synonymous with the words 'and not subject to any foreign power. In the dissenters' view, excessive reliance on "<a href="jus%20soli">jus soli</a>" (birthplace) as the principal determiner of citizenship would lead to an untenable state of affairs in which "the children of foreigners, happening to be born to them while passing through the country, whether of royal parentage or not, or whether of the Mongolian, Malay or other race, were eligible to the presidency, while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not."

The dissenters acknowledged that other children of foreigners—including former slaves—had, over the years, acquired U.S. citizenship through birth on U.S. soil. But they still saw a difference between those people and U.S.-born individuals of Chinese ancestry, because of strong cultural traditions discouraging Chinese immigrants from assimilating into mainstream American society, Chinese laws of the time which made renouncing allegiance to the <a href="Chinese%20emperor">Chinese emperor</a> a <a href="Capital%20punishment">capital crime</a>, and the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act making Chinese immigrants already in the United States ineligible for citizenship. The question for the dissenters was "not whether [Wong Kim Ark] was born in the U.S. or subject to the jurisdiction thereof ... but whether his or her parents have the ability, under U.S. or foreign law, statutory or treaty-based, to become citizens of the U.S. themselves".

In a lecture to a group of law students shortly before the decision was released, Harlan commented that the Chinese had long been excluded from American society "upon the idea that this is a race utterly foreign to us and never will assimilate with us." Without the exclusion legislation, Harlan stated his opinion that vast numbers of Chinese "would have rooted out the American population" in the western United States. Acknowledging the opposing view supporting citizenship for American-born Chinese, he said that "Of course, the argument on the other side is that the very words of the constitution embrace such a case." Commenting on the "Wong Kim Ark" case shortly after the issuance of the Court's ruling in 1898, San Francisco attorney Marshall B. Woodworth wrote that "the error the dissent apparently falls into is that it does not recognize that the United States, as a sovereign power, has the right to adopt any rule of citizenship it may see fit, and that the rule of international law does not furnish [by its own force] the sole and exclusive test of citizenship of the United States".

In an analysis of the "Wong Kim Ark" case written shortly after the decision in 1898, Marshall B. Woodworth laid out the two competing theories of jurisdiction in the Citizenship Clause and observed that "[t]he fact that the decision of the court was not unanimous indicates that the question is at least debatable." Woodworth concluded, however, that the Supreme Court's ruling laid the issue to rest, saying that "it is difficult to see what valid objection can be raised thereto". Another analysis of the case, published by the "<a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> Law Journal" (1898), favored the dissenting view.

An editorial published in the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" on March 30, 1898, expressed concern that the "Wong Kim Ark" ruling (issued two days previously) "may have a wider effect upon the question of citizenship than the public supposes"—specifically, that it might lead to citizenship and voting rights not only for Chinese, but also Japanese and American Indians. The editorial suggested that "it may become necessary ... to amend the Federal Constitution and definitely limit citizenship to whites and blacks."

As a result of Wong Kim Ark's U.S. citizenship being confirmed by the Supreme Court, Wong's eldest son came to the United States from China in 1910, seeking recognition as a citizen via "<a href="jus%20sanguinis">jus sanguinis</a>", but U.S. immigration officials <a href="Paper%20sons">claimed to see discrepancies</a> in the testimony at his immigration hearing and refused to accept Wong's claim that the boy was his son. Wong's other three sons came to the United States between 1924 and 1926 and were accepted as citizens. Because of his citizenship, Wong Kim Ark's youngest son was drafted in World War II, and later made a career in the United States Merchant Marines.

Current U.S. law on birthright citizenship (citizenship acquired at birth) acknowledges both citizenship through place of birth ("jus soli") and citizenship inherited from parents ("jus sanguinis"). Before "Wong Kim Ark," the Supreme Court had held in "<a href="Elk%20v.%20Wilkins">Elk v. Wilkins</a>" (1884) that birthplace by itself was not sufficient to grant citizenship to a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>; however, Congress eventually granted full citizenship to American Indians via the <a href="Indian%20Citizenship%20Act%20of%201924">Indian Citizenship Act of 1924</a>.

Restrictions on immigration and naturalization of Chinese were eventually lifted as a consequence of the <a href="Chinese%20Exclusion%20Repeal%20Act%20of%201943">Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943</a> (also known as the Magnuson Act) and the <a href="Immigration%20and%20Nationality%20Act%20of%201965">Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965</a>.

In the years since "Wong Kim Ark", the concept of "jus soli" citizenship has "never been seriously questioned by the Supreme Court, and [has] been accepted as dogma by lower courts". Citizenship cases since "Wong Kim Ark" have dealt mainly with situations falling outside the bounds of the Citizenship Clause—such as citizenship via "jus sanguinis" for foreign-born children of U.S. citizens, or circumstances under which U.S. citizenship may be lost.

The "Wong Kim Ark" court's affirmation of "jus soli" as the primary rule determining United States citizenship has been cited in several Supreme Court decisions affirming the citizenship of U.S.-born individuals of Chinese or Japanese ancestry. The court's holding that the language of the Constitution should be understood in light of the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> has been cited in numerous Supreme Court decisions dealing with the interpretation of the Constitution or acts of Congress. The "Wong Kim Ark" court's understanding of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction was also cited in a 1982 case involving the rights of illegal immigrants.

An unsuccessful effort was made in 1942 by the <a href="Native%20Sons%20of%20the%20Golden%20West">Native Sons of the Golden West</a> to convince the Supreme Court to revisit and overrule the "Wong Kim Ark" ruling, in a case ("Regan v. King") challenging the citizenship status of roughly 2,600 U.S.-born persons of Japanese ancestry. The plaintiffs' attorney termed "Wong Kim Ark" "one of the most injurious and unfortunate decisions" ever handed down by the Supreme Court and hoped the new case would give the court "an opportunity to correct itself". A federal district court and the <a href="Ninth%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> summarily rejected this contention, each citing "Wong Kim Ark" as a controlling <a href="precedent">precedent</a>, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

Federal appellate courts have repeatedly rejected attempts to cite the "Wong Kim Ark" opinion's use of the phrase "citizenship by birth within the territory" in support of claims that persons born in the Philippines during the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Philippines%20%281898%E2%80%931946%29">period of its history</a> when it was a United States possession were born in the U.S. (and thus entitled to U.S. citizenship via the Citizenship Clause). Judge Richard Posner, in a concurring opinion in a federal appellate decision, criticized the "jus soli" holding in "Wong Kim Ark" in connection with illegal immigration, but at the same time conceded that the courts were powerless to change this rule, urging Congress to do so instead.

Since the 1990s, controversy has arisen in some circles over the practice of granting automatic citizenship via "jus soli" to U.S.-born children of illegal aliens —controversially dubbed the "<a href="anchor%20baby">anchor baby</a>" situation by some media correspondents and advocacy groups. Public debate over the issue has resulted in renewed discussion of the "Wong Kim Ark" decision.

Some legal scholars, opposed to the idea that "jus soli" should apply to the children of illegal aliens, have argued that the "Wong Kim Ark" precedent does not apply when alien parents are in the country illegally. <a href="John%20C.%20Eastman">John C. Eastman</a>, a former dean of the <a href="Chapman%20University%20School%20of%20Law">Chapman University School of Law</a>, has argued that "Wong Kim Ark" does not entitle U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to gain automatic citizenship because, in his opinion, being subject to the jurisdiction of the United States requires a status of "full and complete jurisdiction" that does not apply to aliens who are in the country illegally. Eastman further argues that the "Wong Kim Ark" decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction, and that the <a href="Indian%20Citizenship%20Act%20of%201924">Indian Citizenship Act of 1924</a>—which followed "Wong Kim Ark"—would not have been necessary if Congress had believed "that the Citizenship Clause confers citizenship merely by accident of birth." A similar analysis of the jurisdiction question has been proposed by Professor Peter H. Schuck of the Yale School of Law and <a href="Rogers%20M.%20Smith">Rogers M. Smith</a>, political science professor at Yale. According to law professor <a href="Lino%20Graglia">Lino Graglia</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Texas">University of Texas</a>, even if "Wong Kim Ark" settled the status of children of legal residents, it did not do so for children of illegal residents; Graglia asserts that the case weighs against automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied such citizenship for an analogous group, namely "children of alien enemies, born during and within their hostile occupation". 

Countering this view, <a href="Garrett%20Epps">Garrett Epps</a>—a professor of law at the <a href="University%20of%20Baltimore">University of Baltimore</a>—has stated that "In the case of "United States v. Wong Kim Ark", the United States Supreme Court held that this guarantee [of birthright citizenship] applies to children of foreigners present on American soil, even if their parents are not American citizens and indeed are not eligible to become U.S. citizens." Epps further notes that "as a practical matter, the American-born children receive recognition of their citizenship regardless of the immigration status of their parents." In Epps' opinion, the sponsors of the Fourteenth Amendment "were unwavering in their insistence that the Citizenship Clause was to cover" the children of such undesirable immigrants as Chinese and Gypsies, and he views the "Wong Kim Ark" ruling as an "unexceptionable" matter of reading the drafters' intent.

Cristina Rodriguez, a professor at the <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> School of Law, has argued that Wong Kim Ark's situation was "similar in all meaningful respects" to that of children of illegal immigrants, because "they both involve immigrant parents ineligible for full membership in the polity, or immigrant populations that were tolerated but disdained or considered legally erasable." Rodriguez goes on to claim that the "Wong Kim Ark" ruling was "a powerful rejection of the idea that one's status depends on his parent's status." Noting contrary arguments (such as those put forth by Schuck and Smith), Rodriguez says that "For all practical purposes, this debate has been resolved. Though renewed interest over the last few years in immigration reform has prompted the introduction of legislation in Congress to deny the children of the unauthorized "jus soli" status, these measures have been political non-starters, in large part because of the widespread view that the Supreme Court would strike down any such legislation as unconstitutional."

James Ho has expressed a similar view to that of Rodriguez, saying that "Birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. That birthright is protected no less for children of undocumented persons than for descendants of "Mayflower" passengers." Ho also argues that those who claim the Citizenship Clause was not in fact intended to confer citizenship on the children of aliens are disregarding the substance of the 1866 Senate debate over the proposal to add this language to the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Supreme Court's 1982 "<a href="Plyler%20v.%20Doe">Plyler v. Doe</a>" decision—in a case involving illegal alien children (i.e., children born abroad who had come to the United States illegally along with their parents, and who had no basis for claiming U.S. citizenship)—has also been cited in support of a broad application of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens and their children. A <a href="Texas">Texas</a> state law had sought to deny such children a public education, and the Texas government had argued that "persons who have entered the United States illegally are not 'within the jurisdiction' of a State even if they are present within a State's boundaries and subject to its laws." A "<a href="dictum">dictum</a>" footnote in the Court's majority opinion remarked that according to "Wong Kim Ark", the Fourteenth Amendment's phrases "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" (in the Citizenship Clause) and "within its jurisdiction" (in the <a href="Equal%20Protection%20Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a>) were essentially equivalent; that both expressions referred primarily to physical presence and not to political allegiance; and that the "Wong Kim Ark" decision benefited the children of illegal as well as legal aliens. As a result, the court rejected the claim that Fourteenth Amendment "jurisdiction" depended on whether someone had entered the U.S. legally or not. Although the four dissenting justices disagreed with the opinion of the Court regarding whether the children in question had a right to a public education, the dissenters agreed with the majority regarding the applicability of Fourteenth Amendment jurisdiction to illegal aliens. James Ho considers "Plyler v. Doe" to have "put to rest" any doubt over whether the sweeping language regarding jurisdiction in "Wong Kim Ark" applies to all aliens, even illegal aliens.

The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a> (the federal government agency responsible for international relations) considers U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to be subject to U.S. jurisdiction, and thus to have citizenship at birth. The State Department's <a href="Foreign%20Affairs%20Manual">Foreign Affairs Manual</a> takes the position that this issue was settled by the "Wong Kim Ark" ruling.

Some legal scholars still argue that the "Wong Kim Ark" ruling should be overturned through legislative means. <a href="Richard%20Posner">Richard Posner</a>, a judge of the <a href="Seventh%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, has criticized the granting of citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, suggesting that Congress can and should act to change this policy. Charles Wood, former counsel to the <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a>'s subcommittee on immigration, has also opposed the practice, urging (in 1999) that it be stopped as quickly as possible, either by an act of Congress or a constitutional amendment.

However, in the words of Lucy Salyer, "the birthright citizenship doctrine of "Wong Kim Ark" has remained intact for over a century, still perceived by most to be a natural and well-established rule in accordance with American principles and practice. It is unlikely to be uprooted easily."

In response to public reaction against immigration and fears that U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants could serve as <a href="Chain%20immigration">links</a> to permit legal residency and eventual citizenship for family members who would otherwise be ineligible to remain in the country, <a href="Bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bills</a> have been introduced from time to time in Congress which have challenged the conventional interpretation of the Citizenship Clause and have sought (thus far unsuccessfully) to actively and explicitly deny citizenship at birth to U.S.-born children of foreign visitors or illegal aliens. 

As one example among many, the "Birthright Citizenship Act of 2009"—introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> of the <a href="111th%20United%20States%20Congress">111th Congress</a> as H.R. 1868, by Representative <a href="Nathan%20Deal">Nathan Deal</a> of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>—was an attempt to exclude U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants from being considered subject to the jurisdiction of the United States for purposes of the Citizenship Clause. A similar proposal—named the "Birthright Citizenship Act of 2011"—was introduced in the House as H.R. 140 in the (<a href="112th%20United%20States%20Congress">112th</a>) Congress on January 5, 2011 by Representative <a href="Steve%20King">Steve King</a> of <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>, and in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> as S. 723 on April 5, 2011 by Senator <a href="David%20Vitter">David Vitter</a> of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. Neither bill was discussed in Congress prior to the end of the session.

Since an act of Congress challenging the accepted interpretation of the Citizenship Clause might very possibly be ruled unconstitutional by courts choosing to rely on "Wong Kim Ark" as a precedent, proposals have also been made to <a href="List%20of%20proposed%20amendments%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">amend the Constitution</a> so as to override the Fourteenth Amendment's language and deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal aliens or foreign visitors. For example, Senator Vitter of Louisiana introduced Senate <a href="Joint%20Resolution">Joint Resolution</a> (S.J.Res.) 6 in the 111th Congress, but like H.R. 1868, it failed to reach the floor of either house of Congress before the 111th Congress adjourned on December 22, 2010. Vitter reintroduced this same proposed amendment as S.J.Res. 2 in the 112th Congress on January 25, 2011; it was not brought up for discussion or voted upon in either house of Congress.

In 2010 and 2011, state legislators in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> introduced bills proposing to deny regular <a href="birth%20certificate">birth certificate</a>s to children born in Arizona whose parents could not prove they were in the United States legally. Supporters of such legislation reportedly hoped their efforts would cause the issue of birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal aliens to reach the Supreme Court, possibly resulting in a new decision narrowing or overruling "Wong Kim Ark".

On October 30, 2018, President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> announced his intention to issue an <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a> abolishing birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of non-citizens. On this same date, Senator <a href="Lindsey%20Graham">Lindsey Graham</a> of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> said he would introduce legislation in Congress to accomplish the same thing. Jon Feere, of the <a href="Center%20for%20Immigration%20Studies">Center for Immigration Studies</a> (CIS), has said that "Several legal scholars and political scientists who have delved into the history of the 14th Amendment have concluded that 'subject to the jurisdiction thereof' has no plain meaning". Commenting on Trump's idea of an executive order, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Paul%20Ryan">Paul Ryan</a> said "you obviously cannot do that... I think in this case the 14th Amendment is pretty clear, and that would involve a very, very lengthy constitutional process." <a href="Mark%20Krikorian">Mark Krikorian</a>, executive director of the CIS, said that if Trump follows through on his plan, "This will set up the court fight... the order will be enjoined, [and the] case will eventually reach [the Supreme Court], which then will finally have to rule on the meaning of 'subject to the jurisdiction.'" As of December 25, 2018, neither Trump's promised executive order nor Graham's planned bill have materialized.

Age of Empires II

Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Ensemble%20Studios">Ensemble Studios</a> and published by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Released in 1999 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Macintosh</a>, it is the second game in the "<a href="Age%20of%20Empires">Age of Empires</a>" series. An expansion, "", was released in 2000.

"The Age of Kings" is set in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and contains thirteen playable civilizations. Players aim to gather resources, which they use to build towns, create armies, and defeat their enemies. There are five historically based campaigns, which constrict the player to specialized and story-backed conditions. There are three additional <a href="Single-player%20video%20game">single-player</a> game modes, and <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> is supported. Despite using the same <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a> and similar <a href="Source%20code">code</a> to its predecessor, development of "The Age of Kings" took a year longer than expected, forcing Ensemble Studios to release "" in 1998 instead. The design team focused on resolving significant issues in "Age of Empires", but noted on release that some problems remained.

Reception of "The Age of Kings" was highly positive. The significant number of new features was praised, as were the gameplay improvements. The Age of Kings received "universal acclaim", according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Three months after its release, two million copies of "The Age of Kings" had been shipped, and it topped sales charts in seven countries. The game won multiple awards and is today considered a classic of its type, having had a significant impact on future games in its genre. Both the original "Age of Empires II" and the expansion pack were later released as "The Gold Edition".

In April 2013, "Age of Empires II: HD Edition" was released on the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> <a href="digital%20distribution">digital distribution</a> platform for Windows operating systems. The "HD Edition" includes both the original game and the expansion "The Conquerors", as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays. It also supports user-generated content through the <a href="Steam%20Workshop">Steam Workshop</a> and multiplayer games provided through the Steam servers. Three expansions have been released for the "HD Edition": "" in 2013, "The African Kingdoms" in 2015, and "Rise of the Rajas" in 2016.

"The Age of Kings" focuses on building towns, gathering resources, creating armies and ultimately conquering opponents by destroying their units and buildings. Players conquer rival towns and empires as they advance one of 13 civilizations through four "Ages": the <a href="Dark%20Age">Dark Age</a>, the <a href="Feudalism">Feudal Age</a>, the Castle Age (being the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a>), and the Imperial Age, reminiscent of the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>—a 1000-year timeframe. Advancing to a new Age unlocks new units, structures, and technologies, but players must first build certain buildings from their current age and then pay a sum of resources (typically food and gold).

Civilian units, called "villagers", are used to gather resources; they are either male or female—gender does not affect their abilities. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things; for example, players can research better armour for <a href="infantry">infantry</a> units. The game offers four types of resources: food, wood, gold, and stone. Food is obtained by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and shore fishing and fishing from boats. Wood is gathered by chopping down trees. Gold is obtained from either gold mines, trade or collecting relics in a <a href="monastery">monastery</a>, and stone is collected from stone mines. Villagers require checkpoints, typically depository buildings (town center, mining camp, <a href="Mill%20%28grinding%29">mill</a>, and <a href="lumber%20yard">lumber yard</a>), where they can store gathered resources.

Each civilization can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a <a href="marketplace">marketplace</a> for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold is added to the stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.

There are five campaigns in "The Age of Kings", containing historically based scenarios such as <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>'s invasion of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Barbarossa</a>'s <a href="Crusade">Crusade</a>, or <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>'s defence of the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>. In the <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a> and <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a> campaigns, the player can control a unit based on its namesake; in others, players take orders from guiding spirits representative of the army's commander.

Additional game modes are available to the player in "The Age of Kings". One mode, <a href="random%20map">random map</a>, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for a certain amount of time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. <a href="Deathmatch">Deathmatch</a> mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the <a href="regicide">regicide</a> mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.

Every player has a limit to the number of units they can create—a population limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 25 and 200 in intervals of 25, is based on the number of houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. "The Age of Kings" introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.

"The Age of Kings" also includes five types of military units: infantry, <a href="archers">archers</a>, <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>, <a href="siege">siege</a> weaponry, and <a href="navy">naval</a> units. Certain types of infantry, archers, and cavalry are "counter units" with special defenses against other types of units. The three human classes of military generally follow a <a href="rock-paper-scissors">rock-paper-scissors</a> model. For example, infantry are generally powerful against buildings but weak against cavalry, thus the infantry counter units—<a href="spear">spear</a>men and <a href="pikemen">pikemen</a>—have attack bonuses against cavalry.

Each Civilization in "The Age of Kings" has one or two special units that are exclusive to that Civilization. For instance, the <a href="British%20people">Britons</a> have access to <a href="longbow">longbow</a>men, an archery unit with increased range. These Civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but still follow the basic rock-paper-scissors model. The <a href="monk">monk</a> is a special kind of military unit that has the ability to convert enemy units to the player's civilization, and to heal allied units. Monks are also used to collect relics. Relics accumulate gold once held in the player's monastery—the more relics are captured, the faster the gold is accumulated. Collecting all relics on the map is one method by which a player can win a random map game, depending on the victory setting. Once a player has all the relics in their monasteries, a timer is shown to all players. If an opposing player does not destroy a monastery holding a relic after the set time, then that player wins.

Players choose to play as one of 13 civilizations split into four architectural styles—<a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>an, <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>an, <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>ern, and <a href="East%20Asian">East Asian</a>—that determine building appearance in-game. The civilizations have varying strengths and weaknesses with regards to economics, technology, and battle, and each has access to one or more different, very powerful "Unique Units". Additionally, each civilization provides an individual team bonus in team games. To add variety, each civilization has a set of <a href="sound%20bite">sound bite</a>s in its native language that are uttered by units when selected or instructed to perform a task.

The buildings in "The Age of Kings" are split into the economic and military buildings categories. Buildings can research technologies and upgrades that increase economic, military or unit-based efficiency, as well as provide resources for the player.

The most important economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, all types of resources can be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.

Military buildings include unit-producing buildings such as barracks, archery ranges, stables, and castles, as well as defensive buildings such as walls and towers. Military buildings can perform research to improve the abilities of military units, increasing their strength, defensive capabilities, or other attributes. Castles are a key offensive and defensive building as they can build <a href="trebuchet">trebuchet</a>s, train the civilization's "unique unit/s", and fire a hail of arrows at enemy units within range, with garrisoned units firing extra arrows. Castles can only be built after a player has reached the Castle Age, although in some game options, players begin with an already-built castle as early as the Dark Age.

After advancing to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, building a Wonder triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's Wonder is in the shape of a landmark unique to that historical culture—the <a href="Temple%20of%20Heaven">Temple of Heaven</a> for the Chinese, for example, or <a href="Notre%20Dame%20%28Paris%29">Notre Dame</a> for the Franks.

"The Age of Kings" originally shipped with five extensive campaigns: William Wallace (<a href="Celts">Celts</a>), Joan of Arc (<a href="Franks">Franks</a>), Saladin (<a href="Saracens">Saracens</a>), Genghis Khan (<a href="Mongols">Mongols</a>) and Barbarossa (<a href="Teutons">Teutons</a>). The campaigns are sorted numerically to distinguish difficulty—The William Wallace Campaign being the easiest, and Barbarossa being the most challenging.

William Wallace

The Campaign of William Wallace acts as a tutorial campaign, much like the original "<a href="Age%20of%20Empires">Age of Empires</a>" game, and emphasises on how to move units, collect and gather resources, obtain and store holy relics and defeat the enemy, which in this Campaign is presented as the <a href="England">English</a> during the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a>, commanded by the evil, torturous but skilled commander <a href="Edward%20Longshanks">Edward Longshanks</a>.

Joan of Arc

Joan of Arc puts the player in command of the battered, bloodied and demoralised <a href="France">French</a> during the <a href="Hundred%20Years%20War">Hundred Years War</a> against England. At the beginning of the campaign, nearly every major and decisive battle fought by the French has always led to defeat to the English. In France's darkest hour though, a seventeen-year-old girl—<a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a> intends to save France by the command of <a href="God">God</a>. She intends to drive the English from France forever. Her presence at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Orleans">Siege of Orleans</a> earns her the nickname 'The Maid of Orleans', and she earns the confidence of the uncrowned <a href="Dauphin%20of%20France">Dauphin</a> <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">Charles VII</a> by being given command of the entire French Army, although the Dauphin's advisors begin to plot against Joan of Arc. At several turning points in the Hundred Years' War, namely the <a href="Loire%20Campaign">Loire Campaign</a> where the entire English and <a href="Burgundy">Burgundian</a> forces were cleared out, hope for a free France begin to inspire more men to join the fight under Joan of Arc.

However, the crowned Charles VII's advisors convince the King not to send the promised reinforcements to Joan at the pivotal <a href="Siege%20of%20Paris%20%281429%29">Siege of Paris</a>. Joan of Arc retreats to the Castle at <a href="Siege%20of%20Compi%C3%A8gne">Compiègne</a> where the English and Burgundian troops lay siege. Trapped outside the safety of the <a href="Castle">Castle</a>, Joan is captured by the Burgundians, trialled by the <a href="England">English</a> as a <a href="heretic">heretic</a>, and burned at the stake. The final campaign mission, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Castillon">Battle of Castillon</a>, has one of Joan's most trusted Lieutenants muster a huge force of vengeful French troops, and utterly destroy the English and Burgundian forces around and in Castillon, ending the Hundred Years' War and expelling the English from France, spare <a href="Calais">Calais</a>.

Saladin

This campaign takes places years after the events that led to the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> and capture of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Saladin (who the player acts as throughout this campaign) is first tasked with establishing himself in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and removing the <a href="Crusades">Crusaders</a> there, in order to become <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. A villainous Crusader by the name of <a href="Reynald%20de%20Chatillon">Reynald de Chatillon</a> has continuously violated the fragile peace between the Crusaders and the Saracens, causing great concern to Saladin. Raids by Crusaders in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> are eventually suppressed by the Saracens. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hattin">Battle of Hattin</a>, the Saracens win a decisive victory over the combined strength of the <a href="Knights%20Templar">Knights Templar</a>, <a href="Knights%20Hospitallers">Knights Hospitallers</a>, <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="English%20people">English</a> Crusaders, capture Reynold de Chatillon (who is the only prisoner executed by Saladin personally) and obtain a piece of the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a> as an important relic.

With the strength of the Crusaders now heavily reduced since Hattin, Saladin launches the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%281187%29">Siege of Jerusalem</a> to free it from Crusader control. However, the Saracens must take great care not to destroy the Monasteries within the holy city, and must also deal with Templar and Hospitaller encampments that flank the city. The Siege is successful, the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> now once again in Saracen control, spare the Crusader states of <a href="Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> and <a href="Ashkelon">Ascalon</a>, but are subsequently captured by Saladin. When the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> is informed of the Crusader defeat in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a> is launched, threatening to undo Saladin's conquest. The final mission tasks the player with defending a heavily fortified <a href="Citadel">Citadel</a> from constant Crusader attacks, most notably King <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard of England</a>, as well as constructing the <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20Samarra">Great Mosque of Samarra</a>, the unique Wonder building available to the Saracens in game.

Genghis Khan

The <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a> concentrates on the rise of the divided, constantly warring tribes of <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> into the mighty, fearsome <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol Empire</a>. Early missions of the campaign concentrate on uniting the several steppe tribes whilst also dealing with the '<a href="Qara%20Khitai">Kara-Khitai</a>', sworn enemies of Genghis Khan. With the other tribes either united or destroyed, Genghis now sets his eyes on world domination. The vast riches of the Khwaremia domain in <a href="Persia">Persia</a> would be the obvious choice, but despite a pledge of support to the Mongols, the technologically superior <a href="China">Chinese</a> Kingdoms have refused, thereby setting another example where <a href="Mongol%20conquest%20of%20China">Genghis directs his next campaign</a>. With the entirety of China now under Mongolian rule, the Mongol horde now has the <a href="trebuchet">technology</a> capable of knocking down the fortifications of Persia, and beyond.

The following conquests of <a href="Khwarezmia">Khwarezmia</a> and the <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Rus%27">Russian Principalities</a>, the latter by <a href="Subutai">Subutai</a> leaves <a href="Europe">Europe</a> as the last continent yet to be conquered. However, Genghis Khan who is now 80 years old, dies before the conquest can be complete. His son, Ogatai, promises to continue the war, marking <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Europe">Poland</a> as the first target. The Mongols, using numerical superiority alone, are able to defeat the mounted Knights of Poland, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> as well as the several German Duchies that rally to Poland's support. The final mission of the Genghis Khan campaign focuses on <a href="Pax%20Mongolica">Pax Mongolica</a>, the term used to describe the height of power enjoyed by the Mongolian Empire. The last major power in Eastern Europe, <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>, is all that stands in the way of Mongolia's further incursions into Europe.

Barbarossa

This campaign focuses on the expansion of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> by integrating the squabbling German duchies under the rule of <a href="Frederick%20Barbarossa">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, the first Holy Roman Emperor. The first campaign missions sees the player establishing Barbarossa's dominance over the <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>an powers of <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, Bohemia, and Burgundy, as well as <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a> by collecting relics. Although having established dominance, Barbarossa still finds rivals to challenge his Empire's power in the form of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, as well as <a href="Henry%20the%20Lion">Henry the Lion</a>, a respected ally of Barbarossa. Henry is spared his life and titles as long as he promises to fully declare allegiance to Barbarossa.

With Central Europe now under the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his attention to <a href="Guelphs%20and%20Ghibellines">Italy</a>, namely <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and the <a href="Papal%20States">Pope</a>. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged the power of the Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to <a href="Lombard%20League">subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him.</a> Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into <a href="exile">exile</a> whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a> begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, which is crawling with <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a>. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by the weight of his armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the <a href="Dome%20of%20the%20Rock">Dome of the Rock</a> in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfill his wishes.

"The Age of Kings" supports <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> over the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>, or via a <a href="local%20area%20network">local area network</a> (LAN). Up to eight players can take part in one game, with all of the single player game modes available. The <a href="MSN%20Gaming%20Zone">MSN Gaming Zone</a> supported the game until the service closed on June 19, 2006. After that, various multiplayer gaming services such as <a href="GameRanger">GameRanger</a> support it. Since April 2013, <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> supports in-game multiplayer for <a href="High-definition%20video%23HD%20in%20video%20gaming">HD</a> resolution requiring an internet connection.

Prior to the completion of "<a href="Age%20of%20Empires%20%28video%20game%29">Age of Empires</a>", <a href="Ensemble%20Studios">Ensemble Studios</a> had signed a contract with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> for a sequel. The design team chose to set "The Age of Kings" in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> as a logical progression from the <a href="ancient%20era">ancient era</a> setting of "Age of Empires". The design team was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game's design too similar. Nonetheless, they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played "Age of Empires". "The Age of Kings"s design team intended to complete the game within a year by using <a href="source%20code">code</a> from the original and reusing the <a href="Genie%20%28game%20engine%29">Genie</a> <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>. Several months into the process they found they would not be able to complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created "", an easily developed expansion pack of "Age of Empires", as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998. To help meet the next year's deadline, additional <a href="programmer">programmer</a>s, artists, and designers were employed. To overcome another significant objection to "Age of Empires"—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>'s movement system.

The original "Age of Empires" had been criticized for its <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI). Because the original AI did not "<a href="Game%20artificial%20intelligence%23Cheating%20AI">cheat</a>" by attributing itself extra resources or using other techniques the human player could not, it was easier to defeat than in many other real-time strategy games. For "The Age of Kings", Ensemble Studios attempted to develop a more powerful AI system that did not compromise by cheating. Industry veteran Mario Grimani led Ensemble Studios in the creation of the new system. "The Age of Kings" saw the introduction of a <a href="event-driven%20programming">triggers</a> system for its scenario editor. The triggers allow messages to be displayed, or actions to take place, based on pre-set criteria or "events". The scenario editor was also improved by the new AI system. The AI and trigger systems interacted regularly in the single player campaigns.

The team was less successful in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following the release of "Age of Empires" that there was still no process by which <a href="patch%20%28gaming%29">patches</a> could be issued. Extensive <a href="cheating%20in%20video%20games">cheating</a> in multiplayer games of "Age of Empires" came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for "The Age of Kings". On release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but the patch process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.

Ensemble Studios developed a new <a href="terrain%20rendering">terrain system</a> for "The Age of Kings", with <a href="3D%20graphics">3D</a> presentation capabilities that were vastly superior to those of "Age of Empires". Pritchard noted an improvement in the team's artistic abilities following their work on the past two games, and he is noted as saying that ""AoK" became a showcase for their improved talent". However, he complained about the lack of an art asset management tool, while other departments gained new tools and automated procedures to assist in design and <a href="play%20test">play test</a>ing.

The <a href="soundtrack">soundtrack</a> for "The Age of Kings" was directed by <a href="Stephen%20Rippy">Stephen Rippy</a>, who has since taken that role for <a href="Age%20of%20Empires%23Music">all games in the "Age of Empires" series</a>. Music for the game was split into two categories. For "in game" music, Rippy's team took musical elements from a variety of cultures and combined them to create a mixed sound. "Pre-game" music was designed to be unique to the civilization in question. Campaigns based on historical figures would include "a theme that will at least be rooted in [the character's] culture".

A <a href="demo%20%28gaming%29">demo</a> of "The Age of Kings" was released on October 16, 1999. It featured the learning campaign, a sample of a random map game, and the ability to play via the MSN Gaming Zone. Much to Ensemble Studios' disappointment, numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked. These were picked up by <a href="warez">warez</a> sites, and sold illegally throughout the <a href="Pacific%20Rim">Pacific Rim</a>; warez versions of the game were even sold outside Microsoft's offices in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>.

In 2012, <a href="Hidden%20Path%20Entertainment">Hidden Path Entertainment</a> began working on a high-definition <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a> of "Age of Empires II", an effort spearheaded by Matt Pritchard, an original Ensemble lead programmer. On March 7, 2013, its release was announced, branded as "Age of Empires II: HD Edition". It has improved graphics, widescreen support and new multiplayer options through <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. It was released on April 9, 2013, and there was a pre-order available on April 5.

On August 21, 2017 at <a href="Gamescom">Gamescom</a>, Microsoft announced a remaster titled "Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition" is in development.

In January 2000, three months after its release, Microsoft announced that they had shipped two million copies of "The Age of Kings". The game topped sales charts in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, and South Korea. It would spend the next two and a half years on top 20 sales lists. "The Age of Kings" was top selling game in October 1999, and the fourth highest selling game in 1999. The game's sales in the United States alone totaled 469,376 by the end of 1999, which drew revenues of $20.2 million, the second-highest domestic gross that year behind "<a href="SimCity%203000">SimCity 3000</a>". Domestic sales rose another 442,318 units ($19.56 million) from January through October 2000, according to <a href="PC%20Data">PC Data</a>. It finished the year as the seventh-largest computer game hit in the United States, with 595,016 in sales and $26.2 million in revenue. "Age of Empires II"s domestic success continued in 2001: with sales of 478,557 units ($19.4 million), it claimed tenth place for the year.

In the German market, "Age of Empires II" debuted in first place on Media Control's sales charts during October 1999, and by March 2000 had spent 17 weeks in the rankings. It received the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland's (VUD) "Platinum" award within one month of release, indicating sales of 200,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria. By the end of February 2000, it had reached "Double-Platinum" status (400,000 sales) and become the German market's "most successful PC game of the past 12 months", according to the VUD. The game later received a "Platinum" sales award from the <a href="Entertainment%20and%20Leisure%20Software%20Publishers%20Association">Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association</a> (ELSPA), for at least 300,000 copies sold in the United Kingdom. 

"The Age of Kings" received "universal acclaim", according to video game <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.

According to <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Geoff Richards, "the list of new features and improvements over the original game is over a page long". "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>"s review similarly focused on "new additions to the genre itself" which it argued made "The Age of Kings" outstanding. These included the idle unit button and town bell. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Carlos Salgado was appreciative of other features; he praised the ability to create individual profiles for different players and to customize <a href="hotkey">hotkey</a>s. Meanwhile, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> appreciated the new abilities given to the villager unit—the review stated villagers "now play an important role not only in the collection of resources, but also in town defense and even in combat."

<a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>'s Michael L. House enjoyed the use of sound bites in civilizations' native languages, which he said was "very influential in developing an era-enhancing atmosphere". Eurogamer said this feature "gives [villagers] a personality, rather than the standard 'Acknowledged' grunt of military <a href="real-time%20strategy">RTS</a> games", also stating that the use of female villagers provided a good variety. <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>'s review explained that by being set in a more recent epoch of human history, "The Age of Kings" was able to "add character to an otherwise impersonal style of gameplay". "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" approved of "The Age of Kings" use of shorter, more focused campaigns, compared to its predecessor, while Game Revolution noted that even in slower sections of the campaign, the historical narrative helped maintain player interest. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> said that with the screen full of units, "you can begin to imagine how their historical equivalents once prospered", while GameSpy said "The Age of Kings" presents "realism rarely seen in the RTS genre". IGN staff argued that while the strengths and weaknesses attributed to different civilizations made the game more realistic, the fact that they were still mostly the same prevented "The Age of Kings" from "delivering the same battlefield impact of "<a href="StarCraft">StarCraft</a>" or """.

House also praised the gameplay interface, which he said "couldn't be simpler", as well as the advanced grouping and path-finding systems. Nash Werner of "GamePro" said that the formation tools were wonderful, and complained only that they could not be assigned to naval units. "Computer and Video Games" generally agreed, stating that "the controls are very user-friendly and well explained". GameSpot's <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> wrote that despite the game's improved graphics, "there's nothing foreign about its appearance" and that most game features will be "immediately recognizable if you've played a real-time strategy game before". "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" agreed, but in a negative sense—it argued that "The Age of Kings" "is essentially an update of a two-year-old game".

Richards was surprised by the quality of "The Age of Kings" graphics, considering they were all <a href="bitmap">bitmap</a>ped. However, AllGame complained that units were sometimes difficult to tell apart, a point numerous reviewers agreed on. It also called the sound of "The Age of Kings" as a negative, but not something significant enough to draw players away from the game's overall quality. IGN stated that cutscenes were somewhat bland, but that overall the graphics added "an amazing amount of detail to the actual game". IGN's main criticism was for the in-game speech used in campaigns; it rhetorically asked "why can't they just find a Frenchman to do a French accent?" Alex Constantides of "Computer and Video Games" rated the graphics highly, saying that some in-game buildings are "so grand you'll even feel guilty about burning them to the ground". Werner agreed; "the most noticeable graphical advancements", he wrote, were "the sheer size and scale of things". Game Revolution stated ""AOE2" is the best looking of the 2D RTS games out there right now".

"The Age of Kings" won GameSpot's Strategy Game of the Year in 1999, and was a nominee for <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a>. GamePower also named it Strategy Game of the Year, while "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" and "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" gave it Editor's Choice awards. The editors of "PC Gamer US" named it their 1999 "Best Real-Time Strategy Game", and wrote that it "takes everything we know about the real-time strategy genre and polishes it, and polishes it, and then polishes it some more." "The Age of Kings" won Strategy Game of the Year and Computer Game of the Year at the 2000 <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> awards. It was also nominated for Game of the Year, Outstanding Achievement in Animation, Outstanding Achievement in Game Design, and Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering. IGN ranked "The Age of Kings" the 53rd best game of all time in 2005, and the 10th best PC game of all time in 2007. <a href="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> users placed it 56th in a poll of the best games ever.

"The Age of Kings" was highly influential on its genre. "", a 2001 game by <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>, shared "The Age of Kings" game engine, and was heavily influenced by its mechanics. "<a href="Empire%20Earth">Empire Earth</a>"s design was also similar to that of "The Age of Kings"; GameSpot said it "borrows most of that game's controls, interface features, and even some of its keyboard shortcuts". <a href="Rick%20Goodman">Rick Goodman</a>, designer of "Age of Empires" and "The Rise of Rome", designed "Empire Earth". GameSpot's Scott Osborne argued that the gameplay of "" was heavily based on "The Age of Kings".

"Age of Empires II: HD Edition" received mixed reviews with aggregate review website Metacritic assigning a score of 68 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics. Critics agreed that the "HD Edition" changed very little from the original game. Daniel Starkey of Destructoid added that the reluctance to change the game features encourages "a much more aggressive, and obsessive style of play". He highlights the fact that many of the problems of trying to run the original game on a modern computer are gone, and calls its compatibility with <a href="Steam%20%28software%29%23Other%20functions">Steam's Workshop</a> "an amazing bonus".

Paul Dean of Eurogamer was less forgiving; although he agreed that the Workshop compatibility was a good addition and praised the players in the online community as "remarkably calm and friendly", he thought that the game should have been updated more, citing its "boring campaign" and poorly-aged gameplay mechanics: "It just doesn't play very well, and its flaws are more blatant than ever before". Underscoring his criticisms of the lack of significant changes to the game, he described it as "a mouldy time-capsule that will likely mar your memories of the original".

A <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> <a href="porting">port</a> was released by <a href="Konami">Konami</a> in 2001, and a <a href="Nintendo%20DS">NDS</a> spinoff, "" was released in 2006.

An expansion for "The Age of Kings", "", was released in 2000. It introduced numerous new game features, including unique technologies for each civilization, and five new civilizations. Two of these, the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s and the <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayans</a>, represent the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> and have new distinctive architectural style. Other new civilizations are the <a href="Spaniards">Spanish</a>, <a href="Huns">Huns</a>, and <a href="Koreans">Koreans</a>.

In 2005 a mobile version of "Age of Empires II" was released for Java mobile devices (J2ME), called "Age of Empires II Mobile" and developed by In-Fusio. It featured much simplified gameplay and graphics, designed for the mobile devices of the time.

The third historical game in the series, "<a href="Age%20of%20Empires%20III">Age of Empires III</a>", was released in 2005. The game portrayed the <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">European colonization of the Americas</a>. Aside from one significant feature, the <a href="Age%20of%20Empires%20III%23Home%20Cities">home city</a>, the game's design was similar to that of its predecessor.

The <a href="multiplayer">multiplayer</a>-only "<a href="Age%20of%20Empires%20Online">Age of Empires Online</a>" was released in 2012. While the game was freely accessible, it featured premium content which could either be earned through gameplay or purchased, enabling the player to use higher-tier equipment and new game modes. Active development of the game ended on January 1, 2014, when executive producer Kevin Perry stated that adding new content was "no longer cost effective," and announced that the game would be moving from "development phase" to its "support phase". The game servers were subsequently shut down on July 1, 2014.

In August 2013 an expansion pack was announced for "Age of Empires II HD", entitled "The Forgotten". It is based on the fan-made expansion, "The Forgotten Empires".

It is set in Southeast Asia, and adds four civilizations (<a href="Bamar%20people">Burmese</a>, <a href="Malay%20people">Malay</a>, <a href="Khmer%20Empire">Khmer</a>, and <a href="Vietnamese%20people">Vietnamese</a>; each with its own fully voice-acted campaign: <a href="Bayinnaung">Bayinnaung</a>, <a href="Suryavarman%20I">Suryavarman I</a>, <a href="Gajah%20Mada">Gajah Mada</a>, and <a href="L%C3%AA%20L%E1%BB%A3i">Lê Lợi</a>) as well as a new map type with environments, units, improved AI and more.

Gajah Mada

The campaign starts with a mission explaining the origins of the <a href="Majapahit">Majapahit Empire</a>, wherein <a href="Raden%20Wijaya">Raden Wijaya</a> leads the Javanese to victory against the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a>, the <a href="Singhasari">Singhasari</a>, and the <a href="Kediri%20%28historical%20kingdom%29">Kediri</a>. Gajah Mada proper then appears on the scene to rescue King <a href="Jayanegara">Jayanegara</a> from the city of <a href="Trowulan">Trowulan</a>, which is surrounded by rebels. However, Jayanegara is dissolute and is soon assassinated. His sister, <a href="Tribhuwana%20Wijayatunggadewi">Tribhuwana</a>, takes power and appoints Gajah Mada as her prime minister. Gajah Mada then swears his famous <a href="Sumpah%20Palapa">Sumpah Palapa</a> oath to unify <a href="Nusantara">Nusantara</a>, whereupon he will not eat any food containing spices until the whole Indonesian archipelago is unified. The Majapahit empire then proceeds to expand settlements to the islands of <a href="Bali">Bali</a>, <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a>, and <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, and has conflicts with the <a href="Sunda%20%28clan%29">Sunda</a>, <a href="Dharmasraya">Dhamasraya</a>, and <a href="Temasek">Temasek</a>. The queen regent then abdicates to let her now-matured son, <a href="Hayam%20Wuruk">Hayam Wuruk</a>, ascend the throne, and the Majapahit Empire then expands to the east by destroying the Docks of <a href="Makassar">Makassar</a>, <a href="Kutai">Kutai</a>, and <a href="Luwu">Luwu</a>. The sole group which remains are the Sunda, and Gajah Mada manipulates them into a trap by arranging for a marriage between his king and a <a href="Dyah%20Pitaloka%20Citraresmi">Sunda princess</a>. Whereas the Sunda believe that the marriage will result in an alliance, Gajah Mada has written into the contract that via the marriage, the Sunda will submit to Majapahit rule, unbeknownst to Hayam Wuruk. The result is the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bubat">Pasunda Bubat</a> Massacre, wherein all the Sunda princes are killed and Hayam Wuruk's bride commits suicide out of grief. Gajah Mada is then summoned to the king and exiled for his actions.

Suryavarman I

Suryavarman starts by launching a campaign against and killing King <a href="Udayadityavarman%20I">Udayadityavarman I</a> in the city of <a href="Angkor">Angkor</a>. Following the successful crushing of a rebellion led by <a href="Jayaviravarman">Jayaviravarman</a>, who is killed in the battle, Suryavarman sends an envoy through hostile territory to the <a href="Chola">Chola</a>, offering lavish gifts in exchange for an alliance against the <a href="Tambralinga">Tambralinga</a>. The Chola and Khmer then launch a <a href="two-pronged%20attack">two-pronged attack</a> against the Tambralinga and the thalassocracy of <a href="Srivijaya">Srivijaya</a>. After defeating these two powers, Suryavarman then deals with domestic threats from the <a href="Dai%20Viet">Dai Viet</a>, <a href="Cham%20people">Cham</a>, <a href="Indrapura%20%28Champa%29">Indrapura</a>, and <a href="Lavo">Lavo</a>, which have sought to take advantage of the king's distraction with foreign conquests.

Bayinnaung

1538 AD: Bayinnaung starts out as the loyal follower of King <a href="Tabinshweti">Tabinshweti</a>. Together, they march against the <a href="Hanthawaddy">Hanthawaddy</a> who harbor the <a href="Mon%20people">Mon</a> king, <a href="Takayupti">Takayupti</a>, and capture the city of <a href="Prome">Prome</a>, in spite of the raids led by the <a href="Shan%20people">Shan</a>. 1543 AD: At this time, Bayinnaung assists the king in the conquest of <a href="Ava%20Kingdom">Ava</a> by the killing of its king, <a href="Hkonmaing">Hkonmaing</a>, and fending off opposition by the Shan and the <a href="Rakhine%20people">Rakhine</a>. They must amass a sufficient sum of gold in order for Tabinshweti to be crowned in the religious city of <a href="Pagan">Pagan</a>. 1550 AD: Tabinshweti encounters a Portuguese merchant who leads him into alcoholic habits, leading to Bayinnaung acquiring increased authority as first minister. Tabinshweti is ultimately killed on orders of <a href="Smim%20Sawhtut">Smim Sawhtut</a>, and Bayinnaung must avenge his death by putting down the rebellions led by the possible pretenders, including Smim Sawhtut in his stronghold of <a href="Pegu">Pegu</a>, <a href="Rakkate">Rakkate</a>, Thado Dhamma Yaza, and <a href="Smim%20Htaw">Smim Htaw</a>. 1563 AD: Bayinnaung, now <a href="Cakkavati">Cakkavati</a> and King of the <a href="Toungoo%20Empire">Toungoo Empire</a>, seeks to expand eastward by bringing relics to the neighboring kingdoms to show his devotion. He faces the <a href="Ayutthaya%20Kingdom">Ayutthaya</a>, led by King <a href="Chakkraphat">Chakkraphat</a>, Bayinnaung's vassal <a href="Lan%20Na">Lan Na</a>, and <a href="Lan%20Xang">Lan Xang</a> along the way, in addition to various <a href="nat%20%28spirit%29">nats</a>. 1580 AD: Bayinnaung ends the campaign by entering into a meditative state as his sons <a href="Nanda%20Bayin">Nanda</a> and <a href="Thinga%20Dathta">Thinga Dathta</a> lead the conquest of the Rakhine city of <a href="Mrauk%20U">Mrauk U</a>, and lead him to the four Buddhist temples in the region.

Lê Lợi

Lê Lợi is the leader of an uprising against the <a href="Fourth%20Chinese%20domination%20of%20Vietnam">Ming Empire</a>. The campaign starts in 1418, where Lê Lợi is leading a guerrilla band in destroying all the Ming towers in the Vietnamese villages, with the help of the <a href="Tr%E1%BB%8Bnh">Trịnh</a> and <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n">Nguyễn</a> families. He then defends a fort in <a href="Ch%C3%AD%20Linh">Chí Linh</a> with the help of <a href="L%C3%AA%20Lai">Lê Lai</a>, who disguises himself as Lê Lợi and sallies forth to lead a suicidal <a href="frontal%20assault">frontal assault</a> upon the enemy, giving his life so that Lê Lợi and his troops can escape, once they have destroyed the towers to the east. Lê Lợi then advances upon <a href="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> and succeeds in capturing the city. Afterwards, he marches towards the Ming capital of <a href="Ngh%E1%BB%87%20An">Nghệ An</a>, but finds himself on the way there obliged to deal with a fortress garrisoned by <a href="Cam%20Banh">Cam Banh</a>, a vassal of the Chinese. The Chinese send in their veteran general, Wang Tong, to relieve the fortress, but he is too late to stop Lê Lợi from capturing it. Lê Lợi then splits his forces into three groups: Dinh De to lead the cavalry upon <a href="%C4%90%C3%B4ng%20%C4%90%C3%B4">Đông Đô</a> to keep Wang Tong occupied, <a href="Le%20Trien">Le Trien</a> to move north to intercept the Chinese reinforcements under Liu Sheng, and <a href="Luu%20Nhan%20Chu">Luu Nhan Chu</a> and <a href="Bui%20Bi">Bui Bi</a> to Nghệ An. Miraculously, this triple plan works, prompting the Ming to accept a peace deal. However, the local Vietnamese vassals of the Ming will not accept this, prompting a final showdown with Wang Tong. Peace is finally concluded, and <a href="Dai%20Viet">Dai Viet</a> is allowed to exist as a tributary state of the Ming.

Hooded pitohui

The hooded pitohui ("Pitohui dichrous") is a species of bird in the genus "<a href="Pitohui%20%28genus%29">Pitohui</a>" found in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. The species was long thought to be a whistler (<a href="Pachycephalidae">Pachycephalidae</a>) but is now known to be in the <a href="Old%20World%20oriole">Old World oriole</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> (Oriolidae). Within the oriole family this species is most closely related to the <a href="variable%20pitohui">variable pitohui</a>s in the genus "Pitohui", and then the <a href="figbird">figbird</a>s.

A medium-sized songbird with rich chestnut and black plumage, this species is one of the few known <a href="List%20of%20poisonous%20animals">poisonous birds</a>, containing a range of <a href="batrachotoxin">batrachotoxin</a> compounds in its skin, feathers and other tissues. These toxins are thought to be derived from their diet, and may function both to deter predators and protect the bird from parasites. The close resemblance of this species to other unrelated birds also known as pitohuis which are also poisonous is an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> and <a href="M%C3%BCllerian%20mimicry">Müllerian mimicry</a>. Their appearance is also mimicked by unrelated non-poisonous species, a phenomenon known as <a href="Batesian%20mimicry">Batesian mimicry</a>. The toxic nature of this species is well known to local hunters, who avoid it. This species is one the most poisonous species of pitohui, but the toxicity of individual birds can vary geographically.

The hooded pitohui is found in forests from sea-level up to , but is most common in hills and low mountains. A social bird, it lives in family groups and frequently joins and even leads <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a>s. The diet is made up of fruits, seeds and invertebrates. This species is apparently a cooperative breeder, with family groups helping to protect the nest and feed the young. The hooded pitohui is common and not at risk of <a href="extinction">extinction</a>.

The hooded pitohui ("Pitohui dichrous") was described by the French ornithologist <a href="Charles%20Lucien%20Bonaparte">Charles Lucien Bonaparte</a> in 1850. Bonaparte placed it in the genus "Rectes" which had been erected in the same year by <a href="Ludwig%20Reichenbach">Ludwig Reichenbach</a> as an alternative name for the genus "<a href="Pitohui%20%28genus%29">Pitohui</a>", which had been described by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Lesson">René Lesson</a> in 1831. No explanation was given for the preference of the newer name over the established older one, but it was common to prefer <a href="Latin">Latin</a> names over non-Latin names, and to provide Latin names to those without. <a href="Richard%20Bowdler%20Sharpe">Richard Bowdler Sharpe</a> encapsulated that attitude when he wrote in 1903 ""Pitohui" is doubtless an older name than "Rectes", but can surely be laid aside as a barbarous word". Eventually however the <a href="principle%20of%20priority">principle of priority</a>, which favours the first formal name given to a taxon, was applied, and "Rectes" was suppressed as the junior synonym of "Pitohui".

The hooded pitohui was placed in the genus "<a href="Pitohui%20%28genus%29">Pitohui</a>" with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian whistler family (<a href="Pachycephalidae">Pachycephalidae</a>). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be <a href="Polyphyly">polyphyletic</a> (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related <a href="variable%20pitohui">variable pitohui</a> were both found to be related to the <a href="Old%20World%20oriole">Old World oriole</a>s (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and variable pitohui were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the <a href="figbird">figbird</a>s they formed a well defined <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal clade</a> within the family. As the variable pitohui was the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> for the genus "Pitohui", the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.

The hooded pitohui is <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a>, lacking any subspecies. Birds in the south east of New Guinea are sometimes separated into a proposed subspecies, "P. d. monticola", but the differences are very slight and the supposed subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.

Pitohui, the common name for the group and the genus name, is a Papuan term for "rubbish bird", a reference to its inedibility. The specific name "dichrous" is from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word "dikhrous" for two coloured. Alternate names for the hooded pitohui include the black-headed pitohui and lesser pitohui.

The hooded pitohui is long and weighs . The adult has a black , head, chin, throat and upper breast and a black tail. The rest of the <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is a rufous chestnut. The bill and legs are black, and the <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a> are either reddish brown, dark brown or black. Both sexes look alike. Juvenile birds look like adults, except that the of the tail and of the wing are tinged with brown.

In 1990 scientists preparing the <a href="study%20skin">skins</a> of the hooded pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It was reported in 1992 that this species and some other pitohuis contained a <a href="neurotoxin">neurotoxin</a> called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of <a href="batrachotoxin">batrachotoxin</a>, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of <a href="coturnism">coturnism</a> caused by consuming quail (although toxicity in quails is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>n <a href="poison%20dart%20frog">poison dart frog</a>s from the genus "<a href="Phyllobates">Phyllobates</a>" (family <a href="Dendrobatidae">Dendrobatidae</a>). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a>. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A "cis"-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.

<a href="Bioassay">Bioassay</a>s of their tissue found that the skins and feathers were the most toxic, the heart and liver less toxic, and the skeletal muscles the least toxic parts of the birds. Of the feathers the toxin is most prevalent in those covering the breast and belly. Microscopy has shown that the toxins are sequestered in the skin in <a href="organelle">organelle</a>s analogous to <a href="lamellar%20bodies">lamellar bodies</a> and are secreted into the feathers. The presence of the toxins in muscle, heart and liver shows that hooded pitohuis have a form of insensitivity to batrachotoxins. A bird has been estimated to have up to 20 μg of toxins in its skin and up to 3 μg in its feathers. This can vary dramatically geographically and by individual, and some have been collected with no detectable toxins.

The poisonous pitohuis, including the hooded pitohui, are not thought to create the toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. "Phyllobates" frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, and the extent of the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated <a href="blue-capped%20ifrit">blue-capped ifrit</a>, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are <a href="Topical%20medication">applied topically</a> from an unknown source by the birds.

One possible source has been identified in the forests of New Guinea: <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s of the genus "<a href="Choresine">Choresine</a>" (family <a href="Melyridae">Melyridae</a>), which contain the toxin and have been found in the stomachs of hooded pitohui. An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get the toxin from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is almost exclusively insectivorous.

The function of the toxins to the hooded pitohui has been the source of debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this suggestion was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.

Another explanation for the purpose of the toxins is to mitigate the effects of parasites. In experimental conditions <a href="chewing%20louse">chewing lice</a> were shown to avoid toxic feathers of hooded pitohui in favour of feathers with lower concentrations of toxin or no toxins at all. Additionally lice that did live in the toxic feathers did not live as long as control lice, suggesting that the toxins could lessen both the incidence of infestation and the severity. A comparative study of the tick loads of wild birds in New Guinea would seem to support the idea, as hooded pitohuis had considerably fewer ticks than almost all the 30 genera examined. The batrachotoxins do not seem to have an effect on internal parasites such as "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" or the malaria-causing "<a href="Plasmodium">Plasmodium</a>".
A number of authors have noted that the two explanations, as a chemical defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations of toxins are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists to suggest that the toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.

One argument in favour of the toxin acting as a defence against predators is the apparent <a href="M%C3%BCllerian%20mimicry">Müllerian mimicry</a> in some of the various unrelated pitohui species, which all have similar plumage. The species known as pitohuis were long thought congeneric, due to their similarities in plumage, but are now spread through three families, the oriole, whistlers and <a href="Oreoicidae">Australo-Papuan bellbirds</a>. The similarity in appearance therefore presumably evolved as a shared <a href="aposematic">aposematic</a> signal to common predators of their distasteful nature. This signal is reinforced by the species' strong sour odor. There is also evidence that some other birds in New Guinea have evolved <a href="Batesian%20mimicry">Batesian mimicry</a>, where a non-toxic species adopts the appearance of a toxic species. An example of this is the non-toxic juvenile <a href="greater%20melampitta">greater melampitta</a>, which has plumage similar to the hooded pitohui.

There have also been experiments to test pitohui batrachotoxins on potential predators. They have been shown to irritate the <a href="Oral%20mucosa">buccal membranes</a> of <a href="brown%20tree%20snake">brown tree snake</a>s and <a href="green%20tree%20python">green tree python</a>s, both of which are avian predators in New Guinea. The unpalatability of the species is also known to local hunters, who otherwise hunt songbirds of the same size.

The existence of resistance to batrachotoxins and the use of those toxins as chemical defences by several bird families have led to competing theories as to its evolutionary history. Jønsson (2008) suggested that it was an ancestral adaptation in <a href="Corvoidea">Corvoidea</a> songbirds, and that further studies would reveal more toxic birds. Dumbacher (2008) argued instead that it was an example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>.

The hooded pitohui is <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the islands of New Guinea. It is found widely across the main island, and also on the nearby island of <a href="Yapen">Yapen</a>. It inhabits rainforest, forest edge habitats and secondary growth, and sometimes <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forests. It is most commonly found in hills and low mountains, between , but is found locally down to sea-level and up to . It typically occurs at higher elevations than the lowland variable pitohui and lower than the (unrelated) <a href="black%20pitohui">black pitohui</a>, although there is some overlap.

The hooded pitohui makes a variety of <a href="bird%20vocalisation">calls</a>, mostly forms of whistles. Its song is a variable collection of three to seven whistles, which can slur up or down with hesitant pauses in between. Usually the song begins with two similar notes followed by an upslur. It also makes an "tuk tuk w’oh tuw’uow" call, two whistled "woiy, woiy" notes, two downslurred whistled "tiuw tow" notes, and three whistles "hui-whui-whooee", which increase in volume.

The diet of the hooded pitohui is dominated by fruit, particularly figs of the genus "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>", grass seeds, some insects and other invertebrates, and possibly small vertebrates. Among the invertebrates found in their diet are beetles, spiders, earwigs, bugs (<a href="Hemiptera">Hemiptera</a>, including the families <a href="Membracidae">Membracidae</a> and <a href="Lygaeidae">Lygaeidae</a>), flies (<a href="Diptera">Diptera</a>), caterpillars and ants. They feed at all levels of the forest, from the forest floor to the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>, and are reported to do so in small groups, presumably of related birds. The species also regularly joins <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a>s, and on Yapen and between above sea-level it will often act as the flock leader. This leadership role, and indeed their participation in mixed flocks, is not true across all of their range however.

Little is known about the breeding biology of the hooded pitohui and its relatives due to the difficulties of studying the species high in the canopy of New Guinea. Nests with eggs of the hooded pitohui have been found from October through to February. The nest that has been described was off the ground. The nest is a cup of vine tendrils, lined with finer vines and suspended on thin branches.

The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is one to two eggs, , which are creamy or pinkish with brown to black spots and blotches and faint grey patches; in one egg all the markings with at the larger end. The incubation period is not known, but the species is thought to be a <a href="Cooperative%20breeding">cooperative breeder</a>, as more than two birds in a group have been observed defending the nest from intruders and feeding the young. Young birds, which are covered in white down as nestlings before developing their adult plumage, have been observed being fed acorn-shaped red berries and insects. Young birds will make a threat display when approached in the nest, rising up and erecting their head feathers. As chicks develop directly into adult plumage, it has been suggested that this display may be signalling its identity as a toxic species, even though young birds have not developed toxicity at that age.

The toxic and unpalatable nature of the hooded pitohui has long been known to local people in New Guinea, and this knowledge has been recorded by Western scientists as far back as 1895. In spite of this, and reports of toxicity in birds going back to classic antiquity, before the discovery that the hooded pitohui was toxic, toxicity was not a trait that scientists attributed to birds. The discovery of toxicity in birds, triggered by this species, sparked interest in the subject and a re-examination of older accounts of unpalatability and toxicity in birds, although the field is still understudied.

Common and widespread throughout New Guinea, the hooded pitohui is evaluated as a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> of Threatened Species. In one study of the effects of small subsistence gardens, populations of hooded pitohui were lower in disturbed agricultural habitat in the lowlands, compared to undisturbed forest, but actually increased in disturbed habitat higher in the mountains.

Rudolf Caracciola

Otto Wilhelm Rudolf Caracciola (30 January 1901 – 28 September 1959) was a <a href="racing%20driver">racing driver</a> from <a href="Remagen">Remagen</a>, Germany. He won the <a href="European%20Championship%20%28auto%20racing%29">European Drivers' Championship</a>, the pre-1950 equivalent of the modern <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One World Championship</a>, an unsurpassed three times. He also won the <a href="European%20Hill%20Climb%20Championship">European Hillclimbing Championship</a> three times – twice in <a href="Sports%20car%20racing">sports cars</a>, and once in Grand Prix cars. Caracciola raced for <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20in%20motorsport">Mercedes-Benz</a> during their original dominating <a href="Silver%20Arrows">Silver Arrows</a> period, named after the silver colour of the cars, and set speed records for the firm. He was affectionately dubbed "Caratsch" by the German public, and was known by the title of "Regenmeister", or "Rainmaster", for his prowess in wet conditions.

Caracciola began racing while he was working as <a href="Apprenticeship">apprentice</a> at the <a href="Fafnir%20%28automobile%29">Fafnir</a> automobile factory in <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a> during the early 1920s, first on <a href="motorcycle">motorcycle</a>s and then in cars. Racing for Mercedes-Benz, he won his first two Hillclimbing Championships in 1930 and 1931, and moved to <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20in%20motorsport">Alfa Romeo</a> for 1932, where he won the Hillclimbing Championship for the third time. In 1933, he established the privateer team Scuderia C.C. with his fellow driver <a href="Louis%20Chiron">Louis Chiron</a>, but a crash in practice for the <a href="1933%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a> left him with multiple fractures of his right thigh, which ruled him out of racing for more than a year. He returned to the newly reformed Mercedes-Benz racing team in 1934, with whom he won three European Championships, in <a href="1935%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1935</a>, <a href="1937%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1937</a> and <a href="1938%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1938</a>. Like most German racing drivers in the 1930s, Caracciola was a member of the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> group <a href="National%20Socialist%20Motor%20Corps">National Socialist Motor Corps</a> (NSKK), but never a member of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>. He returned to racing after the Second World War, but crashed in qualifying for the <a href="1946%20Indianapolis%20500">1946 Indianapolis 500</a>. A second comeback in 1952 was halted by another crash, in a sports car race in Switzerland.

After he retired, Caracciola worked as a Mercedes-Benz salesman targeting <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) troops stationed in Europe. He died in the German city of <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>, after suffering <a href="liver%20failure">liver failure</a>. He was buried in Switzerland, where he had lived since the early 1930s. He is remembered as one of the greatest pre-1939 Grand Prix drivers, a perfectionist who excelled in all conditions. His record of six <a href="German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> wins remains unbeaten.

Rudolf Caracciola was born in <a href="Remagen">Remagen</a>, Germany, on 30 January 1901. He was the fourth child of Maximilian and Mathilde, who ran the Hotel Fürstenberg. <a href="Caracciolo">His ancestors</a> had migrated during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> from <a href="Naples">Naples</a> to the German <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, where Prince Bartolomeo <a href="House%20of%20Caracciolo">Caracciolo</a> (nephew of Spanish-allegiance <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Tommaso%20Caracciolo">Tommaso Caracciolo</a>) had commanded the <a href="Ehrenbreitstein%20Fortress">Ehrenbreitstein Fortress</a> near <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>. Caracciola was interested in cars from a young age, and from his fourteenth birthday wanted to become a racing driver. He drove an early <a href="Mercedes%20%28car%29">Mercedes</a> during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, and gained his <a href="driver%27s%20license">driver's license</a> before the legal age of 18. After Caracciola's graduation from school soon after the war, his father wanted him to attend university, but when he died Caracciola instead became an <a href="Apprenticeship">apprentice</a> in the <a href="Fafnir%20%28automobile%29">Fafnir</a> automobile factory in <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>.

Motorsport in Germany at the time, as in the rest of Europe, was an exclusive sport, mainly limited to the <a href="upper%20class">upper class</a>es. As the sport became more professional in the early 1920s, specialist drivers, like Caracciola, began to dominate. Caracciola enjoyed his first success in motorsport while working for Fafnir, taking his <a href="NSU%20Motorenwerke%20AG">NSU motorcycle</a> to several victories in <a href="Endurance%20racing%20%28motorsport%29">endurance events</a>. When Fafnir decided to take part in the first race at the Automobil-Verkehrs- und Übungs-Straße (<a href="AVUS">AVUS</a>) track in 1922, Caracciola drove one of the works cars to fourth overall, the first in his class and the quickest Fafnir. He followed this with victory in a race at the Opelbahn in <a href="R%C3%BCsselsheim">Rüsselsheim</a>. He did not stay long in Aachen, however; in 1923, after punching a soldier from the <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Rhineland">occupying</a> <a href="Belgian%20Land%20Component">Belgian Army</a> in a <a href="nightclub">nightclub</a>, he fled the city. He moved to <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, where he continued to work as a Fafnir representative. In April of that year, Caracciola won the 1923 <a href="ADAC">ADAC</a> race at the <a href="Deutsches%20Stadion%20%28Berlin%29">Berlin Stadium</a> in a borrowed Ego 4 <a href="Horsepower">hp</a>. In his autobiography, Caracciola said he only ever sold one car for Fafnir, but due to <a href="Inflation%20in%20the%20Weimar%20Republic">inflation</a> by "the time the car was delivered the money was just enough to pay for the horn and two headlights".

Later in 1923, he was hired by the <a href="Daimler%20Motoren%20Gesellschaft">Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft</a> as a <a href="Automobile%20salesperson">car salesman</a> at their Dresden outlet. Caracciola continued racing, driving a Mercedes 6/25/40 hp to victory in four of the eight races he entered in 1923. His success continued in 1924 with the new <a href="Supercharger">supercharged</a> Mercedes 1.5-litre; he won 15 races during the season, including the <a href="Klausen%20Pass%23Klausen%20hill%20climb">Klausenpass</a> <a href="Hillclimbing">hillclimb</a> in Switzerland. He attended the <a href="1924%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Autodromo%20Nazionale%20Monza">Monza</a> as a reserve driver for Mercedes, but did not take part in the race. He drove his 1.5-litre to five victories in 1925, and won the hillclimbs at <a href="Kniebis">Kniebis</a> and <a href="Freiburg%20im%20Breisgau">Freiburg</a> in a Mercedes 24/100/140 hp. With his racing career becoming increasingly successful, he abandoned his plans to study mechanical engineering.

Caracciola's breakthrough year was in 1926. The <a href="1926%20German%20Grand%20Prix">inaugural German Grand Prix</a> was held at the AVUS track on 11 July, but the date clashed with a more prestigious race in Spain. The newly merged company <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a>, conscious of <a href="export">export</a> considerations, chose the latter race to run their main team. Hearing this, Caracciola took a short leave from his job and went to the Mercedes office in <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> to ask for a car. Mercedes agreed to lend Caracciola and <a href="Adolf%20Rosenberger">Adolf Rosenberger</a> two 1923 2-litre M218s, provided they enter not as <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23W">works drivers</a> but independents. Rosenberger started well in front of the 230,000 spectators, but Caracciola <a href="Stall%20%28engine%29">stalled</a> his engine. His riding mechanic, Eugen Salzer, jumped out and pushed the car to get it started, but by the time they began moving they had lost more than a minute to the leaders. It started to rain, and Caracciola passed many cars that had retired in the poor conditions. Rosenberger lost control at the North Curve on the eighth lap when trying to pass a slower car, and crashed into the <a href="timekeepers">timekeepers</a>' box, killing all three occupants; Caracciola kept driving. In the fog and rain, he had no idea which position he was in, but resolved to keep driving so he could at least finish the race. When he finished the 20th and final lap, he was surprised to find that he had won the race. The German press dubbed him "Regenmeister", or "Rainmaster", for his prowess in the wet conditions.
Caracciola used the prize money—17,000 <a href="German%20Reichsmark">Reichsmarks</a>—to set up a <a href="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes-Benz</a> dealership on the prestigious <a href="Kurf%C3%BCrstendamm">Kurfürstendamm</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. He also married his girlfriend, Charlotte, whom he had met in 1923 while working at the Mercedes-Benz outlet in Dresden. He continued racing in domestic competitions, returning again to Freiburg to compete in the Flying Kilometre race where he set a new <a href="Sports%20car%20racing">sports car</a> record in the new Mercedes-Benz 2-litre Model K, and finished first. Caracciola entered the Klausenpass hillclimb and set a new touring car record; he also won the touring car class at the <a href="Semmering%2C%20Austria">Semmering</a> hillclimb before driving a newly supercharged 1914 Mercedes Grand Prix car over the same route to set the fastest time of the day for any class. The recently completed <a href="N%C3%BCrburgring">Nürburgring</a> was the host of the 1927 <a href="Eifelrennen">Eifelrennen</a>, a race which had been held on public roads in the <a href="Eifel">Eifel</a> mountains since 1922. Caracciola won the first race on the track, and returned to the Nürburgring a month later for the 1927 German Grand Prix, but his car broke down and the race was won by <a href="Otto%20Merz">Otto Merz</a>. However, he won 11 competitions in 1927, almost all of them in the <a href="Ferdinand%20Porsche">Ferdinand Porsche</a>-developed Mercedes-Benz Model S.

Caracciola regained his German Grand Prix title at the Nürburgring at the 1928 German Grand Prix, driving the new 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SS. He shared the driving with <a href="Christian%20Werner">Christian Werner</a>, who took over Caracciola's car when the latter collapsed with heat exhaustion at a <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a>. The German Grand Prix, like many other races at the time, ignored the official Grand Prix racing rules set by the <a href="Association%20Internationale%20des%20Automobile%20Clubs%20Reconnus">Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus</a> (International Association of Recognized Auto Clubs, or AIACR), which limited weight and fuel consumption, and instead ran races under a <a href="Formula%20Libre">Formula Libre</a>, or free formula. As a result, Mercedes-Benz focused less on producing Grand Prix cars and more on sports cars, and Caracciola drove the latest incarnation of this line, the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20SSK">SSK</a>, at the Semmering hillclimb, and further reduced his own record on the course by half a second.

The inaugural <a href="Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a> was held on 14 April 1929. Caracciola, driving a 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SSK, started from the back row of the grid (which was allocated randomly), and battled <a href="Bugatti">Bugatti</a> driver <a href="William%20Grover-Williams">William Grover-Williams</a> for the lead early on. However, his pit stop, which took four and a half minutes to refill his car with petrol, left him unable to recover the time, and he eventually finished third. He won the <a href="RAC%20Tourist%20Trophy">RAC Tourist Trophy</a> in slippery conditions, and confirmed his reputation as a specialist in wet track racing. He partnered Werner in the <a href="Mille%20Miglia">Mille Miglia</a> and <a href="1930%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> endurance races in 1930; they finished sixth in the former but were forced to retire after leading for most of the race in the latter after their car's <a href="Electrical%20generator%23Vehicle-mounted%20generators">generator</a> burnt out. Caracciola took victory in the 1930 <a href="Irish%20Grand%20Prix">Irish Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Phoenix%20Park">Phoenix Park</a>, and won four hillclimbs to take the title of <a href="European%20Hill%20Climb%20Championship">European Hillclimb Champion</a> for the first time. However, he was forced to close his dealership in Berlin after the firm went bankrupt.

Mercedes-Benz officially withdrew from motor racing in 1931—citing the <a href="Great%20Depression">global economic downturn</a> as a reason for their decision—although they continued to support Caracciola and a few other drivers covertly, retaining manager <a href="Alfred%20Neubauer">Alfred Neubauer</a> to run the 'independent' operation. In part because of the financial situation, Caracciola was the only Mercedes driver to appear at the <a href="1931%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">1931 Monaco Grand Prix</a>, driving an SSKL (a shorter version of the SSK). Caracciola and <a href="Maserati%20in%20motorsport">Maserati</a> driver <a href="Luigi%20Fagioli">Luigi Fagioli</a> challenged the Bugattis of <a href="Louis%20Chiron">Louis Chiron</a> and <a href="Achille%20Varzi">Achille Varzi</a> for the lead early in the race, but when the SSKL's <a href="clutch">clutch</a> failed Caracciola withdrew from the race. A crowd of 100,000 turned out for the <a href="1931%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> at the Nürburgring. Rain began to fall before the race, and continued as Caracciola chased Fagioli for the lead in the early laps. The spray from Fagioli's Maserati severely impaired Caracciola's vision, but he was able to pass to take the lead at the Schwalbenschwanz corner. The track began to dry on lap six, and Chiron's Bugatti, which was by then running second, began to catch the heavier Mercedes. Caracciola's pit stop, completed in record time, kept him ahead of Chiron, and despite the Bugatti lapping 15 seconds faster than the Mercedes late in the race, Caracciola won by more than one minute.

Caracciola was lucky to escape from a crash in the <a href="Masaryk%20Grand%20Prix">Masaryk Grand Prix</a>. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, bringing it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron drove into a ditch at the side of the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron drove out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola drove into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20in%20motorsport">Alfa Romeos</a> battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were <a href="Stirling%20Moss">Stirling Moss</a> and <a href="Denis%20Jenkinson">Denis Jenkinson</a> in 1955.

Mercedes-Benz withdrew entirely from motor racing at the start of 1932 in the face of the economic crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a <a href="valve">valve</a> connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, "I can still see the expression on [Alfa Romeo driver <a href="Giuseppe%20Campari">Giuseppe</a>] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?"

The next race was the Monaco Grand Prix, where Caracciola was again entered as a semi-independent. He ran fourth early in the race, but moved to second as Alfa Romeo driver <a href="Baconin%20Borzacchini">Baconin Borzacchini</a> pitted for a wheel change and the <a href="axle">axle</a> on <a href="Achille%20Varzi">Achille Varzi</a>'s Bugatti broke. <a href="Tazio%20Nuvolari">Tazio Nuvolari</a>, in the other Alfa Romeo, found his lead reduced rapidly as Caracciola closed in; with ten laps remaining in the race Caracciola was so close he could see Nuvolari changing gears. He finished the race just behind Nuvolari. The crowd jeered Caracciola: they believed he had deliberately lost for the team, denying them a fight for the win. However, on the strength of his performance, Caracciola was offered a full spot on the Alfa Romeo team, which he accepted.

Alfa Romeo dominated the rest of the <a href="1932%20Grand%20Prix%20season">Grand Prix season</a>. Nuvolari and Campari drove the newly introduced <a href="Alfa%20Romeo%20P3">Alfa Romeo P3</a> at the <a href="1932%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a>, while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retired when his car broke down, but he took over Borzacchini's car when the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the <a href="1932%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>, Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo's dominance was so great and their cars so far ahead the team could choose the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the <a href="1932%20German%20Grand%20Prix">1932 German Grand Prix</a>, where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.

Caracciola performed strongly in other races; he won the Polish and <a href="Monza%20Grand%20Prix">Monza</a> Grands Prix and the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, and took five more hillclimbs to win that Championship for the third and final time. He was, however, beaten by the Mercedes-Benz of <a href="Manfred%20von%20Brauchitsch">Manfred von Brauchitsch</a> at the Avusrennen (the yearly race at the AVUS track). Von Brauchitsch drove a privately entered SSK with streamlined bodywork, and beat Caracciola's Alfa Romeo, which finished in second place. Caracciola was seen by the German crowd as having defected to the Italian team and was booed, while von Brauchitsch's all German victory drew mass support.

Alfa Romeo withdrew its factory team from motor racing at the start of the <a href="1933%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1933 season</a>, leaving Caracciola without a contract. He was close friends with the Monegasque driver Louis Chiron, who had been fired from Bugatti, and while on vacation in <a href="Arosa">Arosa</a> in Switzerland the two decided to form their own team, Scuderia C.C. (Caracciola-Chiron). They bought three Alfa Romeo 8Cs (known as Monzas), and Daimler-Benz provided a truck to transport them. Chiron's car was painted blue with a white stripe, and Caracciola's white with a blue stripe. The new team's first race was at the <a href="1933%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. On the second day of practice for the race, while Caracciola was showing Chiron around the circuit (it was Chiron's first time in an Alfa Romeo), the German lost control heading into the Tabac corner. Three of the four <a href="brake">brake</a>s failed, which destabilised the car. Faced with diving into the sea or smashing into the wall, Caracciola instinctively chose the latter. Caracciola later recounted what happened after the impact:

Caracciola was carried on a chair to the local <a href="Tabac%20%28store%29">tobacco shop</a>, and from there he went to the hospital. He had sustained multiple <a href="Bone%20fracture">fractures</a> of his right <a href="thigh">thigh</a>, and his doctors doubted he would race again. He transferred to a private clinic in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his doctors and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.

The rise to power of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and <a href="Auto%20Union">Auto Union</a>, an opportunity to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' rise to power, both companies spent the better part of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in <a href="Lugano">Lugano</a> in November with a plan to sign him for the <a href="1934%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1934 Grand Prix season</a> if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.

Upon his return to Lugano, another tragedy befell him. In February, Charlotte died when the party she was <a href="skiing">skiing</a> with in the <a href="Swiss%20Alps">Swiss Alps</a> was hit by an <a href="avalanche">avalanche</a>. Caracciola withdrew almost entirely from public life while he mourned, almost deciding to retire completely from motor racing. A visit from Chiron encouraged him to return to racing, and despite his initial reservations he was persuaded to drive the <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23L">lap of honour</a> before the 1934 Monaco Grand Prix. Although his leg still ached while he drove, the experience convinced him to return to racing.

Caracciola tested the new <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W25">Mercedes-Benz W25</a> at the AVUS track in April, and despite his injuries—his right leg had healed five  shorter than his left, leaving him with a noticeable limp—he was cleared to race. However, Neubauer withdrew the Mercedes team from their first race, also at the AVUS track, as their practice times compared too unfavourably to Auto Union's. Caracciola was judged not fit to race for the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, but made the start for the <a href="1934%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> at the same track six weeks later. He took the lead from Auto Union driver <a href="Hans%20Stuck">Hans Stuck</a> on the outside of the Karussel on the 13th lap, but retired a lap later when his engine failed. He had better luck at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix in September. In very hot weather, Caracciola started from fourth and moved to second, where he trailed Stuck. After 59 laps, the pain in his leg overwhelmed him, and he pitted, letting teammate Fagioli take over his car. Fagioli won from Stuck's car which by then had been taken over by Nuvolari. His best results in the rest of the season were a second place in the <a href="Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spanish Grand Prix</a>—he led before Fagioli passed him, much to the anger of Neubauer, who had ordered the Italian to hold position—and first at the Klausenpass hillclimb.

Caracciola took the first of his three <a href="European%20Championship%20%28auto%20racing%29">European Drivers' Championships</a> in 1935. Five Grands Prix—the <a href="1935%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian</a>, <a href="1935%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German</a>, <a href="1935%20Swiss%20Grand%20Prix">Swiss</a>, <a href="1935%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian</a> and <a href="1935%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spanish</a>—would be included for Championship consideration. He opened the Championship season with a win in Belgium, ahead of Fagioli and von Brauchitsch, who shared the other Mercedes-Benz W25. Nuvolari won a surprise victory at the Nürburgring in his Alfa Romeo P3, ahead of Stuck and Caracciola. The Swiss Grand Prix was held at the <a href="Circuit%20Bremgarten">Bremgarten Circuit</a> in <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, and Caracciola won from Fagioli and the new Auto Union star <a href="Bernd%20Rosemeyer">Bernd Rosemeyer</a>. Caracciola won the Spanish Grand Prix from Fagioli and von Brauchitsch; although his <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">transmission</a> failed at the Italian Grand Prix and he was forced to retire, his three wins allowed him to take the Championship.

In the other races of the 1935 season, Caracciola won the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring and finished second at the <a href="Penya%20Rhin%20Grand%20Prix">Penya Rhin Grand Prix</a> in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. He also won the <a href="Tripoli%20Grand%20Prix">Tripoli Grand Prix</a>, organised by the <a href="Italian%20Libya">Libyan</a> Governor-General <a href="Italo%20Balbo">Italo Balbo</a>. The Grand Prix was held in the desert, around a <a href="salt%20lake">salt lake</a>, and because of the intense heat Neubauer was concerned that the <a href="Tire">tyres</a> on the Mercedes-Benz cars would not last. Caracciola started poorly, but moved to third, after four pit stops to change tyres, by lap 30 of 40. He inherited the lead from Nuvolari and Varzi when the two Italians pitted, and held it to the finish, despite a late charge from Varzi. Caracciola later wrote that this was the race where he began to feel he had recovered from his crash in Monaco two years before, and he was now back among the contenders.

Remaining in such a position would require Mercedes-Benz to produce a competitive car for the <a href="1936%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1936 season</a>. Although the <a href="chassis">chassis</a> of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74 litres, the car proved inferior to the <a href="Auto%20Union%20Type%20C">Type C</a> developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved the chassis to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened the season with a win in the rain at the <a href="1936%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>, after starting from third position. He led the <a href="1936%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">Hungarian Grand Prix</a> early but retired with mechanical problems. At the <a href="1936%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a>, he retired with a failed <a href="fuel%20pump">fuel pump</a>, before taking over his teammate <a href="Hermann%20Lang">Hermann Lang's</a> car; he later retired that car with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the <a href="1936%20Swiss%20Grand%20Prix">Swiss Grand Prix</a> for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the <a href="List%20of%20motorsport%20terminology%23C">Clerk of the Course</a> ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola's later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a>—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.
Mercedes-Benz returned to Grand Prix racing at the start of the <a href="1937%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1937 season</a> with a new car. The <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W125">W125</a> was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 <a href="brake%20horsepower">brake horsepower</a> compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000 people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply <a href="banked%20turn">banked turn</a>, apparently at the suggestion of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Driving a <a href="Streamliner">streamlined</a> Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, <a href="Richard%20Seaman">Richard Seaman</a>, went to race in the revived <a href="Vanderbilt%20Cup">Vanderbilt Cup</a> in America, and in doing so missed the <a href="1937%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a>, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap 22, when he retired with a broken supercharger.

Caracciola started from the second row of the grid at the <a href="1937%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a>, but was into the lead soon after the start. There he remained to the finish, in front of von Brauchitsch and Rosemeyer. He took <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> at the <a href="1937%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a> three weeks later, and was soon engaged in a hard fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola's <a href="Forced%20induction">induction system</a> during a pit stop, costing him three and a half minutes. Caracciola won his second race of the season at the <a href="1937%20Swiss%20Grand%20Prix">Swiss Grand Prix</a>. Despite heavy rain which made the Bremgarten Circuit slippery and hazardous, Caracciola set a new lap record, at an average speed of , and cemented his reputation as the "Regenmeister".

For the first time, the <a href="1937%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> was held at the <a href="Livorno%20Circuit">Livorno Circuit</a> rather than the traditional venue of <a href="Autodromo%20Nazionale%20Monza">Monza</a>. Caracciola took pole position, and despite two false starts caused by spectators pouring onto the track, held his lead for the majority of the race and won from his teammate Lang by just 0.4 seconds. In doing so Caracciola clinched the European Championship for the second time. He backed up the win with another at the <a href="1937%20Masaryk%20Grand%20Prix">Masaryk Grand Prix</a> two weeks later. He trailed Rosemeyer for much of the race until the Auto Union skidded against a kerb and allowed the Mercedes into the lead.

Caracciola married for the second time in 1937, to Alice Hoffman-Trobeck, who worked as a timekeeper for Mercedes-Benz. He had met her in 1932, when she was having an affair with Chiron. She was, at that time, married to Alfred Hoffman-Trobeck, a Swiss businessman and heir to a <a href="Pharmaceutical%20industry">pharmaceutical</a> empire. She had taken care of Caracciola after Charlotte died, and shortly after began an affair with him, unbeknownst to Chiron. They were married in June in Lugano, just before the trip to America.

On 28 January 1938, Caracciola and the Mercedes-Benz record team appeared on the Reichs-<a href="Bundesautobahn%205">Autobahn A5</a> between <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> and <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>, in an attempt to break numerous speed records set by the Auto Union team. The system of speed records at the time used classes based on engine capacity, allowing modified Grand Prix cars, in this case a W125, to be used to break records. Caracciola had broken previous records—he reached in 1935—but these had been superseded by Auto Union drivers, first Stuck and then Rosemeyer. Driving a <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W125%20Rekordwagen">Mercedes-Benz W125 Rekordwagen</a>, essentially a W125 with streamlined bodywork and a larger engine, Caracciola set a new average speed of for the flying kilometre and for the flying mile, speeds which remain to this day as some of the fastest ever achieved on public roads. The day ended in tragedy however; Rosemeyer set off in his Auto Union in an attempt to break Caracciola's new records, but his car was struck by a violent gust of wind while he was travelling at around , hurling the car off the road, where it rolled twice, killing its driver. Rosemeyer's death had a profound effect on Caracciola, as he later wrote:

The Grand Prix formula was changed again in 1938, abandoning the previous system of weight restrictions and instead limiting piston displacement. Mercedes-Benz' new car, the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W154">W154</a>, proved its abilities at the <a href="1938%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>, where von Brauchitsch won ahead of Caracciola and Lang to make it a Mercedes 1–2–3. Caracciola won two races in the <a href="1938%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1938 season</a>: the <a href="1938%20Swiss%20Grand%20Prix">Swiss Grand Prix</a> and the <a href="Coppa%20Acerbo">Coppa Acerbo</a>; finished second in three: the French, <a href="1938%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German</a> and <a href="Pau%20Grand%20Prix">Pau</a> Grands Prix; and third in two: the Tripoli and <a href="1938%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian</a> Grands Prix, to take the European Championship for the third and final time. The highlight of Caracciola's season was his win in the pouring rain at the Swiss Grand Prix. His teammate Seaman led for the first 11 laps before Caracciola passed him; he remained in the lead for the rest of the race, despite losing the visor on his helmet, severely reducing visibility, especially given the spray thrown up by tyres of the many lapped cars.

The <a href="1939%20Grand%20Prix%20season">1939 season</a> took place under the looming shadow of the coming <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, and the schedule was only halted with the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a> in September. The Championship season began with the <a href="1939%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a> in June. In heavy rain, Caracciola spun at La Source, got out and pushed his car off into the safety of the trees. Later in the race, Seaman left the track at the same corner, his car bursting into flames upon impact with the trees, where he was burnt alive in the cockpit. He died that night in hospital, after briefly regaining consciousness. The entire Mercedes team travelled to <a href="London">London</a> for his burial. In the rest of the season, Caracciola won the <a href="1939%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> for the sixth and final time, again in the rain, after starting third on the grid. He finished second behind Lang at the <a href="1939%20Swiss%20Grand%20Prix">Swiss</a> and Tripoli Grands Prix. The latter race was seen as a major win for Mercedes-Benz. In an effort to halt German dominance at the event, the Italian organisers decided to limit engine sizes to 1.5 litres (the German teams at the time ran 3-litre engines), and announce the change at the last moment. The change was, however, leaked to Mercedes-Benz well in advance, and in just eight months the firm developed and built two <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W165">W165s</a> under the new restrictions; both of them beat the combined might of 28 Italian cars, much to the disappointment of the organisers. Caracciola believed that the Mercedes-Benz team were favouring Lang during the 1939 season; in a letter sent to Mercedes' brand owner <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a> <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a> Dr. Wilhelm Kissel, he wrote:

Despite Caracciola's protests, Lang was declared the 1939 European Champion by the <a href="National%20Socialist%20Motor%20Corps">NSKK</a> ("Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps", or National Socialist Motor Corps)—although this was never ratified by the AIACR, and Auto Union driver <a href="Hermann%20Paul%20M%C3%BCller">Hermann Paul Müller</a> may have a valid claim to the title under the official scoring system—and motor racing was put on hold upon the outbreak of war.

Caracciola and his wife Alice returned to their home in Lugano. For the duration of the war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of the last part of the war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. When they finally arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.

He was invited to participate in the <a href="1946%20Indianapolis%20500">1946 Indianapolis 500</a>, and originally intended to drive one of the W165s, but was unable to have them released in time. Nevertheless, he headed to America to watch the race. Joe Thorne, a local team owner, offered him one of his Thorne Engineering Specials to drive, but during a practice session before the race Caracciola was hit on the head by an object, believed to be a bird, and crashed into the south wall. His life was saved by a <a href="tank">tank</a> driver's helmet the organisers insisted he wear, in spite of which he suffered a severe <a href="concussion">concussion</a> and was in a <a href="coma">coma</a> for several days.

Caracciola returned to racing in 1952, when he was recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W194">Mercedes-Benz W194</a> in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside <a href="Karl%20Kling">Karl Kling</a> and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling finished second in the race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps because of a lack of time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the <a href="1952%20Swiss%20Grand%20Prix">1952 Swiss Grand Prix</a>, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.

After his retirement from racing, he continued to work for Daimler-Benz as a salesman, targeting <a href="NATO">NATO</a> troops stationed in Europe. He organised shows and demonstrations which toured military bases, leading in part to an increase in Mercedes-Benz sales during that period. In early 1959, he became sick and developed signs of <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a>, which worsened despite treatment. Later in the year he was diagnosed with advanced <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a>. On 28 September 1959, in <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>, Germany, he suffered <a href="liver%20failure">liver failure</a> and died, aged 58. He was buried in his home town of Lugano.

Caracciola first met <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, the leader of the Nazi Party, in 1931. Hitler had ordered a <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20770">Mercedes-Benz 770</a>, at that point Mercedes' most expensive car, but due to the amount of time spent upgrading the car in line with the Nazi leader's wishes, the delivery was late. To mollify Hitler's anger, Caracciola was dispatched by Mercedes to deliver the car to the <a href="Brown%20House%2C%20Munich%2C%20Germany">Brown House</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. Caracciola drove Hitler and his niece <a href="Geli%20Raubal">Geli Raubal</a> around Munich to demonstrate the car. He later wrote (after the fall of the Nazi Party) that he was not particularly awed by Hitler: "I could not imagine that this man would have the requirements for taking over the government someday."

Like most German racing drivers in <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, Caracciola was a member of the NSKK, a <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> organisation of the Nazi Party devoted to motor racing and motor cars; during the Second World War it handled transport and supply. In reports on races by German media Caracciola was referred to as NSKK-"<a href="Staffelf%C3%BChrer">Staffelführer</a>" Caracciola, the equivalent of a <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a>. After races in Germany the drivers took part in presentations to the crowd coordinated by NSKK leader <a href="Adolf%20H%C3%BChnlein">Adolf Hühnlein</a> and attended by senior Nazis. Although he wrote after the fall of the Nazi regime that he found such presentations dull and uninspiring, Caracciola occasionally used his position as a famous racing driver to publicly support the Nazi regime; for example, in 1938, while supporting the Nazi platform at the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Reichstag</a> elections, he said, "[t]he unique successes of these new racing cars in the past four years are a victorious symbol of our "Führer"'s (Hitler's) achievement in rebuilding the nation."

Despite this, when Caracciola socialised with the upper Nazi echelons he did so merely as an "accessory", not as an active member, and at no time was he a member of the Nazi Party. According to his autobiography, he turned down a request from the NSKK in 1942 to entertain German troops, as he "could not find it in myself to cheer up young men so that they would believe in a victory I myself could not believe in". Caracciola lived in Switzerland from the early 1930s, and despite strict currency controls, his salary was paid in <a href="Swiss%20franc">Swiss franc</a>s. During the war, he continued to receive a pension from Daimler-Benz, until the firm ceased his payments under pressure from the Nazi party in 1942.

Caracciola is remembered—along with Nuvolari and Rosemeyer—as one of the greatest pre-1939 Grand Prix drivers. He has a reputation of a perfectionist, who very rarely had accidents or caused mechanical failures in his cars, who could deliver when needed regardless of the conditions. His relationship with Mercedes racing manager Alfred Neubauer, one of mutual respect, is often cited as a contributing factor to his success. After Caracciola's death, Neubauer described him as:

His trophy collection was donated to the <a href="Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Museum">Indianapolis Hall of Fame Museum</a>, and he was inducted into the <a href="International%20Motorsports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Motorsports Hall of Fame</a> in 1998. In 2001, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, a monument to Caracciola was erected in his birth town of Remagen, and on the 50th anniversary of his death in 2009 Caracciola Square was dedicated off of the town's Rheinpromenade. Karussel corner at the Nürburgring was renamed after him, officially becoming the Caracciola Karussel. , Caracciola's record of six German Grand Prix victories remains unbeaten.

During the inaugural official meeting of the on 2 September 1953, Caracciola was inducted as one of the original three foreigners who met the club's requirements of achieving an average of over 200 mph over two runs for his past achievements prior to the club's foundation.

Geology of the Bryce Canyon area

The exposed geology of the Bryce Canyon area in <a href="Utah">Utah</a> shows a record of deposition that covers the last part of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a> and the first half of the <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> era in that part of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The ancient <a href="Sedimentary%20depositional%20environment">depositional environment</a> of the region around what is now <a href="Bryce%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Bryce Canyon National Park</a> varied from the warm shallow sea (called the <a href="Cretaceous%20Seaway">Cretaceous Seaway</a>) in which the Dakota Sandstone and the Tropic Shale were deposited to the cool <a href="stream">stream</a>s and <a href="lake">lake</a>s that contributed sediment to the colorful Claron Formation that dominates the park's amphitheaters.

Other formations were also formed but were mostly <a href="erosion">eroded</a> following uplift from the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a> which started around 70 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a> (<a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>). This event created the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> far to the east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range</a> topography around 15 mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a>s and the opening of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> by 5 mya changed the drainage of the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> and its tributaries, including the <a href="Paria%20River">Paria River</a>, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called <a href="hoodoo%20%28geology%29">hoodoo</a>s, <a href="badland">badland</a>s, and <a href="monolith">monolith</a>s we see today.

The formations exposed in the area of the park are part of the <a href="Grand%20Staircase">Grand Staircase</a>. The oldest members of this supersequence of rock units are exposed in the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a>, the intermediate ones in <a href="Zion%20National%20Park">Zion National Park</a>, and its youngest parts are laid bare in Bryce Canyon area. A small amount of overlap occurs in and around each park.

The <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rocks</a> exposed in Bryce Canyon are about 100 million years younger than those in nearby <a href="Zion%20National%20Park">Zion National Park</a>, and the rocks exposed in Zion are younger than those in the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> to the south.

There are, however, shared rock units between all three, creating a supersequence of <a href="formation%20%28geology%29">formations</a> that geologists call the Grand Staircase. Together the formations of the Grand Staircase record nearly 2000 million years of the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s history. Bryce Canyon's formations are the youngest known units in the Grand Staircase. Younger rock units, if they ever existed, have been removed by <a href="erosion">erosion</a>.

In the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, a shallow seaway spread into the interior of <a href="North%20America">North America</a> from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> in the south into <a href="Utah">Utah</a> and later to the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> in the far north. Geologists call this shallow sea the <a href="Cretaceous%20Seaway">Cretaceous Seaway</a> or Western Interior Seaway. The seaway divided North America into two halves: an eastern portion dominated by the already ancient <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> and a western part composed primarily of the still growing Sevier Mountains; formed from shallow <a href="thrust%20fault">thrust fault</a>ing caused by the <a href="Sevier%20orogeny">Sevier orogeny</a>. As the shoreline moved back and forth, the Bryce area alternated from being part of the Sevier landmass to being under the Cretaceous Seaway. Alternating layers of nonmarine, intertidal, and marine sediments lay on top of each other as a result.

<a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">Conglomerate</a>, <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>, and <a href="fossil">fossil</a>-rich <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> that together are up to thick mark the arrival of the Cretaceous Seaway. Called the <a href="Dakota%20Sandstone">Dakota Sandstone</a>, it is the oldest <a href="formation%20%28geology%29">formation</a> exposed in the Bryce Canyon area but the youngest one exposed in the Zion and Kolob canyons area to the southwest. Abundant amounts of <a href="petrified%20wood">petrified wood</a>, <a href="oyster">oyster</a> beds containing millions of fossils, and <a href="coal">coal</a> are all found in the Dakota. In the Bryce Canyon area, this formation can be seen in the <a href="Paria%20Valley">Paria Valley</a> where it is found as a lithified blanket <a href="sand">sand</a> that probably accumulated on <a href="beach">beach</a>es, in <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s, and vast coal-producing <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s as the Cretaceous Seaway transgressed (advanced inland) over the region and later retreated. It sits unconformably on much older <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> formations that are not exposed in the immediate area (see <a href="geology%20of%20the%20Zion%20and%20Kolob%20canyons%20area">geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area</a> for a discussion about these older sediments).

<a href="Mud">Mud</a> and <a href="silt">silt</a> were deposited on top of the Dakota Formation as the seaway became deeper and calmer in the area. The resulting dark gray to black <a href="Tropic%20Shale">Tropic Shale</a> records the maximum transgression of the seaway into Utah and is thick in the Paria Amphitheater. It forms the unvegetated badlands seen in the <a href="Tropic%20Valley">Tropic Valley</a> and is perhaps the most fossil-rich formation in the area; containing numerous straight-shelled and coiled <a href="ammonite">ammonite</a>s.

The Cretaceous Seaway was already retreating east and to the south by the time the locally thick <a href="Straight%20Cliffs%20Formation">Straight Cliffs Formation</a> was deposited. Its <a href="member%20%28geology%29">members</a> represent various stages in this process. The cliff-forming sandstone of the Tibbet Canyon Member was conformably deposited on top of the Tropic Shale in shallow marine and later near shore environments. Shale and sandstone from the Smoky Hollow Member were deposited on top of its basal layer of coal-rich mudstone in coastal swamps and lagoons on the shore of the seaway. While the alternating layers of shale and sandstone mixed with massive coal deposits of the John Henry Member were laid down in swamps, lagoons and <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> environments, one member, the Drip Tank, is not found in the Bryce Canyon area. This formation erodes into almost unclimbable cliffs and escarpments of whitish to yellow-gray sandstones with comparatively thin interbedded layers of shale and mudstone. <a href="Shark%20teeth">Shark teeth</a> are found in the lower parts of the formation.

Lakes and east-flowing rivers became the dominant resting place for sediment following the retreat of the Cretaceous Seaway. The shales and sandstones of the locally thick <a href="Wahweap%20Formation">Wahweap Formation</a> were deposited in moving water (fluvial setting). This formation is part of the Grey Cliffs of the Grand Staircase mentioned previously. It contains abundant fossils of <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, including <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s such as the <a href="hadrosaur">hadrosaur</a>s.

A <a href="flood%20plain">flood plain</a> crossed by rivers and lakes developed in the area. Mud and sand accumulated in this setting to become the gray sandstones and mudstones of the <a href="Kaiparowits%20Formation">Kaiparowits Formation</a>. This formation is up to thick in the Bryce Canyon area, but other parts of the Kaiparowits in the region are several hundreds of feet (tens of meters) thick. Two formations, the <a href="Canaan%20Peak%20Formation">Canaan Peak</a> and the <a href="Pine%20Hollow%20Formation">Pine Hollow</a>, sit on top of the Kaiparowits elsewhere in the region but are absent in the Bryce Canyon area. The sandstones and conglomerates of these formations record stream and river deposition starting in the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> epoch.

Uplift caused by a <a href="mountain">mountain</a>-building episode called the <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">Laramide orogeny</a> lasted from the late Cretaceous around 70 mya to the early Paleocene. This hoisted the once lower uplands skyward while low-lying <a href="Sedimentary%20basin">basins</a> between them gradually subsided. Compression from the Laramide event deformed the land in the area to form the up to 5° dipping Bryce Canyon Anticline. All of the Canaan Peak, Pine Hollow, Kaiparowits, and Waheap formations, along with part of the underlying Straight Cliffs, were removed from the anticline's crest by erosion before the Claron Formation was deposited. An <a href="angular%20unconformity">angular unconformity</a> therefore exists along the anticline's crest. The park also sits on the western gently dipping flank of the much larger <a href="Kaibab%20uplift">Kaibab uplift</a>, which was also formed as a result of the Laramide.

Uplift from the Laramide paused briefly in the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the resulting broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive <a href="flood">flood</a>s inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains. <a href="Erosion">Erosion</a> incised these deposits between flood events and <a href="plant">plant</a> growth was abundant. Oxidation of the <a href="iron">iron</a> in the mud and silt turned the soil into <a href="hematite">hematite</a>, giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up-to- -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). Channelized conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along <a href="Utah%20State%20Route%2012">State Route 12</a> while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called <a href="hoodoo%20%28geology%29">hoodoos</a>. Geologist <a href="Clarence%20Dutton">Clarence Dutton</a> called the <a href="iron%20oxide">iron oxide</a>-rich lower member of the Claron the <a href="Pink%20Cliffs">Pink Cliffs</a> series due to its colorful appearance.
A large system of shallow but expansive <a href="lake">lake</a>s and associated <a href="delta%20%28landform%29">deltas</a> covered several thousand square miles of what is now northwest <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> and southwest <a href="Utah">Utah</a> and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>. These lakes existed from the Paleocene to mid <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> but did not spread to the Bryce Canyon area until Eocene time. Large quantities of lakebed sediments were laid down in this system during the 20 million years of its existence from about 60 to 40 mya. <a href="Climate%20change">Climate change</a> and cycles caused the lakes in the system to expand and shrink through time. As they did so, they left beds of differing thickness and composition stacked atop one another;
The limey oozes and mud were later lithified into the limestone and interbedded siltstone of the up-to-300 foot (90 m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored <a href="monolith">monolith</a>s that are found only at the highest elevations of the <a href="Paunsaugunt%20Plateau">Paunsaugunt Plateau</a>. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of <a href="freshwater%20snail">freshwater snail</a>s and <a href="clam">clam</a>s, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous <a href="Natural%20Bridges%20National%20Monument">Natural Bridge</a>, were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron.

A gap in the geologic record following deposition of the Claron Formation was interrupted 34 to 31 mya by eruptions from the nearby <a href="Marysvale%20Volcanic%20Field">Marysvale volcanic field</a>, which is located northwest of the park. <a href="Volcanic%20ash">Volcanic ash</a> and <a href="lava">lava</a> from these flows are found less than from Bryce Canyon but at least some volcanic material was likely deposited directly in the park area only to be later removed by erosion.

Most of the activity at the Marysvale volcanic field occurred during three separate intervals; ~34–22 mya, 22–14 mya and 9–5 mya. <a href="Dacite">Dacite</a>s and <a href="andesite">andesite</a>s were erupted above an evolving <a href="batholith">batholith</a> in the first interval. Crystal-rich ash from the 27-million-year-old (myo) Three Creeks caldera, 24 myo Big John caldera and 23 myo Monroe Peak caldera hardened into <a href="tuff">tuff</a>. The second and third intervals saw eruptions of great quantities of <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a>s. <a href="Alkali">Alkali</a>-rich rhyolite erupted in the second interval from the 19 myo Mount Belknap caldera.

The Marysvale volcanic field collapsed under its own weight around 20 mya; likely due to weaknesses in the <a href="evaporite">evaporite</a>s of the <a href="Carmel%20Formation">Carmel Formation</a> some below. Folding and faulting of the Claron Formation from the collapse created Ruby's Inn thrust. A slight downwarp running east–west and perpendicular to the thrust motion called the Bryce syncline was also created. Volcanic activity in the Marysvale and Bryce area ceased some 500,000 years ago. <a href="Basalt">Basalt</a>ic rocks of the same age can be seen along the Sevier Fault near the entrance to Red Canyon; the dark colored volcanic rocks have been displaced by the fault some and are now in direct contact with the much older Claron Formation.

Younger rock units were laid down but were mostly removed by subsequent uplift-accelerated erosion. Outcrops of these formations can be found in the northern part of the park and in a few places on the plateau rim. Among these are the thick <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> or <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>-aged <a href="Boat%20Mesa%20Conglomerate">Boat Mesa Conglomerate</a> and the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> to early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>-aged <a href="Sevier%20River%20Formation">Sevier River Formation</a>. The Boat Mesa is made mostly of conglomerates with minor amounts of sandstone and some limestone from lakes, representing stream and overbank flood deposits. The brownish-gray sandstone and gravels of the Sevier River Formation were laid down in valleys that were part of the ancestral <a href="Sevier%20River">Sevier River</a> drainage system.

Around 15 mya in <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> time, tensional forces in <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> to the west were so great that the crust was spread thin, creating the <a href="Basin%20and%20Range%20Province">Basin and Range Province</a>. These same forces segmented what is now the western part of the <a href="Colorado%20Plateau">Colorado Plateau</a> into nine different smaller plateaus, including the <a href="Paunsaugunt%20Plateau">Paunsaugunt</a> that the park sits astride. Long, north–south-trending normal <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a> were either newly created or reactivated from older pre-existing faults; a plateau rose on one side of each fault while valleys subsided on the other as the crust was extended in an east-west direction. Two of these faults bound the Paunsaugunt Plateau; the Sevier on the west and the Paunsaugunt on the east. Movement along these two faults has displaced the Claron Formation by 2,000 feet (600 m) relative to the Paria and Sevier valleys.

The <a href="Hurricane%20Fault">Hurricane Fault</a> marks the west edge of the <a href="Markagunt%20Plateau">Markagunt Plateau</a> and is the topographic boundary between the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateaus provinces. <a href="Cedar%20Breaks%20National%20Monument">Cedar Breaks National Monument</a>, which shares almost the same exposed geology and erosional features as Bryce Canyon National Park, sits on the west edge of the Markagunt.

The entire Colorado Plateau then started to uplift from near <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> to several thousand feet (over a kilometer) in elevation. An alternate theory is that the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.

Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was significantly altered by the opening of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a>. <a href="Rift">Rift</a>ing tore <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a> northwestward from the <a href="Mexico">Mexican</a> mainland starting some 10 to 5 mya. The ancestral <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.

Formation of approximately the current depth of the Colorado River's <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. <a href="Headward%20erosion">Headward erosion</a> of one of those tributaries, the <a href="Paria%20River">Paria River</a>, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and <a href="Weathering%23Frost%20weathering">frost wedging</a> create the <a href="hoodoo%20%28geology%29">hoodoos</a>. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today.

The Pink Member of the Claron Formation is largely composed of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone. When rain combines with <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> it forms a weak solution of <a href="carbonic%20acid">carbonic acid</a>. This acid helps to slowly dissolve the limestone in the Claron Formation grain by grain. It is this process of <a href="chemical%20weathering">chemical weathering</a> that rounds the edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles.

In the winter, melting snow seeps into cracks and joints and freezes at night. The force of the expanding ice helps to erode the rock of the Claron Formation. Over 200 of these freeze/thaw cycles occur each year in Bryce Canyon. Frost wedging exploits and widens the nearly vertical joint planes that divide the Pink Member of the Claron Formation.

Internal layers of mudstone, conglomerate and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are more resistant to attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a type of <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>-rich limestone called <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a>. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.

However, the same processes that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In the case of Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 2–4 feet (0.6–1.3 m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the <a href="Sevier%20River">Sevier River</a>. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing of this can be observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.

AdS/CFT correspondence

In <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a>, the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between two kinds of physical theories. On one side are <a href="anti-de%20Sitter%20space">anti-de Sitter space</a>s (AdS) which are used in theories of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>, formulated in terms of <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a> or <a href="M-theory">M-theory</a>. On the other side of the correspondence are <a href="conformal%20field%20theory">conformal field theories</a> (CFT) which are <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theories</a>, including theories similar to the <a href="Yang%E2%80%93Mills%20theory">Yang–Mills theories</a> that describe elementary particles.

The duality represents a major advance in our understanding of string theory and quantum gravity. This is because it provides a <a href="non-perturbative">non-perturbative</a> formulation of string theory with certain <a href="boundary%20condition">boundary condition</a>s and because it is the most successful realization of the <a href="holographic%20principle">holographic principle</a>, an idea in quantum gravity originally proposed by <a href="Gerard%20%27t%20Hooft">Gerard 't Hooft</a> and promoted by <a href="Leonard%20Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a>.

It also provides a powerful toolkit for studying <a href="coupling%20%28physics%29">strongly coupled</a> quantum field theories. Much of the usefulness of the duality results from the fact that it is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear</a> and <a href="condensed%20matter%20physics">condensed matter physics</a> by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.

The AdS/CFT correspondence was first proposed by <a href="Juan%20Maldacena">Juan Maldacena</a> in late 1997. Important aspects of the correspondence were elaborated in articles by <a href="Steven%20Gubser">Steven Gubser</a>, <a href="Igor%20Klebanov">Igor Klebanov</a>, and <a href="Alexander%20Markovich%20Polyakov">Alexander Polyakov</a>, and by <a href="Edward%20Witten">Edward Witten</a>. By 2015, Maldacena's article had over 10,000 citations, becoming the most highly cited article in the field of <a href="high%20energy%20physics">high energy physics</a>.

Current understanding of <a href="gravity">gravity</a> is based on <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="general%20theory%20of%20relativity">general theory of relativity</a>. Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity in terms of the geometry of space and time, or <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>. It is formulated in the language of <a href="classical%20physics">classical physics</a> developed by physicists such as <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> and <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a>. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. Developed in the first half of the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.

<a href="Quantum%20gravity">Quantum gravity</a> is the branch of physics that seeks to describe gravity using the principles of quantum mechanics. Currently, the most popular approach to quantum gravity is <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a>, which models <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called <a href="string%20%28physics%29">strings</a>. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically considers theories of quantum gravity derived from string theory or its modern extension, <a href="M-theory">M-theory</a>.

In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is one dimension of time. Thus, in the language of modern physics, one says that spacetime is four-dimensional. One peculiar feature of string theory and M-theory is that these theories require <a href="extra%20dimensions">extra dimensions</a> of spacetime for their mathematical consistency: in string theory spacetime is ten-dimensional, while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional. The quantum gravity theories appearing in the AdS/CFT correspondence are typically obtained from string and M-theory by a process known as <a href="compactification%20%28physics%29">compactification</a>. This produces a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions and the extra dimensions are "curled up" into circles.

A standard analogy for compactification is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.

The application of quantum mechanics to physical objects such as the <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a>, which are extended in space and time, is known as <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>. In <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>, quantum field theories form the basis for our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields. Quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle-like objects called <a href="quasiparticle">quasiparticle</a>s.

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in addition to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of quantum field theory called a <a href="conformal%20field%20theory">conformal field theory</a>. This is a particularly <a href="symmetric">symmetric</a> and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the <a href="worldsheet">surface</a> swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>, where they model systems at a <a href="critical%20point%20%28thermodynamics%29">thermodynamic critical point</a>.

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers string theory or M-theory on an anti-de Sitter background. This means that the geometry of spacetime is described in terms of a certain <a href="vacuum%20solution">vacuum solution</a> of <a href="Einstein%27s%20equation">Einstein's equation</a> called <a href="anti-de%20Sitter%20space">anti-de Sitter space</a>.

In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the <a href="metric%20tensor">metric</a>) is different from the notion of distance in ordinary <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean geometry</a>. It is closely related to <a href="hyperbolic%20space">hyperbolic space</a>, which can be viewed as a <a href="Poincar%C3%A9%20disk%20model">disk</a> as illustrated on the right. This image shows a <a href="tessellation">tessellation</a> of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.

Now imagine a stack of hyperbolic disks where each disk represents the state of the <a href="universe">universe</a> at a given time. The resulting geometric object is three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. It looks like a solid <a href="cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylinder</a> in which any <a href="cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross section</a> is a copy of the hyperbolic disk. Time runs along the vertical direction in this picture. The surface of this cylinder plays an important role in the AdS/CFT correspondence. As with the hyperbolic plane, anti-de Sitter space is <a href="curvature">curved</a> in such a way that any point in the interior is actually infinitely far from this boundary surface.

This construction describes a hypothetical universe with only two space and one time dimension, but it can be generalized to any number of dimensions. Indeed, hyperbolic space can have more than two dimensions and one can "stack up" copies of hyperbolic space to get higher-dimensional models of anti-de Sitter space.

An important feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder in the case of three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any point, it looks just like <a href="Minkowski%20space">Minkowski space</a>, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.

One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which "spacetime" is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the "spacetime" for a conformal field theory. The claim is that this conformal field theory is equivalent to the gravitational theory on the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a "dictionary" for translating calculations in one theory into calculations in the other. Every entity in one theory has a counterpart in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.

Notice that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space has fewer dimensions than anti-de Sitter space itself. For instance, in the three-dimensional example illustrated above, the boundary is a two-dimensional surface. The AdS/CFT correspondence is often described as a "holographic duality" because this relationship between the two theories is similar to the relationship between a three-dimensional object and its image as a <a href="hologram">hologram</a>. Although a hologram is two-dimensional, it encodes information about all three dimensions of the object it represents. In the same way, theories which are related by the AdS/CFT correspondence are conjectured to be "exactly" equivalent, despite living in different numbers of dimensions. The conformal field theory is like a hologram which captures information about the higher-dimensional quantum gravity theory.

Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, theorists have discovered many different realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions. The theories involved are generally not viable models of the real world, but they have certain features, such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry, which make them useful for solving problems in quantum field theory and quantum gravity.

The most famous example of the AdS/CFT correspondence states that <a href="type%20IIB%20string%20theory">type IIB string theory</a> on the <a href="product%20space">product space</a> formula_1 is equivalent to <a href="N%20%3D%204%20supersymmetric%20Yang%E2%80%93Mills%20theory">N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory</a> on the four-dimensional boundary. In this example, the spacetime on which the gravitational theory lives is effectively five-dimensional (hence the notation formula_2), and there are five additional <a href="compact%20space">compact</a> dimensions (encoded by the formula_3 factor). In the real world, spacetime is four-dimensional, at least macroscopically, so this version of the correspondence does not provide a realistic model of gravity. Likewise, the dual theory is not a viable model of any real-world system as it assumes a large amount of <a href="supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a>. Nevertheless, as explained below, this boundary theory shares some features in common with <a href="quantum%20chromodynamics">quantum chromodynamics</a>, the fundamental theory of the <a href="strong%20force">strong force</a>. It describes particles similar to the <a href="gluon">gluon</a>s of quantum chromodynamics together with certain <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s. As a result, it has found applications in <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>, particularly in the study of the <a href="quark%E2%80%93gluon%20plasma">quark–gluon plasma</a>.

Another realization of the correspondence states that M-theory on formula_4 is equivalent to the so-called <a href="6D%20%282%2C0%29%20superconformal%20field%20theory">(2,0)-theory</a> in six dimensions. In this example, the spacetime of the gravitational theory is effectively seven-dimensional. The existence of the (2,0)-theory that appears on one side of the duality is predicted by the classification of <a href="super%20conformal%20field%20theory">superconformal field theories</a>. It is still poorly understood because it is a quantum mechanical theory without a <a href="classical%20limit">classical limit</a>. Despite the inherent difficulty in studying this theory, it is considered to be an interesting object for a variety of reasons, both physical and mathematical.

Yet another realization of the correspondence states that M-theory on formula_5 is equivalent to the <a href="ABJM%20superconformal%20field%20theory">ABJM superconformal field theory</a> in three dimensions. Here the gravitational theory has four noncompact dimensions, so this version of the correspondence provides a somewhat more realistic description of gravity.

In quantum field theory, one typically computes the probabilities of various physical events using the techniques of <a href="perturbation%20theory">perturbation theory</a>. Developed by <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> and others in the first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called <a href="Feynman%20diagram">Feynman diagram</a>s to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the <a href="coupling%20constant">coupling constant</a>, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory <a href="free%20field">without interactions</a>.

The starting point for string theory is the idea that the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.

The problem of developing a non-perturbative formulation of string theory was one of the original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides several examples of quantum field theories which are equivalent to string theory on anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a "definition" of string theory in the special case where the gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in the dual quantum field theory.

In 1975, <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> published a calculation which suggested that <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the <a href="event%20horizon">event horizon</a>. At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict with one of the basic <a href="postulates%20of%20quantum%20mechanics">postulates of quantum mechanics</a>, which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a>. This property is usually referred to as <a href="Unitarity%20%28physics%29">unitarity</a> of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the <a href="black%20hole%20information%20paradox">black hole information paradox</a>.

The AdS/CFT correspondence resolves the black hole information paradox, at least to some extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics in some contexts. Indeed, one can consider black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and any such black hole corresponds to a configuration of particles on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. These particles obey the usual rules of quantum mechanics and in particular evolve in a unitary fashion, so the black hole must also evolve in a unitary fashion, respecting the principles of quantum mechanics. In 2005, Hawking announced that the paradox had been settled in favor of information conservation by the AdS/CFT correspondence, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which black holes might preserve information.

One <a href="physical%20system">physical system</a> which has been studied using the AdS/CFT correspondence is the quark–gluon plasma, an exotic <a href="state%20of%20matter">state of matter</a> produced in <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s. This state of matter arises for brief instants when heavy <a href="ions">ions</a> such as <a href="gold">gold</a> or <a href="lead">lead</a> <a href="Atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> are collided at high energies. Such collisions cause the <a href="quarks">quarks</a> that make up atomic nuclei to <a href="deconfinement">deconfine</a> at temperatures of approximately two <a href="1%2C000%2C000%2C000%2C000">trillion</a> <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>s, conditions similar to those present at around formula_6 seconds after the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>.

The physics of the quark–gluon plasma is governed by quantum chromodynamics, but this theory is mathematically intractable in problems involving the quark–gluon plasma. In an article appearing in 2005, <a href="%C4%90%C3%A0m%20Thanh%20S%C6%A1n">Đàm Thanh Sơn</a> and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence could be used to understand some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory. By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, Sơn and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark–gluon plasma, the <a href="shear%20viscosity">shear viscosity</a> formula_7 and volume density of <a href="entropy">entropy</a> formula_8, should be approximately equal to a certain universal <a href="constant%20%28mathematics%29">constant</a>:

where formula_10 denotes the <a href="reduced%20Planck%27s%20constant">reduced Planck's constant</a> and formula_11 is <a href="Boltzmann%27s%20constant">Boltzmann's constant</a>. In addition, the authors conjectured that this universal constant provides a <a href="lower%20bound">lower bound</a> for formula_12 in a large class of systems. In 2008, the predicted value of this ratio for the quark–gluon plasma was confirmed at the <a href="Relativistic%20Heavy%20Ion%20Collider">Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider</a> at <a href="Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>.

Another important property of the quark–gluon plasma is that very high energy quarks moving through the plasma are stopped or "quenched" after traveling only a few <a href="femtometer">femtometer</a>s. This phenomenon is characterized by a number formula_13 called the <a href="jet%20quenching">jet quenching</a> parameter, which relates the energy loss of such a quark to the squared distance traveled through the plasma. Calculations based on the AdS/CFT correspondence have allowed theorists to estimate formula_13, and the results agree roughly with the measured value of this parameter, suggesting that the AdS/CFT correspondence will be useful for developing a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.

Over the decades, <a href="experimental%20physics">experimental</a> <a href="condensed%20matter">condensed matter</a> physicists have discovered a number of exotic states of matter, including <a href="superconductors">superconductors</a> and <a href="superfluids">superfluids</a>. These states are described using the formalism of quantum field theory, but some phenomena are difficult to explain using standard field theoretic techniques. Some condensed matter theorists including <a href="Subir%20Sachdev">Subir Sachdev</a> hope that the AdS/CFT correspondence will make it possible to describe these systems in the language of string theory and learn more about their behavior.

So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a <a href="superfluid">superfluid</a> to an <a href="insulator%20%28electricity%29">insulator</a>. A superfluid is a system of <a href="electrically%20neutral">electrically neutral</a> <a href="atoms">atoms</a> that flows without any <a href="friction">friction</a>. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using <a href="liquid%20helium">liquid helium</a>, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing <a href="lasers">lasers</a>. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the <a href="temperature">temperature</a> and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other <a href="phase%20%28matter%29">phases</a>. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole.

With many physicists turning towards string-based methods to attack problems in nuclear and condensed matter physics, some theorists working in these areas have expressed doubts about whether the AdS/CFT correspondence can provide the tools needed to realistically model real-world systems. In a talk at the <a href="Quark%20Matter%20conference">Quark Matter conference</a> in 2006, an American physicist, <a href="Larry%20McLerran">Larry McLerran</a> pointed out that the N=4 super Yang–Mills theory that appears in the AdS/CFT correspondence differs significantly from quantum chromodynamics, making it difficult to apply these methods to nuclear physics. According to McLerran,

In a letter to <a href="Physics%20Today">Physics Today</a>, <a href="Nobel%20laureate">Nobel laureate</a> <a href="Philip%20W.%20Anderson">Philip W. Anderson</a> voiced similar concerns about applications of AdS/CFT to condensed matter physics, stating

The discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 was the culmination of a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of <a href="hadron">hadron</a>s, the <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s like the <a href="proton">proton</a> and <a href="neutron">neutron</a> that are held together by the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong nuclear force</a>. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called <a href="Regge%20trajectories">Regge trajectories</a> with squared <a href="energy">energy</a> proportional to <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating <a href="Principle%20of%20relativity">relativistic</a> string.

On the other hand, attempts to model hadrons as strings faced serious problems. One problem was that string theory includes a <a href="mass">mass</a>less <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin-2</a> particle whereas no such particle appears in the physics of hadrons. Such a particle would mediate a force with the properties of gravity. In 1974, <a href="Joel%20Scherk">Joel Scherk</a> and <a href="John%20Henry%20Schwarz">John Schwarz</a> suggested that string theory was therefore not a theory of nuclear physics as many theorists had thought but instead a theory of quantum gravity. At the same time, it was realized that hadrons are actually made of quarks, and the string theory approach was abandoned in favor of quantum chromodynamics.

In quantum chromodynamics, quarks have a kind of <a href="charge%20%28physics%29">charge</a> that comes in three varieties called <a href="color%20charge">colors</a>. In a paper from 1974, <a href="Gerard%20%27t%20Hooft">Gerard 't Hooft</a> studied the relationship between string theory and nuclear physics from another point of view by considering theories similar to quantum chromodynamics, where the number of colors is some arbitrary number formula_15, rather than three. In this article, 't Hooft considered a certain limit where formula_15 tends to infinity and argued that in this limit certain calculations in quantum field theory resemble calculations in string theory.

In 1975, Stephen Hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of <a href="Jacob%20Bekenstein">Jacob Bekenstein</a> who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict one of the main postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction came to be known as the black hole information paradox.

Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a speculative paper on quantum gravity in which he revisited Hawking's work on <a href="black%20hole%20thermodynamics">black hole thermodynamics</a>, concluding that the total number of <a href="degree%20of%20freedom">degrees of freedom</a> in a region of spacetime surrounding a black hole is proportional to the <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a> of the horizon. This idea was promoted by <a href="Leonard%20Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a> and is now known as the <a href="holographic%20principle">holographic principle</a>. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.

In late 1997, <a href="Juan%20Maldacena">Juan Maldacena</a> published a landmark paper that initiated the study of AdS/CFT. According to <a href="Alexander%20Markovich%20Polyakov">Alexander Markovich Polyakov</a>, "[Maldacena's] work opened the flood gates." The conjecture immediately excited great interest in the string theory community and was considered in articles by <a href="Steven%20Gubser">Steven Gubser</a>, <a href="Igor%20Klebanov">Igor Klebanov</a> and Polyakov, and by <a href="Edward%20Witten">Edward Witten</a>. These papers made Maldacena's conjecture more precise and showed that the conformal field theory appearing in the correspondence lives on the boundary of anti-de Sitter space.

One special case of Maldacena's proposal says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a <a href="gauge%20theory">gauge theory</a> similar in some ways to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in <a href="high%20energy%20physics">high energy physics</a> with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been <a href="mathematical%20rigor">rigorously proved</a>.

In 1999, after taking a job at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, nuclear physicist Đàm Thanh Sơn paid a visit to Andrei Starinets, a friend from Sơn's undergraduate days who happened to be doing a Ph.D. in string theory at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>. Although the two men had no intention of collaborating, Sơn soon realized that the AdS/CFT calculations Starinets was doing could shed light on some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma, an exotic state of matter produced when heavy <a href="ion">ion</a>s are collided at high energies. In collaboration with Starinets and Pavel Kovtun, Sơn was able to use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate a key parameter of the plasma. As Sơn later recalled, "We turned the calculation on its head to give us a prediction for the value of the shear viscosity of a plasma ... A friend of mine in nuclear physics joked that ours was the first useful paper to come out of string theory."

Today physicists continue to look for applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence in quantum field theory. In addition to the applications to nuclear physics advocated by Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators, condensed matter physicists such as Subir Sachdev have used string theory methods to understand some aspects of condensed matter physics. A notable result in this direction was the description, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, of the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. Another emerging subject is the fluid/gravity correspondence, which uses the AdS/CFT correspondence to translate problems in <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a> into problems in general relativity.

In order to better understand the quantum aspects of gravity in our <a href="four-dimensional">four-dimensional</a> universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional <a href="mathematical%20model">mathematical model</a> in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.

Beginning with the work of J. D. Brown and <a href="Marc%20Henneaux">Marc Henneaux</a> in 1986, physicists have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as <a href="Liouville%20field%20theory">Liouville field theory</a>. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with <a href="monster%20group">monster group</a> symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.

Unlike our universe, which is now known to be expanding at an accelerating rate, anti-de Sitter space is neither expanding nor contracting. Instead it looks the same at all times. In more technical language, one says that anti-de Sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a>, whereas the real universe has a small positive cosmological constant.

Although the properties of gravity at short distances should be somewhat independent of the value of the cosmological constant, it is desirable to have a version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for positive cosmological constant. In 2001, <a href="Andrew%20Strominger">Andrew Strominger</a> introduced a version of the duality called the <a href="dS/CFT%20correspondence">dS/CFT correspondence</a>. This duality involves a model of spacetime called <a href="de%20Sitter%20space">de Sitter space</a> with a positive cosmological constant. Such a duality is interesting from the point of view of <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> since many cosmologists believe that the very early universe was close to being de Sitter space. Our universe may also resemble de Sitter space in the distant future.

Although the AdS/CFT correspondence is often useful for studying the properties of black holes, most of the black holes considered in the context of AdS/CFT are physically unrealistic. Indeed, as explained above, most versions of the AdS/CFT correspondence involve higher-dimensional models of spacetime with unphysical supersymmetry.

In 2009, Monica Guica, Thomas Hartman, Wei Song, and Andrew Strominger showed that the ideas of AdS/CFT could nevertheless be used to understand certain <a href="astrophysical">astrophysical</a> black holes. More precisely, their results apply to black holes that are approximated by <a href="extremal%20black%20hole">extremal</a> <a href="Kerr%20black%20hole">Kerr black hole</a>s, which have the largest possible angular momentum compatible with a given mass. They showed that such black holes have an equivalent description in terms of conformal field theory. The Kerr/CFT correspondence was later extended to black holes with lower angular momentum.

The AdS/CFT correspondence is closely related to another duality conjectured by Igor Klebanov and Alexander Markovich Polyakov in 2002. This duality states that certain "higher spin gauge theories" on anti-de Sitter space are equivalent to conformal field theories with <a href="orthogonal%20group">O(N)</a> symmetry. Here the theory in the bulk is a type of gauge theory describing particles of arbitrarily high spin. It is similar to string theory, where the excited modes of vibrating strings correspond to particles with higher spin, and it may help to better understand the string theoretic versions of AdS/CFT and possibly even <a href="mathematical%20proof">prove</a> the correspondence. In 2010, Simone Giombi and Xi Yin obtained further evidence for this duality by computing quantities called <a href="correlation%20function%20%28quantum%20field%20theory%29">three-point functions</a>.

Mirror symmetry (string theory)

In <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a> and <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a>, mirror symmetry is a relationship between <a href="geometry">geometric</a> objects called <a href="Calabi%E2%80%93Yau%20manifold">Calabi–Yau manifold</a>s. The term refers to a situation where two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as <a href="extra%20dimension">extra dimension</a>s of <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a>.

Mirror symmetry was originally discovered by physicists. Mathematicians became interested in this relationship around 1990 when <a href="Philip%20Candelas">Philip Candelas</a>, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that it could be used as a tool in <a href="enumerative%20geometry">enumerative geometry</a>, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the number of solutions to geometric questions. Candelas and his collaborators showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count <a href="rational%20curve">rational curve</a>s on a Calabi–Yau manifold, thus solving a longstanding problem. Although the original approach to mirror symmetry was based on physical ideas that were not understood in a mathematically precise way, some of its mathematical predictions have since been <a href="mathematical%20proof">proven rigorously</a>.

Today, mirror symmetry is a major research topic in <a href="pure%20mathematics">pure mathematics</a>, and mathematicians are working to develop a mathematical understanding of the relationship based on physicists' intuition. Mirror symmetry is also a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory, and it has been used to understand aspects of <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>, the formalism that physicists use to describe <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s. Major approaches to mirror symmetry include the <a href="homological%20mirror%20symmetry">homological mirror symmetry</a> program of <a href="Maxim%20Kontsevich">Maxim Kontsevich</a> and the <a href="SYZ%20conjecture">SYZ conjecture</a> of <a href="Andrew%20Strominger">Andrew Strominger</a>, <a href="Shing-Tung%20Yau">Shing-Tung Yau</a>, and <a href="Eric%20Zaslow">Eric Zaslow</a>.

In physics, <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a> is a <a href="mathematical%20theory">theoretical framework</a> in which the <a href="point%20particle">point-like particles</a> of <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> are replaced by <a href="one%20dimensional">one-dimensional</a> objects called <a href="string%20%28physics%29">strings</a>. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its <a href="mass">mass</a>, <a href="charge%20%28physics%29">charge</a>, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.

There are notable differences between the world described by string theory and the everyday world. In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is one dimension of time (later/earlier). Thus, in the language of modern physics, one says that <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> is four-dimensional. One of the peculiar features of string theory is that it requires <a href="extra%20dimensions">extra dimensions</a> of spacetime for its mathematical consistency. In <a href="superstring%20theory">superstring theory</a>, the version of the theory that incorporates a theoretical idea called <a href="supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a>, there are six extra dimensions of spacetime in addition to the four that are familiar from everyday experience.

One of the goals of current research in string theory is to develop models in which the strings represent particles observed in high energy physics experiments. For such a model to be consistent with observations, its spacetime must be four-dimensional at the relevant distance scales, so one must look for ways to restrict the extra dimensions to smaller scales. In most realistic models of physics based on string theory, this is accomplished by a process called <a href="compactification%20%28physics%29">compactification</a>, in which the extra dimensions are assumed to "close up" on themselves to form circles. In the limit where these curled up dimensions become very small, one obtains a theory in which spacetime has effectively a lower number of dimensions. A standard analogy for this is to consider a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling on the surface of the hose would move in two dimensions.

Compactification can be used to construct models in which spacetime is effectively four-dimensional. However, not every way of compactifying the extra dimensions produces a model with the right properties to describe nature. In a viable model of particle physics, the compact extra dimensions must be shaped like a <a href="Calabi%E2%80%93Yau%20manifold">Calabi–Yau manifold</a>. A Calabi–Yau manifold is a special <a href="topological%20space">space</a> which is typically taken to be six-dimensional in applications to string theory. It is named after mathematicians <a href="Eugenio%20Calabi">Eugenio Calabi</a> and <a href="Shing-Tung%20Yau">Shing-Tung Yau</a>.

After Calabi–Yau manifolds had entered physics as a way to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, <a href="Cumrun%20Vafa">Cumrun Vafa</a>, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions of string theory called <a href="type%20IIA%20string%20theory">type IIA string theory</a> and <a href="type%20IIB">type IIB</a> can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.

The mirror symmetry relationship is a particular example of what physicists call a <a href="string%20duality">duality</a>. In general, the term "duality" refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical theories turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory can be transformed so it looks just like another theory, the two are said to be dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities play an important role in modern physics, especially in string theory.

Regardless of whether Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide a correct description of nature, the existence of the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in <a href="pure%20mathematics">pure mathematics</a>, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in <a href="enumerative%20geometry">enumerative algebraic geometry</a>, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions. A classical problem of enumerative geometry is to enumerate the <a href="rational%20curve">rational curve</a>s on a Calabi–Yau manifold such as the one illustrated above. By applying mirror symmetry, mathematicians have translated this problem into an equivalent problem for the mirror Calabi–Yau, which turns out to be easier to solve.

In physics, mirror symmetry is justified on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require <a href="mathematical%20rigor">rigorous proofs</a> that do not require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of mirror symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of mirror symmetry in the context of <a href="topological%20string%20theory">topological string theory</a>, a simplified version of string theory introduced by <a href="Edward%20Witten">Edward Witten</a>, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, mirror symmetry states that two theories called the <a href="Topological%20A-model">A-model</a> and <a href="Topological%20B-model">B-model</a> are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today mirror symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of mirror symmetry based on physicists' intuition.

The idea of mirror symmetry can be traced back to the mid-1980s when it was noticed that a string propagating on a circle of radius formula_1 is physically equivalent to a string propagating on a circle of radius formula_2 in appropriate <a href="units%20of%20measurements">units</a>. This phenomenon is now known as <a href="T-duality">T-duality</a> and is understood to be closely related to mirror symmetry. In a paper from 1985, <a href="Philip%20Candelas">Philip Candelas</a>, Gary Horowitz, <a href="Andrew%20Strominger">Andrew Strominger</a>, and Edward Witten showed that by compactifying string theory on a Calabi–Yau manifold, one obtains a theory roughly similar to the <a href="standard%20model%20of%20particle%20physics">standard model of particle physics</a> that also consistently incorporates an idea called supersymmetry. Following this development, many physicists began studying Calabi–Yau compactifications, hoping to construct realistic models of particle physics based on string theory. Cumrun Vafa and others noticed that given such a physical model, it is not possible to reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, there are two Calabi–Yau manifolds that give rise to the same physics.

By studying the relationship between Calabi–Yau manifolds and certain <a href="conformal%20field%20theory">conformal field theories</a> called Gepner models, <a href="Brian%20Greene">Brian Greene</a> and Ronen Plesser found nontrivial examples of the mirror relationship. Further evidence for this relationship came from the work of Philip Candelas, Monika Lynker, and Rolf Schimmrigk, who surveyed a large number of Calabi–Yau manifolds by computer and found that they came in mirror pairs.

Mathematicians became interested in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry could be used to solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for decades or more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the <a href="Mathematical%20Sciences%20Research%20Institute">Mathematical Sciences Research Institute</a> (MSRI) in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a> in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by <a href="Norwegians">Norwegian</a> mathematicians <a href="Geir%20Ellingsrud">Geir Ellingsrud</a> and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.

In 1990, Edward Witten introduced topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory, and physicists showed that there is a version of mirror symmetry for topological string theory. This statement about topological string theory is usually taken as the definition of mirror symmetry in the mathematical literature. In an address at the <a href="International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a> in 1994, mathematician <a href="Maxim%20Kontsevich">Maxim Kontsevich</a> presented a new mathematical conjecture based on the physical idea of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. Known as <a href="homological%20mirror%20symmetry">homological mirror symmetry</a>, this conjecture formalizes mirror symmetry as an equivalence of two mathematical structures: the <a href="derived%20category">derived category</a> of <a href="coherent%20sheaves">coherent sheaves</a> on a Calabi–Yau manifold and the <a href="Fukaya%20category">Fukaya category</a> of its mirror.

Also around 1995, Kontsevich analyzed the results of Candelas, which gave a general formula for the problem of counting rational curves on a <a href="quintic%20threefold">quintic threefold</a>, and he reformulated these results as a precise mathematical conjecture. In 1996, <a href="Alexander%20Givental">Alexander Givental</a> posted a paper that claimed to prove this conjecture of Kontsevich. Initially, many mathematicians found this paper hard to understand, so there were doubts about its correctness. Subsequently, Bong Lian, <a href="Kefeng%20Liu">Kefeng Liu</a>, and Shing-Tung Yau published an independent proof in a series of papers. Despite controversy over who had published the first proof, these papers are now collectively seen as providing a mathematical proof of the results originally obtained by physicists using mirror symmetry. In 2000, Kentaro Hori and Cumrun Vafa gave another physical proof of mirror symmetry based on T-duality.

Work on mirror symmetry continues today with major developments in the context of strings on <a href="Riemann%20surface">surfaces</a> with boundaries. In addition, mirror symmetry has been related to many active areas of mathematics research, such as the <a href="McKay%20correspondence">McKay correspondence</a>, <a href="topological%20quantum%20field%20theory">topological quantum field theory</a>, and the theory of <a href="wall-crossing">stability conditions</a>. At the same time, basic questions continue to vex. For example, mathematicians still lack an understanding of how to construct examples of mirror Calabi–Yau pairs though there has been progress in understanding this issue.

Many of the important mathematical applications of mirror symmetry belong to the branch of mathematics called enumerative geometry. In enumerative geometry, one is interested in counting the number of solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 <a href="BCE">BCE</a> by the ancient Greek mathematician <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius</a>, who asked how many circles in the plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, the solution to the <a href="problem%20of%20Apollonius">problem of Apollonius</a> is that there are eight such circles.
Enumerative problems in mathematics often concern a class of geometric objects called <a href="algebraic%20varieties">algebraic varieties</a> which are defined by the vanishing of <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a>s. For example, the <a href="Clebsch%20cubic">Clebsch cubic</a> (see the illustration) is defined using a certain polynomial of <a href="degree%20of%20a%20polynomial">degree</a> three in four variables. A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians <a href="Arthur%20Cayley">Arthur Cayley</a> and <a href="George%20Salmon">George Salmon</a> states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.

Generalizing this problem, one can ask how many lines can be drawn on a quintic Calabi–Yau manifold, such as the one illustrated above, which is defined by a polynomial of degree five. This problem was solved by the nineteenth-century German mathematician <a href="Hermann%20Schubert">Hermann Schubert</a>, who found that there are exactly 2,875 such lines. In 1986, geometer Sheldon Katz proved that the number of curves, such as circles, that are defined by polynomials of degree two and lie entirely in the quintic is 609,250.

By the year 1991, most of the classical problems of enumerative geometry had been solved and interest in enumerative geometry had begun to diminish. According to mathematician Mark Gross, "As the old problems had been solved, people went back to check Schubert's numbers with modern techniques, but that was getting pretty stale." The field was reinvigorated in May 1991 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry could be used to count the number of degree three curves on a quintic Calabi–Yau. Candelas and his collaborators found that these six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifolds can contain exactly 317,206,375 curves of degree three.

In addition to counting degree-three curves on a quintic three-fold, Candelas and his collaborators obtained a number of more general results for counting rational curves which went far beyond the results obtained by mathematicians. Although the methods used in this work were based on physical intuition, mathematicians have gone on to <a href="mathematical%20proof">prove rigorously</a> some of the predictions of mirror symmetry. In particular, the enumerative predictions of mirror symmetry have now been rigorously proven.

In addition to its applications in enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry is a fundamental tool for doing calculations in string theory. In the A-model of topological string theory, physically interesting quantities are expressed in terms of infinitely many numbers called <a href="Gromov%E2%80%93Witten%20invariant">Gromov–Witten invariant</a>s, which are extremely difficult to compute. In the B-model, the calculations can be reduced to classical <a href="integral">integral</a>s and are much easier. By applying mirror symmetry, theorists can translate difficult calculations in the A-model into equivalent but technically easier calculations in the B-model. These calculations are then used to determine the probabilities of various physical processes in string theory. Mirror symmetry can be combined with other dualities to translate calculations in one theory into equivalent calculations in a different theory. By outsourcing calculations to different theories in this way, theorists can calculate quantities that are impossible to calculate without the use of dualities.

Outside of string theory, mirror symmetry is used to understand aspects of <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>, the formalism that physicists use to describe <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s. For example, <a href="gauge%20theory">gauge theories</a> are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics and other parts of theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which are not part of the standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, mirror symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, mirror symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by <a href="Nathan%20Seiberg">Nathan Seiberg</a> and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of <a href="Donaldson%20invariant">Donaldson invariant</a>s. There is also a generalization of mirror symmetry called <a href="3D%20mirror%20symmetry">3D mirror symmetry</a> which relates pairs of quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions.

In string theory and related theories in physics, a "<a href="brane">brane</a>" is a physical object that generalizes the notion of a point particle to higher dimensions. For example, a point particle can be viewed as a brane of dimension zero, while a string can be viewed as a brane of dimension one. It is also possible to consider higher-dimensional branes. The word brane comes from the word "membrane" which refers to a two-dimensional brane.

In string theory, a string may be open (forming a segment with two endpoints) or closed (forming a closed loop). <a href="D-brane">D-brane</a>s are an important class of branes that arise when one considers open strings. As an open string propagates through spacetime, its endpoints are required to lie on a D-brane. The letter "D" in D-brane refers to a condition that it satisfies, the <a href="Dirichlet%20boundary%20condition">Dirichlet boundary condition</a>.

Mathematically, branes can be described using the notion of a <a href="category%20%28mathematics%29">category</a>. This is a mathematical structure consisting of "objects", and for any pair of objects, a set of "<a href="morphisms">morphisms</a>" between them. In most examples, the objects are mathematical structures (such as <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">sets</a>, <a href="vector%20spaces">vector spaces</a>, or <a href="topological%20spaces">topological spaces</a>) and the morphisms are <a href="function%20%28mathematics%29">functions</a> between these structures. One can also consider categories where the objects are D-branes and the morphisms between two branes formula_3 and formula_4 are <a href="wavefunction">states</a> of open strings stretched between formula_3 and formula_4.

In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes are <a href="complex%20manifold">complex submanifold</a>s of a Calabi–Yau together with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one can think of a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent sheaves on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call <a href="special%20Lagrangian%20submanifold">special Lagrangian submanifold</a>s. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.

The derived category of coherent sheaves is constructed using tools from <a href="complex%20geometry">complex geometry</a>, a branch of mathematics that describes geometric curves in algebraic terms and solves geometric problems using <a href="algebraic%20equation">algebraic equation</a>s. On the other hand, the Fukaya category is constructed using <a href="symplectic%20geometry">symplectic geometry</a>, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of <a href="classical%20physics">classical physics</a>. Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a <a href="symplectic%20form">symplectic form</a>, a mathematical tool that can be used to compute <a href="area">area</a> in two-dimensional examples.

The homological mirror symmetry conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich states that the derived category of coherent sheaves on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent in a certain sense to the Fukaya category of its mirror. This equivalence provides a precise mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. In addition, it provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and symplectic geometry.

Another approach to understanding mirror symmetry was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and <a href="Eric%20Zaslow">Eric Zaslow</a> in 1996. According to their conjecture, now known as the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can be understood by dividing a Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces and then transforming them to get the mirror Calabi–Yau.

The simplest example of a Calabi–Yau manifold is a two-dimensional <a href="torus">torus</a> or donut shape. Consider a circle on this surface that goes once through the hole of the donut. An example is the red circle in the figure. There are infinitely many circles like it on a torus; in fact, the entire surface is a <a href="union%20%28set%20theory%29">union</a> of such circles.

One can choose an auxiliary circle formula_7 (the pink circle in the figure) such that each of the infinitely many circles decomposing the torus passes through a point of formula_7. This auxiliary circle is said to "parametrize" the circles of the decomposition, meaning there is a correspondence between them and points of formula_7. The circle formula_7 is more than just a list, however, because it also determines how these circles are arranged on the torus. This auxiliary space plays an important role in the SYZ conjecture.

The idea of dividing a torus into pieces parametrized by an auxiliary space can be generalized. Increasing the dimension from two to four real dimensions, the Calabi–Yau becomes a <a href="K3%20surface">K3 surface</a>. Just as the torus was decomposed into circles, a four-dimensional K3 surface can be decomposed into two-dimensional tori. In this case the space formula_7 is an ordinary <a href="sphere">sphere</a>. Each point on the sphere corresponds to one of the two-dimensional tori, except for twenty-four "bad" points corresponding to "pinched" or <a href="mathematical%20singularity">singular</a> tori.

The Calabi–Yau manifolds of primary interest in string theory have six dimensions. One can divide such a manifold into <a href="3-torus">3-tori</a> (three-dimensional objects that generalize the notion of a torus) parametrized by a <a href="3-sphere">3-sphere</a> formula_7 (a three-dimensional generalization of a sphere). Each point of formula_7 corresponds to a 3-torus, except for infinitely many "bad" points which form a grid-like pattern of segments on the Calabi–Yau and correspond to singular tori.

Once the Calabi–Yau manifold has been decomposed into simpler parts, mirror symmetry can be understood in an intuitive geometric way. As an example, consider the torus described above. Imagine that this torus represents the "spacetime" for a <a href="physical%20theory">physical theory</a>. The fundamental objects of this theory will be strings propagating through the spacetime according to the rules of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>. One of the basic dualities of string theory is T-duality, which states that a string propagating around a circle of radius formula_1 is equivalent to a string propagating around a circle of radius formula_2 in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, a string has <a href="momentum">momentum</a> as it propagates around a circle, and it can also wind around the circle one or more times. The number of times the string winds around a circle is called the <a href="winding%20number">winding number</a>. If a string has momentum formula_16 and winding number formula_17 in one description, it will have momentum formula_17 and winding number formula_16 in the dual description. By applying T-duality simultaneously to all of the circles that decompose the torus, the radii of these circles become inverted, and one is left with a new torus which is "fatter" or "skinnier" than the original. This torus is the mirror of the original Calabi–Yau.

T-duality can be extended from circles to the two-dimensional tori appearing in the decomposition of a K3 surface or to the three-dimensional tori appearing in the decomposition of a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. In general, the SYZ conjecture states that mirror symmetry is equivalent to the simultaneous application of T-duality to these tori. In each case, the space formula_7 provides a kind of blueprint that describes how these tori are assembled into a Calabi–Yau manifold.

Horseshoe Curve is a three-track <a href="railroad">railroad</a> <a href="Horseshoe%20curve">curve</a> on <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a>'s <a href="Pittsburgh%20Line">Pittsburgh Line</a> in <a href="Blair%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Blair County</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. The curve itself is about long and in diameter; it was completed in 1854 by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> as a way to lessen the grade to the summit of the <a href="Allegheny%20Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</a>. It eventually replaced the time-consuming <a href="Allegheny%20Portage%20Railroad">Allegheny Portage Railroad</a>, the only other route across the mountains for large vehicles.

The rail line has been important since its opening, and during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the Curve was targeted by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> in 1942 as part of <a href="Operation%20Pastorius">Operation Pastorius</a>. The Curve was later owned and used by Pennsylvania Railroad successors <a href="Penn%20Central%20Transportation%20Company">Penn Central</a>, <a href="Conrail">Conrail</a>, and Norfolk Southern. Horseshoe Curve was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> and designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1966, and it became a <a href="National%20Historic%20Civil%20Engineering%20Landmark">National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark</a> in 2004.

Horseshoe Curve has long been a tourist attraction, as a trackside observation park had been completed in 1879. The park was renovated and a <a href="visitor%20center">visitor center</a> built in the early 1990s. The <a href="Railroaders%20Memorial%20Museum">Railroaders Memorial Museum</a> in Altoona manages the center, which has exhibits pertaining to the curve.

Horseshoe Curve is on the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Line">Pittsburgh Line</a>, the <a href="Norfolk%20Southern%20Railway">Norfolk Southern Railway</a> Pittsburgh Division main line between <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> and <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a>, Pennsylvania. Westbound trains climb a maximum grade of 1.85 percent for from Altoona to <a href="Gallitzin%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gallitzin</a>; just west of the <a href="Gallitzin%20Tunnel">Gallitzin Tunnel</a>s trains pass the summit of the <a href="Allegheny%20Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</a>, then descend for to <a href="Johnstown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Johnstown</a> on a grade of 1.1 percent or less.

The curve is west of Altoona in <a href="Logan%20Township%2C%20Blair%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Logan Township</a>, <a href="Blair%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Blair County</a> at railroad milepost 242. The Blair County Veterans Memorial Highway (SR 4008) follows the valley west from Altoona and tunnels under the curve. Horseshoe Curve bends around a dam and lake, the highest of three reservoirs along the valley which are owned by the Altoona Water Authority and supply water to the city. Horseshoe Curve spans two ravines formed by creeks: <a href="Kittanning%20Run">Kittanning Run</a> on the north side of the valley, and <a href="Glenwhite%20Run">Glenwhite Run</a> on the south.

For every , the tracks at the Horseshoe Curve bend 9 degrees and 15 <a href="minute%20of%20arc">minutes</a> with the entire curve totaling 220 degrees. The curve is long and, at its widest, about across. The Horseshoe Curve descends from an approximate elevation of on the southern side to on the northern. The grade of the curve was listed by the Pennsylvania Railroad as 1.45 percent, and currently as 1.34 percent by Norfolk Southern. Each track consists of , <a href="continuous%20welded%20rail">welded</a> rails that were, , laid in 2011. Prior to <a href="dieselisation">dieselization</a> and the introduction of <a href="dynamic%20braking">dynamic braking</a> and rail oilers, the rails along the curve would be transposed—left to right and vice versa—to equalize the wear on each rail from the <a href="flange">flange</a>s of passing steam locomotives and rail cars, thereby extending their lifespan.

In 1834 the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Pennsylvania">Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</a> built the <a href="Allegheny%20Portage%20Railroad">Allegheny Portage Railroad</a> across the Allegheny Mountains to connect <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and Pittsburgh, as part of the <a href="Main%20Line%20of%20Public%20Works">Main Line of Public Works</a>. The Portage Railroad was a series of canals and <a href="funicular">inclined planes</a> and remained in use until the mid-19th century. The <a href="Pennsylvania%20Railroad">Pennsylvania Railroad</a> was incorporated in 1847 to build a railroad from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh, replacing the cumbersome Portage Railroad.

Using surveys completed in 1842, the state's engineers recommended a route west from <a href="Lewistown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lewistown</a> that followed the ridges with a maximum <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a> of 0.852 percent on the line. The Chief Engineer for the Pennsylvania Railroad, <a href="John%20Edgar%20Thomson">John Edgar Thomson</a>, instead chose a route on lower, flatter terrain along the <a href="Juniata%20River">Juniata River</a> and accepted the resulting steeper grade west of Altoona. The valley west of Altoona was split into two <a href="ravine">ravine</a>s by a mountain; surveys had already found a route with an acceptable grade east from Gallitzin to the south side of the valley, and Horseshoe Curve allowed the same grade to continue to Altoona. Engineers built an earth <a href="embankment%20%28transportation%29">fill</a> over the first ravine encountered while ascending, formed by Kittanning Run, <a href="cut%20%28earthmoving%29">cut</a> the point of the mountain between the ravines, and filled in the second ravine, formed by Glenwhite Run.

Work on Horseshoe Curve began in 1850 and took over three years. It was done without <a href="heavy%20equipment%20%28construction%29">heavy equipment</a>, only men "with picks and shovels, horses and drags". The entire line, including Horseshoe Curve, opened on February 15, 1854. The total cost for of track between Altoona and <a href="Johnstown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Johnstown</a> was <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>2,495,000 or $80,225 per mile ($49,850 /km). The remaining part of the mountain inside the curve was leveled in 1879 to allow the construction of a park and observation area—the first built for viewing trains. As demand for train travel increased, a third track was added to the curve in 1898 and a fourth was added two years later.

From around the 1860s to just before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> passengers could ride to <a href="Kittanning%20Point%20%28PRR%20station%29">Kittanning Point station</a> near the Curve. Two <a href="branch%20line">branch railroad</a>s connected to the main line at Horseshoe Curve in the early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty <a href="hopper%20car">hopper car</a>s to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built at the apex of the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A <a href="macadam">macadam</a> road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a <a href="gift%20shop">gift shop</a> was built in 1940.

Horseshoe Curve was depicted in brochures, calendars and other promotional material; Pennsylvania Railroad <a href="stock%20certificate">stock certificate</a>s were printed with a <a href="vignette%20%28graphic%20design%29">vignette</a> of it. The Pennsylvania pitted the scenery of Horseshoe Curve against rival <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>'s "Water Level Route" during the 1890s. A <a href="raised-relief%20map">raised-relief</a>, <a href="scale%20model">scale model</a> of the curve was included as part of the Pennsylvania Railroad's exhibit at the 1893 <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. Pennsylvania Railroad <a href="conductor%20%28transportation%29">conductor</a>s were told to announce the Horseshoe Curve to daytime passengers—a tradition that continues aboard <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> trains.
During World War II PRR carried troops and matériel for the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> war effort, and the Curve was under armed guard. The <a href="military%20intelligence">military intelligence</a> arm of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, the "<a href="Abwehr">Abwehr</a>", plotted to sabotage important industrial assets in the United States in a project code-named <a href="Operation%20Pastorius">Operation Pastorius</a>. In June 1942 four men were brought by submarine and landed on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>, planning to destroy such sites as the Curve, <a href="Hell%20Gate%20Bridge">Hell Gate Bridge</a>, <a href="Alcoa">Alcoa</a> aluminum factories and locks on the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a>. The would-be <a href="saboteur">saboteur</a>s were quickly apprehended by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> after one, <a href="George%20John%20Dasch">George John Dasch</a>, turned himself in.

During the 1954 celebration of the centennial of the opening of Horseshoe Curve, a <a href="night%20photography">night photo</a> was arranged by <a href="Sylvania%20Electric%20Products">Sylvania Electric Products</a> using 6,000 flashbulbs and of wiring to illuminate the area. The event also commemorated the 75th anniversary of the <a href="incandescent%20light%20bulb">incandescent light bulb</a>. Pennsylvania steam locomotive <a href="PRR%201361">1361</a> was placed at the park inside the Horseshoe Curve on June 8, 1957. It is one of 425 <a href="PRR%20K4s">K4s</a>-class engines, the principal passenger locomotives on the Pennsylvania Railroad that regularly plied the curve. The Horseshoe Curve was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> and was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> on November 13, 1966. The operation of the observation park was transferred to the city of Altoona the same year. The Pennsylvania Railroad was combined with the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a> in 1968. The merger created <a href="Penn%20Central%20Transportation%20Company">Penn Central</a>, which went bankrupt and was taken over by the federal government in 1976, as part of the merger that created <a href="Conrail">Conrail</a>. The second track from the inside at the Horseshoe Curve was removed by Conrail in 1981. The K4s 1361 was removed from the curve for a restoration to working order in September 1985 and was replaced with the ex-Conrail <a href="EMD%20GP9">EMD GP9</a> diesel-electric locomotive <a href="PRR%207048">7048</a> that was repainted into a Pennsylvania Railroad scheme.

Starting in June 1990, the park at the Horseshoe Curve underwent a $5.8 million renovation funded by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</a> and by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> through its "America's Industrial Heritage Project". The renovations were completed in April 1992 with the dedication of a new visitor center. In 1999 Conrail was divided between <a href="CSX%20Transportation">CSX Transportation</a> and Norfolk Southern, with the Horseshoe Curve being acquired by the latter. The Horseshoe Curve was lit up again with fireworks and rail-borne searchlights during its <a href="wikt%3Asesquicentennial">sesquicentennial</a> in 2004 as an homage to the celebrations in 1954. It was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Civil%20Engineering%20Landmark">National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark</a> by the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> in 2004.

Train count peaked in the 1940s with over 50 passenger trains per day along with many freight and military trains. Demand for train travel dropped greatly after World War II as highway and air travel became popular. The curve is still busy as part of Norfolk Southern's Pittsburgh Line and, , was passed by 51 scheduled <a href="freight%20rail%20transport">freight train</a>s each day, not including locals and <a href="bank%20engine">helper engine</a>s which can double the number. The <a href="EMD%20SD40-2">EMD SD40-2</a>s and <a href="EMD%20SD40">SD40E</a>s helpers are coupled to the rear of long trains, providing power on the ascent and assisting in braking on the descent. The 2012 Norfolk Southern track chart lists the annual traffic density passing Horseshoe Curve as , including locomotives. <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>'s "<a href="Pennsylvanian%20%28train%29">Pennsylvanian</a>" between Pittsburgh and New York City rounds the curve once each way daily. Average speed for trains at Horseshoe Curve are for freight and approximately for passenger trains.

The <a href="Railroaders%20Memorial%20Museum">Railroaders Memorial Museum</a> in Altoona manages a visitor center next to the curve which is open April to October. The center has historical artifacts and memorabilia relating to the curve, and a <a href="raised-relief%20map">raised-relief map</a> of the Altoona–<a href="Johnstown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Johnstown</a> area. Access to the curve is by a <a href="funicular">funicular</a> or a 194-step stairway. The funicular is single-tracked, with the cars passing each other halfway up the slope; the cars are painted to resemble Pennsylvania Railroad passenger cars. Along with the locomotive, a former "watchman's shanty" is in the park. Horseshoe Curve is popular with <a href="railfan">railfan</a>s, especially as watchers might see three trains passing at once. As part of Norfolk Southern's <a href="21st%20Century%20Steam">21st Century Steam</a> program, the former <a href="New%20York%2C%20Chicago%20and%20St.%20Louis%20Railroad">Nickel Plate</a> steam locomotive <a href="Nickel%20Plate%20765">765</a> traversed Horseshoe Curve in August 2012—the first steam locomotive to do so since 1977—while <a href="deadheading%20%28railroads%29">deadheading</a> to and from Harrisburg. Nickel Plate 765 returned to the curve in May 2013 with public <a href="excursion%20train">excursion train</a>s from Lewistown to Gallitzin.

William D. Boyce

William Dickson Boyce (June 16, 1858 – June 11, 1929) was an American newspaper man, entrepreneur, magazine publisher, and explorer. He was the founder of the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> (BSA) and the short-lived <a href="Lone%20Scouts%20of%20America">Lone Scouts of America</a> (LSA). Born in <a href="Allegheny%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allegheny County, Pennsylvania</a>, he acquired a love for the outdoors early in his life. After working as a schoolteacher and a coal miner, Boyce attended <a href="College%20of%20Wooster">Wooster Academy</a> in Ohio before moving to the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a> and Canada. An astute businessman, Boyce successfully established several newspapers, such as "The Commercial" in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> and the "Lisbon Clipper" in <a href="Lisbon%2C%20North%20Dakota">Lisbon, North Dakota</a>. With his first wife, Mary Jane Beacom, he moved to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> to pursue his <a href="entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a>ial ambitions. There he established the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company and the weekly "Saturday Blade", which catered to a rural audience and was distributed by thousands of newspaper boys. With his novel employment of newsboys to boost newspaper sales, Boyce's namesake publishing company maintained a circulation of 500,000 copies per week by 1894. Boyce strongly supported worker rights, as demonstrated by his businesses' support of <a href="trade%20union">labor unions</a> and his concern for his newsboys' <a href="quality%20of%20life">well-being</a>.

By the early years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a step back from his businesses to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer <a href="George%20R.%20Lawrence">George R. Lawrence</a> and <a href="cartoonist">cartoonist</a> <a href="John%20T.%20McCutcheon">John T. McCutcheon</a>. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered <a href="KV62">tomb</a> of <a href="Tutankhamun">King Tutankhamun</a>.

Boyce learned about <a href="Scouting">Scouting</a> while passing through London during his first expedition to Africa in 1909. According to somewhat fictionalized legend, Boyce had become lost in the dense London fog, but was guided back to his destination by a <a href="Unknown%20Scout">young boy</a>, who told him that he was merely doing his duty as a <a href="Boy%20Scout">Boy Scout</a>. Boyce then read printed material on Scouting, and on his return to the United States, he formed the B.S.A.

From its start, Boyce focused the Scouting program on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order "to make men". After clashing over the Scouting program with the first <a href="Chief%20Scout%20Executive">Chief Scout Executive</a> <a href="James%20E.%20West%20%28Scouting%29">James E. West</a>, he left the B.S.A. and founded the L.S.A. in January 1915, which catered to rural boys who had limited opportunities to form a troop or a patrol.

In June 1924, five years before Boyce's death, a merger was completed between the B.S.A. and the struggling L.S.A. Boyce received many awards and memorials for his efforts in the U.S. Scouting movement, including the famed "<a href="Silver%20Buffalo%20Award">Silver Buffalo Award</a>".

Boyce was born on June 16, 1858 in New Texas, Pennsylvania – now <a href="Plum%2C%20Pennsylvania">Plum Borough</a> —to a <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> farm couple, David and Margaret Jane Bratton Boyce. The Boyces had three children: William Dickson, Mary, and John. During his rural childhood, Boyce acquired a love for the outdoors. He began teaching school at the age of 16 and then worked briefly as a <a href="coal%20mining">coal miner</a>. He returned to teaching before joining his sister at <a href="College%20of%20Wooster">Wooster Academy</a> in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, which—according to school records—he attended from 1880 to 1881. It is uncertain if he graduated or was expelled.

He then worked as a teacher, <a href="lumberjack">lumberjack</a>, secretary, and salesman in the Midwest and Canada before settling in Chicago, where he quickly became known as a persuasive and shrewd salesman and learned business quickly. His books on business, travel, and expeditions often used the phrase "We pushed on." On January 1, 1884, Boyce married Mary Jane Beacom (1865–1959), whom he had known since his Pennsylvania childhood. Boyce called her Betsy, but to many her nickname was "Rattlesnake Jane" because she matched his skill in poker, was an expert shot, and rode horses cross saddle. It had also become obvious that she was more masculine than Boyce himself, although he had never admitted this, it became clear out of his journal.

Boyce's personal activities included <a href="hunting">hunting</a>, <a href="yacht">yacht</a>ing, <a href="Independent%20Order%20of%20Odd%20Fellows">Odd Fellows</a>, <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Arabic%20Order%20of%20the%20Nobles%20of%20the%20Mystic%20Shrine">Shriners</a>, <a href="golf">golf</a>, <a href="country%20club">country club</a>s and the Chicago Hussars—an independent <a href="equestrianism">equestrian</a> military organization.

In 1903, Boyce purchased a four-story mansion on in <a href="Ottawa%2C%20Illinois">Ottawa, Illinois</a>, which became the center of his family and social activities. Thereafter, he showed little interest in Chicago and its social activities; he would only go there on business. Boyce and Mary led increasingly separate lives and eventually divorced, which was reported on the front page of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" because of the prominence he had attained by that time. The divorce was finalized in a <a href="Campbell%20County%2C%20South%20Dakota">Campbell County, South Dakota</a> court in September 1908; his wife's property settlement was close to $1 million (USD).

After the divorce was finalized, Boyce courted Virginia Dorcas Lee, a vocalist from <a href="Oak%20Park%2C%20Illinois">Oak Park, Illinois</a>, who was 23 years his junior and the eldest child of Virginia and John Adams Lee, a former <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor">Lieutenant Governor</a> of <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. Both Virginia's parents and Boyce's son Ben opposed the relationship. In May 1910, after the planned marriage was announced, an infuriated Ben scuffled with his father outside the <a href="Blackstone%20Hotel">Blackstone Hotel</a> and Boyce sustained a facial wound. Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $5 and court costs. Two days later, Boyce and Virginia married and went to Europe on an extended honeymoon. Almost immediately, there was speculation amongst family members and in newspapers about problems within the marriage. On April 9, 1911, Boyce and Virginia had a daughter, whom they named Virginia. A few months later, in December 1911, Boyce signed an agreement to support and educate their infant daughter. After Boyce's wife filed for divorce in March 1912, she moved to <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara, California</a>, with their daughter and her parents. Boyce did not contest the divorce and arranged for a $100,000 settlement. Years later, the elder Virginia married Richard Roberts, a New York banker, and moved with her and Boyce's daughter to <a href="Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut">Greenwich, Connecticut</a>. The younger Virginia took the surname Roberts. She did not meet her natural father, Boyce, until she was eight years old.

Ben married Miriam Patterson of <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, on June 11, 1912. Both Boyce and his first wife attended the ceremony. At this time Boyce's first wife, Mary, exchanged some of her Chicago property for the home in Ottawa, which sparked speculation that she and Boyce might reconcile. The next year they remarried on June 14, 1913, in Ottawa. They then departed on a honeymoon to Alaska, Hawaii, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, and Cuba, with their daughter Happy, son Ben, and his wife Miriam.

As Boyce traveled, he often started a newspaper wherever he went. His first venture into commercial publishing was compiling a city directory. He also worked briefly for a publisher in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, and a newspaper publisher in <a href="Kensington%2C%20Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Kensington, Pennsylvania</a>, part of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. He then boarded a train for <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and worked as a secretary and salesman for ""<a href="Western%20%28magazine%29">Western</a>"" magazine. Restless again, he moved to <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul, Minnesota</a>, and sold advertisements for a publisher for a short time and then spent a month in <a href="Fargo%2C%20North%20Dakota">Fargo, North Dakota</a>, and <a href="Grand%20Forks%2C%20North%20Dakota">Grand Forks, North Dakota</a>. Further north in <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, he and local resident James W. Steen co-founded <a href="Winnipeg%20Commercial">""The Commercial""</a> in 1881, a newspaper that lasted for 70 years. He sold his share of ""The Commercial"" to his partner in 1882 and returned to Fargo where he became a reporter. In December 1882, Boyce moved to <a href="Lisbon%2C%20North%20Dakota">Lisbon, North Dakota</a>, where he bought the "Dakota Clipper".

Beginning in December 1884, Boyce managed reporters and news releases at the "Bureau of Correspondence" at the six-month-long <a href="World%20Cotton%20Centennial">World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. Countries from all over the world sent displays. Boyce was responsible for providing news stories on events and displays to over 1,200 newspapers around the country. He returned to <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> after the Exposition concluded, but by early 1886 he had moved back to Chicago. He often returned in North Dakota for publishing business deals and deer- and duck-hunting vacations.
In Chicago, he founded the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which provided advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers. In 1887, he established the weekly ""Saturday Blade"", an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys—an innovation at the time. By 1892, the "Saturday Blade" had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States. Boyce's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the ""Saturday Blade"" and were reprinted in books by atlas/map publisher <a href="Rand%20McNally">Rand McNally</a>. The success of the ""Saturday Blade"" spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company, which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines. In 1892, Boyce bought out the ""<a href="Chicago%20Ledger">Chicago Ledger</a>"", a fiction weekly publication. In January 1903 he founded the international ""Boyce's Weekly"", which advocated worker's rights. Boyce's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor/union leaders such as <a href="John%20Mitchell%20%28United%20Mine%20Workers%29">John Mitchell</a> of the <a href="United%20Mine%20Workers">United Mine Workers</a> and <a href="Henry%20Demarest%20Lloyd">Henry Demarest Lloyd</a> as writers and editors for ""Boyce's Weekly"". Eight months later, ""Boyce's Weekly"" was consolidated with the ""Saturday Blade."" Boyce also established the selected subject/topical newspapers ""Farm Business"" in 1914 and ""Home Folks Magazine"" in 1922. Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the ""Blade"" and ""Ledger"" into the monthly <a href="Chicago%20Ledger">""Chicago Blade & Ledger""</a>, which was published until 1937. As Boyce's enterprises grew, he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30,000 delivery boys, who were key to his financial success. Working with them may have helped him gain an understanding of America's youth. Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite, reading human nature, and handling money. Boyce's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men: "There are many obstacles to overcome, but toil, grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all. Help yourself and others will help you." and "whatever trade you have selected; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished".
In 1891, Boyce began working on his own 12-story office building at 30 North Dearborn Street, known as the "<a href="Boyce%20Building">Boyce Building</a>", it was designed by architect <a href="Henry%20Ives%20Cobb">Henry Ives Cobb</a>. Even 20 years later, this building was recognized as the most expensive building (in terms of dollars per cubic foot) in Chicago. In 1907, Boyce consolidated his business operations into another office building, also known as the Boyce Building, at 500–510 North Dearborn Street. A new four-story office building—designed by the architectural firm of <a href="Daniel%20Burnham">Daniel Burnham</a>—was built on this location in 1912 and expanded during 1913–14 with an additional six stories. This building was later listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on February 29, 1996, maintained by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Department of the Interior</a> and its <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>.

At a time when women had trouble finding work and workers were often oppressed, Boyce felt their rights were important: his businesses employed many women and he supported labor unions. His newspapers often carried stories about the "nobility of labor". His businesses were able to pay out wages and benefits during the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>, a time when many businesses were laying off workers and cutting wages. During the <a href="Pullman%20Strike">Pullman Strike</a> of the <a href="Pullman%20Company">Pullman Palace Car Company</a> in 1894, which spread to 20 companies in over half the states, Boyce called <a href="Eugene%20V.%20Debs">Eugene V. Debs</a>, the socialist labor national leader of the <a href="American%20Railway%20Union">American Railway Union</a>, a "great labor leader" and industrialist <a href="George%20Pullman">George Pullman</a>, inventor of the <a href="sleeping%20car">railroad passenger and sleeping car</a>, the man "who caused all the trouble" (then current labor and social/political strife of the 1890s). In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in <a href="Marseilles%2C%20Illinois">Marseilles, Illinois</a>, burned down, he paid the workers immediately and then hired them back as construction workers to rebuild the paper mill so they would not lose income. Yet, he was also protective of his money. In late 1894, when two of his workers were injured by a fallen smokestack and won $2,000 each in a court judgment, Boyce appealed the case all the way to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Illinois">Supreme Court of Illinois</a>, and lost. He was also persistent in getting what he wanted; in 1902, he sued the Marseilles Land and Power Company for not supplying enough water power to his mills and won a $65,300 judgment. By 1903, the Marseilles Land and Power Company fell into receivership and Boyce bought the company up.
Boyce hired his son, Ben, when he was 20 years old, giving him high-level positions in his water and power businesses in and around Marseilles and Ottawa. However, their relationship was often strained by Boyce's high expectations and Ben's carelessness with his funds in activities such as betting on horse races.

During June–August 1906, the government proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second-class mail, which included newspapers, from one cent to four cents per pound. In response, Boyce proposed buying the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">Post Office Department</a> for $300 million (USD), claiming that he would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">United States Department of the Treasury</a> for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent. This offer was rejected by the government, but it did halt their planned second-class postage rate increase.

Boyce was a multi-millionaire by the early 1900s and by 1909 became more interested in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at <a href="Lake%20City%2C%20South%20Dakota">Fort Sisseton, South Dakota</a>, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes may have been in part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating.

In 1914 Boyce bought two more newspapers, the ""<a href="Indianapolis%20Sun">Indianapolis Sun</a>"", which he renamed the ""<a href="Indianapolis%20Daily%20Times">Indianapolis Daily Times</a>"", and the ""Inter Ocean Farmer"", which he renamed ""The Farming Business"". By 1920, the majority of Americans lived in cities instead of rural areas. "Lone Scout", ""Saturday Blade"", and ""<a href="Chicago%20Ledger">Chicago Ledger</a>"" all focused on rural customers and began to falter. Boyce launched ""Home Folks Magazine"" in an attempt to regain customers. By June 1925, sales had slipped so much that he merged the latter two titles into the ""Blade and Ledger"", which caused sales to rise again. This encouraged Boyce to start ""Movie Romances"", one of the first tabloid magazines about movie star romances.

Boyce's success in the publishing business lay in his ability to organize the administration of a business and delegate details to subordinates. He eventually amassed a fortune of about US$20 million. Boyce's life paralleled <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s in many ways: Both men were products of the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a>, internationally prominent, had concern for children, supported Scouting, were adventurers and outdoorsmen, (modern-day "environmentalists"), and were interested in civic reform. Although Boyce admired and sought to surpass Roosevelt, his only foray into politics was the 1896 <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> primary for a <a href="United%20States%20Representative">United States Representative</a> (congressman) in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> – a bitterly fought campaign which he lost to first-term incumbent <a href="George%20E.%20Foss">George E. Foss</a>. In all likelihood, Boyce met Roosevelt at the <a href="Union%20League">Union League Club of Chicago</a>, of which the former had become a member in 1891. His ambivalent attitude towards government was a common one of the general public during the <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressive Era</a>. However, Boyce's Republican credentials and monetary contributions earned him an invitation to the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential</a> <a href="inauguration">inauguration</a> and ball of newly elected successor to "T.R.", the 27th President, <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> in March 1909.

Boyce financed an expedition of the explorer <a href="Frederick%20Schwatka">Frederick Schwatka</a> to Alaska in 1896. Schwatka discovered gold near <a href="Nome%2C%20Alaska">Nome</a> and Boyce reported this success in his newspapers, which led him to finance other Schwatka expeditions as well as those of other adventurers, including a failed expedition to the <a href="Yukon%20River">Yukon River</a> in 1898. Boyce soon began to carry out his own expeditions. When the United States entered the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> in 1898, Boyce set sail for <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>n waters aboard the ship "Three Friends". The nature of the activities of Boyce and this ship are unknown.

In March 1909, Boyce embarked on a two-month trip to Europe, which included a visit to his daughters, who were in Rome. On returning to America, Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence. Boyce met with <a href="safari">safari</a> organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples. His son Benjamin and Lawrence's son Raymond were part of the expedition. Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa. The group disembarked at <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, and was in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> by September. After hiring local <a href="Porter%20%28carrier%29">porters</a> and guides, the entire expedition totaled about 400 people, about three-fourths of whom were servants. It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near Kijabi and <a href="Lake%20Victoria">Lake Victoria</a>. The expedition was a failure because a <a href="telephoto%20lens">telephoto lens</a> was neither brought nor subsequently procured, the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa, and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away. The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi. The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals.

In December 1910, Boyce led a nine-month, expedition to South America that was extensively reported in his newspapers. In late January 1915, Boyce sailed to England because of his concern over World War I. He received permission from the American Legation in Switzerland to travel into Germany and Austria for six weeks to report on the industrial and commercial effects of the war on those countries. He sent extensive reports to his newspapers and returned home around April–May.

In late 1922, Boyce departed on another expedition to Africa, this time for six months. <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> reminded him of the Dakotas, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. In <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> he visited the tomb of <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>, which had been discovered just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to <a href="Luxor">Luxor</a> and sailed up the <a href="Nile">Nile River</a> to <a href="Edfu">Edfu</a>, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed for the first time in decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.

As Boyce's interest in <a href="philanthropy">philanthropy</a> grew, he turned to his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while "en route" to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the <a href="Woodcraft%20Indians">Woodcraft Indians</a> and <a href="Sons%20of%20Daniel%20Boone">Sons of Daniel Boone</a> formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.

According to legend, Boyce was lost on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout came to his aid, guiding him back to his destination. The boy then refused Boyce's tip, explaining that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout. Soon thereafter, Boyce met with <a href="Robert%20Baden-Powell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Baden-Powell">Robert Baden-Powell</a>, who was the head of the <a href="The%20Scout%20Association">Boy Scout Association</a> at that time. Boyce returned to America, and, four months later, founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. He intended to base the program around <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">American Indian</a> lore. This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines. There are several variations of it, including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters.

In actuality, Boyce stopped in London "en route" to a safari in <a href="British%20East%20Africa">British East Africa</a>. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout headquarters and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of "Scouting For Boys" and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.

The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February 8, 1910, but it struggled from shortages of cash and leadership in the beginning. Boyce personally donated $1,000 a month to keep the organization running on the condition that boys of all races and creeds be included, which was at odds with his own expressed belief in the superiority of whites. He was not interested in directing the organization, and turned over the running of the organization to <a href="Edgar%20M.%20Robinson">Edgar M. Robinson</a> of the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, who proceeded to recruit the permanent executive board of the BSA. The much-needed leadership and management arrived when the Sons of Daniel Boone and Woodcraft Indians merged with the BSA.

Boyce felt that Scouting's emphasis on outdoor activity was crucial in producing the type of leaders that America needed because youth reared in cities had too much done for them, whereas those from the country had to learn to do things for themselves. Scouting was focused on teaching self-reliance, citizenship, resourcefulness, patriotism, obedience, cheerfulness, courage, and courtesy in order "to make men".

Boyce clashed with <a href="James%20E.%20West%20%28Scouting%29">James E. West</a>, the BSA's Chief Scout Executive, over a program for boys who lived too far from town to join a troop. Boyce offered to publish a magazine for the BSA, as long as it was published in Chicago. The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA, though he remained a staunch supporter of the program. As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young, Boyce started a new Scouting-related venture: the Lone Scouts of America (LSA) on January 9, 1915. Reliance on <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor: Lone Scouts could form small groups known as "tribes", the tribe's treasurer was known as the "<a href="wampum">wampum</a>-bearer", and LSA taught boys to respect the environment. Boyce's annual contribution to the LSA grew to $100,000. In both the BSA and the LSA, Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts. Upon his return from reporting on World War I, Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting "Lone Scout" magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan, a noted Chicago Scoutmaster, to lead the LSA. By November 1915, the LSA had over 30,000 members. Warren conferred upon Boyce the title "Chief Totem". Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents. By 1916, the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members. In the summer of 1917, during his annual Dakota hunt, the <a href="Gros%20Ventres">Gros Ventres</a> Indian tribe made Boyce an honorary chief with the name "Big Cloud" during a three-day ceremony. With America at war, Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917. Though he had a uniform made for himself, he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one.

Boyce felt that "Lone Scout" was the best magazine he had ever done. "Lone Scout" was so popular that it could not handle all the material that was submitted, so many local and regional "Tribe Papers" were started. By 1922, Boyce's newspaper business was suffering and "Lone Scout" was losing money—it switched from a weekly to a monthly. Boyce's racial prejudice was revealed when the racial tensions in Chicago increased in the 1920s. The LSA issued a formal proclamation in late 1920 that it would only accept whites and in 1922 changed the masthead of "Lone Scout" from "A Real Boys' Magazine" to "The White Boys Magazine".

The fortunes of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for "Lone Scout", George N. Madison. Madison discovered that the LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate: it was full of duplications and inactive members. The reported 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number. Boyce finally accepted West's annual offer to merge with the BSA in April 1924, with the merger formalized on June 16, 1924. Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA, but the BSA continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for another decade, gradually losing its unique programs. Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities, but are not part of a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties.

Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 of a heart <a href="embolism">embolism</a>. His father did not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: "Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea". Boyce died from bronchial <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the <a href="Ottawa%20Avenue%20Cemetery">Ottawa Avenue Cemetery</a>, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers. BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude. A statue that commemorates his contribution to the Boy Scouts of America was placed near his grave on June 21, 1941, which West dedicated.

Boyce was recognized with the <a href="Silver%20Buffalo%20Award">Silver Buffalo Award</a> in 1926, the first year it was awarded, for his efforts in starting the BSA. He was the third recipient, after Baden-Powell and the Unknown Scout. During the BSA's 50th anniversary in 1960, 15,000 Scouts and several of Boyce's descendants gathered in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend. Illinois governor <a href="William%20Stratton">William Stratton</a> delivered the key address and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive. In 1985, about 2,500 Scouts attended a 75th anniversary pilgrimage in Ottawa, attended by his last surviving child, Virginia, and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame member. Boyce had been a member from 1891 until he died. On December 6, 1997, a <a href="Scouting%20museums">Scouting museum</a> opened in Ottawa. The <a href="Scouting%20in%20Illinois">W. D. Boyce Council</a> of the BSA is named in his honor. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located on Boyce Campus of <a href="Community%20College%20of%20Allegheny%20County">Community College of Allegheny County</a> in <a href="Monroeville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Monroeville, Pennsylvania</a>, recognizes his achievements to Scouting. Not far from the marker is a county park, <a href="Boyce%20Park">Boyce Park</a>, that was named for him. A medallion of Boyce is near the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> as part of <a href="The%20Extra%20Mile">The Extra Mile – Points of Light Volunteer Pathway</a>. In 2005, the BSA introduced the <a href="Advancement%20and%20recognition%20in%20the%20Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%23Support%20of%20Scouting%20awards">William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award</a>, presented to the organizer of any new Scouting unit.

The Extra Mile National Monument in Washington, DC selected Boyce as one of its 37 honorees. The Extra Mile pays homage to Americans like Boyce who set their own self-interest aside to help others and successfully brought positive social change to the United States.

Sholay

Sholay (, ) is a <a href="Bollywood%20films%20of%201975">1975</a> Indian <a href="Action%20film">action</a>-<a href="adventure%20film">adventure film</a>, written by <a href="Salim-Javed">Salim-Javed</a>, directed by <a href="Ramesh%20Sippy">Ramesh Sippy</a>, and produced by his father <a href="G.%20P.%20Sippy">G. P. Sippy</a>. The film is about two criminals, Veeru and Jai (played by <a href="Dharmendra">Dharmendra</a> and <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, respectively), hired by a retired police officer (<a href="Sanjeev%20Kumar">Sanjeev Kumar</a>) to capture the ruthless <a href="dacoit">dacoit</a> <a href="Gabbar%20Singh%20%28character%29">Gabbar Singh</a> (<a href="Amjad%20Khan%20%28actor%29">Amjad Khan</a>). <a href="Hema%20Malini">Hema Malini</a> and <a href="Jaya%20Bhaduri">Jaya Bhaduri</a> also star, as Veeru and Jai's love interests, respectively. "Sholay" is considered a classic and one of the best <a href="Cinema%20of%20India">Indian films</a>. It was ranked first in the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s 2002 poll of "Top 10 Indian Films" of all time. In 2005, the judges of the <a href="50th%20Filmfare%20Awards">50th Filmfare Awards</a> named it the <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Film%20of%2050%20Years">Best Film of 50 Years</a>.

The screenplay was written by screenwriter pair Salim-Javed, consisting of <a href="Salim%20Khan">Salim Khan</a> and <a href="Javed%20Akhtar">Javed Akhtar</a>. Their screenplay was initially rejected by several producers and directors, before they met Ramesh Sippy and his father G. P. Sippy, both of whom liked the script and wanted to direct and produce it, respectively. The film was shot in the rocky terrain of <a href="Ramanagara">Ramanagara</a>, in the southern state of <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, over a span of two and a half years. After the <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Central Board of Film Certification</a> mandated the removal of several violent scenes, "Sholay" was released with a length of 198 minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204 minutes became available on home media. When first released, "Sholay" received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than five years at Mumbai's Minerva theatre. The film was also an <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films%20in%20overseas%20markets">overseas success</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. It was the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">highest-grossing Indian film</a> ever at the time, and was the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films%20in%20India">highest-grossing film in India</a> up until "<a href="Hum%20Aapke%20Hain%20Koun..%21">Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</a>" (1994). By some accounts, "Sholay" remains the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.

The film is a <a href="Dacoit%20Western">Dacoit Western</a> (sometimes called a "<a href="Curry%20Western">Curry Western</a>"), combining the conventions of Indian <a href="dacoit%20film">dacoit film</a>s with that of <a href="Spaghetti%20Western">Spaghetti Western</a>s along with elements of <a href="Samurai%20cinema">Samurai cinema</a>. "Sholay" is also a defining example of the <a href="masala%20film">masala film</a>, which mixes several genres in one work. Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, <a href="homosocial">homosocial</a> bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory. The combined sales of the original soundtrack, scored by <a href="R.%20D.%20Burman">R. D. Burman</a>, and the dialogues (released separately), set new sales records. The film's dialogues and certain characters became extremely popular, contributing to numerous cultural <a href="meme">meme</a>s and becoming part of India's daily <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a>. In January 2014, "Sholay" was re-released to theatres in the 3D format.

In the small village of Ramgarh, the retired policeman <a href="Thakur%20%28Indian%20title%29">Thakur</a> Baldev Singh (<a href="Sanjeev%20Kumar">Sanjeev Kumar</a>) summons a pair of small-time thieves that he had once arrested. Thakur feels that the duo—Veeru (<a href="Dharmendra">Dharmendra</a>) and Jai (<a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>)—would be ideal to help him capture Gabbar Singh (<a href="Amjad%20Khan%20%28actor%29">Amjad Khan</a>), a <a href="Dacoity">dacoit</a> wanted by the authorities for a 50,000 reward. Thakur tells them to surrender Gabbar to him, alive, for an additional 20,000 reward.

The two thieves thwart the dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of <a href="Holi">Holi</a>. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, although he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, which is why he could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a <a href="shawl">shawl</a>.

Living in Ramgarh, the jovial Veeru and cynical Jai find themselves growing fond of the villagers. Veeru is attracted to Basanti (<a href="Hema%20Malini">Hema Malini</a>), a feisty, talkative young woman who makes her living by driving a horse-cart. Jai is drawn to Radha (<a href="Jaya%20Bhaduri">Jaya Bhaduri</a>), Thakur's reclusive, widowed daughter-in-law, who subtly returns his affections.

Skirmishes between Gabbar's gang and Jai-Veeru finally result in the capture of Veeru and Basanti by the dacoits. Jai attacks the gang, and the three are able to flee Gabbar's hideout with dacoits in pursuit. Fighting from behind a rock, Jai and Veeru nearly run out of ammunition. Veeru, unaware that Jai was wounded in the gunfight, is forced to leave for more ammunition. Meanwhile, Jai, who is continuing the gunfight singlehandedly, decides to sacrifice himself by using his last bullet to ignite dynamite sticks on a bridge from close range.

Veeru returns, and Jai dies in his arms. Enraged, Veeru attacks Gabbar's den and catches the dacoit. Veeru nearly beats Gabbar to death when Thakur appears and reminds Veeru of the promise to hand over Gabbar alive. Thakur uses his spike-soled shoes to severely injure Gabbar and destroy his hands. The police then arrive and arrest Gabbar. After Jai's funeral, Veeru leaves Ramgarh and finds Basanti waiting for him on the train. Radha is left alone again.


The screenwriter pair <a href="Salim-Javed">Salim-Javed</a>, consisting of <a href="Salim%20Khan">Salim Khan</a> and <a href="Javed%20Akhtar">Javed Akhtar</a>, began narrating the idea for "Sholay" as a four-line snippet to filmmakers in 1973. The idea was rejected by two producer/director teams, including directors <a href="Manmohan%20Desai">Manmohan Desai</a> and <a href="Prakash%20Mehra">Prakash Mehra</a>. About six months after the release of "<a href="Zanjeer%20%281973%20film%29">Zanjeer</a>" (1973), Salim-Javed got in touch with <a href="G.%20P.%20Sippy">G. P. Sippy</a> and his son <a href="Ramesh%20Sippy">Ramesh Sippy</a>, and narrated the four-line snippet to them. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept of "Sholay" and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge the murder of his family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that it would be difficult to get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances. The film's script and dialogues are in <a href="Hindi-Urdu">Hindi-Urdu</a>, primarily <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>. Salim-Javed wrote the dialogues in <a href="Urdu%20script">Urdu script</a>, which was then transcribed by an assistant into <a href="Devanagari">Devanagari</a> script so that <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> readers could read the Urdu dialogues.

The film's plot was loosely styled after <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>'s 1954 <a href="Samurai%20cinema">Samurai cinema</a> film, "<a href="Seven%20Samurai">Seven Samurai</a>". It is a defining example of the <a href="Dacoit%20Western">Dacoit Western</a> film, combining the conventions of Indian <a href="dacoit%20film">dacoit film</a>s, especially <a href="Mehboob%20Khan">Mehboob Khan</a>'s "<a href="Mother%20India">Mother India</a>" (1957) and <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>'s "<a href="Gunga%20Jumna">Gunga Jumna</a>" (1961), with that of <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Westerns</a>, especially <a href="Sergio%20Leone">Sergio Leone</a>'s <a href="Spaghetti%20Western">Spaghetti Western</a>s such as "<a href="Once%20Upon%20a%20Time%20in%20the%20West">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>" (1968) as well as "<a href="The%20Magnificent%20Seven">The Magnificent Seven</a>" (1960). It also some plot elements borrowed from the Indian films "<a href="Mera%20Gaon%20Mera%20Desh">Mera Gaon Mera Desh</a>" (1971) and "<a href="Khote%20Sikkay">Khote Sikkay</a>" (1973). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery was inspired by a similar scene in "Gunga Jumna", and has also been compared to a similar scene in "<a href="North%20West%20Frontier%20%28film%29">North West Frontier</a>" (1959). A scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family in "Once Upon a Time in the West". "Sholay" may have also been influenced by <a href="Sam%20Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>'s Westerns, such as "<a href="The%20Wild%20Bunch">The Wild Bunch</a>" (1969) and "<a href="Pat%20Garrett%20and%20Billy%20the%20Kid">Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</a>" (1973), and <a href="George%20Roy%20Hill">George Roy Hill</a>'s "<a href="Butch%20Cassidy%20and%20the%20Sundance%20Kid">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a>" (1969).

The character Gabbar Singh was modelled on a real-life dacoit of the same name who had menaced the villages around <a href="Gwalior">Gwalior</a> in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. The character was also inspired by "Gunga Jumna", where Dilip Kumar's character Gunga is a dacoit speaking with a similar dialect, a mix of <a href="Khariboli">Khariboli</a> and <a href="Awadhi">Awadhi</a>. The character was also influenced by the villain "El Indio" (played by <a href="Gian%20Maria%20Volont%C3%A8">Gian Maria Volontè</a>) of Sergio Leone's "<a href="For%20a%20Few%20Dollars%20More">For a Few Dollars More</a>" (1965). Sippy wanted to do away with the cliched idea of a dacoit becoming one due to societal issues, as was the case in other films, and focused on Gabbar being an emblem of pure evil. To drive home the point of Gabbar being a new type of villain, Sippy also did away with the typical tropes of dacoits wearing <a href="dhoti">dhoti</a>s and <a href="Pagri_%28turban%29">pagri</a>s and sporting a <a href="Tilaka">Tika</a> and worshipping "Ma Bhavani"; Gabbar would be wearing army fatigues. The character of jailer, played by <a href="Asrani">Asrani</a> was influenced by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, Javed Akhtar brought a book on <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> which had several pictures of Hitler posing to set the typical posture of the character in the film. Asrani spiced up his character with some ideas about Hitler's speech delivery he had heard from a teacher in <a href="Film_and_Television_Institute_of_India">FTII</a>. The trademark 'Ha Ha' at the end of his monologues was inspired by a similar performance by <a href="Jack%20Lemmon">Jack Lemmon</a> in "<a href="The%20Great%20Race">The Great Race</a>". Soorma Bhopali, a minor <a href="comic%20relief">comic relief</a> character, was based on an acquaintance of actor Jagdeep, a forest officer from <a href="Bhopal">Bhopal</a> named Soorma. The real-life Soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter. The main characters' names, Jai and Veeru, mean "victory" and "heroism" in Hindi.

The producers considered <a href="Danny%20Denzongpa">Danny Denzongpa</a> for the role of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in <a href="Feroz%20Khan%20%28actor%2C%20born%201939%29">Feroz Khan</a>'s "<a href="Dharmatma">Dharmatma</a>" (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book "Abhishapta Chambal", which told of the exploits of <a href="Chambal%20division">Chambal</a> dacoits. The book was written by Taroon Kumar Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. Sanjeev Kumar also wanted to play the role of Gabbar Singh, but Salim-Javed "felt he had the audience's sympathy through roles he'd done before; Gabbar had to be completely hateful."

Sippy wanted <a href="Shatrughan%20Sinha">Shatrughan Sinha</a> to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not very popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself. He was cast after Salim-Javed recommended him for "Sholay" in 1973; Bachchan's performance in their first collaboration, "Zanjeer", convinced Salim-Javed he was the right actor for the film. Salim-javed were smitten by Bachchan's performance in "<a href="Raaste%20Kaa%20Patthar">Raaste Kaa Patthar</a>" even though it was a flop, and at Bachchan's request, Dharmendra had personally put in a word for him. All these factors ensured that the role was Bachchan's. 

As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. <a href="Pran%20%28actor%29">Pran</a> was considered for the role of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev Kumar was a better choice. Initially, Salim-Javed approached <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a> to play Thakur's role, but he turned down the offer; Dilip Kumar later said it was one of the few films he regretted turning down. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested to play the role of Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev Kumar would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that Kumar was also interested in Malini. Hema Malini was reluctant to play the role of a "tangewali", more so after Sippy told her that the movie belongs to Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan, but she trusted Ramesh to give her a meaty role, given that he had played a huge role in essaying her stardom. 

During the film's production, four of the leads became romantically involved. Bachchan married Bhaduri four months before filming started. This led to shooting delays when Bhaduri became pregnant with their daughter Shweta. By the time of the film's release, she was pregnant with their son <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek</a>. Dharmendra had begun wooing Malini during their earlier film "<a href="Seeta%20Aur%20Geeta">Seeta Aur Geeta</a>" (1972), and used the location shoot of "Sholay" to further pursue her. During their romantic scenes, Dharmendra would often pay the light boys to spoil the shot, thereby ensuring many retakes and allowing him to spend more time with her. The couple married five years after the film's release.

Much of "Sholay" was shot in the rocky terrain of <a href="Ramanagara">Ramanagara</a>, a town near <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. The filmmakers had to build a road from the Bangalore highway to Ramanagara for convenient access to the sets. Art director Ram Yedekar had an entire township built on the site. A prison set was constructed near Rajkamal Studio in Mumbai, also outdoors, to match the natural lighting of the on-location sets. One part of Ramanagara was for a time called "Sippy Nagar" as a tribute to the director of the film. , a visit to the "Sholay rocks" (where much the film was shot) was still being offered to tourists travelling through Ramanagara.

Filming began on location on 3 October 1973, with a scene featuring Bachchan and Bhaduri. The film had a lavish production for its time (with frequent banquets and parties for the cast), took two and a half years to make, and went over budget. One reason for its high cost was that Sippy re-filmed scenes many times to get his desired effect. "Yeh Dosti", a 5-minute song sequence, took 21 days to shoot, two short scenes in which Radha lights lamps took 20 days to film because of lighting problems, and the shooting of the scene in which Gabbar kills the imam's son lasted 19 days. The train robbery sequence, shot on the Mumbai–Pune railway route near <a href="Panvel">Panvel</a>, took more than 7 weeks to complete.

"Sholay" was the first Indian film to have a <a href="Stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic</a> soundtrack and to use the <a href="70%20mm%20film">70 mm</a> <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> format. However, since actual 70 mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35 mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, "A 70mm "[sic]" format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it even more to make the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator." The use of 70 mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the <a href="tagline">tagline</a>: "The greatest star cast ever assembled – the greatest story ever told".

The director's original cut of "Sholay" has a different ending in which Thakur kills Gabbar, along with some additional violent scenes. Gabbar's death scene, and the scene in which the imam's son is killed, were cut from the film by India's <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Censor Board</a>, as was the scene in which Thakur's family is massacred. The Censor Board was concerned about the violence, and that viewers may be influenced to violate the law by punishing people severely. Although Sippy fought to keep the scenes, eventually he had to re-shoot the ending of the film, and as directed by the Censor Board, have the police arrive just before Thakur can kill Gabbar. The censored theatrical version was the only one seen by audiences for fifteen years. The original, unedited cut of the film finally came out in a British release on VHS in 1990. Since then, <a href="Eros%20International">Eros International</a> has released two versions on DVD. The <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> of the film preserves the original full frame and is 204 minutes in length; the censored widescreen version is 198 minutes long.

Scholars have noted several themes in the film, such as glorification of violence, conformation to feudal ethos, debate between social order and mobilised usurpers, homosocial bonding, and the film's role as a national allegory.

Koushik Banerjea, a sociologist in the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>, notes that "Sholay" exhibits a "sympathetic construction of 'rogue' masculinity" exemplified by the likeable outlaws Jai and Veeru. Banerjea argues during the film, the moral boundary between legality and criminality gradually erodes. Film scholar Wimal Dissanayake agrees that the film brought "a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order" to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. Madhava Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru's criminality for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept <a href="Feudalism">feudal order</a>. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are humanised by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh.

Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience was fascinated by the dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation of violence in the film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in "Sholay", the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that "Sholay" can be viewed as a national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of "Sholay", with its violence, revenge, and <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a> action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in <a href="the%20Emergency%20%28India%29">the Emergency</a> (<a href="rule%20by%20decree">rule by decree</a>) declared by prime minister <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> in 1975.

Dissanayeke and Sahai note that, although the film borrowed heavily from the Hollywood Western genre, particularly in its visuals, it was successfully "Indianised". As an example, William van der Heide has compared a massacre scene in "Sholay" with a similar scene in "Once Upon a Time in the West". Although both films were similar in technical style, "Sholay" emphasised Indian family values and melodramatic tradition, while the Western was more materialistic and restrained in its approach. Maithili Rao, in "Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema", notes that "Sholay" infuses the style of the Western genre into a "feudalistic ethos". Ted Shen of the "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>" notes "Sholay"s "hysterical visual style" and intermittent "populist message". Cultural critic and Islamic scholar <a href="Ziauddin%20Sardar">Ziauddin Sardar</a> lampoons the film in his book "The Secret Politics of Our Desires: Innocence, Culpability and Indian Popular Cinema", both for its caricature and stereotyping of Muslim and women characters, and for what he calls mockery of innocent villagers. Sardar notes that the two most prominent Muslim characters in the film are Soorma Bhopali (a buffoonish criminal), and an impotent victim of the bandits (the imam). Meanwhile, the sole function of one female character (Radha) is to suffer her fate in silence, while the other female lead (Basanti) is just a garrulous village belle.

Some scholars have indicated that "Sholay" contains <a href="Homosociality">homosocial</a> themes. Ted Shen describes the male bonding shown in the film as bordering on <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">camp style</a>. Dina Holtzman, in her book "Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora", states that the death of Jai, and resultant break of bonding between the two male leads, is necessary for the sake of establishing a normative heterosexual relationship (that of Veeru and Basanti).

<a href="R.%20D.%20Burman">R. D. Burman</a> composed the film's music, and the lyrics were written by <a href="Anand%20Bakshi">Anand Bakshi</a>. The songs used in the film, and released on the original soundtrack are listed below. Following that is a list of unused tracks and dialogues which were released later on an updated soundtrack.

The song "Mehbooba Mehbooba" was sung by its composer, R. D. Burman, who received his sole <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Playback%20Singer%231970s">Filmfare Award nomination for playback singing</a> for his effort. The song, which is often featured on Bollywood hit song compilations, is based on "Say You Love Me" by Greek singer <a href="Demis%20Roussos">Demis Roussos</a>.

"Mehbooba Mehbooba" has been extensively anthologised, remixed, and recreated. A version was created in 2005 by the <a href="Kronos%20Quartet">Kronos Quartet</a> for their <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy</a>-nominated album "You've Stolen My Heart", featuring <a href="Asha%20Bhosle">Asha Bhosle</a>. It was also remixed and sung by <a href="Himesh%20Reshammiya">Himesh Reshammiya</a>, along with Bhosle, in his debut acting film "<a href="Aap%20Kaa%20Surroor%20%28film%29">Aap Kaa Surroor</a>" (2007). "Yeh Dosti" has been called the ultimate friendship anthem. It was remixed and sung by <a href="Shankar%20Mahadevan">Shankar Mahadevan</a> and <a href="Udit%20Narayan">Udit Narayan</a> for the 2010 Malayalam film "<a href="Four%20Friends%20%282010%20film%29">Four Friends</a>", and also in 2010 it was used to symbolise India's friendship with the United States during a visit from President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>.

Several songs from the soundtrack were included in the annual "<a href="Binaca%20Geetmala">Binaca Geetmala</a>" list of top <a href="filmi">filmi</a> songs. "Mehbooba Mehooba" was listed at No. 24 on the <a href="Binaca%20Geetmala%20annual%20list%201975">1975 list</a>, and at No. 6 on the <a href="Binaca%20Geetmala%20annual%20list%201976">1976 list</a>. "Koi Haseena" was listed at No. 30 in 1975, and No. 20 in 1976. "Yeh Dosti" was listed at No. 9 in 1976. Despite the soundtrack's success, at the time, the songs from "Sholay" attracted less attention than the film's dialogue—a rarity for Bollywood. The producers were thus prompted to release records with only dialogue. Taken together, the album sales reached an unprecedented 500,000 units. By 1979, the soundtrack went <a href="Indian%20Music%20Industry">Platinum</a> (equivalent to 1million sales at the time), becoming one of the top-selling <a href="Bollywood%20soundtrack">Bollywood soundtrack</a>s of the 1970s.

Music critic Oli Marlow reviewed the soundtrack in 2013, calling it a unique fusion of religious, folk, and classical music, with influences from around the world. He also commented on the sound design of the film, calling it psychedelic, and saying that there was "a lot of incredible incidental music" in the film that was not included in the soundtrack releases. In a 1999 paper submitted to London's Symposium on Sound in Cinema, film critic Shoma A. Chatterji said, ""Sholay" offers a model lesson on how sound can be used to signify the terror a character evokes. "Sholay" is also exemplary in its use of soundmatching to jump cut to a different scene and time, without breaking the continuity of the narrative, yet, intensifying the drama."

"Sholay" was released on 15 August 1975, <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28India%29">Indian Independence Day</a>, in Mumbai. Due to lacklustre reviews and a lack of effective visual marketing tools, it saw poor financial returns in its first two weeks. From the third week, however, viewership picked up owing to positive <a href="word%20of%20mouth">word of mouth</a>. During the initial slow period, the director and writer considered re-shooting some scenes so that Amitabh Bachchan's character would not die. When business picked up, they abandoned this idea. After being helped additionally by a soundtrack release containing dialogue snippets, "Sholay" soon became an "overnight sensation". The film was then released in other distribution zones such as <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, <a href="West%20Bengal">Bengal</a>, and <a href="Hyderabad%20district%2C%20India">Hyderabad</a> on 11 October 1975. It became the highest-grossing <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> film of 1975, and film ranking website <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a> has given the film a verdict of "All Time Blockbuster".

"Sholay" went on to earn a still-standing record of 60 golden jubilees across India, and was the first film in India to celebrate a silver jubilee at over 100 theatres. It was shown continuously at Mumbai's Minerva theatre for over five years. "Sholay" was the Indian film with the longest theatrical run until "<a href="Dilwale%20Dulhania%20Le%20Jayenge">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>" (1995) broke its record of 286 weeks in 2001.

Exact figures are not available on the budget and box office earnings of "Sholay", but film trade sources provide estimates of its success. According to Box Office India, "Sholay" earned about in net income (valued at about US$16,778,000 in 1975) in India during its first run, which was many times its 30 million (valued at about US$3,355,000 in 1975) budget. Those earnings were a record that remained unbroken for nineteen years, which is also the longest amount of time that a film has held <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films%23Highest-grossing%20films%20by%20year">the record</a>. Its original gross was increased further with re-releases during the late 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. The film's total gross revenue in India amounted to (). Box Office India estimates the film's total footfalls in India as over 100million tickets sold. The film was also an <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films%20in%20overseas%20markets">overseas success</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, where it was released in 1979. The film sold 48.4million tickets during its initial run at the <a href="List%20of%20Soviet%20films%20of%20the%20year%20by%20ticket%20sales">Soviet box office</a>, before eventually selling 60million tickets including re-runs. The film was also released in China, as two parts in 1988.

It was the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">highest-grossing Indian film</a> ever up until "<a href="Disco%20Dancer">Disco Dancer</a>" (1982), and the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films%20in%20India">highest-grossing film in India</a> up until "<a href="Hum%20Aapke%20Hain%20Koun..%21">Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</a>" (1994). It is often cited that, after adjusting the figures for inflation, "Sholay" remains one of the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">highest-grossing films</a> in the history of Indian cinema, although such figures are not known with certainty. Box Office India estimated as "Sholay"'s adjusted domestic net income in 2008, while "<a href="Times%20of%20India">Times of India</a>" estimated over as the adjusted domestic gross in 2009. "<a href="Mid%20Day">Mid Day</a>" estimated the film's total adjusted gross as () in 2014. In terms of footfalls, the film is estimated to have sold over 100million tickets in India, in addition to 60million tickets in the Soviet Union. In 1985, "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" estimated that the film drew a total audience of 250million, which is comparable to the number of tickets sold by some of the world's <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20films">highest-grossing films of all time</a> adjusted for inflation.

Initial critical reviews of "Sholay" were negative. Among contemporary critics, K.L. Amladi of "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" called the film a "dead ember" and "a gravely flawed attempt". "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" said that the film was an unsuccessful mincing of Western style with Indian <a href="Social%20environment">milieu</a>, making it an "imitation western—neither here nor there." Others labelled it as "sound and fury signifying nothing" and a "second-rate take-off" of the 1971 film "Mera Gaon Mera Desh". Trade journals and columnists initially called the film a flop. In a 1976 article in the journal "Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review", author Michael Gallagher praised the technical achievement of the film, but otherwise criticised it stating, "As a spectacle it breaks new ground, but on every other level it is intolerable: formless, incoherent, superficial in human image, and a somewhat nasty piece of violence".

Over time, the critical reception to "Sholay" greatly improved; it is now considered a classic, and among the greatest Hindi-language films. In a 2005 BBC review, the well-rounded characters and simple narrative of the film were commended, but the comical cameos of Asrani and Jagdeep were considered unnecessary. On the film's 35th anniversary, the "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" wrote that it was a "trailblazer in terms of camera work as well as music," and that "practically every scene, dialogue or even a small character was a highlight." In 2006, The <a href="Film%20Society%20of%20Lincoln%20Center">Film Society of Lincoln Center</a> described "Sholay" as "an extraordinary and utterly seamless blend of adventure, comedy, music and dance", labelling it an "indisputable classic". "Chicago Review" critic Ted Shen criticised the film in 2002 for its formulaic plot and "slapdash" cinematography, and noted that the film "alternates between <a href="slapstick">slapstick</a> and melodrama". In their obituary of the producer G.P. Sippy, the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" said that "Sholay" "revolutionized Hindi filmmaking and brought true professionalism to Indian script writing".

"Sholay" was nominated for nine <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, but the only winner was <a href="M.%20S.%20Shinde">M. S. Shinde</a>, who won the award for <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Editing%20Award">Best Editing</a>. The film also won three awards at the 1976 <a href="Bengal%20Film%20Journalists%27%20Association%20Awards">Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards</a> (Hindi section): "Best Actor in Supporting Role" for Amjad Khan, "Best Cinematographer (Colour)" for Dwarka Divecha, and "Best Art Director" for Ram Yedekar. "Sholay" received a special award at the 50th Filmfare Awards in 2005: <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Film%20of%2050%20Years">Best Film of 50 Years</a>.

"Sholay" has received many "Best Film" honours. It was declared the "Film of the Millennium" by <a href="BBC%20India">BBC India</a> in 1999. It topped the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s "Top 10 Indian Films" <a href="Films%20considered%20the%20greatest%20ever">of all time</a> poll of 2002, and was voted the greatest Indian movie in a <a href="Sky%20%28UK%20and%20Ireland%29">Sky Digital</a> poll of one million British Indians in 2004. It was also included in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time Magazine</a>"s "Best of Bollywood" list in 2010, and in <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a>'s list of the "100 greatest Indian films of all time" in 2013.

"Sholay" inspired many films and <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a>s, and spawned a genre of films, the "Curry Western", which is a play on the term Spaghetti Western. A more accurate label for the genre is the Dacoit Western, due to its roots in earlier Indian dacoit films such as "<a href="Mother%20India">Mother India</a>" (1957) and "<a href="Gunga%20Jumna">Gunga Jumna</a>" (1961). It was also an early and most definitive <a href="masala%20film">masala film</a>, and a trend-setter for "multi-star" films. The film was a watershed for <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a>'s scriptwriters, who were not paid well before "Sholay"; after the film's success, its writing duo Salim-Javed became stars in their own right and script writing became a more respected profession. The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> has described "Sholay" as the ""<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" of Bollywood", comparing its impact on Bollywood to the impact that "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" (1977) later had on <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>, while comparing Gabbar Singh to <a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a>.

Certain scenes and dialogues from the film earned iconic status in India, such as ""Kitne aadmi the"" (How many men were there?), ""Jo dar gaya, samjho mar gaya"" (One who is scared is dead), and ""Bahut yaarana laagta hai"" (Looks like you two are very close) – all dialogues of Gabbar Singh. These and other popular dialogues entered the people's daily vernacular. Characters and dialogues from the film continue to be referred to and parodied in popular culture. Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by "seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains", who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by <a href="Kulbhushan%20Kharbanda">Kulbhushan Kharbanda</a>) of "<a href="Shaan%20%28film%29">Shaan</a>" (1980), Mogambo (<a href="Amrish%20Puri">Amrish Puri</a>) of "<a href="Mr.%20India%20%281987%20film%29">Mr. India</a>" (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of "<a href="Tridev">Tridev</a>" (1989). "Filmfare", in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema, and four actors were included in its 2010 list of "80 Iconic Performances" for their work in this film.

The film is often credited with making Amitabh Bachchan a "superstar", two years after he became a star with "<a href="Zanjeer%20%281973%20film%29">Zanjeer</a>" (1973). Some of the supporting actors remained etched in public memory as the characters they played in "Sholay"; for example, <a href="Mac%20Mohan">Mac Mohan</a> continued to be referred to as "Sambha", even though his character had just one line. Major and minor characters continue to be used in commercials, promos, films and sitcoms. Amjad Khan acted in many villainous roles later in his career. He also played Gabbar Singh again in the 1991 spoof "<a href="Ramgarh%20Ke%20Sholay">Ramgarh Ke Sholay</a>", and reprised the role in commercials. The British Film Institute in 2002 wrote that fear of Gabbar Singh "is still invoked by mothers to put their children to sleep". The 2012 film "<a href="Gabbar%20Singh%20%28film%29">Gabbar Singh</a>", named after the character, became the highest grossing <a href="Cinema%20of%20Andhra%20Pradesh">Telugu film</a> up to that point. Comedian <a href="Jagdeep">Jagdeep</a>, who played Soorma Bhopali in the film, attempted to use his "Sholay" success to create a spinoff. He directed and played the lead role in the 1988 film "<a href="Soorma%20Bhopali">Soorma Bhopali</a>", in which Dharmendra and Bachchan had cameos.

In 2004, "Sholay" was digitally remastered and shown again to packed theatres in India, including Mumbai's Minerva, where it had run successfully 29 years earlier. An attempt to remake "Sholay", <a href="Ram%20Gopal%20Varma">Ram Gopal Varma</a>'s film "<a href="Aag%20%282007%20film%29">Aag</a>" (2007), starring Amitabh Bachchan as the villain, was a commercial and critical disaster. Because of television and home media, "Sholay" is widely available and still popular. Twenty years after its release, "Sholay" was first shown on the Indian <a href="DD%20National">DD National</a> television channel, where it drew the highest ratings ever for an Indian film broadcast. Video game producer Mobile2win released the "Sholay Ramgarh Express" game for mobile phones in 2004, along with other "Sholay" themed content such as wallpapers, video clips, and ringtones.

"Sholay" has been the subject of two books and many articles. Wimal Dissanayake and Malti Sahai's "Sholay, A Cultural Reading" (1992) attempts a comprehensive scholarly study that sets the film within the broader history of popular cinema in India. <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a>'s "" (2000) provides an inside look at the film's production based on interviews with the director, stars, and crew members.

"Sholay" has been labelled by Chopra as the gold standard in Indian cinema, and a reference point for audiences and trade analysts. Over the years, the film has reached a mythic stature in popular culture, and has been called the greatest Hindi film of all time. It belongs to only a small collection of films, including "<a href="Kismet%20%281943%20film%29">Kismet</a>" (1943), "<a href="Mother%20India">Mother India</a>" (1957), "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" (1960) and "<a href="Hum%20Aapke%20Hain%20Koun..%21">Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</a>" (1994), which are repeatedly watched throughout India, and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. The lasting effect of "Sholay" on Indian cinema was summarised by Anupama Chopra, when in 2004 she called it "no longer just a film, [but] an event". In the 2000 book "Sholay: The Making of a Classic", the noted director <a href="Shekhar%20Kapur">Shekhar Kapur</a> stated "there has never been a more defining film on the Indian screen. Indian film history can be divided into "Sholay" BC and "Sholay" AD". The film was jointly released in Pakistan by <a href="Geo%20TV">Geo films</a> and Mandviwalla Entertainment on 17 April 2015, almost 40 years after its theatrical release. The film's premiere in the country was held in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>.

Filmmaker Ketan Mehta's company Maya Digital was responsible for converting "Sholay" into the <a href="Stereoscopic%203D">3D</a> format. Mehta was approached by G. P. Sippy's grandson, Sasha Sippy, about the project in 2010. In March 2012, Shaan Uttam Singh, the grandson of producer G. P. Sippy, said that he would sponsor a conversion of the film to 3D, and release it in late 2012; this was later postponed to late 2013, and eventually finalised for 3 January 2014. It took to convert "Sholay" to 3D.

Under the leadership of computer animator Frank Foster, 350 people worked to convert the film into the digital 3D format, for which every scene had to be individually <a href="Film%20preservation">restored</a>, colour-corrected and re-composited in 3D to match the depth. New set-pieces, particularly those suited to the new format were also included, such as digital logs which scatter in the direction of the camera during the first half of the film when the train collides with them, the gunshot scene which frees Jai and Veeru from their handcuffs, and <a href="Panorama">panoramic</a> views of Gabbar's hideout in the caves.

The theatrical trailer and release date were unveiled by the original script-writers Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar. The two original leads, Bachchan and Dharmendra, were also involved in promoting the re-release. The film was released in 1,000 screens in India, and additional screens overseas. It earned approximately during its re-release, not enough to recover its conversion cost.

Interstate 696

Interstate 696 (I-696) is an east–west <a href="List%20of%20auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highways">auxiliary Interstate Highway</a> in the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> is also known as the Walter P. Reuther Freeway, named for the prominent <a href="Walter%20P.%20Reuther">auto industry union head</a> by the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> in 1971. I-696 is a bypass route, detouring around the city of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> through the city's northern suburbs in <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland</a> and <a href="Macomb%20County%2C%20Michigan">Macomb</a> counties. It starts by branching off <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> and <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> at its western terminus in <a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a>, and runs through suburbs including <a href="Southfield%2C%20Michigan">Southfield</a>, <a href="Royal%20Oak%2C%20Michigan">Royal Oak</a> and <a href="Warren%2C%20Michigan">Warren</a> before merging into <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> at <a href="St.%20Clair%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair Shores</a> on the east end. It has eight lanes for most of its length and is approximately north of downtown Detroit. I-696 connects to other freeways such as <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> (Chrysler Freeway) and <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> (Lodge Freeway). Local residents sometimes refer to I-696 as "The Autobahn of Detroit."

Planning for the freeway started in the 1950s. Michigan state officials proposed the designation I-98, but this was not approved. Construction started on the first segment in 1961, and the Lodge Freeway was designated Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696) the following year. The western third of the freeway opened in 1963, and the eastern third was completed in January 1979. The central segment was the subject of much controversy during the 1960s and 1970s. Various municipalities along this stretch argued over the routing of the freeway such that the governor locked several officials into a room overnight until they would agree to a routing. Later, various groups used federal environmental regulations to force changes to the freeway. The <a href="Orthodox%20Jew">Orthodox Jew</a>ish community in <a href="Oak%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Oak Park</a> was concerned about pedestrian access across the freeway; I-696 was built with a set of parks on overpasses to accommodate their needs. The <a href="Detroit%20Zoo">Detroit Zoo</a> and the City of Detroit also fought components of the freeway design. These concessions delayed the completion of I-696 until December 15, 1989. Since completion, the speed limit was raised from . In addition, some interchanges were reconfigured in 2006.

I-696, which has been called "Detroit's Autobahn" by some residents reflecting a reputation for fast drivers, begins in the west in the city of Novi as a left exit branching off I-96. This ramp is a portion of the I-96/I-696/I-275/M-5 interchange that spans the north–south, Novi–<a href="Farmington%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Farmington Hills</a> city line linking together five converging freeways. The freeway curves southeasterly and then northeasterly through the complex as it runs eastward through the adjacent residential subdivisions. I-696 passes south of 12 Mile Road in the <a href="Mile%20Road%20System%20%28Detroit%29">Mile Road System</a> through Farmington Hills, passing south of <a href="Harrison%20High%20School%20%28Michigan%29">Harrison High School</a> and north of <a href="Mercy%20High%20School%20%28Farmington%20Hills%2C%20Michigan%29">Mercy High School</a>. After crossing into <a href="Southfield%2C%20Michigan">Southfield</a>, I-696 passes through the Mixing Bowl, another complex interchange that spans over near the <a href="American%20Center">American Center</a> involving M-10 (the Lodge Freeway and Northwestern Highway) and US 24 (Telegraph Road) between two <a href="Partial%20interchange%23partial-ic">partial interchanges</a> with Franklin Road on the west and Lahser Road on the east. The <a href="carriageway">carriageway</a>s for I-696 run in the <a href="median%20%28road%29">median</a> of M-10 from northwest to southeast. East of this interchange, cargo restrictions have been enacted for the next segment of I-696; no commercial vehicles may carry flammable or explosive loads.
After passing through the Mixing Bowl, I-696 follows 11 Mile Road, which forms a pair of <a href="service%20drive">service drive</a>s for the main freeway. The Interstate passes through the city of <a href="Lathrup%20Village%2C%20Michigan">Lathrup Village</a> before turning southward and then easterly on an S-shaped path to run along 10 Mile Road. This segment of freeway is known for its extensive use of <a href="retaining%20wall">retaining wall</a>s, with three large landscaped plazas forming short tunnels for freeway traffic near the Greenfield Road exit. The freeway passes next to the <a href="Jewish%20Community%20Center">Jewish Community Center</a> of Metropolitan Detroit as it passes under the third pedestrian plaza. The Interstate then picks up 10 Mile Road, which forms a pair of service drives, as the Reuther runs along the border between the cities of <a href="Oak%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Oak Park</a> and <a href="Huntington%20Woods%2C%20Michigan">Huntington Woods</a>. I-696 follows the southern edge of the <a href="Detroit%20Zoo">Detroit Zoo</a>. Immediately east of the zoo, the Interstate intersects <a href="M-1%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-1</a> (Woodward Avenue), and crosses a line of the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> that also carries <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> passenger service between Detroit and <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a>.

East of the rail crossing, I-696 has a four-level <a href="stack%20interchange">stack interchange</a> with I-75 over the <a href="quadripoint">quadripoint</a> for <a href="Royal%20Oak%2C%20Michigan">Royal Oak</a>, <a href="Madison%20Heights%2C%20Michigan">Madison Heights</a>, <a href="Hazel%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Hazel Park</a> and <a href="Ferndale%2C%20Michigan">Ferndale</a>. This interchange marks the eastern end of the cargo restrictions. I-696 jogs to the northeast near the <a href="Hazel%20Park%20Raceway">Hazel Park Raceway</a>, leaving 10 Mile Road. Crossing into <a href="Warren%2C%20Michigan">Warren</a> in <a href="Macomb%20County%2C%20Michigan">Macomb County</a> at the Dequindre Road interchange, the freeway begins to follow 11 Mile Road again. Near the <a href="Detroit%20Arsenal%20Tank%20Plant">Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant</a>, I-696 has <a href="Highway%20revolts%23Detroit">another stack interchange for Mound Road</a>; through the junction, the freeway makes a slight bend to the south. The freeway continues east through the northern edge of <a href="Center%20Line%2C%20Michigan">Center Line</a>, crossing a line of <a href="Conrail%20Shared%20Assets">Conrail Shared Assets</a> and heading back into Warren. The Interstate crosses into <a href="Roseville%2C%20Michigan">Roseville</a> near the <a href="M-97%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-97</a> (Groesbeck Highway) interchange and then meets <a href="M-3%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-3</a> (Gratiot Avenue) just west of the eastern terminus at I-94 (the Edsel Ford Freeway) in St. Clair Shores. The service drives merge in this final interchange and 11 Mile Road continues due east to <a href="Lake%20Saint%20Clair%20%28North%20America%29">Lake St.Clair</a>.

Like other state highways in Michigan, I-696 is maintained by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average</a>, 185,700 vehicles used the freeway daily east of I-75 and 38,100 vehicles did so each day in part of the Mixing Bowl, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-696 is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.

I-696 is part of the original <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> as outlined in 1956–58.
As originally proposed by the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a>, the freeway would have been numbered I-98. Construction started in 1961. The Lodge Freeway, the first segment of which opened in 1957, was given the Business Spur I-696 designation in 1962. The first segment of I-696 built was the western third of the completed freeway which opened in 1963–64 at a cost of $16.6 million (equivalent to $ in ). This section ran from the I-96 in Novi east to the Lodge Freeway in Southfield. The then-unfinished freeway was named for Walter P. Reuther, former leader of the <a href="United%20Auto%20Workers">United Auto Workers</a> labor union after he and his wife died in a plane crash on May 9, 1970. The next year the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> approved the naming by passing Senate Concurrent Resolution 57.

In the late 1970s, during the second phase of construction, lobbying efforts and lawsuits attempted to block construction of the central section. If successful, the efforts would have left the freeway with a gap in the middle between the first (western) and second (eastern) phases of construction. During this time, MDOT assigned <a href="M-6%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-6</a> to the eastern section of the freeway under construction. Signs were erected along the service roads that followed 11 Mile Road to connect the already built stack interchange at I-75 east to I-94. By the time the eastern freeway segment was initially opened in January 1979 between I-94 and I-75, the signage for M-6 was removed and replaced with I-696 signage; it cost $200 million (equivalent to $ in ) to complete. Later in 1979, a closure was scheduled to allow work to be completed on three of the nine interchanges on the segment.

The central section was the most controversial. Governor <a href="James%20Blanchard">James Blanchard</a> was 15 years old and a high school sophomore in neighboring <a href="Pleasant%20Ridge%2C%20Michigan">Pleasant Ridge</a> when the freeway was proposed and purchased a home in the area in 1972. He joked during remarks at the dedication in 1989, "The unvarnished truth about this freeway? I wasn't even alive when it was first proposed," and added, "frankly, I never thought it would go through." Total cost at completion for the entire freeway at the end of the 30-year project was $675 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Arguments between local officials were so intense that during the 1960s, then-Governor <a href="George%20W.%20Romney">George W. Romney</a> once locked fighting bureaucrats in a community center until they would agree on a path for the freeway. During the 1970s, local groups used then-new environmental regulations to oppose the Interstate. The freeway was noted in a <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congressional</a> subcommittee report on the "Major Interstate System Route Controversy in Urban Areas" or the controversies in 1970. Before 1967, local communities had to approve highway locations and designs, and the debates over I-696 prompted the passage of an arbitration statute. That statute was challenged by Pleasant Ridge and <a href="Lathrup%20Village%2C%20Michigan">Lathrup Village</a> before being upheld by the <a href="Michigan%20Supreme%20Court">Michigan Supreme Court</a>. Lathrup Village later withdrew from a planning agreement in 1971; had that agreement been implemented, construction on the central section was scheduled to commence in 1974 and finish in 1976.
The community of <a href="Orthodox%20Jew">Orthodox Jew</a>s in Oak Park wanted the freeway to pass to the north of their suburb. When this was deemed to be futile, the community asked for changes to the design that would mitigate the impact of the freeway to the pedestrian-dependent community. Final approval in 1981 of the freeway's alignment was contingent on these mitigation measures. To address the community's unique needs, the state hired a rabbi to serve as a consultant on the project. In addition, a series of landscaped plazas were incorporated into the design, forming the tunnels through which I-696 passes. These structures are a set of three bridges that cross the freeway within a mile (1.6 km). They allow members of the Jewish community to walk to synagogues on the Sabbath and other holidays when Jewish law prohibits driving. These plazas had their length limited; if they were longer they would be considered tunnels that would require ventilation systems.

The Detroit Zoo was concerned that noise and air pollution from the Interstate would disturb the animals. They were satisfied by $12 million (equivalent to $ in ) spent on a new parking ramp and other improvements. The City of Detroit tried to stop I-696 as well, but in the end the city was forced to redesign its golf course. A refusal to grant an additional of <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> by Detroit forced additional design and construction delays during the 1980s.

One of the last obstacles to construction of the freeway was a wetlands area near Southfield. MDOT received a permit from the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Natural%20Resources">Michigan Department of Natural Resources</a> to destroy of wetland and create a replacement area. In the process, some <a href="Rosa%20arkansana">prairie roses</a> and wetlands milkweed were transplanted from the path of I-696 in 1987. The final section of the eight-lane freeway opened at a cost of $436 million (equivalent to $ in ) on December 15, 1989. At the time, one caller to a Detroit radio show commented, "do you realize we have been to the moon and back in the time it has taken to get that road from Ferndale to Southfield?"

As part of the overall rehabilitation to the Mixing Bowl interchange, a new interchange at Franklin Road was to be constructed in 2006. An exit ramp from I-696 eastbound to American Drive opened in April 2006. An entrance ramp from Franklin Road to I-696 westbound opened in July 2006. The Franklin Road overpass, which had been closed during this time, re-opened in October 2006. On November 9 that year, the speed limit was increased from along the length of I-696.

Business Spur Interstate 696 (BS I-696) was the designation given to the <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Lodge Freeway</a> in the <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> area in 1962. This freeway was renumbered as part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> in 1970, when that highway designation was shifted off Woodward Avenue.

Sabre Wulf

Sabre Wulf is an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> by <a href="Ultimate%20Play%20the%20Game">Ultimate Play the Game</a>, initially released for the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a> in 1984. The player navigates the <a href="pith%20helmet">pith-helmeted</a> <a href="Sabreman">Sabreman</a> through a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">2D</a> jungle maze while collecting amulet pieces to bypass the guardian at its exit. The player does not receive explicit guidance on how to play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabreman moves between the maze's 256 <a href="flip-screen">connected screens</a> by touching the border where one screen ends and another begins. Each screen is filled with colourful flora, enemies that spawn at random, and occasional collectibles.

Ultimate released the game for the ZX Spectrum at an above-average price to combat piracy. Its premium product packaging became a company standard. The developers had finished "Sabre Wulf" sequels in advance of its release but—in keeping with their penchant for secrecy—chose to withhold them for marketing purposes. The sequels were swiftly released later that year. Ultimate hired outside developers to <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">port</a> "Sabre Wulf" to other computing platforms: the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, and <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>. The game was later featured in compilations including <a href="Rare%20Replay">the 2015 retrospective</a> of games by Ultimate and its successor, <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>.

Several gaming publications recommended the game, and "<a href="Crash%20%28magazine%29">Crash</a>" magazine readers named it the "Best Maze Game" of 1984. "Sabre Wulf" was a bestseller and a financial success. Though its labyrinthine gameplay was similar to that of Ultimate's <a href="Atic%20Atac">previous release</a>, reviewers preferred "Sabre Wulf". They further noted its difficult gameplay and lauded its graphics. Game journalists remember "Sabre Wulf" among the Spectrum's best releases, and for starting the Sabreman series.

In "Sabre Wulf", the player guides the <a href="pith%20helmet">pith-helmeted</a> adventurer <a href="Sabreman">Sabreman</a> through a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> maze. The player must reconstruct an amulet from its four pieces scattered throughout the maze to bypass the guardian at its exit, a cave that leads to the game's sequel, "<a href="Underwurlde">Underwurlde</a>". The maze is presented in <a href="flip-screen">flip-screen</a>s such that the player views one static tile of the maze's grid at a time. For example, when Sabreman reaches the left edge of one screen, he continues the maze at the right edge of the next screen.

The game opens to music composed by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>. Its tiled maze contains 256 screens and is drawn in a 16 by 16 grid. The maze's paths are bordered by tropical flora, populated with attacking enemies and, on its outskirts, surrounded by mountains. Apart from the jungle, the game's maze also includes several lakes. The player swings Sabreman's <a href="sabre">sabre</a> with the push of the <a href="joystick">joystick</a>'s fire button to defeat enemies that spawn in random on-screen locations. When the player idles too long in the same screen, an indestructible bushfire appears to pursue Sabreman. Enemies include spiders, scorpions, snakes, bats, indigenous people, sleeping hippos, and a fast wolf (the titular Sabre Wulf). Some enemies are killed, others flee when hit, while the wolf, cave guardian, and bushfire are unaffected by the sabre.

The player does not receive any explicit guidance on how to play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. "Sabre Wulf" graphics fill the screen with a minimal user interface consisting of the current game score, number of lives left and a <a href="high%20score">high score</a> meter on the top row. Sabreman can eat orchid <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s, which bloom for only a few seconds, to turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. <a href="invulnerability">invulnerability</a>, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">extra lives</a> scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> releases include a <a href="two-player">two-player</a> mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.

The developer of "Sabre Wulf", <a href="Ultimate%20Play%20the%20Game">Ultimate Play the Game</a>, had a reputation for secrecy. The company rarely gave interviews or revealed details about their internal practices or upcoming games. Little is known about their development process apart from that they used <a href="Sage%20IV">Sage IV</a> computers, preferred to develop for the <a href="ZX%20Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>'s <a href="Z80">Z80</a> <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>, and often outsourced development for other platforms, such as those that ran <a href="6502">6502</a> microprocessors. After releasing "<a href="Atic%20Atac">Atic Atac</a>" at the end of 1983, Ultimate went silent until it ran <a href="teaser%20advertisement">teaser advertisement</a>s for "Sabre Wulf" in April 1984. The company rarely depicted actual gameplay in their advertisements. They had already prepared "<a href="Knight%20Lore">Knight Lore</a>", the third game in the Sabreman series, in advance of the character's introduction in "Sabre Wulf". Ultimate withheld "Knight Lore" for about a year because they felt "Sabre Wulf" would not have sold as well once players saw the former's graphical advancements. "Knight Lore" subsequently became known as a seminal work in British gaming history and an iconic game of the 1980s for its popularization of the <a href="isometric%20platformer">isometric platformer</a> format.

Ultimate released "Sabre Wulf" for the ZX Spectrum in 1984 and the other Sabreman titles both released later that year. "Sabre Wulf" was Ultimate's first game to use what would become the company's standard price and mysterious, unadorned packaging. Retailing at £9.95, Ultimate nearly doubled its usual price in what they saw as a "bold step" to combat piracy. They expected legal owners to be more protective over letting friends copy their more expensive games. Ultimate had seen competitor prices slowly increasing and felt that the price was fair for their time invested. The game retailed in a large, high-quality cardboard box with a glossy instruction manual, both upgrades over typical game packaging. It became Ultimate's standard packaging for new games. The company's game packaging was nondescript and showed no screenshots of the in-game world. Ultimate's games also did not display internal <a href="Credit%20%28creative%20arts%29">credits</a>. The company hired outside developers to complete "Sabre Wulf" <a href="Porting%20of%20video%20games">ports</a> for other computers. Paul Proctor wrote the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> conversion, and in 1985, Greg Duddle wrote the Commodore 64 conversion, which was licensed under <a href="Firebird%20Software">Firebird</a>. "Sabre Wulf" later appeared in the 1985 compilation "They Sold a Million", a collection of Spectrum games that had together sold a million units. When the compilation was released for the <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a>, "Sabre Wulf" was converted for the platform and eventually released in a standalone edition. "Sabre Wulf" also appeared alongside "Underwurlde", its sequel, in a Commodore 64 pack, and in the August 2015 <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> compilation of 30 Ultimate and <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a> titles, "<a href="Rare%20Replay">Rare Replay</a>".

Reviewers appreciated the game's graphics and found its gameplay similar to Ultimate's previous game, "Atic Atac"—particularly in its opening sequence and maze format—but preferred "Sabre Wulf". Critics also noted the game's difficulty and above-average pricing. "Sabre Wulf" was a selected recommendation in "<a href="Crash%20%28magazine%29">Crash</a>" (July 1984), "<a href="Personal%20Computer%20Games">Personal Computer Games</a>" (August 1984), and "<a href="Popular%20Computing%20Weekly">Popular Computing Weekly</a>" (June 1984). The game was named "Best Maze Game" in the 1984 "Crash" Readers Awards. Ultimate's new pricing strategy was a success and "Sabre Wulf" topped the sales chart in the video game format. While "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" reported that "Sabre Wulf" broke the company's sales records, "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" ("CVG") said that the release underperformed prior games, with only 30,000 copies sold by December 1984. "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" later reported that 350,000 units were sold in total.

"Crash" confirmed rumours that the game was similar to "Atic Atac", but declared "Sabre Wulf" the better and predicted that they would have similar legacies. The magazine wrote that their inability to intuit Sabreman's current inventory or resistance to damage added to the game's mystique, and that Ultimate was particularly skilled at not giving hints but leaving sufficient clues through the game's design. "Personal Computer Games" found one such tip: that the indigenous enemies make a sound when aligned with an amulet piece. In a similar experience, "Popular Computing Weekly" slowly learned to use rather than avoid the orchids. "CVG" described the game's instructions as "cryptic". "Crash" later reflected that comparisons to "Atic Atac" at its launch were unfair, similar to calling any two <a href="text%20adventures">text adventures</a> identical.

Critics had high praise for the colourful and detailed graphics and animations. In the opinion of "CVG" reviewers, "Sabre Wulf" carried Ultimate's momentum from "<a href="Jetpac">Jetpac</a>" and "Atic Atac", and had the best graphics of any ZX Spectrum game, with graphical detail that surpassed what previous reviewers had considered the computer's limits. "Sinclair User" particularly liked how the hippo enemies force the player to vary their <a href="hack-and-slash">hack-and-slash</a> gameplay style. A "Crash" reviewer called the game "a Software Masterpiece". The magazine received more mail in praise of "Sabre Wulf" in 1984 than for any other game and, a year later, repeated that "Sabre Wulf" was among the top games available for the Spectrum, adding that the game did not feel antiquated. "CVG" Commodore 64 review, two years after the original release, approved of the port and said that the game remained a classic.

Reviewers complained of the game's high price, which was nearly double the average. "Crash" wondered if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a <a href="software%20bug">bug</a> in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. "CVG" recommended drawing a map of the maze, without which it was easy to get lost. While "Sabre Wulf" had some <a href="Flicker%20%28screen%29">flicker</a> issues, said "Sinclair User", the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.

A retrospective review from "Retro Gamer" reduced "Sabre Wulf" to "an interactive maze" packed with colour and hack-and-slash gameplay. The magazine likened the game's colour choice and setting to what the magazine considered Ultimate's best arcade game, "Dingo" (1983), and lamented Sabreman's inability to hit enemies above or below him. "Eurogamer" Peter Parrish retrospectively found the game's <a href="collision%20detection">collision detection</a> imprecise as well. In "The Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies", Simon Niedenthal used "Sabre Wulf" as an example of games that maximised the limited colour palette of 8-bit computers. He described its colours as "glow(ing) like stained glass, and the effects of color purity are enhanced by contrast with the black background."

Players and game journalists consider the game among the Spectrum's best. "Sabre Wulf" was the first of four titles in the Sabreman series for the ZX Spectrum. "Retro Gamer" credited the character's name and character traits for its lasting memorability. As an ordinary human with a hat and exaggerated nose, Sabreman fit the video game <a href="8-bit%20era">8-bit era</a>'s character archetype. The last, unreleased game in the Spectrum Sabreman series, "<a href="Mire%20Mare">Mire Mare</a>", was planned to have been similar to "Sabre Wulf" in gameplay. <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>, the successor to Ultimate, later released a <a href="side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a href="platformer">platformer</a> in 2004 for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> handheld console—also titled "<a href="Sabre%20Wulf%20%282004%20video%20game%29">Sabre Wulf</a>"—in which Sabreman enlists jungle animals to solve the Sabre Wulf's puzzles. It was not received well by fans. Elements from the original "Sabre Wulf" appear in other games, including Rare's "<a href="Jet%20Force%20Gemini">Jet Force Gemini</a>". "Retro Gamer" considered Sabreman's recurring appearance to be proof of Rare's interest in the character and series.

West Wycombe Park

West Wycombe Park is a <a href="English%20country%20house">country house</a> built between 1740 and 1800 near the village of <a href="West%20Wycombe">West Wycombe</a> in Buckinghamshire, England. It was conceived as a pleasure palace for the 18th-century <a href="libertine">libertine</a> and <a href="wikt%3Adilettante">dilettante</a> <a href="Francis%20Dashwood%2C%2011th%20Baron%20le%20Despencer">Sir Francis Dashwood, 2nd Baronet</a>. The house is a long rectangle with four façades that are <a href="column">column</a>ed and <a href="pediment">pediment</a>ed, three theatrically so. The house encapsulates the entire progression of British 18th-century architecture from early idiosyncratic <a href="Palladian">Palladian</a> to the <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a>, although anomalies in its design make it architecturally unique. The mansion is set within an 18th-century landscaped park containing many small temples and <a href="folly">follies</a>, which act as satellites to the greater temple, the house.

The house, which is a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, was given to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> in 1943 by <a href="Dashwood%20baronets">Sir John Dashwood, 10th Baronet</a> (1896–1966), an action strongly resented by his heir. Dashwood retained ownership of the surrounding estate and the contents of the house, most of which he sold; after his death, the house was restored at the expense of his son, the 11th Baronet. Today, while the structure is owned by the National Trust, the house is still the home of the Dashwood family. The house is open to the public during the summer months and is a venue for civil weddings and corporate entertainment, which help to fund its maintenance and upkeep.

West Wycombe Park, architecturally inspired by the villas of the <a href="Veneto">Veneto</a> constructed during the late-<a href="renaissance">renaissance</a> period, is not one of the largest, grandest or best-known of England's many country houses. Compared to its <a href="Palladian">Palladian</a> contemporaries, such as <a href="Holkham%20Hall">Holkham Hall</a>, <a href="Woburn%20Abbey">Woburn Abbey</a> and <a href="Ragley%20Hall">Ragley Hall</a>, it is quite small, yet it is architecturally important as it encapsulates a period of 18th-century English social history, when young men, known as <a href="dilettanti">dilettanti</a>, returning from the nearly obligatory <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> with newly purchased acquisitions of art, often built a country house to accommodate their collections and display in stone the learning and culture they had acquired on their travels.

The West Wycombe estate was acquired by <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Dashwood%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet</a>, and his brother <a href="Samuel%20Dashwood">Samuel</a> in 1698. Dashwood demolished the existing <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> and built a modern mansion on higher ground nearby. This mansion forms the core of the present house. Images of the house on early estate plans show a red-brick house with stone dressings and a hipped roof in the contemporary <a href="Queen%20Anne%20style%20architecture">Queen Anne style</a>. In 1724, Dashwood bequeathed this square conventional house to his 16-year-old son, the 2nd Baronet, also <a href="Francis%20Dashwood%2C%2011th%20Baron%20le%20Despencer">Francis</a>, who later inherited the title <a href="Baron%20le%20Despencer">Baron le Despencer</a> through his mother and is perhaps best known for establishing the <a href="Hellfire%20Club">Hellfire Club</a> close to the mansion, in the <a href="West%20Wycombe%20Caves">West Wycombe Caves</a>. Between 1726 and 1741, Dashwood embarked on a series of Grand Tours: the ideas and manners he learned during this period influenced him throughout his life and were pivotal in the rebuilding of his father's simple house, transforming it into the classical edifice that exists today.
West Wycombe has been described as "one of the most theatrical and Italianate mid-18th century buildings in England". Of all the 18th-century country houses, its façades replicate in undiluted form not only the <a href="Classical%20architecture">classical</a> <a href="villa">villa</a>s of Italy on which <a href="Palladianism">Palladianism</a> was founded, but also the temples of <a href="Classical%20antiquity">antiquity</a> on which <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</a> was based. The <a href="Doric%20order">Greek Doric</a> of the house's west portico is the earliest example of the <a href="Greek%20revival">Greek revival</a> in Britain.

The late 18th century was a period of change in the interior design of English country houses. The <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> concept of the principal floor, or "<a href="piano%20nobile">piano nobile</a>", with a large bedroom suite known as the <a href="state%20apartments">state apartments</a>, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate <a href="withdrawing%20room">withdrawing</a>, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above.

The builder of West Wycombe, Sir Francis Dashwood, 2nd Baronet, employed at least three architects and two <a href="landscape%20architect">landscape architect</a>s in the design of the house and its grounds. He had an input himself: having made the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a> and seen the villas of the <a href="Italian%20renaissance">Italian renaissance</a> first hand, he wished to emulate them.

Work began in about 1735 and continued until Dashwood's death in 1781, when the older house had been transformed inside and out. The long building time partly explains the flaws and variations in design: when building commenced, Palladianism was the height of fashion, but by the time of its completion, Palladianism had been succeeded by Neoclassicism; thus, the house is a marriage of both styles. While the marriage is not completely unhappy, the Palladian features are marred by the lack of <a href="Palladio">Palladio</a>'s proportions: the east portico is asymmetrical with the axis of the house, and trees were planted either side to draw the eye away from the flaw.

The finest architects of the day submitted plans to transform the older family house into a modern architectural extravaganza. Among them was <a href="Robert%20Adam">Robert Adam</a>, who submitted a plan for the west portico, but his idea was dropped. The architect <a href="Nicholas%20Revett">Nicholas Revett</a> was consulted and created the west portico. Today, the first sight of the house as approached from the drive is this west end of the house, which appears as a Grecian temple. The eight-columned portico, inspired by the <a href="Temple%20of%20Bacchus">Temple of Bacchus</a> in <a href="Teos">Teos</a> was completed by 1770, and is considered to be the earliest example of <a href="Greek%20revival%20architecture">Greek revival architecture</a> in Britain. The opposite (east) end of the house, designed by Roger Morris and completed c. 1755, appears equally temple-like, but this time the muse was the <a href="Villa%20Rotunda">Villa Rotunda</a> in <a href="Vicenza">Vicenza</a>. Thus the two opposing porticos, east and west, illustrate two architectural styles of the late-18th century: the earlier Roman inspired Palladian architecture and the more Greek inspired Neoclassicism.

The principal façade is the great south front, a two-storey <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a> of <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian</a> columns superimposed on <a href="Tuscan%20order">Tuscan</a>, the whole surmounted by a central pediment. The <a href="column">column</a>s are not stone, but wood coated in <a href="stucco">stucco</a>. It is possible this facade was inspired by work done in Paris on the church of S. Sulpice by <a href="Giovanni%20Niccol%C3%B2%20Servandoni">Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni</a> who was working in England from 1747 to 1751; some drawings made for Sir Francis Dashwood in emulation of his uncle's patronage of Palladian style, survive by him in the collection at West Wycombe. The executant architect for this elevation and for much of the work on the house appears to have been the minor architectural view painter John Donowell, who worked between 1761 and 1763 (although he had to wait until 1775 for payment). The façade, which has similarities to the main façade of Palladio's <a href="Palazzo%20Chiericati">Palazzo Chiericati</a> of 1550, was originally the entrance front. The front door is still in the centre of the ground floor leading into the main entry hall. This is a substantial deviation from the classical form of English Palladianism in which the main entrance and principal rooms would be on the first floor reached by an outer staircase, giving the main reception rooms elevated views, with the ground floor given over to service rooms. Such a radical re-arrangement was not possible here since the house was a partial rebuild rather than a wholly new structure.

The more severe north front is of eleven <a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a>, with the end bays given significance by <a href="rustication%20%28architecture%29">rustication</a> at ground floor level. The centre of the façade has <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a> columns supporting a pediment and originally had the Dashwood <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>. This façade is thought to date from around 1750–51, although its segmented windows suggest it was one of the first of the 2nd Baronet's improvements to the original house to be completed, as the curved or segmented window heads are symbolic of the earlier part of the 18th century; the design has been given to Isaac Ware.

The principal reception rooms are on the ground floor with large <a href="sash%20window">sash window</a>s opening immediately into the porticos and the colonnades, and therefore onto the gardens, a situation unheard of in the grand villas and palaces of <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> Italy. The mansion contains a series of 18th century salons decorated and furnished in the style of that period, with <a href="polychrome">polychrome</a> marble floors, and painted ceilings depicting classical scenes of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman mythology</a>. Of particular note is the entrance hall, which resembles a Roman <a href="Atrium%20%28architecture%29">atrium</a> with marbled columns and a painted ceiling copied from Robert Wood's "Ruins of Palmyra".

Many of the reception rooms have painted ceilings copied from Italian <a href="palazzo">palazzi</a>, most notably from the <a href="Palazzo%20Farnese">Palazzo Farnese</a> in Rome. The largest room in the house is the Music Room, which opens onto the east portico. The ceiling fresco in this room depicts the "Banquet of the Gods" and was copied from the <a href="Villa%20Farnesina">Villa Farnesina</a>. The Saloon, which occupies the centre of the north front, contains many marbles, including statuettes of the four seasons. The ceiling depicting "The Council of the Gods and the Admission of Psyche" is also a copy from Villa Farnesina.

The Dining Room walls are painted faux <a href="jasper">jasper</a> and hold paintings of the house's patron—<a href="Francis%20Dashwood%2C%2011th%20Baron%20le%20Despencer">Sir Francis Dashwood</a>—and his fellow members of the <a href="Divan%20Club">Divan Club</a> (a society for those who had visited the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>). The room also has a painted ceiling from Wood's "Palmyra".

The Blue Drawing Room is dominated by the elaborate painted ceiling depicting "The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne" ("illustrated left"). This room houses a plaster statuette of the <a href="Venus%20de%27%20Medici">Venus de' Medici</a> and marks the 2nd Baronet's risqué devotion to that goddess of love. The room has walls of blue <a href="Flocking%20%28texture%29">flock</a>, applied in the 1850s and later renewed, bearing paintings from various Italian schools of the 17th century. The Red Drawing Room is lined in crimson silk and is furnished with <a href="marquetry">marquetry</a> <a href="commode">commode</a>s.

The relatively small study contains plans for the house and potential impressions for various elevations. One is reputed to have been drawn by Sir Francis Dashwood himself, while the Tapestry Room, once ante-room to the adjoining former principal bedroom, is hung with <a href="Brussels%20tapestry">Brussels tapestries</a> depicting peasant scenes by <a href="Teniers">Teniers</a>. Dashwood inherited them in 1763 from his uncle <a href="John%20Fane%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Lord Westmorland</a>, who is said to have been given them by <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">the 1st Duke of Marlborough</a> to celebrate their victories in the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>.

The gardens at West Wycombe Park are among the finest and most idiosyncratic 18th century gardens surviving in England. The park is unique in its consistent use of Classical architecture from both Greece and Italy. The principal architect of the gardens was <a href="Nicholas%20Revett">Nicholas Revett</a>, who designed many of the ornamental <a href="List%20of%20garden%20structures%20at%20West%20Wycombe%20Park">buildings in the park</a>. The landscape architect <a href="Thomas%20Cook%20%28landscape%20architect%29">Thomas Cook</a> began to execute the plans for the park, with a nine-acre man-made lake created from the nearby <a href="River%20Wye%2C%20Buckinghamshire">River Wye</a> in the form of a swan. The lake originally had a <a href="snow%20%28ship%29">snow</a> (a sailing vessel) for the amusement of Dashwood's guests, complete with a resident captain on board. Water leaves the lake down a <a href="waterfall">cascade</a> and into a canal pond.

<a href="Georgian%20period%20in%20British%20history">Georgian</a> <a href="English%20landscape%20garden">English landscape garden</a>s, such as West Wycombe and <a href="Stowe%20Landscape%20Gardens">Stowe</a>, are arranged as a walk or series of walks that take the visitor through a range of locations, each with its own specific character and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of the landscape is used, alongside <a href="folly">follies</a> and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000 acres (20 km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of <a href="High%20Wycombe">High Wycombe</a>, and <a href="Humphrey%20Repton">Humphrey Repton</a> completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.

The park still contains many follies and temples. The "Temple of Music" is on an island in the lake, inspired by the <a href="Temple%20of%20Vesta">Temple of Vesta</a> in Rome. It was designed for Dashwood's <a href="f%C3%AAte%20champ%C3%AAtre">fêtes champêtres</a>, with the temple used as a theatre; the remains of the stage survive. Opposite the temple is the garden's main cascade which has statues of two <a href="Nymph">water nymphs</a>. The present cascade has been remade, as the original was demolished in the 1830s. An <a href="octagon">octagon</a>al tower known as the "Temple of the Winds" is based in design on the <a href="Tower%20of%20the%20Winds">Tower of the Winds</a> in Athens.

Classical architecture continues along the path around the lake, with the "Temple of <a href="Flora%20%28mythology%29">Flora</a>", a hidden <a href="summer%20house">summerhouse</a>, and the "Temple of <a href="Daphne%20%28mythology%29">Daphne</a>", both reminiscent of a small temple on the <a href="Acropolis">Acropolis</a>. Another hidden temple, the "Round Temple", has a curved <a href="loggia">loggia</a>. Nearer the house, screening the service wing from view, is a Roman <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>, the "Temple of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>", also known (because of its former use a venue for <a href="cock%20fighting">cock fighting</a>) as "Cockpit Arch", which holds a copy of the famed <a href="Apollo%20Belvedere">Apollo Belvedere</a>. Close by is the "Temple of <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>", with a small niche containing a statue of the goddess. Another goddess is celebrated in the "Temple of <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>". Below this is an <a href="Exedra">Exedra</a>, a <a href="grotto">grotto</a> (known as Venus's Parlour) and a statue of <a href="Mercury%20%28mythology%29">Mercury</a>. This once held a copy of the <a href="Venus%20de%27%20Medici">Venus de' Medici</a>; it was demolished in the 1820s but was reconstructed in the 1980s and now holds a replica of the <a href="Venus%20de%20Milo">Venus de Milo</a>.

Later structures that break the classical theme include the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic</a> style <a href="boathouse">boathouse</a>, a Gothic Alcove – now a romantic ruin hidden amongst undergrowth – and a Gothic Chapel, once home of the village <a href="shoemaking">cobbler</a> (and facetiously named St Crispin's) but later used as the estate <a href="kennel">kennel</a>s. A monument dedicated to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> was erected on her 60th birthday in 1986.

The gardens are listed Grade I on the <a href="Register%20of%20Historic%20Parks%20and%20Gardens%20of%20special%20historic%20interest%20in%20England">Register of Historic Parks and Gardens</a>.

Sir Francis Dashwood built West Wycombe to entertain, and there has been much speculation on the kind of entertainment he provided for his guests. Judged against the sexual morals of the late 18th century, Dashwood and his clique were regarded as promiscuous; while it is likely that the contemporary reports of the <a href="bacchanalia">bacchanalia</a>n <a href="orgy">orgies</a> over which Dashwood presided in the <a href="Hellfire%20Club">Hellfire</a> caves above West Wycombe were exaggerated, <a href="free%20love">free love</a> and heavy drinking did take place there. Dashwood often had himself depicted in <a href="portrait">portrait</a>s in fancy dress (in one, dressed as St Francis of Assisi toasting a statue of Venus), and it is his love of fancy dress which seems to have pervaded through to his parties at West Wycombe Park. Following the dedication of the West portico as the temple of Bacchus in 1771, Dashwood and his friends dressed in skins adorned with vine leaves and went to party by the lake for "<a href="Paean">Paean</a>s and <a href="libation">libation</a>s". On another occasion, during a <a href="naumachia">mock sea battle</a> on the canal, the captain of the snow, "attacking" a <a href="Artillery%20battery">battery</a> constructed on the bank, was struck by the <a href="wadding">wadding</a> of a gun and suffered an internal injury. Dashwood later devoted more of his time to political reform and to charitable works; he had an active political career all of his adult life; a serious occupation belied by his reputation for revelry. He died in 1781, bequeathing West Wycombe to his half-brother <a href="Sir%20John%20Dashwood-King%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir John Dashwood-King, 3rd Baronet</a>.

Dashwood-King spent little time at West Wycombe. On his death in 1793, the estate was inherited by his son <a href="Sir%20John%20Dashwood-King%2C%204th%20Baronet">Sir John Dashwood, 4th Baronet</a>, Member of Parliament for <a href="Wycombe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Wycombe</a> and a friend of the <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a>, although their friendship was tested when Sir John accused his wife of an affair with the prince. Like his father, Sir John cared little for West Wycombe and held a five-day sale of West Wycombe's furniture in 1800. In 1806, he was prevented from selling West Wycombe by the <a href="trustee">trustee</a>s of his son, to whom the estate was <a href="entailed">entailed</a>. He became religious in the last years of his life, holding ostentatiously <a href="teetotal">teetotal</a> parties in West Wycombe's gardens in aid of the "Friends of Order and Sobriety" – these would have been vastly different from the bacchanalian fêtes given by his uncle in the grounds. In 1847, Sir John was bankrupt and <a href="bailiff">bailiff</a>s possessed the furniture from his home at <a href="Halton%20House">Halton</a>. He died estranged from his wife and surviving son in 1849.

Sir John was succeeded by his estranged son <a href="Sir%20George%20Dashwood%2C%205th%20Baronet">Sir George Dashwood, 5th Baronet</a>. For the first time since the death of the 2nd Baronet in 1781, West Wycombe became again a favoured residence. However, the estate was heavily in debt and Sir George was forced to sell the unentailed estates, including Halton, which was sold in 1851 to <a href="Lionel%20de%20Rothschild">Lionel de Rothschild</a> for the then huge sum of £54,000 (£ in 2019). The change in the Dashwoods' fortunes allowed for the refurbishment and restoration of West Wycombe. Sir George died childless in 1862, and left his wife, Elizabeth, a <a href="life%20tenancy">life tenancy</a> of the house while the title and ownership passed briefly to his brother and then a nephew. Lady Dashwood's continuing occupation of the house prevented the nephew, <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Dashwood%2C%207th%20Baronet">Sir Edwin Hare Dashwood, 7th Baronet</a>, an alcoholic sheep farmer in the <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> of New Zealand, from living in the mansion until she died in 1889, leaving a neglected and crumbling estate.

The 7th Baronet's son, Sir Edwin Dashwood, 8th Baronet, arrived from New Zealand to claim the house, only to find Lady Dashwood's heirs claiming the house's contents and family jewellery, which they subsequently sold. As a consequence, Sir Edwin was forced to mortgage the house and estate in 1892. He died suddenly the following year, and the heavily indebted estate passed to his brother, Sir Robert Dashwood, 9th Baronet. Sir Robert embarked on a costly legal case against the executors of Lady Dashwood, which he lost, and raised money by denuding the estate's woodlands and leasing the family town house in London for 99 years. On his death in 1908, the house passed to his 13-year-old son Sir John Dashwood, 10th Baronet, who in his adulthood sold much of the remaining original furnishings (including the state bed, for £58 – this important item of the house's history complete with its gilded pineapples is now lost). In 1922, he attempted to sell the house itself. He received only one offer, of £10,000 (£ in 2019), so the house was withdrawn from sale. Forced to live in a house he disliked, the village of West Wycombe was sold in its entirety to pay for renovations. Not all these renovations were beneficial: painted 18th century ceilings were overpainted white, and the dining room was divided into service rooms, allowing the large service wing to be abandoned to rot.

A form of salvation for West Wycombe was Sir John's wife: Lady Dashwood, the former Helen Eaton, a Canadian and sister of American novelist <a href="Evelyn%20Eaton">Evelyn Eaton</a>, was a socialite who loved entertaining, and did so in some style at West Wycombe throughout the 1930s. Living a semi-estranged life from her husband, occupying opposite ends of the mansion, she frequently gave "large and stylish" house parties.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the house saw service as a depository for the evacuated <a href="Wallace%20Collection">Wallace Collection</a> and a convalescent home. A troop of gunners occupied the decaying service wing, and the park was used for the inflation of <a href="barrage%20balloon">barrage balloon</a>s. During this turmoil, the Dashwoods retreated to the upper floor and took in lodgers to pay the bills, albeit very superior lodgers, who included <a href="Nancy%20Mitford">Nancy Mitford</a> and <a href="James%20Lees-Milne">James Lees-Milne</a>, who was secretary of the Country House Committee of the National Trust and instrumental in the Trust's acquisition of many such houses. In 1943, Sir John gave the house and grounds to the National Trust, on condition that he and his descendants could continue living in the house.

In the latter half of the 20th century, Sir Francis Dashwood, 11th Baronet, embarked on a program of restoration and improvement. His efforts included the installation of a huge <a href="equestrian%20sculpture">equestrian sculpture</a> as the focal point of a long tree lined <a href="Vista%20%28landscaping%29">vista</a> from the house. On close inspection, it proves to be a <a href="fibre%20glass">fibre glass</a> <a href="Theatrical%20property">prop</a> found at <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> by the 11th Baronet who paid for it with 12 bottles of champagne. The local <a href="Local%20government%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">planning authority</a> was furious but lost their lawsuit to have it removed. Today, from a distance, it has been "known to fool experts".

The present head of the Dashwood family is Sir Edward Dashwood (born 1964), who is married and has three children. The contents of the house are owned by the family, who also own and run the estate. The house can be hired as a filming location, and, in addition to agricultural and equestrian enterprises, there is a large <a href="Pheasant">pheasant shoot</a> with paying guns. The park, a natural <a href="amphitheatre">amphitheatre</a>, is often the setting for large public concerts and firework displays, and the mansion is available for weddings and corporate entertainment.

While the estate remains in private hands, the National Trust owns the house and gardens, the park, the village of <a href="West%20Wycombe">West Wycombe</a>, and the hill on which the Dashwood mausoleum sits. The hill was the first part of the property given to the Trust by Sir John Dashwood in 1925. The village was bought by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> from Sir John in 1929 and given to the Trust five years later. The grounds are open to the public in the afternoon only from April to August annually, and the house is open from June to August.
