French colonization of Texas

The French colonization of Texas began with the establishment of a fort in present-day southeastern <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. It was established in 1685 near Arenosa Creek and <a href="Matagorda%20Bay">Matagorda Bay</a> by explorer <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Robert%20Cavelier%2C%20Sieur%20de%20La%20Salle">Robert Cavelier de La Salle</a>. He intended to found the colony at the <a href="River%20mouth">mouth</a> of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, but inaccurate maps and navigational errors caused his ships to anchor instead to the west, off the coast of Texas. The colony survived until 1688. The present-day town of <a href="Inez%2C%20Texas">Inez</a> is near the fort's site.

The colony faced numerous difficulties during its brief existence, including <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> raids, <a href="epidemics">epidemics</a>, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions to find the Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much of the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> and parts of <a href="east%20Texas">east Texas</a>. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was <a href="Shipwrecking">wrecked</a>, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only with help from the French settlements in <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a> to the north, along the Mississippi and <a href="Illinois%20River">Illinois River</a>s. His last expedition ended along the <a href="Brazos%20River">Brazos River</a> in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a>.

Although a handful of men reached Illinois Country, help never made it to the fort. Most of the remaining members of the colony were killed during a <a href="Karankawa">Karankawa</a> raid in late 1688, four children survived after being adopted as captives. Although the colony lasted only three years, it established France's claim to possession of the region that is now Texas. The <a href="United%20States">United States</a> later claimed, unsuccessfully, this region as part of the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> because of the early French colony.

Spain learned of La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could threaten Spain's control over the <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20New%20Spain">Viceroyalty of New Spain</a> and the unsettled southeastern region of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, the <a href="Spanish%20monarchy">Crown</a> funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate the settlement. The unsuccessful expeditions helped Spain to better understand the geography of the <a href="Gulf%20Coast">Gulf Coast</a> region. When the Spanish finally discovered the remains of the French colony at the fort in 1689, they buried the <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s and burned the buildings. Years later, <a href="New%20Spain">Spanish</a> authorities built a "<a href="presidio">presidio</a>" at the same location. When the "presidio" was abandoned, the site of the French settlement was lost to history.

The fort was rediscovered by historians and excavated in 1996, and the area is now an <a href="archaeological">archaeological</a> site. In 1995, researchers located the ship "<a href="La%20Belle%20%28ship%29">La Belle</a>" in <a href="Matagorda%20Bay">Matagorda Bay</a>, with several sections of the <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> remaining virtually intact. They constructed a <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a>, the first to be used in North America to excavate the ship as if in dry conditions. In 2000, excavations revealed three of the original structures of the <a href="fort">fort</a>, as well as three graves of Frenchmen.

By the late 17th century, much of North America had been claimed by European countries. Spain had claimed <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Florida</a> as well as modern-day Mexico and <a href="Santa%20Fe%20de%20Nuevo%20M%C3%A9xico">much of the southwestern part of the continent</a>. The northern and central <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast was <a href="British%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">claimed by Britain</a>, and <a href="New%20France">New France</a> comprised much of what is now eastern Canada as well as the central <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a>. The French feared that their territory was vulnerable to the expansionist aims of its neighbors. In 1681, <a href="French%20nobility">French nobleman</a> <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Robert%20Cavelier%2C%20Sieur%20de%20La%20Salle">Robert Cavelier de La Salle</a> launched an expedition down the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> from New France, at first believing he would find a path to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Instead, La Salle found a route to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Although <a href="Hernando%20De%20Soto%20%28explorer%29">Hernando De Soto</a> had explored and claimed this area for Spain 140 years before, on April 9, 1682, La Salle claimed the Mississippi River valley for French king <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>, naming the territory Louisiana in his honor.

Unless France established a base at the mouth of the Mississippi, Spain would have an opportunity to control the entire Gulf of Mexico and potentially pose a threat to New France's southern borders. La Salle believed that the Mississippi River was near the eastern edge of New Spain. On his return to France in 1684, he proposed to the Crown the establishment of a colony at the mouth of the river. The colony could provide a base for promoting Christianity among the native peoples as well as a convenient location for attacking the Spanish province of <a href="Nueva%20Vizcaya%2C%20New%20Spain">Nueva Vizcaya</a> and gaining control of its lucrative silver mines. He argued that a small number of Frenchmen could successfully invade <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a> by allying themselves with some of the more than 15,000 <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> who were angry over Spanish enslavement. After Spain declared war on France in October 1667, King Louis agreed to support La Salle's plan. He was to return to North America and confirm "the Indians' allegiance to the crown, leading them to the true faith, and maintaining intertribal peace".

La Salle originally planned to sail to New France, journey overland to the south and Illinois Country, and then travel down the Mississippi River to its mouth. To spite Spain, Louis XIV insisted that La Salle sail through the Gulf of Mexico, which Spain considered its exclusive property. Although La Salle had requested only one ship, on July 24, 1684, he left <a href="La%20Rochelle%2C%20France">La Rochelle, France</a> with four: the 36-gun <a href="man-of-war">man of war</a> "Le Joly", the 300-ton storeship "L'Aimable", the <a href="barque">barque</a> "<a href="La%20Belle%20%28ship%29">La Belle</a>", and the <a href="ketch">ketch</a> "St. François". Although Louis XIV had provided both "Le Joly" and "La Belle", La Salle desired more cargo space and leased "L'Aimable" and "St. François" from French merchants. Louis also provided 100 soldiers and full crews for the ships, as well as funds to hire skilled workers to join the expedition. La Salle was forced to purchase trade goods himself for expected encounters with Native Americans. .

The ships carried a total of nearly 300 people, including soldiers, <a href="artisan">artisan</a>s and craftsmen, six Catholic <a href="missionary">missionaries</a>, eight merchants, and over a dozen women and children. Shortly after their departure, France and Spain ceased hostilities, and Louis was no longer interested in sending La Salle further assistance. Details of the voyage were kept secret so that Spain would not learn about it. La Salle's naval commander, the Sieur de Beaujeu, resented La Salle's keeping their destination until the party was well underway. The discord between the two intensified when they reached <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a>, on the island of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>, and quarreled over where to anchor. Beaujeu sailed to another part of the island, allowing Spanish <a href="privateers">privateers</a> to capture the "St. François", which had been fully loaded with supplies, provisions, and tools for the colony.

During the 58-day voyage, two people died of illness and one woman gave birth to a child. The voyage to Saint-Domingue had lasted longer than expected, and provisions ran low, especially after the loss of the "St. François". La Salle had little money with which to replenish supplies, and finally two of the merchants aboard the expedition sold some of their trade goods to the islanders, and lent their profits to La Salle. To fill the gaps left after several men deserted, La Salle recruited a few islanders to join the expedition.

In late November 1684, when La Salle had fully recovered from a severe illness, the three remaining ships continued their search for the Mississippi River <a href="River%20delta">delta</a>. Before they left Santo Domingo, local sailors warned that strong Gulf currents flowed east and would tug the ships toward the Florida straits unless they corrected for it. On December 18, the ships reached the Gulf of Mexico and entered waters that Spain claimed as its territory. None of the members of the expedition had ever been in the Gulf of Mexico or knew how to navigate it. Due to a combination of inaccurate maps, La Salle's previous miscalculation of the latitude of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and overcorrection for the currents, the expedition failed to find the Mississippi. Instead, they landed at <a href="Matagorda%20Bay">Matagorda Bay</a> in early 1685, west of the Mississippi.

On February 20, the colonists set foot on land for the first time in three months since leaving Saint-Domingue. They set up a temporary camp near the site of the present-day <a href="Matagorda%20Island%20Lighthouse">Matagorda Island Lighthouse</a>. The chronicler of the expedition, <a href="Henri%20Joutel">Henri Joutel</a>, described his first view of Texas: "The country did not seem very favorable to me. It was flat and sandy but did nevertheless produce grass. There were several salt pools. We hardly saw any wild fowl except some cranes and Canadian (sic) geese which were not expecting us."

Against Beaujeu's advice, La Salle ordered "La Belle" and the "Aimable" "to negotiate the narrow and shallow pass" to bring the supplies closer to the campsite. To lighten "L'Aimable"'s load, its eight cannons and a small portion of its cargo were removed. After "La Belle" successfully negotiated the pass, La Salle sent her pilot to "L'Aimable" to assist with the navigation, but "L'Aimable's" captain refused the help. As the "Aimable" set sail, a band of <a href="Karankawa">Karankawa</a> approached and carried off some of the settlers. La Salle led a small group of soldiers to rescue them, leaving no one to direct the "Aimable." When he returned, he found the "Aimable" grounded on a sandbar. Upon hearing that the captain had ordered the ship to sail forward after it had struck a sandbar, La Salle became convinced that the captain had deliberately grounded the ship.

For several days the men attempted to salvage the tools and provisions that had been loaded on the "Aimable", but a bad storm prevented them from recovering more than food, cannons, powder, and a small amount of the merchandise. The ship sank on March 7. The French watched the Karankawa loot the wreckage. As French soldiers approached the Native American village to retrieve their supplies, the villagers hid. On discovering the deserted village, the soldiers not only reclaimed the looted merchandise but also took animal pelts and two canoes. The angry Karankawa attacked, killing two Frenchmen and injuring others.

Beaujeu, having fulfilled his mission in escorting the colonists across the ocean, returned to France aboard the "Joly" in mid-March 1685. Many of the colonists chose to return to France with him, leaving approximately 180. Although Beaujeu delivered a message from La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having made peace with Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> and <a href="venereal%20diseases">venereal diseases</a>, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.

On March 24, La Salle took 52 men in five canoes to find a less exposed settlement site. They found Garcitas Creek that had fresh water and fish, with good soil along its banks. They named it Rivière aux Boeufs for the nearby <a href="American%20Bison">buffalo</a> herds. The fort was constructed on a bluff overlooking the creek, 1.5 <a href="League%20%28unit%29%23France">leagues</a> from its mouth. Two men died, one of a <a href="rattlesnake">rattlesnake</a> bite and another from drowning while trying to fish. At night, the Karankawa would sometimes surround the camp and howl, but the soldiers could scare them away with a few gun shots. The fort has sometimes been referred to as "Fort St. Louis" but that name was not used during the life of the settlement and appears to be a later invention.
In early June, La Salle summoned the rest of the colonists from the temporary campsite to the new settlement site. Seventy people began the overland trek on June 12. All of the supplies had to be hauled from the "Belle", a physically draining task that was finally completed by the middle of July. The last load was accompanied by the 30 men who had remained behind to guard the ship. Although trees grew near the site, they were not suitable for building, and timber had to be transported to the building site from several miles inland. Some timbers were salvaged from the "Aimable". By the end of July, over half of the settlers had died, most from a combination of scant rations and overwork.

The remaining settlers built a large two-story structure at the center of the settlement. The ground floor was divided into three rooms: one for La Salle, one for the priests, and one for the officers of the expedition. The upper story consisted of a single room used to store supplies. Surrounding the fort were several smaller structures to provide shelter for the other members of the expedition. The eight cannons, each weighing , had been salvaged from "L'Aimable" and were positioned around the colony for protection.

For several months after the permanent camp was built, the colonists took short trips to explore their surroundings. At the end of October 1685, La Salle decided to undertake a longer expedition and reloaded the "Belle" with many of the remaining supplies. He took 50 men, plus the "Belle's" crew of 27 sailors, leaving behind 34 men, women, and children. Most of the men traveled with La Salle in canoes, while the "Belle" followed further off the coast. After three days of travel, they learned of hostile Native Americans in the area. Twenty of the Frenchmen attacked the Native American village, where they found Spanish artifacts. Several of the men died on this expedition from eating <a href="opuntia">prickly pear</a>. The Karankawa killed a small group of the men who had camped on shore, including the captain of the "Belle".

From January until March 1686, La Salle and most of his men searched overland for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>, possibly as far west as modern-day <a href="Langtry%2C%20Texas">Langtry, Texas</a>. The men questioned the local Native American tribes, asking for information on the locations of the Spaniards and the Spanish mines, offering gifts, and telling stories that portrayed the Spanish as cruel and the French as benevolent. When the group returned, they were unable to find the "Belle" where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.

The following month they traveled east, hoping to locate the Mississippi and return to Canada. During their travels, the group encountered the <a href="Caddo">Caddo</a>, who gave the Frenchmen a map depicting their territory, that of their neighbors, and the location of the Mississippi River. The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French. While visiting the Caddo, the French met <a href="Jumano">Jumano</a> traders, who reported on the activities of the Spanish in New Mexico. These traders later informed Spanish officials of the Frenchmen they had seen.

Four of the men deserted when they reached the <a href="Neches%20River">Neches River</a>. La Salle and one of his nephews became very ill, forcing the group to halt for two months. While the men recovered, the group ran low on food and gunpowder. In August, the eight surviving members of the expedition returned to Fort Saint Louis, having never left East Texas.

While La Salle was gone, six of those who had remained on the "Belle" finally arrived at Fort Saint Louis. According to them, the new captain of the "Belle" was always drunk. Many of the sailors did not know how to sail, and they grounded the boat on Matagorda Peninsula. The survivors took a canoe to the fort, leaving the ship behind. The destruction of their last ship left the settlers stranded on the Texas coast, with no hope of gaining assistance from the French colonies in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>.

By early January 1687, fewer than 45 of the original 180 people remained in the colony, which was beset by internal strife. La Salle believed that their only hope of survival lay in trekking overland to request assistance from <a href="New%20France">New France</a>, and some time that month he led a final expedition to try to reach the <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a>. Fewer than 20 people remained at Fort Saint Louis, primarily women, children, and those deemed unfit, as well as seven soldiers and three missionaries with whom La Salle was unhappy. Seventeen men were included on the expedition, including La Salle, his brother, and two of his nephews. While camping near present-day <a href="Navasota%2C%20Texas">Navasota</a> on March 18, several of the men quarreled over the division of buffalo meat. That night, an expedition member killed one of La Salle's nephews and two other men in their sleep. The following day La Salle was killed while approaching the camp to investigate his nephew's disappearance. Infighting led to the deaths of two other expedition members within a short time. Two of the surviving members, including <a href="Jean%20L%27Archeveque">Jean L'Archeveque</a>, joined the Caddo. The remaining six men, led by Henri Joutel, made their way to Illinois Country. During their journey through Illinois to Canada, the men did not tell anyone that La Salle was dead. They reached France in the summer of 1688 and informed King Louis of La Salle's death and the horrible conditions in the colony. Louis did not send aid.

Spanish pirate and "guarda costa" privateer <a href="Juan%20Corso">Juan Corso</a> had independently heard rumors of the colony as early as the Spring of 1685; he set out to eliminate the settlement but his ship was caught in rough seas and poor weather and was lost with all hands. Afterwards La Salle's mission had remained nearly secret until 1686 when former expedition member Denis Thomas, who had deserted in <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Santo%20Domingo">Santo Domingo</a>, was arrested for <a href="piracy">piracy</a>. Trying to have his punishment reduced, Thomas informed his Spanish jailers of La Salle's plan to found a colony and eventually conquer Spanish silver mines. Despite his confession, Thomas was hanged. 

The Spanish government felt the French colony would be a threat to their mines and shipping routes, and <a href="Carlos%20II">Carlos II's</a> Council of War thought that "Spain needed swift action 'to remove this thorn which has been thrust into the heart of America. The greater the delay the greater the difficulty of attainment.'" The Spanish had no idea where to find La Salle, and in 1686 they sent a sea expedition and two land expeditions to try to locate his colony. Although the expeditions were unable to find La Salle, they did narrow the search to the area between the Rio Grande and the Mississippi. Four Spanish expeditions the following year failed to find La Salle, but helped Spain to better understand the geography of the Gulf Coast region.

In 1688, the Spanish sent three more expeditions, two by sea and one by land. The land expedition, led by <a href="Alonso%20De%20Le%C3%B3n">Alonso De León</a>, discovered <a href="Jean%20Gery">Jean Gery</a>, who had deserted the French colony and was living in Southern Texas with the <a href="Coahuiltecan">Coahuiltecan</a>s. Using Gery as a translator and guide, De León finally found the French fort in late April 1689. The fort and the five crude houses surrounding it were in ruins. Several months before, the Karankawa had attacked the settlement. They destroyed the structures and left the bodies of three people, including a woman who had been shot in the back. A Spanish priest who had accompanied De León conducted funeral services for the three victims. The chronicler of the Spanish expedition, <a href="http%3A//www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fch70">Juan Bautista Chapa</a>, wrote that the devastation was God's punishment for opposing the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>, as Pope <a href="Alexander%20VI">Alexander VI</a> had granted the Indies exclusively to the Spanish. The remains of the fort were destroyed by the Spanish, who also buried the French cannons left behind. The Spanish later built a fort on the same location.
In early 1689, Spanish authorities received a plea, written in French. <a href="Jumano">Jumano</a> scouts had received these papers from the Caddo, who asked that they be delivered to the Spanish. The papers included a parchment painting of a ship, as well as a written message from <a href="Jean%20L%27Archev%C3%AAque">Jean L'Archevêque</a>. The message read:

De León later rescued L'Archeveque and his companion Jacques Grollet. On interrogation, the men maintained that over 100 of the French settlers had died of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, and the others had been killed by Native Americans. The only people known to have survived the final attack were the Talon children, who had been adopted by the Karankawa. According to the children, the settlement had been attacked around <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> of 1688, and all the remaining settlers had been killed.

Only 15 or 16 people survived the colony. Six returned to France, while nine others were captured by the Spanish, including the four children who had been spared by the <a href="Karankawa">Karankawa</a>. The children were initially brought to the viceroy of New Spain, the Conde de Galve, who treated them as servants. Two of the boys, Pierre and Jean-Baptiste, later returned to France. Of the remaining Spanish captives, three became Spanish citizens and settled in New Mexico. Although the French colony had been utterly destroyed, Spain feared that another French attempt was inevitable. For the first time, the Spanish crown authorized small outposts in eastern Texas and at <a href="Pensacola">Pensacola</a>. In 1722, the Spanish built a fort, <a href="Presidio%20La%20Bahia">Presidio La Bahia</a>, and <a href="Mission%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20del%20Esp%C3%ADritu%20Santo%20de%20Z%C3%BA%C3%B1iga">Mission Nuestra Señora del Espíritu Santo de Zúñiga</a> on the site of Fort Saint Louis.

France did not abandon its claims to Texas until November 3, 1762, when it ceded all of its territory west of the Mississippi River to Spain in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fontainebleau%20%281762%29">Treaty of Fontainebleau</a>, following its defeat by Great Britain in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>. It ceded New France to Britain. In 1803, three years after Spain had <a href="Third%20Treaty%20of%20San%20Ildefonso">returned Louisiana</a> to France, <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">sold the territory</a> to the United States. The original agreement between Spain and France had not explicitly specified the borders of Louisiana, and the descriptions in the documents were ambiguous and contradictory. The United States insisted that its purchase included all of the territory France had claimed, including all of Texas. The dispute was not resolved until the <a href="Adams-On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams-Onís Treaty</a> of 1819, in which Spain ceded <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to the United States in return for the United States' relinquishing its claim on Texas.

The official boundary of Texas was set at the <a href="Sabine%20River%20%28Texas-Louisiana%29">Sabine River</a> (the current boundary between Texas and Louisiana), and following the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20South">Red</a> and <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas</a> rivers to the 42nd parallel (<a href="California">California</a>'s current northern border).

In 1908, historian <a href="Herbert%20Eugene%20Bolton">Herbert Eugene Bolton</a> identified an area along Garcitas Creek, near Matagorda Bay, as the location of Fort St. Louis. Other historians, before and after Bolton, argued that the fort was located on <a href="Lavaca%20River">Lavaca River</a> in <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Texas">Jackson County</a>. Five decades later, the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a> funded a partial excavation of Bolton's site, a part of the Keeran ranch. Although several thousand items were recovered, archaeologists could not accurately distinguish between French and Spanish artifacts of the 17th century, and no report on the findings was ever issued. In the 1970s, the artifacts were reexamined by Kathleen Gilmore, an archaeologist at <a href="Southern%20Methodist%20University">Southern Methodist University</a>. She determined that while most of the artifacts were Spanish, some definitively matched artifacts recovered from French and French-Canadian excavations of the same time period.

In late 1996, Keeran ranch workers exploring with metal detectors located eight cast-iron cannons buried near Garcitas Creek. After excavating the cannons, the <a href="Texas%20Historical%20Commission">Texas Historical Commission</a> (THC) confirmed they were from Fort Saint Louis. In 2000 a THC excavation discovered the locations of three of the buildings that had housed the French colony and the three graves dug by the Spanish.

For decades, the THC had also been searching for the wreckage of "La Belle". In 1995, the shipwreck was discovered in Matagorda Bay. Researchers excavated a cast-bronze cannon from the waters, as well as musket balls, bronze straight pins, and trade beads. Large sections of the wooden hull were intact, protected from the damaging effects of warm salt water by layers of muddy sediment which "essentially creat[ed] an oxygen-free time capsule". "La Belle" was the oldest French shipwreck discovered in the Western Hemisphere to that date. To enable the archaeologists to recover as many of the artifacts as possible, a <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a> was constructed around the ship. The cofferdam held back the waters of the bay, allowing archaeologists to conduct the excavation as if it were on land. This was the first attempt in North America to excavate a shipwreck in dry conditions. Previous shipwreck excavations using cofferdams were completed in Europe, but never on a ship as large as the "Belle".

The <a href="National%20Underwater%20and%20Marine%20Agency">National Underwater and Marine Agency</a> searched for "L'Aimable" from 1997 until 1999. Although they found a promising location, the ship was buried under more than of sand and could not be reached.

Abby (TV series)

Abby is an American television <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> created by Nat Bernstein and Michael Katlin that aired for one season on <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) from January 6, 2003, to March 4, 2003. The show revolves around television producer Abigail "Abby" Walker (<a href="Sydney%20Tamiia%20Poitier">Sydney Tamiia Poitier</a>) and her relationship with her ex-boyfriend Will Jeffries (<a href="Kadeem%20Hardison">Kadeem Hardison</a>). After they break up in the <a href="Pilot%20Episode">pilot episode</a>, they agree to live together as friends in their <a href="Rent%20control%20in%20the%20United%20States">rent-controlled</a> <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> apartment.

Bernstein and Katlin had intended to feature Abby and Will as an interracial couple and had cast <a href="Sean%20O%27Bryan">Sean O'Bryan</a>, a white actor, as Will. After a negative response from <a href="test%20audience">test audience</a>s, they gave the role to Hardison and recast O'Bryan as a <a href="supporting%20character">supporting character</a>, along with <a href="Randy%20J.%20Goodwin">Randy J. Goodwin</a> and <a href="Tangie%20Ambrose">Tangie Ambrose</a>.

Critics classified "Abby" as a <a href="sex%20comedy">sex comedy</a> and <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a>. Despite UPN's heavy promotion, it attracted a weekly average of just 1.7 million viewers, making it the lowest-performing show tracked by <a href="Nielsen%20Holdings">Nielsen Holdings</a>. Critical responses were primarily negative; commentators praised Poitier's acting but criticized the show's reliance on sexual humor.

Set in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, the series follows its titular character Abigail "Abby" Walker (<a href="Sydney%20Tamiia%20Poitier">Sydney Tamiia Poitier</a>), one of the few women working for the fictional television sports program "West Coast Sports Report". Although Abby becomes the producer of "West Coast Sports Report", according to Bernadette Adams Davis of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>", the character does not display a particular interest in any sport. Poitier characterized Abby as a woman who "doesn't design herself to fit other people's perceptions and wants". Episodes include storylines where Abby imagines being someone else, and overshares details about her love life with her best friend, Max Ellis (<a href="Randy%20J.%20Goodwin">Randy J. Goodwin</a>), who is also the program's anchorman. 

In the pilot, Abby breaks up with her boyfriend, Will Jeffries (<a href="Kadeem%20Hardison">Kadeem Hardison</a>), but they argue over their <a href="Rent%20control%20in%20the%20United%20States">rent-controlled</a> apartment and decide to share it as <a href="Platonic%20love">platonic</a> roommates. A writer for <a href="Jet%20%28magazine%29">"Jet"</a> called their relationship "antagonistic and supportive". Will, a professional photographer, still harbors feelings for Abby and attempts to rekindle their romance. He is portrayed as selfish with no interest in her professional life. Incidents showing his negative behavior include his purchase of an expensive watch for himself for their second anniversary, and his marriage proposal to Abby saying "there is no more perfect gift" than himself. "Abby"'s concept and tone received comparisons to the <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a>s "<a href="Three%27s%20Company">Three's Company</a>" and "<a href="Will%20%26amp%3B%20Grace">Will & Grace</a>". <a href="Rob%20Owen%20%28journalist%29">Rob Owen</a> referred to the series as a <a href="sex%20comedy">sex comedy</a>, though other critics felt it was a <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic comedy</a>.

Abby's sister, Joanne "Jo" Walker (<a href="Tangie%20Ambrose">Tangie Ambrose</a>), and Max each support Abby. Jo encourages her to move on from her relationship with Will, while Max harbors an <a href="Unrequited%20love">unrequited crush</a> on Abby over the course of the series. Abby frequently clashes with her chauvinistic boss, Roger Tomkins (<a href="Sean%20O%27Bryan">Sean O'Bryan</a>), who is also close friends with Will. Roger frequently attends the <a href="Strip%20club">gentlemen's club</a> "The Booty Barn" with Will, and advises him to reconcile with Abby. The "<a href="Sun-Sentinel">Sun-Sentinel</a>"'s Tom Jicha described Roger as the series' "<a href="Tokenism">token white</a>" character. Abby's mother and father, played by <a href="Michelle%20Phillips">Michelle Phillips</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Robinson%20%28actor%29">Charlie Robinson</a>, appear as <a href="Recurring%20character">recurring characters</a>.

Developed under the working title "Abby Newton", "Abby" was <a href="executive%20producer">executively produced</a> by Nat Bernstein, Michael Katlin, and Jacque Edmonds. Bernstein and Katlin further contributed to the series as display artists and writers. The show was handled by <a href="CBS%20Productions">CBS Productions</a> and Katlin/Bernstein Productions. <a href="Leonard%20R.%20Garner%20Jr.">Leonard R. Garner Jr.</a> directed the pilot, which was filmed in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> along with the rest of the series. <a href="Rick%20Marotta">Rick Marotta</a> composed the soundtrack.

In 2002, <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) announced that Poitier and O'Bryan would play the lead characters. Abby was Poitier's first starring role in a television series, and her sitcom debut. Describing the show's main concept as "fertile ground for a lot of humor", Poitier was also drawn to its multicultural casting. Producers initially imagined Will as a white character; Katlin said: "We had wanted to have an interracial relationship, but not make the show about an interracial relationship." Producers gave the role to Hardison instead of O'Bryan due to a negative response from <a href="test%20audience">test audience</a>s. Criticizing the pilot episode for not explicitly addressing Will and Abby's interracial relationship, the previewers frequently asked: "Why aren't you dealing with it?"

Addressing the change in casting, Poitier clarified that the series would preserve a "spirit of multiculturalism" through Will and Abby's dating life. She referred to "Abby" as one of the few television shows to represent interracial couples. As part of a discussion on UPN's 2002–2003 television season, "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>"'s Greg Braxton cited "Abby" as an example of the network adding more white actors to its programming; Braxton pointed to the show's focus on a biracial woman and her dates with white men. <a href="CBS">CBS</a> television executive <a href="Leslie%20Moonves">Leslie Moonves</a> explained that UPN wanted to attract a wider audience.

Initially broadcast on Monday nights at 9:30 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> in January 2003, "Abby" was a <a href="mid-season%20replacement">mid-season replacement</a> after the <a href="Paranormal%20television">paranormal drama</a> <a href="Haunted%20%28TV%20series%29">"Haunted"</a> was canceled. Between January and March of that year, UPN moved the series to Tuesday nights at 9:00 pm EST, along with the <a href="Supernatural%20fiction">supernatural drama</a> "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>" and the sitcom <a href="Girlfriends%20%282000%20TV%20series%29">"Girlfriends"</a>. The first non-<a href="Genre%20fiction">genre show</a> placed in the time slot in two years, "Abby" aired against established programs "<a href="Frasier">Frasier</a>", <a href="24%20%28TV%20series%29">"24"</a>, <a href="The%20Guardian%20%28TV%20series%29">"The Guardian"</a>, and "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>" during a "competitive" time.

UPN promoted the series as part of "an aggressive rollout strategy", targeting a primarily African-American audience. The "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>"' Scott D. Pierce wrote that the network was "pinning its hopes on the new sitcom" along with the <a href="Television%20drama">drama</a> <a href="Platinum%20%28TV%20series%29">"Platinum"</a>. UPN branded its Tuesday programming as a "comedy night" and "Girls Night", though Poitier was uncertain of the audience's possible response to the mixture of sitcoms and dramas. She explained that the network wanted "Abby" to attract the same audience as its Monday comedies.

Commercially unsuccessful, "Abby" ranked last on the list of 146 shows tracked by the <a href="Nielsen%20Holdings">Nielsen Holdings</a>; it attracted an average of 1.7 million viewers per week. Canceled after a nine-episode season, the series had its final episode air on March 4, 2003. From July 2003 to August 2003, <a href="rerun">rerun</a>s aired on Tuesday nights at 8:30 pm EST. Overall, "Abby" was broadcast for a total of 270 minutes. According to John Kiesewetter of "<a href="The%20Cincinnati%20Enquirer">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a>", the show "contributed to UPN ratings losses" for the 2002–2003 television season.

"Abby" received negative critical feedback, primarily for its sexual humor. Calling the series "pleasant but not funny", "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"'s Robert Bianco criticized its humor as an example of UPN's reliance on sexual comedy. Michael Speier of <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a> panned the show for its "booty humor" and frequent scenes "about hot sex, about messy sex and about dirty sex". Deriding the premise for its "strained humor", Bernadette Adams Davis questioned the effectiveness of the focus on Abby's on-again, off-again relationship with Will. A contributor for <a href="People%20%28magazine%29">"People"</a> summed up "Abby" as "plain dumb".

While the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>"'s Allan Johnson criticized Poitier's performance, writing that she was "not appealing enough to lift what becomes a very uncomfortable premise", some commentators praised her acting. Highlighting Poitier's use of <a href="physical%20comedy">physical comedy</a>, Speier wrote that Poitier responded to the male characters with "proper nuance and appropriate tones". Davis praised the use of Abby's professional life for episodes, writing that ensemble shows ("Girlfriends", "<a href="The%20Parkers">The Parkers</a>", and "<a href="Living%20Single">Living Single</a>") frequently relegate a woman's career to the background. Davis hoped that the sitcom would focus more on Abby, particularly a "single, career-minded" version of the character. Despite being critical of the series' premise, Diane Werts of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" felt that "the execution makes it fly".

Boogeyman 2

Boogeyman 2 is a 2007 American <a href="supernatural%20horror%20film">supernatural horror film</a> edited and directed by <a href="Jeff%20Betancourt">Jeff Betancourt</a> and the <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to the 2005 film "<a href="Boogeyman%20%28film%29">Boogeyman</a>". The film was written by Brian Sieve and stars <a href="Danielle%20Savre">Danielle Savre</a>, <a href="Matt%20Cohen%20%28actor%29">Matt Cohen</a>, <a href="Tobin%20Bell">Tobin Bell</a> and <a href="Renee%20O%27Connor">Renee O'Connor</a>. Savre portrays Laura Porter, a woman who witnessed her parents' murder alongside her brother as a child. She believes the killer to be the <a href="Bogeyman">Boogeyman</a>, and now as an adult seeks group therapy to overcome her phobia of the creature. However, her fears become reality as her fellow patients are murdered one by one.

Due to the previous film's financial success, "Boogeyman 2" was announced in October 2006. Production of the film began in the same month with the hiring of Betancourt as director and Sieve attached as writer. Casting began in December of the same year with the hiring of O'Connor; Savre got the lead role in January 2007. Filming took place in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> at the former hospital, <a href="Linda%20Vista%20Community%20Hospital">Linda Vista Community Hospital</a>, over a four-month period, beginning in January 2007 and concluding in April. Unlike the original film, which featured the Boogeyman as a supernatural being, Betancourt strove to present a more grounded and realistic version of the mythical creature. Additionally, emphasis was placed on the writing and atmosphere to compensate for the film's small $4.5 million budget.

After screening at the <a href="Screamfest%20Horror%20Film%20Festival">Screamfest Horror Film Festival</a> on October 20, 2007, "Boogeyman 2" was released <a href="direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> in the United States on January 8, 2008; it was later released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered it to be a general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary <a href="Creature%20Features">creature features</a>, including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, "<a href="Boogeyman%203">Boogeyman 3</a>", the following year.

As young children Laura Porter and her brother Henry witness their parents' brutal murder by a hooded man, whom they believe to be the <a href="Bogeyman">Boogeyman</a>. As an adult, Henry has attended group therapy, improving such that he is instead currently looking for work. Laura joins this group as he leaves, meeting the other members: <a href="Nyctophobia">nyctophobic</a> Mark, <a href="Germaphobia">germaphobic</a> Paul, <a href="Self-harm">masochistic</a> Alison, <a href="Agoraphobia">agoraphobic</a> and commitment-averse Darren, and Nicky, a <a href="bulimic">bulimic</a> girl who fears extreme weight gain.

Upon her joining, however, the members of the group are targeted and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.

Dr. Ryan goes to the basement to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing in a puddle of water. Laura finds a file on her brother and those of other patients with bogyphobia (<a href="phobia">phobia</a> of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is <a href="Hallucination">hallucinating</a>. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.

Laura finds Nicky on a basement table with hoses attached to her, pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; along the way she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles into his eyes. The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet in an attempt to treat him of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is framed for the murders and arrested.

In a <a href="post-credits%20scene">post-credits scene</a>, the Boogeyman looks at a picture of Laura and Henry as adults before disappearing.

"Boogeyman 2" was first announced in October 2006 due to the financial success of its predecessor with <a href="Jeff%20Betancourt">Jeff Betancourt</a>, <a href="film%20editing">film editor</a> of "<a href="The%20Exorcism%20of%20Emily%20Rose">The Exorcism of Emily Rose</a>", "<a href="When%20a%20Stranger%20Calls%20%282006%20film%29">When a Stranger Calls</a>" and "<a href="The%20Grudge%202">The Grudge 2</a>," making his directorial debut and Brian Sieve attached as writer. The film was slated to start development in January 2007 in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. It was produced by <a href="Ghost%20House%20Pictures">Ghost House Pictures</a>, a film production company created by <a href="Sam%20Raimi">Sam Raimi</a> and <a href="Robert%20Tapert">Robert Tapert</a> which specializes in creating horror films. Betancourt stated that he wanted to avoid usage of CGI as well as present a new take on the Boogeyman rather than rehashing the storyline of the first film; this led to a more grounded version of the creature in the film. As a result, and due to the film's low budget, he focused especially on the atmosphere and writing. <a href="Storyboard">Storyboard</a>s were used extensively to plan out the film and minimize wasted effort and resources by make-up artists on unused prosthetics; the limited budget meant that most effects could only be filmed once. The former hospital <a href="Linda%20Vista%20Community%20Hospital">Linda Vista Community Hospital</a> served as the primary filming location for the <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">mental institution</a>.

The first actor to be cast was <a href="Renee%20O%27Connor">Renee O'Connor</a> as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her personal friend and "Boogeyman"s producer <a href="Rob%20Tapert">Rob Tapert</a> on the New Zealand set, where she had had a discussion with him about "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.

In mid-January, <a href="Danielle%20Savre">Danielle Savre</a> was cast as the film's lead Laura Porter. On Savre, Betancourt stated that "[she] has been incredible so far and has been a real trooper. We've [...] had her running up and down these halls screaming, throwing blood on her, throwing vomit on her, throwing guts on her and she's held up so far." <a href="Tobin%20Bell">Tobin Bell</a> was cast as Dr. Mitchell Allen in February and <a href="Matt%20Cohen%20%28actor%29">Matt Cohen</a> as Laura's brother Henry in March. Bell modeled his portrayal after <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>.

The <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s were handled by Quantum Creation FX, who were involved with the project throughout the entire duration of filming. Ten artisans and technicians were involved in creating severed heads, puppets, prosthetic makeup, and gore gags. The killer's mask was designed by Jerad S. Marantz, and the Boogeyman itself was based on Betancourt's own childhood fears, with "skeletal things and bird corpses" as inspiration for its skin texture.

"Boogeyman 2" was screened in a sold-out showing on October 20, 2007 at the <a href="Screamfest%20Horror%20Film%20Festival">Screamfest Horror Film Festival</a> in <a href="Grauman%27s%20Chinese%20Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a>. During the same month, it was announced that the film would be released on DVD in January 8, 2008. Outside the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the film was released theatrically in both <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, where it stayed in theaters for two weeks, and <a href="Italy">Italy</a>.

"Boogeyman 2" made at least $2,484,219 from its domestic video sales and a further $1,798,418 from its international releases, bringing the total gross to $4,282,637.

The DVD, which was released as "Unrated Director's Cut" and lacks an <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">MPAA</a> rating, includes two different commentaries. The first one features director Betancourt and writer Sieve while the second features actors Bell and Savre along with producers Hein and Bryman. Additionally, the DVD includes a documentary called "Bringing Fear to Life: Makeup Effects from Storyboards to Screen," which shows some of the film's development using storyboards. The film has also been digitally released on <a href="Google%20Play">Google Play</a>, <a href="Amazon%20Video">Amazon Video</a> and <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a>.

The film was criticized for having an unoriginal story and unlikable characters. Brandon Ciampaglia of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> described it as "yet another stupid horror film" and gave it a score of 4/10. Ryan Turek of <a href="CraveOnline">ComingSoon.net</a> criticized the story, characters, and lack of suspense, but found the film more entertaining than the original, with better acting than it deserved. He added that despite the movie's low budget, "[Betancourt] has hashed together a fine-looking film that’s technically competent." Tristan Sinns of <a href="Dread%20Central">Dread Central</a> awarded it two out of five stars, criticizing it for not featuring the mythological <a href="Boogeyman">Boogeyman</a> and having unsympathetic characters but praising the death scenes as "rather creative."

Positive reviews praised the film for presenting a more realistic approach to the Boogeyman and eschewing CGI, both of which were considered improvements over its predecessor. Its death scenes were highly praised for being extremely violent and gory. Many reviewers also recognized that the film exceeded their expectations despite its direct-to-video status and low budget. Shawn Lealos of "<a href="CHUD.com">CHUD.com</a>" gave the film a score of 6.8 out of ten, stating that it was "a very solid little horror flick that forgoes the ridiculous CGI and hokum supernatural aspects of the first movie, as well as the restraints of PG-13." In a similar review, Matthew Stern of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" praised the film in comparison to its predecessor, giving it eight stars out of ten, with a consensus reading: "A film that bucks the stigma of direct-to-DVD sequels, this unyieldingly dark and bloody feature will surprise you, especially if you were unfortunate enough to catch the first one." David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews also praised "Boogeyman 2" over the first film, particularly for its "satisfying kill sequences" and an entertaining supporting cast. While he criticized the middle half as "uneventful," he felt that the film "recovers nicely for a surprisingly enthralling third act" and gave it 2.5/4 stars.

A sequel, titled "Boogeyman 3," premiered at the <a href="Screamfest%20Horror%20Film%20Festival">Screamfest Horror Film Festival</a> on October 18, 2008 and was released <a href="direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> in January 20, 2009. Brian Sieve came back as writer, but the film features new cast members and characters, taking place on a college campus and starring <a href="Erin%20Cahill">Erin Cahill</a>. As with the first movie, the Boogeyman is portrayed as a supernatural entity.

Admiralty Islands campaign

The Admiralty Islands campaign (Operation Brewer) was a series of battles in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in which the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>'s <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Cavalry Division</a> occupied the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japanese</a>-held <a href="Admiralty%20Islands">Admiralty Islands</a>.

Acting on reports from airmen that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands might have been evacuated, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> accelerated his timetable for capturing the Admiralties and ordered an immediate <a href="reconnaissance%20in%20force">reconnaissance in force</a>. The campaign began on 29 February 1944 when a force landed on <a href="Los%20Negros%20Island">Los Negros</a>, the third-largest island in the group. By using a small, isolated beach where the Japanese had not anticipated an assault, the force achieved tactical surprise, but the islands proved to be far from unoccupied. A furious battle over the islands ensued.

In the end, <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> and <a href="command%20of%20the%20sea">command of the sea</a> allowed the Allies to heavily reinforce their position on Los Negros. The 1st Cavalry Division could then overrun the islands. The campaign officially ended on 18 May 1944. The Allied victory completed the isolation of the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> that was the ultimate objective of the Allied campaigns of 1942 and 1943. A major air and naval base was developed in the Admiralty Islands that became an important launching point for the campaigns of 1944 in the Pacific.

The Admiralty Islands lie north east of the mainland of New Guinea and west of Rabaul, only two degrees south of the <a href="equator">equator</a>. The climate is tropical, with constant high temperatures and high humidity and an annual rainfall of . Thunderstorms are common. December to May is the north west <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> season, with prevailing winds from that direction.

The largest island in the group is <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a>, which is about across from east to west and wide from north to south. The interior is mountainous, with peaks rising to and largely covered with thick <a href="tropical%20rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>. The then largely uncharted coastline had numerous reefs. The shoreline consisted mostly of <a href="mangrove%20swamp">mangrove swamp</a>. Los Negros is separated from Manus by the narrow Loniu Passage. The island contains two important harbours of its own, Papitalai on the west coast, which connects with <a href="Seeadler%20Harbour">Seeadler Harbour</a>, and Hyane on the east coast. The two are separated by a wide sandy spit. Here, the natives built a skidway over which they could drag canoes between the two harbours. Los Negros curves horseshoe-like, forming a natural breakwater for Seeadler Harbour, the remainder of which is enclosed by Manus and a series of smaller islands. The main entrance was through a wide passage between Hauwei and Ndrilo Islands. Seeadler Harbour is about across from east to west and wide from north to south, and up to deep.

In July 1942, the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> approved a series of operations against the Japanese bastion at Rabaul, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> towards the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> or northward towards the main Japanese naval base at <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a>. In keeping with the overall Allied <a href="grand%20strategy">grand strategy</a> of <a href="Europe%20first">Europe first</a>, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of the threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia. By agreement among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific theatre</a> was divided into the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, under General Douglas MacArthur, and the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">Pacific Ocean Areas</a>, under <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a>. Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area but the initial operations in the southern <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces—primarily Australian—fought off a series of Japanese offensives in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> in the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20Campaign">Kokoda Track Campaign</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Battle of Milne Bay</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna-Gona">Battle of Buna-Gona</a>, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">Battle of Wau</a>.

At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the latest version of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.

Throughout January 1944, <a href="AirSols">AirSols</a> aircraft based in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20%28archipelago%29">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) aircraft based on <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina</a> kept up a sustained air offensive against Rabaul. Under steady and relentless pressure, the Japanese air defence began to weaken, allowing a landing to be made on 15 February by New Zealand troops on the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Green%20Islands">Green Islands</a>, which lie little more than from Rabaul. On 16 and 17 February, the <a href="US%20Pacific%20Fleet">US Pacific Fleet</a>'s <a href="Task%20Force%2058">Task Force 58</a> <a href="Operation%20Hailstone">attacked the main Japanese base at Truk</a>. Most Japanese aircraft were recalled to defend Truk and 19 February saw the last significant interception of Allied aircraft over Rabaul. Meanwhile, on 13 February, General MacArthur had issued orders for the invasion of the Admiralty Islands, codenamed Operation Brewer, which was now scheduled for 1 April. Forces assigned included the 1st Cavalry Division; <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B73%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 73 Wing RAAF</a>, providing <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a>; the 592nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR); the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">US Marines</a>' 1st Amphibious Tractor Battalion; and US <a href="Seabee%20%28US%20Navy%29">Naval Construction Battalions</a> ("Seabees") to build the naval base—a total of 45,000 personnel. However, on 23 February 1944 three <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a> <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> bombers flew low over Los Negros. The airmen reported that there were no signs of enemy activity and the islands had been evacuated. <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the South West Pacific Area, went to MacArthur and proposed that the unoccupied islands be quickly taken by a small force. According to Kenney: "The General listened for a while, paced back and forth as I kept talking, nodded occasionally, then suddenly stopped and said: That will put the cork in the bottle."

Orders went out on 24 February 1944 for a reinforced squadron of the 1st Cavalry Division to carry out a reconnaissance in force in just five days time. If the Admiralty Islands were indeed evacuated, they would be occupied and a base developed. If the enemy was unexpectedly strong, then the force could be withdrawn. General MacArthur and <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Kinkaid">Thomas C. Kinkaid</a>, the commander of Allied Naval Forces in the South West Pacific Area, would be on hand to make the decision but otherwise they delegated command to <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="William%20Fechteler">William Fechteler</a>, the commander of Amphibious Group 8 of Rear Admiral <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Barbey">Daniel E. Barbey</a>'s <a href="VII%20Amphibious%20Force">VII Amphibious Force</a>. To accommodate them, the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> was ordered to sea. At the time, she was in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, with over 300 of her crew on shore leave. Trucks with <a href="bull%20horn">bull horn</a>s broadcast the code word recalling the crew. To achieve surprise, and to reach the Admiralty Islands in just five days, <a href="high%20speed%20transport">high speed transport</a>s (APDs) were required; <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">Landing Ships, Tank</a> (LSTs) were too slow to make the required distance in the time. Only three APDs were available: , and . Each could accommodate 170 men. The remaining troops were carried on nine <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s: , , , , , , , and . Between them, the destroyers and APDs carried 1,026 troops.

This force was commanded by <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> William C. Chase, commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. It included the three rifle troops and the heavy weapons troop of the 2nd Squadron, <a href="5th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Cavalry</a>; a platoon from Battery B, 99th Field Artillery Battalion with two <a href="M116%20howitzer">75 mm pack howitzer</a>s; the 673rd Anti-Aircraft Machine Gun Battery (Airborne); and 29 Australians of the <a href="Australian%20New%20Guinea%20Administrative%20Unit">Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit</a> (ANGAU), who were to assist in gathering intelligence and dealing with the native population, some 13,000 of whom lived in the islands. Once the decision to remain was known, a follow-up force with the rest of the 5th Cavalry and 99th Field Artillery Battalion, 40th Naval Construction Battalion, and 2,500 measurement <a href="ton">ton</a>s of stores would depart from Finschhafen in six <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">Landing Ships, Tank</a> (LSTs), each towing an <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Mechanized">LCM</a> of Company E, 592nd EBSR. When an aide expressed concern over assigning such a hazardous mission to a unit without combat experience, General MacArthur recalled how the 5th Cavalry had fought alongside his <a href="Arthur%20MacArthur%2C%20Jr.">father</a>'s troops in the campaign against <a href="Geronimo">Geronimo</a>. "They'd fight then," he said, "and they'll fight now."

<a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Charles%20A.%20Willoughby">Charles A. Willoughby</a>'s G-2 (<a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence</a>) section did not agree with the airmen's assessment the islands were unoccupied. Drawing on <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> and <a href="Allied%20Intelligence%20Bureau">Allied Intelligence Bureau</a> reports from interrogating local civilians, it reported on 15 February that there were 3,000 Japanese troops in the Admiralty Islands. On 24 February, it revised the estimate to 4,000. G-2 attributed the lack of anti-aircraft fire to the Japanese logistical situation, believing it was a measure to conserve ammunition. Lieutenant General <a href="Walter%20Krueger">Walter Krueger</a>, the commander of <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army">US Sixth Army</a> later recalled no one at his headquarters believed the islands unoccupied. In the original plan, a team of <a href="Alamo%20Scouts">Alamo Scouts</a> was to have thoroughly reconnoitred the island before the landing. Krueger had a six-man party of Alamo Scouts inserted on the southern coast of Los Negros by <a href="PBY%20Catalina">PBY</a> under cover of a bombing raid on 27 February. The scouts reported the south coast was "lousy with Japs".

The Japanese defence of the Admiralties fell under the <a href="Japanese%20Eighth%20Area%20Army">Eighth Area Army</a>, based at Rabaul and commanded by General <a href="Hitoshi%20Imamura">Hitoshi Imamura</a>. In September 1943, as a result of the failure to stop Allied advances in New Guinea and the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20Campaign">Solomons</a>, the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> (IGHQ) had decided to constrict Japan's defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific to a new line stretching from the <a href="Banda%20Sea">Banda Sea</a> to the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a>. The IGHQ charged Imamura with holding his portion of the new line, which included the Admiralties, as long as possible to allow the Japanese navy and army time to prepare "decisive" counterattacks against Allied forces. Maintaining control of the Admiralties was crucial to the Japanese defensive plans, as possession of the islands by the Allies would place the key Japanese stronghold at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> within range of heavy bombers. Apparently not expecting the Allies to move on the Admiralties so quickly, IGHQ gave Imamura until the middle of 1944 to complete the defensive preparations for his command. At this time the largest Japanese unit in the islands was the 51st Transport Regiment, which had arrived on Los Negros in April.

Imamura sought reinforcements for the Admiralties in late 1943 and early 1944. In October 1943 he requested an infantry division for the islands, but none was available. A subsequent proposal to transfer the 66th Regiment from the Palaus, where it was being rebuilt after suffering heavy losses, to the Admiralties was also unsuccessful as IGHQ believed that the <a href="Eighteenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Eighteenth Army</a> had greater need for this unit. The <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) also rejected Imamura's suggestion that a <a href="Japanese%20Special%20Naval%20Landing%20Forces">special naval landing force</a> unit be dispatched to the islands. IGHQ agreed to deploy the 66th Regiment to the Admiralties in January 1944 to bolster the region's defences following the Allied landings at <a href="Battle%20of%20Arawe">Arawe</a> and <a href="Landing%20at%20Saidor">Saidor</a> in mid-December and early January respectively, but this movement was cancelled after a ship carrying reinforcements for the regiment was sunk by with heavy loss of life on the 16th of the month. Following this disaster Imamura directed the <a href="38th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">38th Division</a> to dispatch a battalion to the islands, and 750 men of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment arrived there on the night of 24/25 January. A subsequent attempt to ship an infantry and an artillery battalion to the Admiralties was frustrated by Allied air and submarine attacks, but 530 soldiers of the 38th Division's 1st Battalion, <a href="229th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">229th Infantry Regiment</a> arrived there on the night of 2 February. Most of these troop movements were detected by Allied intelligence.

At the time of the Allied landing, <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> forces in the Admiralties consisted of the 51st Transport Regiment under Colonel Yoshio Ezaki, who was also the overall garrison commander; 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment; 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment; and elements of the IJN's 14th Naval Base Force. Allied G-2 had identified the presence of all these units in the Admiralties, though their designation was not known in all instances. While the 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment was a veteran of several campaigns, it was short of equipment and lacked its battalion artillery guns. The 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment was led by reserve officers who had seen action in China, but most of its enlisted men were recalled reservists who had not previously been in battle.

The 51st Transport Regiment had constructed an airstrip on Lorengau and commenced another, known as <a href="Momote%20Airport">Momote Airstrip</a>, at the Momote Plantation on Los Negros. Lorengau was used as a staging point for aircraft moving between Rabaul and airstrips in North East New Guinea. The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a> which blocked off other air routes. By February, both airstrips were unserviceable and the antiaircraft guns were silent to conserve ammunition and conceal their positions. Ezaki had ordered his men to neither move nor fire in daylight.

The chosen landing site was a small beach on the south shore of Hyane Harbour near the Momote airstrip. The airstrip could be seized quickly; but the surrounding area was <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> swamp, and the harbour entrance was only about wide. "Since the whole operation was a gamble anyway," <a href="Samuel%20Eliot%20Morison">Samuel Eliot Morison</a> noted, "one might as well be consistent." The gamble paid off. The Japanese had not anticipated a landing at this point and the bulk of their forces were concentrated to defend the beaches of <a href="Seeadler%20Harbour">Seeadler Harbour</a>, on the other side of the island. The weather on 29 February 1944 was overcast with a low cloud ceiling that prevented most of the planned air strike. Only three <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24</a>s and nine B-25s found the target. The naval bombardment was therefore extended for another 15 minutes. Each APD lowered four <a href="Landing%20craft">LCPR</a>s (Landing Craft, Personnel, Ramped). Each LCPR carried its maximum load of 37 men, who boarded by climbing over the APDs' sides and down cargo nets. The unarmoured LCPRs were still used because <a href="davit">davit</a>s had not been strengthened to carry the heavier, armoured <a href="LCVP%20%28United%20States%29">LCVP</a> (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel).
The first wave landed without casualties at 08:17, but once the bombardment lifted the Japanese emerged from their dugouts and machine guns and shore batteries began firing. The landing craft, on returning, came under <a href="crossfire">crossfire</a> from enemy machine guns on both sides of the harbour. The fire became so heavy the second wave was forced to reverse course until the enemy fire was suppressed by destroyers. The third and fourth waves also came under fire. A correspondent from "<a href="Yank%2C%20the%20Army%20Weekly">Yank, the Army Weekly</a>" described the scene:
Four of the twelve LCPRs had been damaged. Three were soon repaired, but they could not be risked further, for without them, the reconnaissance force could not be evacuated. The emergency plan provided for an APD to enter the harbour and take troops off from a jetty but this would clearly be a desperate measure indeed. Over the next four hours, the boats continued to make trips to the beach, but only when it was believed destroyers had suppressed enemy fire. Heavy rain made it safer by reducing visibility. The last destroyer was unloaded at 12:50. By this time, the navy had lost two men dead and three wounded.

For the moment it was safer ashore. The cavalrymen overran the airstrip. Sporadic opposition allowed them to set up the antiaircraft machine guns on the beach, unload supplies, and patrol inland. Two soldiers were killed and three wounded. At 16:00, General MacArthur and Admiral Kinkaid came ashore. The general inspected the position. A lieutenant warned him a Japanese sniper had been killed in the vicinity just a few minutes before. "That's the best thing to do with them," the General replied. He decided to stay, ordering Chase to hold his position until the follow-up force arrived, then returned to "Phoenix". Fechteler's force departed at 17:29, the transports having unloaded and most of the bombardment force having exhausted its ammunition. "Bush" and "Stockton" remained to provide on-call naval fire support.

Chase pulled his troops back into a tight perimeter. There was no barbed wire, so the whole area had to be covered. The ground was hard <a href="coral">coral</a>, which was good for airbase construction but made it difficult to dig foxholes. The twelve .50 calibre (12.7mm) machine guns were positioned in the front line. There was fighting throughout the night as small groups of Japanese attempted to infiltrate the position. An airdrop of ammunition was requested. A break in the weather allowed three B-25s of the 38th US Bomb Group to drop supplies at 08:30. Four B-17s of the <a href="375th%20Airlift%20Wing">375th Troop Carrier Group</a> each dropped three tons of supplies, including blood plasma, ammunition, hand grenades, and barbed wire. Some of the ammunition fell beyond the perimeter but for some reason men who moved out to retrieve it were not fired upon.

The Japanese were not expected to make another effort until dark but at around 16:00 a Japanese patrol was discovered that had somehow managed to infiltrate the perimeter in broad daylight and penetrate to within of General Chase's command post. A sniper fired on the command post, and fire was directed at the patrol. Major <a href="Julio%20Chiaramonte">Julio Chiaramonte</a>, <a href="Staff%20officer">S-2</a> (intelligence officer) of the task force, set out with four men to silence the sniper. As his party closed in, there were a series of explosions. Three Japanese had committed suicide with hand grenades, while another had committed "<a href="seppuku">seppuku</a>" with his sword. Fifteen dead officers and sergeants were counted, including Captain Baba, the commander of the Japanese battalion which made the attack the preceding night. The Japanese launched another attack on the perimeter at 17:00 but could make little progress in the face of American firepower.
The next morning saw the arrival of the follow-up force, six LSTs, each towing an LCM, escorted by the destroyers and and and <a href="destroyer%20minesweeper">destroyer minesweeper</a>s and . The LSTs entered Hyane Harbour and beached, coming under mortar fire as they did so. , manned by a <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> crew, replied with <a href="3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun">3 in</a> (76mm) and <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors 40 mm gun</a>s. The LSTs were unloaded over the next seven hours. In the process, ammunition, construction equipment, and stores piled up. To accommodate a proper dispersal of stores, General Chase ordered an attack to expand the perimeter. An air strike was requested. B-25s of the 345th US Bomb Group were intercepted by an estimated fifteen Japanese fighters. These were driven off by eight escorting <a href="P-47%20Thunderbolt">P-47 Thunderbolt</a> fighters, which claimed eight Japanese aircraft shot down. Two <a href="B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17s</a> of the 69th US Troop Carrier Squadron on a supply dropping run were also attacked, and claimed to have shot one of their attackers down. Two of the four B-25 squadrons dropped bombs in areas occupied by American troops, two of whom were killed and four wounded before the 12th US Air Liaison Party could correct the error. Both squadrons of the 5th Cavalry attacked at 15:00. All objectives were taken and a new, larger defensive perimeter was prepared. The 40th Naval Construction Battalion had landed expecting to work on Momote airstrip. Instead, they were ordered to use their equipment to clear fields of fire and construct fortifications, and were given a section of the perimeter to defend. Six trenches were dug out by a bulldozer and ten men stationed in each. Their <a href="Excavator">ditch digger</a> scooped out a trench which formed a secondary line of defence. The airstrip's revetments were transformed into heavy machine gun posts.

The two destroyer minesweepers were supposed to sweep the entrance to <a href="Seeadler%20Harbour">Seeadler Harbour</a> between Hauwei and Ndrilo Islands but fire from at least one Japanese gun on Hauwei Island prevented them from entering the harbour. Captain <a href="Emile%20Dechaineux">Emile Dechaineux</a>, commanding the destroyers supporting the forces ashore, brought "Ammen", "Bush", "Mullany" and "Warramunga" around and bombarded the island. The Japanese guns ceased fire but came alive again when another attempt was made to sweep the channel. Dechaineux then called off the effort, ordering the DMSs to join him. The destroyers bombarded Japanese guns covering the entrance to Hyane Harbour to allow the LSTs to leave unmolested. One LST left with between 20 and 30 truckloads of stores still aboard. The LSTs did not wish to remain after dark as a Japanese attack was expected. Dechaineux escorted them part of the way until he received an order from Admiral Barbey for "Ammen", "Mullany", "Warramunga", and "Welles" to remain off Los Negros. "Ammen" and "Mullany" bombarded Hauwei Island again in the morning, setting off a couple of ammunition dumps, but still came under accurate fire from four or five guns, and Dechaineux was forced to inform Barbey that he was unable to overcome the island's guns.

General Krueger was gravely concerned about the seriousness of the situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement of the rest of the 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2nd Squadron, <a href="7th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">7th Cavalry</a> would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9 March instead of 9 and 16 March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. To use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.

From the Japanese perspective, the battle was not going too well either. The Japanese had expected a landing on Seeadler Harbour, this being the logical American objective, and had concentrated their forces around the Lorengau airfield. The defence of the Momote airstrip and Hyane harbour was the responsibility of Baba Force, built around Captain Baba's 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment. Colonel Ezaki ordered Baba to attack the beachhead but a suspicion the Hyane Harbour landing was a diversion, coupled with false reports of enemy activity at Salami had him retain the 2nd (Iwakami) Battalion of the 1st Independent Infantry Regiment there instead of sending it to assist Baba Force. By 2 March, Ezaki had resolved to attack the Hyane beachhead with his whole force. The difficulties imposed by the terrain, and disruption by American artillery and Allied naval gunfire, forced a postponement of the attack to the night of 3 March.

At 21:00, a lone Japanese plane dropped eight bombs, cutting telephone wires. Once it had departed, yellow flares went up and a Japanese infantry attack was launched, supported by mortar fire. Offshore, Dechaineux' destroyers came under attack from four <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">"Betty"</a> bombers. 1st Squadron, 5th Cavalry, was attacked by about two reinforced platoons, which were met by heavy automatic weapons and mortar fire. The heavy jungle in this sector permitted some infiltration but the Japanese force was not strong enough to overrun the position. The main Japanese attack was delivered by 2nd Battalion, 1st Independent Mixed Regiment, from the direction of the native skidway, together with detachments from the Porlaka area, and fell on 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry. The troopers noticed a change in Japanese tactics. Instead of infiltrating silently, they advanced across the open, talking and in some cases singing. Their advance took them straight into anti-personnel mines and booby traps, which duly exploded, and then into the fields of fire of the Americans' automatic weapons, including several .30 <a href="M1917%20Browning%20machine%20gun">water-cooled Browning</a> machineguns, but the advance continued. The guns of the 211th Coast Artillery (AA) Battalion and 99th Field Artillery Battalion fired through the night, attempting to break up the Japanese attack from Porlaka. Shortly after midnight, Japanese barges attempted to cross Hyane harbour but were engaged by anti-aircraft guns and did not reach the American positions. A Bofors 40 mm gun position was captured by the Japanese, who in turn were driven off by the Seabees. Manning the .30s, the 5th Cavalry's gunners piled up the Japanese dead until the guns had to be moved to get clear fields of fire. One of the Browning guns that held the position was later left in its place, as a monument. Sergeant <a href="Troy%20McGill">Troy McGill</a> occupied a revetment with his squad of eight men. All were killed or wounded except McGill and another man, whom he ordered to fall back to the next revetment. McGill fired his rifle until it jammed, then clubbed the Japanese with it until he was killed. He was posthumously awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a>.

By dawn, the Japanese attack had subsided. Over 750 Japanese dead were counted in and around the American positions. No prisoners were taken. American casualties were 61 dead, and 244 wounded, including nine dead and 38 wounded Seabees. The 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry and the 40th Naval Construction Battalion received <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28United%20States%29">Presidential Unit Citations</a>. General Chase called for an airdrop of ammunition, prodigious quantities of which had been expended during the night, and had "Warramunga" fire on the native skidway.

The morning of 4 March saw the arrival of the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, which relieved the 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry. The next day Major General <a href="Innis%20P.%20Swift">Innis P. Swift</a>, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, arrived aboard "Bush" and assumed command. He ordered the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry to attack across the native skidway. The 2nd Squadron, 5th Cavalry therefore went back into the line to relieve them. While the relief was taking place, the Japanese launched a daylight attack. This was repulsed by the cavalrymen, with the help of artillery and mortar fire, but the American attack was delayed until late afternoon. It then ran into a Japanese minefield and by dawn the advance had only reached as far as the skidway.

On the morning of 6 March, another convoy arrived at Hyane Harbour: five LSTs, each towing an LCM, with the <a href="12th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">12th Cavalry</a> and other units and equipment including five <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">Landing Vehicles Tracked</a> (LVTs) of the 592nd EBSR, three <a href="M3%20Stuart">M3 light tank</a>s of the 603rd Tank Company, and twelve <a href="M101%20howitzer">105mm howitzers</a> of the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The 12th Cavalry was ordered to follow the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry in its advance to the north, and to capture the Salami Plantation. The road to Salami was little more than a muddy track in which vehicles soon became bogged. The Japanese also obstructed the route with ditches, felled trees, snipers, and booby traps. <a href="Warrant%20Officer">WO2</a> R. J. Booker of ANGAU used his local knowledge to guide the 12th Cavalry and the three tanks to Salami. Here the Japanese put up a fierce fight that lasted over an hour. The tanks fired <a href="canister%20shot">canister shot</a> shells into buildings and high-explosive shells into the slits of Japanese bunkers.

The inhabitants of the area informed the ANGAU detachment the Japanese had retreated across Seeadler Harbour to Papitalai Mission. This, therefore, became the next objective. The 5th Cavalry would attack Papitalai Plantation from the east while the 2nd Squadron, 12th Cavalry would attack Papitalai Mission. The 5th Cavalry captured Porlaka without opposition and crossed Lemondrol Creek in canvas and rubber boats. A patrol under Captain William C. Cornelius fought an estimated 50 Japanese, who ultimately withdrew. Captain Cornelius, who was credited with killing four, was severely wounded and died the next day. He was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

Because of the coral reef, conventional landing craft could not be used for the landing at Papitalai Mission. The five LVTs, one a combat type and the other four cargo-carrying, set out from Hyane Harbour to Salami Plantation but the road was so bad that only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time. The attack went ahead anyway, preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The combat LVT fired 24 <a href="M8%20%28rocket%29">M8 4.5-inch rocket</a>s. Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns, and a 75mm howitzer. The first wave had to hold alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45 minutes until the LVTs returned with the next wave. Later, they fought off a counterattack by about 30 Japanese. Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to Salami, the LVTs made 16 trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations, transporting part of the 2nd Squadron, 12th Cavalry, along with rations, water and ammunition, and evacuating the dead and wounded.

Colonel Ezaki reported the American attack on Papitalai Mission to the Eighth Area Army in Rabaul, promising a night counterattack on the position; but no attack was delivered. The Japanese withdrew, and no further messages were ever received from Colonel Ezaki.

The task of silencing the Japanese guns guarding Seeadler Harbour fell to Rear Admiral <a href="Victor%20Crutchley">Victor Crutchley</a>'s Task Force 74 (TF74), consisting of the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , light cruisers and , and destroyers , , , and . They bombarded Hauwei Island for an hour on 4 March but on 6 March was struck by a Japanese shell fired from Hauwei. With minesweepers scheduled to attempt to enter Seeadler Harbour again on 8 March, Admiral Kinkaid ordered Crutchley to try again. On the afternoon of 7 March, TF74 bombarded Hauwei, Ndrilo, Koruniat, Pityilu and northern Los Negros. "Shropshire" fired 64  and 92  shells, while the American cruisers and destroyers expended 1,144  and shells. The next day, two destroyers, two minesweepers, an LCM (flak) and six LCMs carrying trucks and supplies entered the Seeadler Harbour without being fired upon. This cleared the way for the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division to land at Salmi on 9 March.
By 7 March, the Seabees had the Momote airfield ready. Artillery spotting aircraft began operating from the strip on 6 March and a B-25 made an emergency landing the next day. Guided by a B-25, twelve <a href="Curtiss%20P-40">P-40 Kittyhawk</a>s of <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron RAAF</a> arrived from Kiriwina via Finschhafen on 9 March, the remaining twelve aircraft of the squadron following the next day. They were joined by the ground crew of <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron RAAF</a>, which had arrived by LST on 6 March. The rest of No. 73 Wing RAAF arrived over the next two weeks, including the Kittyhawks of No. 77 Squadron RAAF and <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s of <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 79 Squadron RAAF</a>. Operations began on 10 March and henceforth ships and ground units in the Admiralties had air support just minutes away.

The ANGAU Detachment reached the town of Mokerang on 9 March and found fifty inhabitants. The Detachment was relieved to find islanders had not been deliberately ill-treated by the Japanese. The retreating Japanese had stripped their gardens of food, leaving the civilian population hungry, so ANGAU arranged for them to be provisioned by the Americans.

Operations on Los Negros had now reached the mopping-up stage, but an estimated 2,700 Japanese troops remained on Manus. General Swift decided to land Brigadier General Verne D. Mudge's 2nd Brigade at Lugos Mission, west of Lorengau. Lorengau, known to be heavily fortified, was an important objective. It had an airfield, and four roads converged there. As a preliminary, the 302nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop was ordered to locate sites from which the artillery could cover landings on Manus. Three patrols were sent out by LCVP on 11 March. The first found Bear Point on Manus free of Japanese but lacking sites for artillery emplacements. The second scouted the Butjo Luo Islands. They found the islands apparently unoccupied, with good sites on the northern island. The third patrol, 25 officers and men of the 302nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, two officers from the 99th Field Artillery Battalion, with WO2 A. L. Robinson of ANGAU and Kaihu, a native of Mokerang, as guides, set out for Hauwei in an LCVP, escorted by PT 329, one of the <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s now operating from the <a href="Motor%20torpedo%20boat%20tender">tender</a> in Seeadler Harbour.

As the patrol moved ashore, Major Carter S. Vaden spotted a well camouflaged <a href="bunker">bunker</a> and threw two <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>s into it. When they exploded, concealed Japanese mortars and machine guns commenced firing on the patrol and the craft offshore. The PT was hit, her commander wounded, and she withdrew. The LCVP headed toward the shore where it picked up five men, including Robinson and Kaihu. The LCVP retracted and headed out to sea but then sighted another group on the beach. She headed back in to pick them up, despite her commander being wounded, and succeeded. As she backed off the beach again, she was holed by a mortar round and began taking on water. Meanwhile, the damaged PT had reported what had happened and a bomber was sent to investigate. Flying low, it spotted the men in the water, and another PT boat was sent to the rescue, covered by the destroyer . After three hours in the water, the LCVP's survivors were picked up by the PT boat. Eight Americans, including Major Vaden, had been killed and fifteen wounded, including the entire LCVP crew. Kaihu was missing and Robinson was contemplating how he would break the news to his family when Kaihu walked in, having swum back to Los Negros.

General Swift postponed the landing on Lugos and ordered the 2nd Squadron, 7th Cavalry to capture Hauwei. Once again, Robinson acted as guide, notwithstanding severe sunburn from his time in the water the previous day. The landing was covered by the destroyers "Arunta", "Bush", "Stockton" and ; a pair of rocket-firing LCVPs and the LCM (flak), which fired 168  rockets; the guns of the 61st Field Artillery Battalion on Los Negros; and six Kittyhawks of No. 76 Squadron dropped bombs. The assault was made from three cargo-carrying LVTs. To save wear and tear, they were towed across Seeadler Harbour by LCMs and cut loose for the final run in to shore. The cavalrymen found well constructed and sited bunkers with interlocking fields of fire covering all approaches, and deadly accurate snipers. The next morning an LCM brought over a medium tank, for which the Japanese had no answer, and the cavalrymen were able to overcome the defenders at a cost of eight killed and 46 wounded; 43 dead Japanese naval personnel were counted. The 61st and 271st Field Artillery Battalions moved to Hauwei, while the 99th established itself on Butjo Luto.

The attack on Manus got underway on 15 March. Before dawn, two troops of the <a href="8th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">8th Cavalry</a>, six cargo carrying LVTs and the combat LVT were loaded on board an LST for the trip across Seeadler Harbour from Salami. Beaches at Lugos, about west of Lorengau were chosen in preference to those nearer Lorengau, which were known to be heavily defended. The destroyers , , , and bombarded the area with their <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">5-inch guns</a>; the two rocket LCVPs, the LCM (<a href="flak">flak</a>), and the combat LVT raked the shoreline with rockets; the artillery on Hauwei and Butjo Luo engaged targets; and 18 B-25s of the 499th and 500th Bombardment Squadrons dropped 81  bombs and strafed the area.

The Japanese had evidently not expected a landing at Lugos and their positions there were quickly overrun. The 1st Squadron, 8th Cavalry then advanced eastward until it was stopped by a Japanese bunker complex on the edge of the Lorengau airstrip. An artillery barrage was brought down, followed by an airstrike by <a href="P-40%20Kittyhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a>s with 500 pound bombs. The cavalry resumed its advance, and occupied a ridge overlooking the airstrip without opposition. In the meantime, the 7th Cavalry had been landed at Lugos from the LST on its second trip and took over the defence of the area, freeing the 2nd Squadron, 8th Cavalry to join the attack on Lorengau. The first attempt to capture the airstrip was checked by an enemy bunker complex. A second attempt on 17 March, reinforced by the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry and tanks, made good progress. The advance then resumed, with Lorengau itself falling on 18 March.

Although there had been plenty of fighting, the main Japanese force on Manus had not been located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7th Cavalry found it on 20 March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8th Cavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there. The Japanese bunkers, actually log and earth pillboxes, proved resistant to artillery fire.

As the Japanese on Los Negros ran out of food and ammunition, the fight became increasingly unequal. A last stand by fifty Japanese in the Papitalai Hills on 24 March marked the end of organised Japanese resistance on Los Negros. The end of organised resistance on Los Negros and Manus still left a number of islands in Japanese hands. To minimise civilian casualties, ANGAU quietly evacuated these islands in advance of the American operations. Pityilu was believed occupied by about 60 Japanese. On 30 March the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry was transported there from Lorengau by 10 LCMs towing seven LVTs. With the lessons of Hauwei in mind, the landing was covered by bombardment by destroyers, artillery, and two <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Support">Landing Craft Support</a>, plus an air strike by Kittyhawks and Spitfires. The landing was unopposed, but a strong Japanese position was encountered which was overcome with the aid of artillery and tanks. Some 59 Japanese were killed compared with eight Americans killed and six wounded.

The same treatment was given to Ndrilo and Koruniat on 1 April but the 1st Squadron, 12th Cavalry found them unoccupied. This was notable for being the only amphibious operation of the war carried out by the United States in dugout canoes. The final landing was on Rambutyo on 3 April by the 2nd Squadron, 12th Cavalry. This time, six LCMs and six LCVPs were used instead of the LVTs. As a result, the first waves grounded on a reef and troopers had to wade ashore through the surf. Fortunately for them, there was no opposition. The Japanese, hiding in the interior, were eventually located by ANGAU and 30 Japanese were killed and five captured. Patrols continued hunting for Japanese throughout the islands. Increasingly, the cavalry followed up sightings reported by the natives. On Los Negros, the 302nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop killed 48 and captured 15 Japanese during May. On Manus, some 586 Japanese dead were counted and 47 prisoners taken. General Krueger officially declared the campaign over on 18 May.

A diary found on a dead Japanese soldier recounted his last days:

Discussions concerning the scope and nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey, Jr.</a>'s neighbouring <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">South Pacific Area (SOPAC)</a>. The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC would be responsible for the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they would not be able to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of naval base development.

Admiral Nimitz recommended to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development and control of the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed without the consent of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">United States Seventh Fleet</a> and <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a>. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3 March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility for the development of the base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18 May 1944. It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC but it never did.

Momote airfield was found to have been constructed on a coral subbase with an overburden of coconut palm <a href="humus">humus</a>, over which the Japanese had laid a thin layer of coral and coral sand. This would not withstand heavy use, so 40th Naval Construction Battalion, 8th Engineer Squadron, and Shore Battalion of the 592nd EBSR had to strip away the humus and lay a new coral surface. Just of runway was sufficient for the Kittyhawks and Spitfires but the runway was increased to by late April. B-24s of <a href="5th%20Bomb%20Wing">5th Bombardment Group</a> moved in on 18 April 1944 and flew their first mission, against <a href="Woleai">Woleai</a> two days later.

Plans called for a second airfield at Salami Plantation, but surveys revealed that the site was unsuitable and a new site was found in a coconut plantation near <a href="Mokerang%20Airfield">Mokerang</a>. While the 46th Naval Construction Battalion cleared an access road, the 836th Engineer Aviation Battalion constructed the runway, and the 104th and 46th Naval Construction Battalions built the taxiways and dispersal areas. As at Momote, the humus had to be removed to reach the coral subgrade, which was then graded and compacted. In places the coral was so hard explosives had to be used. The work required the clearing of and the removal of 18,000 coconut trees. B-24s of <a href="307th%20Bombardment%20Wing">307th Bombardment Group</a> (the "Long Rangers") arrived on 21 April 1944. They participated in raids on <a href="Biak">Biak</a> and supported the <a href="Battle%20of%20Biak">Battle of Biak</a> in May.

A fighter base to provide repair and overhaul facilities for <a href="aircraft%20carrier">carrier</a> aircraft was constructed by the 78th Naval Construction Battalion on <a href="Ponam%20Island">Ponam Island</a>. As half of the work area was swamp, coral was blasted and dredged from the ocean bed and used as landfill. Another facility for carrier aircraft was built on Pityilu by the 71st Naval Construction Battalion in May and June 1944, along with accommodation for 2,500 men. The eastern end of Pityilu was cleared and a fleet recreation centre was built that could accommodate up to 10,000 at a time.

Construction of the naval base on Los Negros was the responsibility of the 2nd Naval Construction Regiment, with the 11th, 58th and 71st Naval Construction Battalions. Work included a bulk storage at Papitalai for of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, of <a href="Diesel%20fuel">distillate</a>, of <a href="avgas">avgas</a> and of <a href="gasoline">mogas</a>; a 500-bed evacuation hospital; two <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a> wharves; 24 warehouses and 83 administration buildings in <a href="Quonset%20hut">Quonset hut</a>s. At Lombrum Point, the Seabees built three installations: a <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> repair base, a ship repair base, and a landing craft repair base. A pontoon drydock was provided for servicing the landing craft.

Development of facilities on Manus was taken in hand by the 5th Naval Construction Regiment, with the 35th, 44th and 57th Naval Construction Battalions, which arrived in mid-April. They erected 128 storage buildings and 50 refrigerators, each of capacity. A water supply system was developed to supply per day. Two systems were developed, one using streams in the Lombrum area that supplied per day, and another for outlying areas that used wells to produce per day. The system included water treatment plants, reservoirs, and pipes. All construction work was completed by April 1945, with the base remaining in use until the end of the war.

In his final report on the campaign, General Krueger reported 3,280 Japanese dead had been counted and 75 had been captured. Perhaps 1,100 more were missing, and were never seen again. American casualties were 326 killed, 1,189 wounded, and four missing. Some 1,625 Americans had been evacuated for all causes, including wounds and illness. One Australian was wounded. ANGAU reported one native had been killed and one wounded in action, three were killed by the Japanese, and 20 accidentally killed and 34 wounded by air, artillery, and naval bombardment.

The value of the Admiralty Islands to the Allies was enormous. Their capture saved more lives than they cost by obviating the need to capture Truk, Kavieng, Rabaul, and <a href="Hansa%20Bay">Hansa Bay</a> and thereby speeding up the Allied advance by several months. As an airbase, the Admiralties' value was great, for aircraft based there ranged over Truk, Wewak, and beyond. As a naval base, their value was greater still, as they combined a fleet anchorage with major facilities.

A well-known rule of thumb is that an attacking force needs a 3:1 superiority to ensure success. In the opening stages of the battle of Los Negros, the ratio was more like 1:4. In the end the Allies won, "simply because," wrote Morison, "the United States and Australia dominated that stretch of ocean and the air over it." When queried about the naval support, General Chase replied, "they didn't support us; they saved our necks". Chase's own defensive tactics were also a vital factor. He was awarded the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star</a> for his part, as was MacArthur.

Allied commanders, and later historians, debated whether the Admiralty Islands Campaign was the bold action of a great commander or a reckless endeavour that courted disaster. Admiral Fechteler felt, "we're damn lucky we didn't get run off the island," and Admiral Barbey, for one, believed the original plan would have resulted in over-running the islands in short order with fewer casualties. It would certainly have been much less risky, but it is doubtful whether an assault on the well-defended beaches of Seeadler Harbour would have resulted in fewer casualties. Whereas, in accelerating both MacArthur and Nimitz's campaigns, it shortened the war by at least a month. Thus, in the final analysis, the campaign "had the great virtue of hastening victory while reducing the number of dead and wounded".

For the Japanese, the loss of the Admiralties meant the loss of their outpost line in the South Eastern Area. Imperial Headquarters now ordered the preparation of a new line in <a href="Western%20New%20Guinea">Western New Guinea</a>. The Admiralties operation also indicated the Allies were becoming more ambitious and might bypass Hansa Bay. Accordingly, the <a href="Eighteenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Eighteenth Army</a> in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a> and <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a> as well.

Stanley Savige

<a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir Stanley George Savige, (26 June 1890 – 15 May 1954) was an <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> soldier and officer who served in the First World War and Second World War.

In March 1915, after the outbreak of the First World War, Savige enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a>. He served in the ranks during the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>, and received a <a href="Commissioned%20officer">commission</a>. He later served on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, where he was twice recommended for the Military Cross for bravery. In 1918, he joined <a href="Dunsterforce">Dunsterforce</a> and served in the <a href="Caucasus%20Campaign">Caucasus Campaign</a>, during which he was instrumental in protecting thousands of <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> refugees. He subsequently wrote a book, "Stalky's Forlorn Hope", about his experiences. After the war he played a key role in the establishment of <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy Australia</a>, the war widows and orphans benefit fund.

During the early years of the Second World War, Savige commanded the <a href="17th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">17th Infantry Brigade</a> in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Battle of Greece</a> and <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria–Lebanon Campaign</a>. His outspoken criticism of professional soldiers earned him their rancour. He returned to Australia in early 1942, and later commanded the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a> in the <a href="Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae%20campaign">Salamaua–Lae campaign</a>. He ultimately rose to the rank of lieutenant general in the Australian Army, commanding the <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a> in the <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville Campaign</a>.

In later life, Savige was a director of Olympic Tyre & Rubber Ltd from 1946 to 1951 and chairman of <a href="Moran%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%26amp%3B%20Cato%20Ltd">Moran & Cato Ltd</a> from 1950 to 1951. He was also chairman of the Central War Gratuity Board from 1946 to 1951, and a commissioner of the <a href="State%20Bank%20of%20Victoria">State Savings Bank of Victoria</a>.

Stanley Savige was born on 26 June 1890, in <a href="Morwell%2C%20Victoria">Morwell, Victoria</a>, the eldest of eight children to Samuel Savige, a butcher, and his wife Ann Nora, née Walmsley. Stan Savige left <a href="Korumburra">Korumburra</a> State School at the age of twelve to work as a <a href="Blacksmith%23Blacksmith%27s%20striker">blacksmith's striker</a>. While at Korumburra, he enlisted in the school <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">junior cadets</a> as a <a href="bugler">bugler</a>. The family moved to <a href="Prahran%2C%20Victoria">Prahran, Victoria</a>, in 1907, where Savige worked at a variety of jobs and served in the Prahran senior cadets for 18 months, from 1907 to 1909. He became a <a href="scoutmaster">scoutmaster</a>, forming the First Yarra Troop. Savige was an active member of the <a href="South%20Yarra">South Yarra</a> <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> Church, where he was a <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> teacher. Through his church activities, Savige met Lilian Stockton, to whom he became engaged on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a>, 1914.

Savige enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 6 March 1915, and was posted to the <a href="24th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">24th Infantry Battalion</a>, which departed Melbourne for Egypt on the transport "Euripides" on 8 May 1915. He was passed over for a commission due to his lack of education, but was promoted to <a href="corporal">corporal</a> on 30 April and <a href="lance%20sergeant">lance sergeant</a> on 8 May. The 24th Infantry Battalion landed at <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> on 5 September 1915 and took over part of the line at <a href="Battle%20of%20Lone%20Pine">Lone Pine</a>. Savige became <a href="company%20sergeant%20major">company sergeant major</a> on 20 September. There, he was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on 9 November 1915. During the evacuation of Gallipoli in December 1915, Savige was one of three officers chosen to serve with the battalion rearguard.

After a brief period of rest and reorganisation in Egypt, the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">2nd Division</a>—of which the 24th Infantry Battalion was part—embarked for France on 21 March 1916. Savige became commander of the battalion scout platoon and led a number of night patrols into <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>. On 12 April, he became battalion <a href="intelligence%20officer">intelligence officer</a> and he was promoted to <a href="first%20lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 1 May. Coming to the attention of his brigade commander, <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> <a href="John%20Gellibrand">John Gellibrand</a>, Savige was attached to 6th Infantry Brigade headquarters as a trainee brigade intelligence officer. "We expected a lot of the new B. I. O.," Gellibrand later recalled, "and we got it." Savige served in operations at <a href="Pozi%C3%A8res">Pozières</a> and <a href="Mouquet%20Farm">Mouquet Farm</a> in July and August 1916. At one point he ran through heavy shellfire on an errand. The orderly who went into it with him was never seen again. Savige was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> on 15 September. On 8 November, he was wounded at <a href="Flers%2C%20Somme">Flers</a> but remained on duty. However, on 20 December he was admitted to hospital, suffering from influenza. Savige rejoined the 24th Infantry Battalion on 5 January 1917 and was appointed <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> on 3 February.

In February 1917, the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> began a withdrawal from its positions in the <a href="Somme%20%28department%29">Somme</a> sector to the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a>. Gellibrand was in temporary command of the 2nd Division, which at this time was opposite the village of <a href="Butte%20de%20Warlencourt">Warlencourt</a>. Patrols from the 6th Infantry Brigade found Warlencourt empty and occupied it unopposed. The 24th Infantry Battalion kept in contact with the Germans as they pulled back. On 13 March, the 24th Infantry battalion—now responsible for the entire brigade front—found <a href="Gr%C3%A9villers">Grévillers</a> empty and occupied it. By 17 March 1917, the trenches in front of Bapaume were empty and the 6th Infantry Brigade occupied its northern suburbs.

In the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bullecourt">Second Battle of Bullecourt</a> during May 1917, the 6th Infantry Brigade managed to penetrate the Hindenburg Line but its hold was precarious, as the 5th Infantry Brigade on its flank had not been able to manage the same feat. The brigade then faced strong German counter-attacks. Savige was in the front trench, where he attempted to coordinate the 24th Infantry Battalion's defence. The situation, Savige realised, was "somewhat serious". Extraordinary tenacity and bravery was required to hold the position. "The 6th Brigade's achievement on this day," wrote <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, "had few parallels in the history of the AIF. In the whole line of battle from <a href="Vimy">Vimy</a> to near <a href="Qu%C3%A9ant">Quéant</a>, theirs had been almost the only success."

Savige was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for Bullecourt, and recommended for the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>. His citation read:
Savige was ultimately awarded the Military Cross on 1 January 1918, for both his "consistent good work and devotion to duty" in the period spanning 26 February to 17 March 1917 and his "coolness under fire and tenacity of purpose" during the Second Battle of Bullecourt from April–May 1917. He was mentioned in despatches a second time for his role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>, although he was originally recommended for a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his Military Cross. His citation read:

Although Savige was informed that the citation had gone through, the medal was never <a href="gazette">gazette</a>d. He became assistant brigade major of the 6th Infantry Brigade on 10 September and was acting brigade major from 22 November until 11 January 1918.

Following the <a href="February%20Revolution%23Events">abdication of the Russian Tsar</a> in 1917, the <a href="Caucasus%20Campaign">Caucasus Front</a> collapsed, leaving Central Asia open to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Turkish</a> Army. The British <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> responded with a plan to send a force of hand-picked British officers and NCOs to organise any remaining Russian forces or civilians who were ready to fight the Turkish forces. A request for Australian officers to participate was sent to the commander of the <a href="Australian%20Corps">Australian Corps</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> Sir <a href="William%20Birdwood%2C%201st%20Baron%20Birdwood">William Birdwood</a>. Some twenty officers, drawn from "the cream of the cream" of Australian leaders, were chosen, including Savige. This force became known as <a href="Dunsterforce">Dunsterforce</a> after its commander, <a href="Major-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major General</a> <a href="Lionel%20Charles%20Dunsterville">Lionel Charles Dunsterville</a>, the inspiration for the titular character of <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s novel "<a href="Stalky%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Stalky & Co.</a>" Dunsterforce arrived in <a href="Baku">Baku</a> in August 1918. It was hoped that, from the Christian <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgian</a>, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>n and <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> people who had supported the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russians</a> and historically feared the Turks, Dunsterforce could raise an army to contain the Turks but "the task proved superhuman".

Following the capture of <a href="Urmia">Urmia</a> by the Turks, Savige discovered tens of thousands of fleeing <a href="Assyrian%20people">Assyrian</a> refugees. He deployed a small group of volunteers from his own force, along with refugees, to form a rearguard to hold back the <a href="Persian%20people">Persians</a> and <a href="Kurds">Kurds</a> who were murdering the refugees and carrying off the young girls as slaves. Official Historian Charles Bean later wrote that:

Savige was subsequently decorated with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for his efforts on this occasion. His citation read:

For his services in Iran, Savige was also mentioned in despatches a third time. He later wrote a book about his experiences, entitled "Stalky's Forlorn Hope", which was published in Melbourne in 1920. In November 1918, he was evacuated to a hospital in <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, suffering an attack of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and returned to Australia in January 1919 on the "City of Exeter".

Savige married Lilian Stockton on 28 June 1919 at the <a href="South%20Yarra%2C%20Victoria">South Yarra</a> Baptist Church. Their marriage produced a daughter, Gwendolyn Lesley, who was born in 1920. Savige also raised his two nephews, Stanley James and William, after his sister Hilda died in 1924. Savige had to struggle to re-establish himself in civilian life. He was unemployed for a time before finding work with a Melbourne wholesale firm. In 1923 he became sole agent for the Returned Soldiers' Mill in <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a>. He was successful as a salesman and eventually became sole agent for all of Australia. In 1930, he ran unsuccessfully for the <a href="Victorian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Victorian Legislative Assembly</a> <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Caulfield">Electoral district of Caulfield</a> on the <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Nationalist Party of Australia</a> ticket.

In 1923, Gellibrand founded the Remembrance Club in <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>, with the aim of encouraging returned servicemen in business. Savige visited Gellibrand in Hobart during August 1923, and Gellibrand urged him to set up a similar club in Melbourne. Soon after Savige's return to Melbourne, a group of ex-servicemen met to say farewell to one of their number who was about to go to England. Savige used this opportunity to bring up the idea of a club similar to Gellibrand's Remembrance Club. After several informal meetings, the Melbourne club's inaugural meeting was held in Anzac House, Melbourne. <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy Australia</a> was founded as an ex-servicemen's club, but soon became a charitable organisation focusing on war widows and orphans. For the next 26 years, due to his commitment, energy and enthusiasm, Savige's name became inseparable from both the club and the movement.

Savige joined the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> on 19 February 1920, with his AIF rank of captain. He served with Headquarters <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a>—then under Gellibrand—from July 1921 to November 1924. He commanded the <a href="37th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">37th Infantry Battalion</a> from 1 December 1924 to 31 July 1928, the 24th Infantry Battalion from 1 August 1928 to 31 May 1935, and the <a href="10th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">10th Infantry Brigade</a> from 1 June 1935 to 12 October 1939. Along the way, he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> on 1 July 1924, <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 1 July 1926, <a href="colonel">colonel</a> on 1 June 1935, and <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a> on 1 May 1938. His promotion, while neither meteoric nor exceptional, was still far faster than that enjoyed by regular officers like <a href="Frank%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a>, <a href="Horace%20Robertson">Horace Robertson</a>, or <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Alan Vasey</a>, who had been majors in the AIF but remained at that rank for nearly twenty years, only to find themselves junior to Militia officers like Savige. For his part, Savige was a critic of the regulars. While commander of 10th Infantry Brigade, he insisted that <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a> graduates serve first as <a href="platoon">platoon</a> commanders before assuming staff posts, so they could acquire an understanding of the men. He wrote to Gellibrand:

Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> announced the decision to form a <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a>. He further directed that all commands in the new <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> would go to militiamen. <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>—who was appointed commander of the 6th Division on 28 September—selected Savige to command its <a href="17th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">17th Infantry Brigade</a>, the brigade from Victoria. Savige was given the AIF serial number VX13. He and Blamey had worked together when Blamey had commanded the 3rd Division from 1931 to 1937, and Savige was "almost fanatically loyal to Blamey through bad as well as good times". For regular officers, their exclusion from command positions was "the final straw". Savige suspected—accurately in part—that <a href="Australian%20Staff%20Corps">Staff Corps</a> officers were out to get him. A "general atmosphere of criticism and derogation" infected the force that would eventually sour relations between Blamey and some Staff Corps officers.

Considering its inexperience, Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade was given a complicated role in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bardia">Battle of Bardia</a>. While the <a href="2/6th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/6th Infantry Battalion</a> made a demonstration on the right, the <a href="2/5th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/5th Infantry Battalion</a>, reinforced by part of the <a href="2/7th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/7th Infantry Battalion</a>, attempted to follow up the <a href="16th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">16th Infantry Brigade's</a> attack, with the remainder of the 2/7th in reserve. The brigade had to move in four directions at once. The plan soon went wrong, as the 2/5th in particular suffered a series of mishaps. By nightfall, Colonel Frank Berryman, the divisional chief of staff, had reached the conclusion that the 17th Infantry Brigade had become too tired and disorganised for further effort. This was only partly due to enemy action; the rest was attributable to Berryman's own plan, which had dispersed the brigade and provided it with inadequate armoured and, in the final stages, artillery support. Savige also bore some of the blame, for failing to ensure that his subordinates understood and carried out the plan.
At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tobruk%20%281941%29">Battle of Tobruk</a>, Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade was again split up and given a secondary role. However, in the advance on <a href="Derna%2C%20Libya">Derna</a>, the brigade managed to beat Robertson's 19th Infantry Brigade to <a href="Giovanni%20Berta">Giovanni Berta</a>. By late February, the campaign was over and Savige was tasked with holding a defensive line near <a href="El%20Agheila">El Agheila</a>. He became convinced that German troops were moving into the area, but his concerns were dismissed by the Brigadier General Staff at <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>, Brigadier <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a>. A month later, Savige was proven right when the "<a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>" pounced on the British forces around El Agheila, but by then he and the 17th Infantry Brigade were in Egypt, preparing for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Greece">Battle of Greece</a>. Although the campaign had raised doubts about his suitability for command—mostly resulting from his performance at Bardia, but also with regard to the running feud with Vasey, Berryman and Robertson—Savige was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a>. His citation read:

The 17th Infantry Brigade was the last to land in Greece, arriving at <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> on 12 April. Savige was placed in charge of "Savige" Force, consisting of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and <a href="2/11th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/11th</a> Infantry Battalions, with armour, artillery, engineer and other support. He was given the mission of covering the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> flank around <a href="Kalabaka">Kalabaka</a>. On 17 April, Savige received orders to withdraw from Kalabaka, leaving only a rearguard behind. The road behind him, however, was packed with vehicles, and a crucial bridge on the only reasonably good road back had accidentally been demolished. Savige elected to disregard his orders and hold his position until the road was clear. He then managed to withdraw, although his driver's foot was broken in an air raid. Savige arrived back in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> on 1 May 1941 and began the task of rebuilding his brigade. For the campaign in Greece, he received his fourth mention in despatches.
In June 1941, the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> fought in the <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria–Lebanon Campaign</a>. One of its problems was that it was trying to fight three battles with only two brigades, because the <a href="18th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">18th Infantry Brigade</a> that was normally part of the division was engaged in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a>. Accordingly, Savige's 17th Infantry Brigade headquarters was brought in to provide the 7th Division with a third brigade headquarters. Savige was given three battalions that had never worked together before—the <a href="2/3rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/3rd</a> and 2/5th Infantry Battalions and 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion. He scored a notable success in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Damour">Battle of Damour</a>, which he rated as his most successful battle of the war, although his conduct was not above criticism by Berryman, who felt that Savige had located his headquarters too far back, resulting in failure to seize an important opportunity. Ultimately, though, this had no significant impact on the battle.

By June 1941, Blamey had become concerned about Savige's health. A thorough medical examination in August declared that Savige had reached a stage of complete exhaustion. Blamey therefore decided to send Savige and Brigadier <a href="John%20Murray%20%28general%29">J. J. Murray</a> back to Australia on a recruiting campaign as "a graceful way of retiring with honour two officers who have done useful work in the Middle East but seemed to him unequal to the severe physical demands of fast-moving modern warfare". Savige said goodbye to the three battalions of the 17th Brigade at a special parade at Edsaya in Syria on 15 December 1941. At the time his next post was to have been Director of Recruiting and Propaganda in Australia.<ref name = "AWM52 8/2/17/49 - December 1941"></ref>

Savige arrived in Australia on 5 January 1942 to find that his new appointment had been changed to commander of the 3rd Division, and he was promoted to the rank of major general two days later. The outbreak of war with <a href="Japan">Japan</a> prompted a wholesale reorganisation of the forces in Australia and Savige was one of a number of officers with experience in the Middle East who was promoted and given command of a Home Army formation. Savige threw himself into the task of preparing his command for the war, weeding out the physically unfit and incompetent. By May, he had removed some 60 officers. Replacing them was another matter. The division was at less than half strength when Savige assumed command and was filled with large numbers of 18-year-old conscripts. One new arrival was especially welcome: Lieutenant Colonel <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28general%29">John Wilton</a>, who was posted as General Service Officer, First Grade (GSO1) in August. Savige later recalled that "I never had a more competent staff, nor such a co-operative team, than that staff after Wilton came along." The 3rd Division moved to southern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> in July, where it came under Lieutenant General <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Edmund Herring</a>'s <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a>. In October, Herring succeeded Rowell as commander of <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a>, and Savige became acting corps commander. With his attention focused on the corps, Savige relied on Wilton to supervise the training of the 3rd Division.

The 3rd Division was alerted to move to New Guinea in February 1943, but Blamey did not initially intend for Savige to command it, for he felt that "it's very tough going up there", and he still had doubts about Savige's physical fitness. A thorough medical examination cleared the way, and Savige departed for <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in March 1943. The successful conclusion of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">Battle of Wau</a> left the 17th Infantry Brigade—now under Brigadier <a href="Murray%20Moten">Murray Moten</a>—at Wau as the only troops in contact with the enemy in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a>. Herring, now in command of New Guinea Force, ordered Savige to threaten the Japanese position at <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a>; the result was the <a href="Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae%20campaign">Salamaua–Lae campaign</a>. Despite the rugged conditions, Savige led from the front. He visited forward positions and flew over frontline areas wearing his scarlet general's cap band to let his men—and any Japanese sniper—know that the general was on the job.
Once again, Savige would not escape controversy. In this case, difficulties arose from the fact that Herring failed to make it clear to Savige and Wilton exactly what was meant by "threaten". What would end up being threatened by Savige's very success was Blamey's plan for the capture of <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, which called for the Japanese defenders of Lae to be drawn away towards Salamaua. The campaign also included an acrimonious exchange between Savige and American commanders that threatened Allied harmony. This arose, ironically, because of Herring's deliberately vague instructions, which he hoped would ensure Allied harmony.

On 15 August, Blamey and Berryman, now a major general, arrived in Port Moresby. Berryman was sent forward to visit Savige and evaluate his performance, with a brief to pass judgement on Savige's conduct of the campaign—and relieve him if necessary. Although "it was an open secret that Berryman had a very low opinion of Savige's military competence", after surveying the situation for himself, Berryman was forced to admit to Wilton that he "never thought that he would have to admit that Savige was right." Berryman returned to Port Moresby and informed Blamey and Herring that they had misjudged Savige. Nonetheless, in deference to Herring's wishes, Blamey relieved Savige anyway. On 23 August, Savige, bitterly disappointed that he would not see the final capture of Salamaua, handed over the Salamaua operation to the <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division</a> under Major General <a href="Edward%20Milford">Edward Milford</a>. Savige was awarded a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> for his services in the Salamaua campaign. His citation read:

In February 1944, the appointment of Herring as Chief Justice of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria">Supreme Court of Victoria</a> led to a vacancy at I Corps, for which General Blamey nominated both Vasey and Savige, but, "having regard to their respective careers", recommended the latter. Army Minister <a href="Frank%20Forde">Frank Forde</a> queried Blamey's recommendation, and asked who was the senior officer. Blamey explained that Savige was senior to Vasey—although not as senior as <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur "Tubby" Allen</a>, <a href="James%20Cannan">James Cannan</a> or <a href="Eric%20Plant">Eric Plant</a>. Blamey pointed out that seniority was not the paramount concern for promotion at such a level, and that he was not prepared to recommend these officers at this time, whereupon Forde dropped his objection. <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> considered Vasey's supersession "outrageous".

On 12 April 1944, Savige's I Corps headquarters moved up from Queensland to relieve that of Berryman’s II Corps at <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a>. The two staffs had hoped to exchange office equipment, thus saving on shipping, but Advanced LHQ ordered that each should move with all its stores. Instead, the designations of the two corps were exchanged, so that I Corps was still the corps in Australia and II Corps the one in New Guinea. On 20 April, II Corps was ordered to assume the designation and function of New Guinea Force and the existing headquarters of New Guinea Force in Port Moresby was broken up. Savige therefore assumed command of New Guinea Force, his new headquarters opening at Lae on 6 May. At this time, no major combat operations were taking place and activities were winding down in Australian New Guinea. New Guinea Force's main role was rolling up the base installations and shipping units back to Australia. On 9 September 1944, MacArthur discarded the task force organisation. Henceforth the US <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army">Sixth Army</a> and <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth Army</a> and Lieutenant General <a href="Vernon%20Sturdee">Vernon Sturdee</a>’s <a href="First%20Army%20%28Australia%29">First Army</a> reported directly to him. First Army headquarters arrived at Lae on 1 October and assumed control of Australian troops in New Guinea. At midnight, New Guinea Force was discontinued, and Savige's headquarters became II Corps once more.

Although geographically the largest of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands%20%28archipelago%29">Solomon Islands</a>, <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a> was politically part of <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">Australian New Guinea</a> and Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> desired that Australia should contribute to the garrison. Savige’s II Corps was ordered to "reduce enemy resistance on Bougainville Island as opportunity offers without committing major forces". "To a commander like General Savige, who was not only deeply imbued with the doctrine of aggressiveness which was an AIF article of faith in both world wars but also burning to end his military career in a swirl of action,"" wrote correspondent John Hetherington, Savige's orders "were invitingly flexible." GHQ reckoned that there were no more than 12,000 Japanese left on Bougainville, while LHQ estimated 25,000. Actually, more than 40,000 Japanese were still alive on Bougainville in November 1944.

Savige's sixth and last campaign of the war was free of controversy about his command. Once again, he had a talented regular officer as chief of staff, Brigadier <a href="Ragnar%20Garrett">Ragnar Garrett</a>, with whom he had worked in Greece during 1941 and more recently in New Guinea. Moreover, as a corps commander, tactical details could be left to subordinates, although Savige still had to keep a close eye on them to ensure that they did not take unnecessary risks or incur needless casualties. Savige continued to tour the front lines wearing his scarlet cap band and flying his car flag. He also maintained his concern for, and rapport with, the ordinary soldiers under his command. The final campaign on Bougainville cost 516 Australian lives. Some 8,500 Japanese were killed while 9,800 died of other causes, leaving 23,571 still alive when the war ended. On 8 September 1945, Savige accepted their surrender at <a href="Torokina">Torokina</a>.

From October 1945 to May 1946, Savige served as co-ordinator of <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20Australian%20military%20after%20World%20War%20II">demobilisation and dispersal</a>. He transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 6 June. Resuming his business interests, he was a director of Olympic Tyre & Rubber Ltd from 1946 to 1951 and chairman of <a href="Moran%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%26amp%3B%20Cato%20Ltd">Moran & Cato Ltd</a> from 1950 to 1951. He was also chairman of the Central War Gratuity Board from 1946 to 1951 and from 1951 a commissioner of the <a href="State%20Bank%20of%20Victoria">State Savings Bank of Victoria</a>. He was a leader in Melbourne's <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> marches, a patron of a number of his former units' associations, and honorary colonel of the <a href="5th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">5th Battalion</a> (<a href="Victorian%20Scottish%20Regiment">Victorian Scottish Regiment</a>).

Blamey recommended Savige for a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> for the Salamaua campaign in October 1944. A year later, he recommended Savige for a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> for the campaign on Bougainville. Both recommendations were turned down by the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government. Following the election of the <a href="Coalition%20%28Australia%29">coalition</a> government in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201949">1949 election</a>, Blamey wrote to the newly elected Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Savige was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (Military Division) in the <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> on 8 June 1950. In 1953, he travelled to <a href="London">London</a> to represent Legacy at the <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronation</a> of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>.

Savige died of <a href="coronary%20artery%20disease">coronary artery disease</a> at his home in <a href="Kew%2C%20Victoria">Kew, Victoria</a> on 15 May 1954. He was accorded a funeral with full military honours at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne">St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne</a>. The service was conducted by the Chaplain of Southern Command and <a href="Bishop">Bishop</a> of Geelong, the <a href="Right%20Reverend">Right Reverend</a> Dr J. D. McKie, who told the congregation that "Sir Stanley's greatest virtue was humanity. He had great consideration for his troops. He thought that they were not there just to be used, but to be helped." A crowd of 3,000 mourners watched him laid to rest at <a href="Boroondara%20General%20Cemetery">Kew Cemetery</a>. Savige left an estate valued at £66,000. He was survived by his daughter Gwendolyn and his nephew Stanley, his wife having died two months earlier. In his will, he directed that his papers be donated to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, where they remain. The War Memorial also holds his portrait by Alfred Cook. In August 2006, Australian-Assyrian community leaders from Sydney and Melbourne gathered to commemorate Savige's role in saving Assyrian refugees in 1918, and the mayor of Morwell, Lisa Price, unveiled a bronze bust of the general.

Sesame Street international co-productions

"Sesame Street" international co-productions are <a href="educational%20television">educational</a> <a href="children%27s%20television%20series">children's television series</a> based on the American "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>" but tailored to the countries in which they are produced. Shortly after the debut of "Sesame Street" in the United States in <a href="1969%20in%20television">1969</a>, television producers, teachers, and officials of several countries approached the show's producers and the executives of <a href="Sesame%20Workshop">Sesame Workshop</a> (2000-present) about the possibility of airing international versions of "Sesame Street". Creator <a href="Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> hired former <a href="CBS">CBS</a> executive <a href="Michael%20Dann">Michael Dann</a> to field offers to produce versions of the show in other countries.

The producers of these shows developed them using a variant on the CTW model, a flexible model of production based upon the experiences of the creators and producers of the U.S. show. The model consisted of the combination of producers and researchers working together on the show, the development of a unique curriculum, and extensive <a href="test%20screening">test screening</a> of the shows. The shows came to be called co-productions, and they contained original sets, <a href="List%20of%20Sesame%20Street%20international%20co-production%20characters">characters</a>, and curriculum goals. Different co-productions were produced, depending upon each country's needs and resources. They included both <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29%23Global%20use">dubbed</a> versions of the American show and versions created, developed, and produced in each country that reflected their needs, educational priorities, and culture. For example, the first <a href="HIV">HIV</a>-positive <a href="The%20Muppets">Muppet</a>, <a href="Kami%20%28Takalani%20Sesame%29">Kami</a>, from the <a href="Television%20in%20South%20Africa">South African</a> co-production "<a href="Takalani%20Sesame">Takalani Sesame</a>", was created in 2003 to address the epidemic of <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and was met with controversy in the U.S.. By 2006, there were 20 co-productions in countries all over the world. In 2001, there were more than 120 million viewers of all international versions of "Sesame Street", and by the US show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries.

A few months after the 1969 debut of "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>" on <a href="National%20Educational%20Television">National Educational Television</a> in the United States, producers from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the <a href="Children%27s%20Television%20Workshop">Children's Television Workshop</a> (CTW), create and produce versions of "Sesame Street" in those countries. Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without <a href="television%20advertisement">commercials</a>; (2) any changes would have to meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes would have to be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.

Many years later, co-creator <a href="Joan%20Ganz%20Cooney">Joan Ganz Cooney</a> recalled, "To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought <a href="the%20Muppets">the Muppets</a> were quintessentially American, and it turns out they're the most international characters ever created". <a href="Michael%20Dann">Michael Dann</a>, a former CBS executive whom Cooney had hired as a CTW vice-president and her assistant, was assigned to field offers from other countries to produce their own versions of "Sesame Street". Dann's appointment led to television critic Marvin Kitman stating, "After he [Dann] sells ["Sesame Street"] in Russia and Czechoslovakia, he might try Mississippi, where it is considered too controversial for educational TV".

By summer 1970, Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW later called "co-productions". 38 <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> television stations broadcast "Sesame Street" to Canada's English-speaking provinces. The <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Radio%20and%20Television%20Network">Armed Forces Radio and Television Network</a> agreed to air the first 130 episodes of the US-made show for children of military personnel serving in 16 countries, including Iceland, Greece, Ethiopia, and South Korea. During his tenure at CTW, Dann also made agreements with several Caribbean nations, Mexico, Australia, Japan, the Philippines, France, Israel, and Germany. He later told author Michael Davis, "I was aggressive and I knew people around the world". During the same period there were discussions about broadcasting the US version in <a href="Television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Britain</a> or producing a <a href="Sesame%20Street%20in%20the%20UK">British version of Sesame Street</a>, but British broadcasters found the show too controversial and rejected the idea. The American version was broadcast throughout the UK on a limited basis starting in 1971, but went off the air in 2001.

As of 2006, there were 20 active "co-productions". In 2001, CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole estimated that there were more than 120 million viewers of all international versions of "Sesame Street", and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries. In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that income from the co-productions accounted for US$96 million. Cole stated, "Children's Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world". Studies conducted on the effects of several co-productions (Mexico in 1974, Turkey in 1990, Portugal in 1993, and Russia in 1998) found that viewers of these shows gain basic academic skills, especially <a href="literacy">literacy</a> and <a href="numeracy">numeracy</a>, from watching them.

In 2001 the Workshop introduced "<a href="Sesame%20English">Sesame English</a>", a series focused on teaching children and their families the basics of the <a href="English%20language">English language</a> and on familiarizing them with some aspects of American culture. As of 2009 it aired in several countries, including Japan, Korea, and Italy. In 2003, in response to the epidemic of <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20South%20Africa">AIDS in South Africa</a>, the co-producers of "<a href="Takalani%20Sesame">Takalani Sesame</a>" included the first <a href="preschool">preschool</a> AIDS/HIV curriculum. They created the first HIV-positive Muppet, <a href="Kami%20%28Takalani%20Sesame%29">Kami</a>, to confront the stigma of HIV and AIDS in South Africa. According to the documentary "<a href="The%20World%20According%20to%20Sesame%20Street">The World According to Sesame Street</a>", the reaction of many in the US surprised Sesame Workshop. Some members of Congress attacked "Sesame Street", Sesame Workshop (previously, the CTW), and PBS. According to co-producer Naila Farouky, "The reaction we got in the US blew me away. I didn't expect people to be so horrible ... and hateful and mean". The controversy in the US was short-lived, and died down when the public discovered the facts about the South African co-production, and when <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">UN Secretary-General</a> <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a> and American televangelist and conservative activist <a href="Jerry%20Falwell">Jerry Falwell</a> praised the Workshop's efforts.

Gettas explained that what he called "Sesame Street's unprecedented appeal abroad" was its broad appeal and adaptability to other cultures. Gettas stated, "Here is a program that speaks to them in their own language, on their level, and with respect for their intelligence". According to Cooper Wright, the Sesame Workshop's vice-president of International Co-Productions in 2006, the "mission" of the co-productions was to "help children reach their highest potential". The producers were further galvanized to accomplish this goal after the events of <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11</a>. Cooney stated, "Our producers are like old-fashioned missionaries. It's not religion they're spreading, but it is learning and tolerance and love and mutual respect".

The earliest international versions were what then-CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole called "fairly simple", consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice-overs and instructional <a href="Cutaway%20%28filmmaking%29">cutaways</a>. Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country's needs and resources warranted it. They utilized a variant of a flexible model called the CTW model, developed by the producers and creators of the original show, to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries. The Workshop recognized that the production model developed in the US, which reflected its needs and culture at the time, served as a framework for other countries that wanted to repeat it. Its inherent flexibility was attractive to producers in other countries, who saw the model as "a methodological approach that is neither doctrinaire nor culture-bound" that could be used to achieve different results in different countries. According to the 2006 documentary "The World According to Sesame Street", the producers of the co-productions repeated the "experiment" undertaken by the original US show, but adapted it to each specific situation. In 1969, the producers of the original show depended upon government and <a href="foundation%20%28nonprofit%29">foundation</a> funding, but as Sesame Workshop CEO Gary Knell stated in 2009, the US funding model would not necessarily be effective in countries with different economic and political structures. All co-productions share elements with the American show, but because of their different needs, no two are exactly alike. According to Gettas, the producers of the programs would "rely on variants of the CTW model to help them create programming that faithfully reflects the linguistic, cultural, social, or religious diversity of their native lands".

The need for preschool education in each country was assessed through research and interviews with television producers, researchers, and educational experts, which paralleled what the producers of "Sesame Street" did in the late 1960s. Then they convened the experts in a series of meetings, held in the individual countries, to create and develop a curriculum, the show's <a href="educational%20television">educational goals</a>, and its set and characters, as was done in 1968 in the US. Finally, they held a series of meetings, both at the CTW offices in New York City and in the individual countries, to train the co-production team in the CTW model. Writing seminars were also held in New York.

The co-productions consisted of unique characters, sets, and curricula designed to meet the needs of their own children. Cole reported that the goal of the co-productions was to provide children in each country a program that reflected their country's culture, local values, and educational priorities. She stated that this cultural specificity was the reason for the co-productions' success, popularity, and educational impact. The co-productions combined universal curriculum goals that were common around the world with educational content that specifically addressed the needs of children in each country. Another goal of the international co-productions of "Sesame Street" was, as executive producer <a href="Lutrelle%20Horne">Lutrelle Horne</a> stated in 1987, the improvement of "the overall quality of a country's television". He added, "We give a country a model of how television can be used effectively to address people's needs".

US cast members <a href="Kevin%20Clash">Kevin Clash</a> and <a href="Martin%20P.%20Robinson">Marty Robinson</a> have cast and trained the international <a href="puppeteer">puppeteer</a>s. At first, Muppet builder <a href="Kermit%20Love">Kermit Love</a> constructed the puppets for the new shows in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, <a href="Jim%20Henson">Jim Henson</a>'s <a href="Creature%20Shop">Creature Shop</a>, overseen by Connie Peterson, has taken over puppet creation. The producers of "<a href="Sisimpur">Sisimpur</a>", the <a href="Television%20in%20Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and an important part of their culture. The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research to ascertain whether their curriculum goals were met, just as was done in the US after the first season of "Sesame Street". According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, <a href="2004%20unrest%20in%20Kosovo">riots and conflicts</a> between <a href="Kosovo%20Serbs">Serbs</a> and <a href="Kosovo%20Albanians">Albanians</a> in 2004 delayed production of the <a href="Television%20in%20Kosovo">Kosovo</a> co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.

When countries were not able to afford creating original co-productions, the Workshop provided alternatives for them. They created "<a href="Open%20Sesame%20%28TV%20series%29">Open Sesame</a>", a series with no specific cultural references in it and, as Horne described, "universally acceptable material". The show was also broadcast on US military bases. The Workshop's library of Muppet skits, short films, and animations were sold to many countries and were either broadcast in English or dubbed in the local language. According to Gikow, it often served as the basis for the creation of new material for their own co-productions. As of 2009, the Workshop opened its entire library of episodes, short films, and animations created all over the world so that poorer countries could use and adapt them for their purposes.

The first international co-production of "Sesame Street" was <a href="Television%20in%20Brazil">Brazil</a>'s "<a href="Vila%20S%C3%A9samo">Vila Sésamo</a>", which first aired in 1972 and had an initial run of two years. Its set consisted of an open <a href="plaza">plaza</a>. The Muppet Garibaldo was "the centerpiece" of the Brazil co-production and remained popular with viewers when the show was revived in 2007. Garibaldo's performer in the revival, Fernando Gomes, became a puppeteer because of the original Brazilian show's influence. It was broadcast in <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>. Also in 1972, "<a href="Plaza%20S%C3%A9samo">Plaza Sésamo</a>" was produced in <a href="Television%20in%20Mexico">Mexico</a>. This co-production has also been broadcast in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>-speaking <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> since 1973, and has aired on Spanish television stations in the US since 1995.

In 1973, <a href="History%20of%20television%20in%20Germany%231960s%20-%201970s">West Germany</a>, one of the first countries to approach CTW, began airing "<a href="Sesamstra%C3%9Fe">Sesamstraße</a>". It has been continually produced since. At first, this co-production incorporated original German animation and live action segments into the US version. Starting in 1978, its producers began using puppets filmed in their own studio in Germany. The <a href="Television%20in%20the%20Netherlands">Netherlands</a>' version, "<a href="Sesamstraat">Sesamstraat</a>", began in 1976. This show has aired in both <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> and <a href="Flemish">Flemish</a>. In "Sesamstraat's" early years, <a href="Television%20in%20Belgium">Belgium</a> television participated in its production, so it also aired there. In 2011, to celebrate the show's 35th anniversary, the Sesame Workshop partnered with the <a href="Van%20Gogh%20Museum">Van Gogh Museum</a> in Amsterdam to recreate a version of van Gogh's "<a href="Bedroom%20in%20Arles">Bedroom in Arles</a>", featuring Muppets from both the American and Dutch shows. <a href="Television%20in%20France">France</a> aired "Open Sesame" in the early 1970s before creating its own co-production. One version created in 1974, "<a href="Bonjour%20S%C3%A9same">Bonjour Sésame</a>", was fifteen minutes long and had no street scenes. "<a href="1%2C%20Rue%20S%C3%A9same">1, Rue Sésame</a> "began in 1976; its set consists of a courtyard of a building in a small French town.

The final two co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, occurred in <a href="Television%20in%20Kuwait">Kuwait</a> and <a href="Television%20in%20Spain">Spain</a>. The Kuwaiti show, "<a href="Iftah%20Ya%20Simsim">Iftah Ya Simsim</a>", which ran until 1990, was the first of its kind in the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a>. It used <a href="Modern%20Standard%20Arabic">Modern Standard Arabic</a> (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, including the use of MSA. "<a href="Barrio%20S%C3%A9samo">Barrio Sésamo</a>", made in Spain, featured a snail character who was able to hide a thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. <a href="Valentin%20Fuster">Valentin Fuster</a>, a native Spaniard who worked at <a href="Mount%20Sinai%20Hospital%20%28Manhattan%29">Mount Sinai Hospital</a> in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.

<a href="Television%20in%20Sweden">Sweden</a>'s version of "Sesame Street", "<a href="Svenska%20Sesam">Svenska Sesam</a>" (1981–1983), was originally a single-season full co-production, but did not integrate puppets. Dubs have aired before and after. <a href="Television%20in%20Israel">Israel</a> filmed its co-production, called "<a href="Rechov%20SumSum">Rechov SumSum</a>", in 1983. It was the first co-production to devote an entire section of its curriculum to educating children about mutual respect, which was a priority due to "profound <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20conflict">political tension</a> in the region". Its curriculum, which was based upon their viewers' needs, differed from many other countries and exposed Israeli children to children from different cultures. The show's counterpart of <a href="Big%20Bird">Big Bird</a> was a <a href="hedgehog">hedgehog</a> named Kippi.

Also in 1983, the <a href="Television%20in%20the%20Philippines">Philippines</a> created "<a href="Batibot">Batibot</a>", the first fully bilingual (<a href="Tagalog%20language">Tagalog</a> and English) version of "Sesame Street". In 1989, "<a href="Susam%20Soka%C4%9F%C4%B1">Susam Sokağı</a>", a co-production filmed in <a href="Television%20in%20Turkey">Turkey</a>, featured versions of Big Bird and an "exuberant little-girl Muppet host" named Simi. There have been three versions of "Sesame Street" in <a href="Television%20in%20Portugal">Portugal</a>, including one co-production created in 1989. "Rua Sésamo" was also broadcast in the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>-speaking nations <a href="Angola">Angola</a>, <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>, <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Tom%C3%A9%20and%20Pr%C3%ADncipe">São Tomé and Príncipe</a>. "<a href="Play%20with%20Me%20Sesame">Play with Me Sesame</a>" is the title of the current version.

<a href="Television%20in%20Norway">Norway</a>'s co-production, entitled "<a href="Sesam%20Stasjon">Sesam Stasjon</a>", began filming in 1991. Three co-productions premiered in 1996, in <a href="Television%20in%20Russia">Russia</a>, Canada, and <a href="Television%20in%20Poland">Poland</a>. Russia's version, "<a href="Ulitsa%20Sezam">Ulitsa Sezam</a>" (Улица Сезам), debuted in 1996. No longer on the air, one of its curriculum goals was to prepare Russian children to live in a "new open society". Poland's "<a href="Ulica%20Sezamkowa">Ulica Sezamkowa</a> "has been since replaced by dubs of various Sesame Workshop programs and has changed its name to "Sezamkowy Zakątek". Canada aired "<a href="Sesame%20Street%20Canada">Sesame Street Canada</a>", a combination of locally produced and US-made content from 1972 to 1996. A French-dubbed version was shown in 1975, which demonstrated the producers' commitment to <a href="Official%20bilingualism%20in%20Canada">bilingualism</a>, one of their curriculum goals. In 1996, a half-hour program called "<a href="Sesame%20Park">Sesame Park</a>" was produced by the <a href="CBC%20Television">country's public broadcasting corporation</a> and consisted of more content created in-country. The series featured a polar bear, an otter, a female <a href="Bush%20flying">bush pilot</a>, and a girl in a wheelchair.

In 1998, the <a href="Television%20in%20China">Chinese</a> co-production of "Sesame Street", "<a href="Zhima%20Jie">Zhima Jie</a>", was created. An auto mechanic became the head writer of this show, broadcast in <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a>, because there were few people with experience in writing for children in the country. It has aired in 40 local markets, comprising forty percent of all Chinese homes. Its curriculum emphasized <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>. The Chinese puppeteers were trained by Kevin Clash and <a href="Caroll%20Spinney">Caroll Spinney</a>. Also in 1998, a fifteen-minute version of the Israeli show was dubbed in <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> and renamed "<a href="Shara%27a%20Simsim">Shara'a Simsim</a>"; this <a href="Television%20in%20the%20State%20of%20Palestine">Palestinian</a> co-production promoted children's sense of national identity.

In 2000, <a href="Television%20in%20Egypt">Egypt</a>'s co-production, entitled "<a href="Alam%20Simsim">Alam Simsim</a>" (عالم سمسم), began to air throughout the Arab world and was broadcast in Arabic. Its curriculum focused on literacy, math, cognitive and social skills, <a href="Female%20education%23Islamic%20history">girls' education</a>, the environment, and health. The show was sponsored by its patron, Egyptian First Lady <a href="Suzanne%20Mubarak">Suzanne Mubarak</a>. A study conducted in 2004 showed that the show's efforts to educate Egyptian children about health were substantially influential.

South Africa aired "Takalani Sesame, "also in 2000; it focused on AIDS education with the creation of the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, who was declared a <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> "Champion for Children" in 2003. The show reached almost 70 percent of children in urban areas and almost 50 percent in rural areas, and its viewers had improvements in HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes, and communication. In 2007 it began airing in almost all of the country's official languages, and its Muppets were used in health educational campaigns. In 2008, the show began to focus on diversity within South Africa and technology. The show's tenth anniversary in 2010 was marked by a series of workshops in South Africa focusing on the future of the show and the needs of the country's children. Research conducted about the show's affects showed that viewers gained in four major areas: basic knowledge, blood safety, discrimination, and numeracy skills. They also improved in life skills, such as safety, sounds, nature, emotions, and self-esteem.

In 2003, "<a href="Hikayat%20Simsim">Hikayat Simsim</a> "premiered in <a href="Television%20in%20Jordan">Jordan</a>. According to its producers, its goal was to "promote respect in the face of conflict". The show also focused on literacy, numeracy, health and hygiene, emotions, road safety, and the environment. <a href="Television%20in%20Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> temporarily aired its first version of "Sesame Street", called "<a href="Koche%20Sesame">Koche Sesame</a>" in 2004, to help rebuild its educational system. Although this production filmed its own live-action films, it used Muppet segments filmed in the U.S., which were dubbed in <a href="Dari%20language">Dari</a>, one of the country's two main languages. The show's producers donated 400 education kits, which included a message from President <a href="Hamid%20Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a>, to schools, orphanages, and TV stations across the country. Its curriculum focused on encouraging awareness of other cultures, increasing opportunities for women and girls, and fostering children's interests in education.

In 2005, "Sisimpur" aired in Bangladesh. This co-production's goal was to improve school achievement and decrease drop-out rates for children before the third grade. This difficult co-production, which was beset by political difficulties and severe flooding that delayed production, was depicted in the 2006 documentary "The World According to Sesame Street". Also in 2005, the producers of the Kosovo co-production ("Rruga Sesam"/"Ulica Sezam") chose to present the languages of the region more evenly. Instead of showing words on screen, children were challenged to label objects verbally, thus learning that there are different ways to say the same thing. The Workshop worked in conjunction with UNICEF to produce this show, to aid in the peace process between Albanians and Serbs. One of its goals was to demonstrate to Albanian and Serbian children that their counterparts were like them.

In 2008, <a href="Telecommunications%20in%20Cambodia">Cambodia</a> produced "<a href="Sabai%20Sabai%20Sesame">Sabai Sabai Sesame</a>", a dubbed version of the original US show. It aired twice weekly, and emphasized basic literacy, numeracy, and social skills. <a href="Television%20in%20Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>'s production, which was broadcast throughout the UK but was "rooted in everyday life in Northern Ireland", was called "<a href="Sesame%20Tree">Sesame Tree</a>", and was set in and around a whimsical tree. The show's curriculum focused on mutual respect and understanding. Also in 2008, "<a href="Jalan%20Sesama">Jalan Sesama</a>", the <a href="Television%20in%20Indonesia">Indonesian</a> co-production, premiered; its focus was the country's rich diversity. <a href="Television%20in%20Denmark">Denmark</a> created "Sesamgade" in 2009, which contained elements of "Play With Me Sesame" and locally produced segments with <a href="Elmo">Elmo</a>.

<a href="Media%20in%20Nigeria">Nigeria</a> produced its own version of "Sesame Street", called "<a href="Sesame%20Square">Sesame Square</a>", in 2010. Previously, they aired the US version. Funded in part by a grant from the US government, the show focused on AIDS, <a href="mosquito%20net">malaria nets</a>, gender equality, and yams. It also featured the HIV-positive Muppet Kami from the South African co-production.

After an absence of ten years, and almost 30 years after the 1983 movie "<a href="Big%20Bird%20in%20China">Big Bird in China</a>", 53 eleven-minute episodes of "Sesame Street's Big Bird Looks at the World", filmed in <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a>, debuted in early 2011 in China. Inspired by the <a href="2008%20Sichuan%20earthquake">2008 Sichuan earthquake</a>, the program emphasized emergency preparedness. In the first week of December 2011, a <a href="Pashto%20language">Pashto</a> and Dari-language version called "<a href="Baghch-e-Simsim">Baghch-e-Simsim</a>" was launched in Afghanistan, and in the same month <a href="Television%20in%20Pakistan">Pakistan</a> began airing its own <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>-language version, called "<a href="SimSim%20Humara">SimSim Humara</a>", which was supposed to run for three years. In June 2012, the United States terminated funding for "SimSim Humara" due to serious allegations of corruption by the local Pakistani puppet theater working on the initiative.

Tech Tower

The Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans Administration Building, commonly known as Tech Tower, is a historic building and focal point of the central campus of the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> (Georgia Tech) in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, Georgia, United States.

Located at 225 <a href="North%20Avenue%20%28Atlanta%29">North Avenue</a> <a href="Cardinal%20direction">NW</a> in <a href="Midtown%20Atlanta">Midtown Atlanta</a>, it was erected in 1888 as the Academic Building, with classrooms to complement the hands-on training in the adjacent shop building. It was the second edifice completed on the Georgia Tech campus and it is the oldest surviving one.

Tech Tower has achieved local, cultural, and historical significance. Monuments and plaques commemorating philanthropy towards Georgia Tech adorn the building and surrounding landscape. The red brick, <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian-style</a> building is the architectural anchor of the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20Historic%20District">Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District</a>, a landmark of tradition and school spirit, and the present-day administrative hub of the Institute. It has been the site of many ceremonies and important events, including a visit by U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and its dedication in honor of <a href="Lettie%20Pate%20Whitehead%20Evans">Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans</a>, "Tech's greatest <a href="benefactor%20%28law%29">benefactor</a>."

Lighted signs spelling "TECH" hang on each of the four sides of the seven-story central tower, dominating the building's facade and visible from many parts of the Georgia Tech campus and surrounding area. Georgia Tech students have several times stolen the letter 'T' from one of these signs, a prank once tolerated but now strictly forbidden.

In 1887, the state of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> acquired of land from Atlanta pioneer <a href="Richard%20Peters%20%28Atlanta%29">Richard Peters</a> that would form the original campus of what was then called the Georgia School of Technology, as well as the site of its first two structures. The state hired the well-known architectural firm Bruce & Morgan to design an Academic Building, containing "ample accommodations in halls, offices, apparatus rooms, recitation and lecture rooms, <a href="drawing">free hand</a> and <a href="technical%20drawing">mechanical drawing</a> rooms, library and chapel," as well as a Shop Building, in which "<a href="boiler">boiler</a> and engine rooms, <a href="carpentry">wood shop</a>, <a href="machining">machine shop</a>, <a href="forge">forge room</a> and <a href="foundry">foundry</a>" were located.

Both buildings boasted towers and edifices of similar design. The complementary names and purposes of these buildings reflected the School's founding principles of valuing both <a href="theory">theory</a> and <a href="practice%20%28learning%20method%29">practice</a>, while their similar appearance emphasized the equal standing of these principles. Construction work, contracted by Angus McGilvray with his low bid of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>43,250 ($  in 2019), began with the Academic Building in June 1887; the building was completed in September 1888. The Shop Building, completed shortly afterward, was destroyed by fire in 1892 and rebuilt more modestly without a tower. Following this, the Academic Building, later known as Tech Tower, became the oldest building on the Georgia Tech campus, a distinction it continues to hold more than a century later.

On October 20, 1905, U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> visited the Georgia Tech campus. On the steps of Tech Tower, Roosevelt presented a speech about the importance of engineering education. He then shook hands with each of the 500 students present.

Georgia Tech's Class of 1922 installed the famous "TECH" signs on all four sides of Tech Tower in 1918, giving rise to the building's present nickname. Their purpose, as defined by the donors during their first year at Georgia Tech, was to "light the spirit of Tech to the <a href="cardinal%20direction">four points of the compass</a>." The signs were originally made of wood and painted white and gold – the Institute colors. In the 1930s, lightbulbs were affixed to the signs to illuminate them more effectively than the earlier ground-based spotlights. In 1949, the "TECH" signs were supplemented by <a href="neon%20sign">neon lighting</a> in metal frames.

In 1978, Tech Tower and the surrounding of the original campus were added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> as the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20Historic%20District">Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District</a>. Near the entrance to Tech Tower, a <a href="historical%20marker">historical marker</a> maintained by the <a href="Georgia%20Historical%20Society">Georgia Historical Society</a> commemorates this listing as well as the early history of the Georgia Tech campus.
On May 22, 1998, Tech Tower was officially renamed the Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans Administration Building in a ceremony presided over by Tech president <a href="G.%20Wayne%20Clough">G. Wayne Clough</a>. Although neither she nor her husbands attended Georgia Tech as a student, <a href="Lettie%20Pate%20Whitehead%20Evans">Lettie Pate Whitehead Evans</a> was a longtime benefactor of the Institute, contributing over $340 million through her philanthropic organization, the Lettie Pate Evans Foundation.

Tech Tower's continuous use since its completion in 1888 has required occasional maintenance and refurbishment. It underwent extensive <a href="renovation">renovation</a>s in 1965 with a focus on remodeling the building's interior layout. During this time, the library and chapel were replaced with modern office space and furnishings. In contrast, efforts directed towards the exterior of the building have aimed to preserve its historic appearance. A restoration project called the "Tech Tower Renovation" began in 1987, spearheaded by alumnus Eugene M. "Gene" Clary's gift of new copper shingles with which to replace Tech Tower's aging roof tiles. Clary first suggested gold-colored shingles, but <a href="John%20Patrick%20Crecine">John Patrick Crecine</a>, Georgia Tech's president at the time, insisted on copper shingles to match the building's original construction materials. One of these shingles and a small marker inside the Tech Tower entrance lobby commemorate Clary and his donation. Additional restoration of Tech Tower's exterior and the Georgia Institute of Technology Historic District, funded by the Class of 1950 and Class of 1975, began in 2000. As part of Phase I of the Georgia Tech Master Plan of 1997, the area was made "more <a href="pedestrian%23Pedestrianisation">pedestrian-friendly</a>" with the removal of access roads and the addition of landscaping improvements, benches, and other facilities. Further renovations to Tech Tower were completed during 2015-2016, which cost $7.5 million, and addressed fire, safety, and accessibility issues. These renovations were designed to improve occupant safety and comfort and also improve building energy efficiency.

Tech Tower is built in the <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> style with <a href="Romanesque%20Revival%20architecture">Romanesque Revival</a> influences. The building's original specifications, according to Georgia Tech's first "Annual Catalogue Announcement" published in 1889, are listed as wide and deep. It is constructed primarily of red brick and trimmed with <a href="granite">granite</a>. The <a href="gable">gable</a>d roof, originally <a href="terra%20cotta">terra cotta</a>, was later replaced by copper shingles. The main complex of the building stands four stories high plus a basement. The tower portion stands seven stories high and is topped with four lighted "TECH" signs (one on each side) and a high pitched roof. The main entrance to the building is accessed by ascending a small staircase and entering a small porch which forms the base of Tech Tower. Most of the building's windows are simple rectangular frames, with the exception of those on the third floor, which are arched. The entire complex sits on the crest of a tree-dotted hill, giving it the appearance of being larger than it actually is.

As the oldest building on the Georgia Tech campus, Tech Tower has accumulated a number of peripheral <a href="monument">monument</a>s and sites of interest over the years. Two walkways encircle the building, including the Tower Walk, donated by the Class of 1950 in 2000. Georgia Tech's first class memorial, a marble drinking fountain, was donated in 1911 by the Class of 1903 and is situated east of Tech Tower's main entrance. Also near the main entrance to Tech Tower is a <a href="marble">marble</a>d pair of benches donated by the Class of 1925 in memory of those who died in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. A few feet away stands a marbled bench memorial to Paul Howes Norcross, a 1902 Georgia Tech alumnus and former <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">ASCE</a> president who perished in the <a href="M.E.%20Norman">"Norman"</a> boat disaster of May 8, 1925. The headstone of <a href="Georgia%20Tech%20traditions%23Sideways%20the%20Dog">Sideways the dog</a> is located near Tech Tower's rear entrance, as is an informational placard detailing Tech Tower's early history, donated by the Class of 1932. A staircase donated by the <a href="ANAK%20Society">ANAK Society</a> in 1921 connects Tech Tower to the adjacent D. P. Savant Building via a continuous sidewalk. Finally, a steam-driven <a href="air%20compressor">air compressor</a>, colloquially known as the "steam engine," sits prominently at the top of the hill near Tech Tower as a reminder of the school's industrial roots.

As its official name suggests, Tech Tower is primarily used for <a href="academic%20administration">administrative</a> purposes. It houses the Office of the <a href="Registrar%20%28education%29">Registrar</a>, the Office of Capital Planning and Space Management (CPSM), the Internal Auditing Department, and offices for the Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning (CETL). In addition, the <a href="dean%20%28education%29">deans</a> of the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20College%20of%20Engineering">College of Engineering</a> and the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology%20College%20of%20Sciences">College of Sciences</a> have offices in Tech Tower.

Tech Tower is considered an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and of higher education in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the <a href="Atlanta%20metropolitan%20area">Atlanta metropolitan area</a>. "The Tower", Georgia Tech's undergraduate research journal, is named after Tech Tower. <a href="Kessler%20Campanile">Kessler Campanile</a>, a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide branding campaign in the mid-1990s, was designed to look like a modernized version of Tech Tower. The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.

Students have stolen the huge, symbolic letter 'T' on the Tech Tower's "TECH" signs a number of times. The 'T' is then returned at the halftime of the <a href="homecoming">homecoming</a> <a href="college%20football">football</a> game, and the students' achievement celebrated. Tradition dictates that the first 'T' to be stolen should be the one facing east, as this can most easily be seen from the <a href="Downtown%20Connector">Downtown Connector</a>. The groups of students responsible for 'T' thefts generally assume dramatic pseudonyms, such as the "Mystic Marauders" or the "Sneaky Four." Pervasive rumors of a detailed plan held in the Institute's archives to execute "the perfect T theft," crafted by an unnamed Georgia Tech <a href="fraternities%20and%20sororities">fraternity</a>, are apparently spurious.

The 'T' was first stolen in April 1969 by a secret group of Georgia Tech fraternity brothers calling themselves the "Magnificent Seven". Inspired by a similar prank that had taken place in 1968 at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, the students planned the theft as a means of commemorating Institute President <a href="Edwin%20D.%20Harrison">Edwin D. Harrison</a>'s retirement. The 'T' was returned several days later via helicopter at the behest of Atlanta mayor <a href="Ivan%20Allen%20Jr.">Ivan Allen</a>.

On the evening of November 6, 1997, the 'T's were nearly stolen from the north, south and west sides of Tech Tower by five students wielding hacksaws, tin snips, and <a href="rappelling">rappelling</a> equipment. The students were caught by Georgia Tech police acting on a tip provided by an anonymous informant. The stolen north 'T' was recovered in the back of a blue Ford Explorer that was parked at the Copper Kettle on Howell Mill Road, also in response to an anonymous tip. Each student was required to pay $2,446.75 in damages ($  in 2019) although criminal charges were not filed. The Georgia Tech Office of Facilities reinstalled the 'T' on January 31, 1998, 87 days after its attempted theft.

One of the most theatrical thefts of the 'T' occurred over the summer of 1999. The 'T' on the north face of Tech Tower was stolen by a group of "six or seven people" on the morning of June 3, 1999. The perpetrators wrote a letter detailing the theft to the editorial staff of "<a href="The%20Technique">The Technique</a>", Georgia Tech's student newspaper. The letter, an abridged version of which was subsequently printed in the summer issue of "The Technique", described the process of stealing the 'T' by lowering it via a rope and moving it to a secret location. The letter also included a photograph of the 'T' "on vacation" in <a href="Bath%20%28Berkeley%20Springs%29%2C%20West%20Virginia">Berkeley Springs, West Virginia</a>. Finally, the perpetrators indicated plans to return the 'T' during the Georgia Tech Homecoming Parade, according to tradition, as long as no criminal charges would be brought against them. The letter was signed by fictitious Georgia Tech alumnus <a href="George%20P.%20Burdell">George P. Burdell</a>. However, the Institute released a notice that those who stole the 'T' would be harshly punished, and therefore the 'T' remains to this day at an undisclosed location.

The replacement 'T' on the north face of Tech Tower was stolen on May 28, 2001 by three students, two of whom were found guilty of numerous conduct code violations by the Undergraduate Judiciary Cabinet and subsequently suspended. The students had successfully removed the 'T' from its mount but were caught in the act by authorities when the removal triggered an alarm. In October 2005, a replica of the 'T' was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.

Around midday on March 18, 2014, it was discovered that the north-facing 'T' had been stolen from Tech Tower. In this case, the thief admitted guilt after detectives approached him at his residence that afternoon, and was suspended through the following summer, while also having to pay a restitution fee and tuition to retake his nearly completed Spring 2014 classes. To handle this financial burden, the restitution fee alone totaling $14,823.98, a <a href="GoFundMe">GoFundMe</a> was created by a friend of the thief that was well known on campus, to assure its legitimacy, without revealing the thief's identity (the friend's name has since been removed from the post because of negative pressure from the GT administration).
The tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower has inspired <a href="copycat%20crimes">copycat crimes</a> involving other signage. During a Georgia Tech–<a href="North%20Carolina%20State%20University">NC State</a> <a href="college%20football">football</a> game on November 4, 2006, the second 'T' from a large banner mysteriously vanished from the upper deck of <a href="Carter%E2%80%93Finley%20Stadium">Carter–Finley Stadium</a> where it had been hanging. It was widely assumed across the Tech campus that the prank was pulled off by a group of Georgia Tech students in an <a href="Homage%20%28arts%29">homage</a> to the longstanding Tech Tower tradition; however, it is possible that the T in the banner came loose and fell to the stands below.
Another copy cat incident occurred some time after the 2012 <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Techs">football game with Virginia Tech</a> when vandals, believed to be Yellow Jacket fans, pried a T off of the sign in front of Virginia Tech's <a href="Lane%20Stadium">Lane Stadium</a>. The 'T' was later dropped off at night to the Georgia Tech Police Department. The Georgia Tech president returned it to the Virginia Tech president in September 2012 along with an apology.

Similar copycat crimes have occurred on the Georgia Tech campus. In late 2001, a group of Georgia Tech students calling itself the "Caldwell Liberation Army" stole 32 'T's from signs on 16 campus buildings over a period of two nights. The students, who were not caught, vandalized the signs to express their bitterness at being displaced from <a href="Caldwell%20Hall%20%28Georgia%20Tech%29">Caldwell Residence Hall</a> while renovations were taking place. In February 2006, it was noticed that small vinyl 'T' stickers were being stolen from informational signs located around the Georgia Tech campus, creating confusion for visitors and new students. According to the Georgia Tech Student Government Association (SGA), 'T' thefts across campus cost the Institute over $100,000 from 2010–11. The SGA discouraged these thefts, which they emphasized did not constitute a true Georgia Tech tradition: "The tradition is stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower – no other 'T's were ever a part of this tradition." The campaign drew national press coverage.

The Georgia Tech administration's position on stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower has varied over the years. When the 'T' was first stolen in 1969, interim Institute President Vernon Crawford was so upset he considered canceling classes until it was returned. Afterwards, subsequent presidents opted to <a href="turn%20a%20blind%20eye">turn a blind eye</a> to the practice, with one president, <a href="John%20Patrick%20Crecine">John Patrick Crecine</a>, going so far as to endorse it.

Today, stealing the 'T' is prohibited and is officially punishable with expulsion, although this has not happened in practice. After a Georgia Tech visitor was accidentally killed while climbing the <a href="Alexander%20Memorial%20Coliseum">Alexander Memorial Coliseum</a> in 1999, Institute President <a href="G.%20Wayne%20Clough">G. Wayne Clough</a> banned stealing of the 'T' and the climbing of any Institute building, due to the risk of fatal falls and the potential for damage to the building. Clough also expressed concern over the "incredibly expensive liability litigation" Georgia Tech could face in the event of an accident. To discourage climbing, security features such as pressure-sensitive roof tiling, <a href="optical%20fiber">fiber optic cabling</a> running throughout the letters, and an audible alarm have been added to the 'T' to help prevent its theft.
In 2011, the Georgia Tech Student Government Association (SGA) launched a "Keep the 'T' in Tech" campaign to discourage thefts of 'T's from signage around the campus. The week-long campaign took place from September 26–30 and included an online petition to be published in "The Technique", an open forum for discussing the issue, an amnesty day for returning stolen 'T's, and "Live the True Tradition," an evening event focused on the tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower.

Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express

Agatha Christie: Murder on the Orient Express is a 2006 <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> developed by AWE Productions and published by <a href="The%20Adventure%20Company">The Adventure Company</a> for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. It is the second installment in The Adventure Company's "<a href="Agatha%20Christie%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Agatha Christie series</a>". The setting is five years before the events in "", with a largely unrelated storyline. The plot follows an amateur sleuth, Antoinette Marceau, and her investigation of a murder with twelve possible suspects aboard the <a href="Orient%20Express">Orient Express</a>, which has been blocked by an avalanche in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> during 1934. She is aided by famous detective <a href="Hercule%20Poirot">Hercule Poirot</a>.

"Murder on the Orient Express" retains the main plot elements of <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>'s <a href="Murder%20on%20the%20Orient%20Express">novel of the same name</a>. An additional ending is presented in the game which differs from the conclusion of Christie's novel. As with "And Then There Were None", Christie's novel is bundled with the game. Some reviewers of "Murder on the Orient Express" criticized the game because of the repetitive nature of tasks the player must complete, and also complained about the inefficient and cumbersome inventory system. Others have praised it for improved graphics compared to "And Then There Were None", as well as convincing <a href="voice%20acting">voice acting</a> and audio effects. "Murder on the Orient Express" is followed by "", the third installment in the "Agatha Christie series".

"Murder on the Orient Express" is the first game in the "Agatha Christie series" to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. <a href="David%20Suchet">David Suchet</a>, whose portrayal of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series "<a href="Agatha%20Christie%27s%20Poirot">Agatha Christie's Poirot</a>", was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some have criticized the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game do not reflect the genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.

The player can navigate and interact with the game's environment, mainly carriages on the <a href="Orient%20Express">Orient Express</a>, through use of a context-sensitive <a href="Cursor%20%28user%20interface%29">cursor</a>. The cursor changes when it is placed over an item with which the player can interact, and can be used to talk to other characters, listen to other characters' conversations, look around the environment, and move. The player can walk to a location with a single click, and run to a location with a double-click. Double-clicking on the edge of the screen instantly takes the player to the next screen. There is a map of the train in the game's interface at the top of the screen, and once each carriage has been unlocked, the player can click on any part of the map and instantly be transported to that location, saving the player from having to travel through the train screen by screen. Another accessible feature is an objectives menu interface which states the general tasks the player should be attempting to complete. This menu is designed to guide players in the right direction without giving any explicit hints.

"Murder on the Orient Express", as with its predecessor, features an inventory system. There are several components of the inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a scrapbook, and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates that there is something relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, "Murder on the Orient Express" does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.

A large portion of gameplay in "Murder on the Orient Express" has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which may lead to the murderer. Other tasks the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms a major part of the puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.

A unique feature of "Murder on the Orient Express" is Poirot, who serves as a hint system for the duration of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player has trouble once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.

"Murder on the Orient Express" is set in the year 1934. The game is initially begins in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, while the remaining majority occurs within the carriages of the Orient Express, when it is blocked by an avalanche in <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. However, the player has some opportunities to venture outside the train into the snowy exterior environment.

The sole <a href="player%20character">player character</a> is Antoinette Marceau, an employee of the <a href="Compagnie%20Internationale%20des%20Wagons-Lits">Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits</a>. She is aided throughout her investigation by famous detective Hercule Poirot, as well as his friend Dr. Constantine. Ten of the thirteen murder suspects from Christie's novel are included in the game adaption. These suspects are Count and Countess Andrenyi, Colonel Arbuthnot, Mary Debenham, Princess Dragomiroff, Greta Ohlsson, Antonio Foscarelli, Cyrus Hardman, Caroline Hubbard, Hector McQueen, and several staff on the Orient Express. The victim is Samuel Ratchett. In total, there are twenty characters featured in the game.

The game opens on June 29, 1924 at an unidentified farmhouse in <a href="New%20Paltz%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">New Paltz, New York</a>. <a href="NYPD">NYPD</a> officers arrive at the farmhouse and surround it before unloading. After a brief gun battle, two men walk out of the house and surrender.

The story then shifts 10 years later, in November 1934, in <a href="Istanbul%2C%20Turkey">Istanbul, Turkey</a>. The game's protagonist, a devoted junior clerk at the Istanbul offices of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits, Antoinette Marceau, receives instructions from her employer Marcel Bouc, the Director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagon-Lits, to attend to the wishes of his good friend Hercule Poirot. He tasks Marceau with ensuring that Poirot's journey on the Orient Express is favourable. Marceau begins her adventure in <a href="Sirkeci%20Terminal">Sirkeci Terminal</a>, Istanbul, where she becomes acquainted with Poirot, whom she admires, as well as the other characters who later accompany her aboard the Orient Express.

Soon after the train departs Istanbul, its passage is blocked by an avalanche, stopping it. The sudden stop causes Poirot to fall out of his bunk and sprain his ankle, rendering him bed-ridden. Soon after, Ratchett is found murdered, with twelve possible suspects to the murder, and the investigation begins. Marceau is challenged by Poirot to find the solution to the murder and do the "legwork" by gathering clues.

Marceau splits her time between seeing to the duties of the train (such as helping to fix the heat in the engine), interviewing passengers about the murder, and examining the train and surrounding area for clues. She travels to several additional locations that Poirot does not travel to in the book, such as the engine, the baggage car, and an old shack outside of the snowed-in train. Additionally, a sabotaged <a href="Amateur%20radio">ham radio</a> is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Barnaby Lewes, a young friend of Poirot's, and ask him to research the passengers.

Similar to the novel, Ratchett is revealed to be Cassetti, the criminal mastermind behind the Daisy Armstrong kidnapping. Each of the passengers on the train as well as the conductor are connected in some way to the Armstrong family, each with a motive for murder. Additionally, each person had an alibi corroborated by other passengers.

When Marceau believes she has solved the murder, Poirot gathers the passengers and poses a series of questions to Marceau about the clues found. He goes on to reveal three possible solutions to Ratchett's death. The first two are identical to the novel. In the first, Poirot suggests that an assassin may have come aboard the train during the night, killed Cassetti, and then escaped the train, which is supported by evidence such as a bloodied stiletto with fingerprints that do not match anyone on the train. The second solution pieces together a number of clues showing that all of the train's passengers and the conductor, Pierre Michel, are responsible for the murder, to which they confess.

Unique to this adaptation of the story, Marceau finds additional clues such as a crate full of living accommodations in the security vault of the baggage compartment and a picture of Michel's family, despite Barnaby Lewes reporting that the man has none. After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to the shock of the other passengers, and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house. But when he and his brother, Jeffrey, refused to kill Daisy, Cassetti decided to do the job himself. In doing so, he gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy. Afterwards, Perkinson and his wife fled to France and raised Daisy as their own daughter.

Perkinson reveals that, after his wife's death, he had sought out Pierre Michel, and that Michel had told him of the plan to murder Cassetti. However, in spite of his own loss, he was too afraid to go through with it himself. Since the others had never seen Michel in person, Perkinson volunteered to impersonate Michel and stab Cassetti on his behalf so that he could get revenge for Teresa's death. He then reveals that the now 13-year-old Daisy Armstrong has been hidden in the baggage compartment of the train during the journey, having boarded at Belgrade disguised as an attendant. Daisy then comes out to meet the people who thought she was dead. Poirot, Dr. Constantine, and Marceau decide to tell the police officials the first solution – that an unknown assassin came aboard the train, killed Rachett, and left. The passengers are overjoyed that Daisy is alive and Poirot concludes that it is "a most satisfactory solution indeed."

"Murder on the Orient Express" was announced in May 2006, as the second installment in The Adventure Company's "Agatha Christie series". As with the game's predecessor, "And Then There Were None", "Murder on the Orient Express" was developed by AWE Productions, in collaboration with producer The Adventure Company. The production team remained largely the same, with Lee Sheldon reprising his role as Lead Designer, and Scott Nixon from AWE Productions reprising his position as Managing Director.

The Adventure Company and <a href="Chorion%20%28company%29">Chorion</a>, the owners of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel "Murder on the Orient Express", widely considered the author's "<a href="masterpiece">magnum opus</a>", as the basis for the next game in the "Agatha Christie series". AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with "And Then There Were None", and generally had fewer complaints with "Murder on the Orient Express", as opposed to its predecessor.

Mike Adams, the producer of "Murder on the Orient Express", was extremely determined to have <a href="David%20Suchet">David Suchet</a> as the voice actor for Poirot, a major character in the game. Nixon thought that Suchet had become so intertwined with the character of Poirot, after his success with the television series "<a href="Agatha%20Christie%27s%20Poirot">Agatha Christie's Poirot</a>", that it would be hard to imagine someone else doing Poirot's voice without constantly being compared to Suchet. Nixon described the situation as a <a href="Catch-22%20%28logic%29">catch-22</a>, saying that he "worried about someone coming in and doing a Suchet impression instead of a unique rendition of Poirot, yet the more the voice strays from Suchet's version, the more people will wish it was Suchet doing it!" Another reason for the development team's determination to have Suchet aboard was that they thought he would spur the other voice actors in the game, such as <a href="Vanessa%20Marshall">Vanessa Marshall</a> who portrayed Antoinette Marceau, to step up and compete with Suchet's skillful portrayal of Poirot. Fairly late in the game's development, Suchet agreed to do the voice acting. He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long. Adams expressed pride at having succeeded in convincing Suchet to do voice acting for "Murder on the Orient Express", and said that his skillful voice acting would bring "tremendous excitement and authenticity" to the game.

As with "And Then There Were None", Sheldon introduced a new character to the plot of "Murder on the Orient Express", who was not present in Christie's novel, in order to fulfill the role of a player character and protagonist. The character, Antoinette Marceau, is described by Sheldon as an amalgam of two characters from the novel. These were Poirot's friend who ran the Orient Express, Marcel Bouc, and a young soldier who is present in both the novel and the <a href="Murder%20on%20the%20Orient%20Express%20%281974%20film%29">film version</a> of the story, who shepherds Poirot to Istanbul. Sheldon stated that he did not want to create entirely new protagonists for the Christie games, but rather preferred to draw from sources in Christie's novels to piece together the games' protagonists. Sheldon also addressed concerns from several early previews of the game, which asked why the player could not actually play as Poirot. He explained the choice of Marceau as the protagonist, saying "the reason for choosing Marceau over Poirot as the protagonist is that most of the fun of Poirot is seeing what he is up to, watching how he acts and solves things. I've always thought the more interesting character was the '<a href="John%20Watson%20%28Sherlock%20Holmes%29">Watson</a>' character rather than the <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> character."

To make Poirot an even more integral part of "Murder on the Orient Express", Sheldon made him into an elaborate hint system. After players complained about a sense of aimlessness in "And Then There Were None", which arose whilst they tried to find a trigger to begin the next section of gameplay, Sheldon made Poirot an "oracle of sorts," who can provide help whenever the player is stuck or unsure of what to do next.

The development team decided that, as with "And Then There Were None", they would change Christie's original ending for "Murder on the Orient Express". The aim of the developers was to create games that would not only appeal to casual gamers, but also to Christie fans. As nearly all Christie fans have read "Murder on the Orient Express", and know the solution, and considering that the novel was to be included with the game, the developers decided that the ending needed to be changed. The novel has two solutions – one being what appears to be happening and the other being what is actually occurring – and the developers aimed to develop a third solution which drew on these two solutions and still surprised the player. Lee Sheldon admitted that his variation to the ending of "And Then There Were None" received some criticism, and said that in "Murder on the Orient Express" changing the ending was even harder because of the sheer fame of the book and its solution. He also expressed his hatred of adaptations of older material which make fun of that time period, and said that he was trying to stay as faithful to Christie's work and time era as possible.

A major difference between "And Then There Were None" and "Murder on the Orient Express" that Sheldon pointed out was that in the former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately try to find a way to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In "Murder on the Orient Express", the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from "Murder on the Orient Express", as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.

Several graphical improvements were made to "Murder on the Orient Express" over "And Then There Were None". These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers to use the same animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In "And Then There Were None", characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in "Murder on the Orient Express", characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.

Research was a major component of the developmental stages of "Murder on the Orient Express". Most of the research was focused on Yugoslavia in 1934, the game's setting. Sheldon focused on the political and scientific situation of this era, and explained his intensive research, saying "all of the puzzles have to be contextual. They all have to either help character, help story or define period." The developers also drew influence from a train museum outside <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami</a> with an original <a href="Pullman%20%28car%20or%20coach%29">Pullman carriage</a> - the same as the carriages used on the Orient Express in the 1930s. The museum also contained a <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a> similar to the one the developers were looking for. The developers ended up using the train museum, several books about the Orient Express, the 1974 film version of Christie's novel, and the internet as research resources. With "Murder on the Orient Express" being the first Poirot game produced, Sheldon was careful that the game fitted into Christie's timeline of Poirot's exploits. The television series often took liberties with the time in which stories were set, but Sheldon was determined to keep everything in strict accordance with Christie's work. There are several references in the game to Poirot's earlier cases, all of which are chronologically accurate. This was partly so that Sheldon could use the culture of specific eras of time, and also so that in the future other Poirot-based games will be chronologically accurate.

The official site for "Murder on the Orient Express" was unveiled in September 2006, and contains screenshots, character biographies and photos, environment artwork, trailers, demos, music, wallpaper and contests. "Murder on the Orient Express" was released on November 14, 2006 in North America. The Adventure Company held a launch party for the gaming press two days after the game was shipped. Among the guests were the development team of "Murder on the Orient Express", and actors portraying the game's various characters. The demo for "Murder on the Orient Express" was released on December 20, 2006, and contained a small portion of the game which has the player exploring the train.

Since its release, "Murder on the Orient Express" has received widely differing reviews. <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> gave it a score of 65.22%, while <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave it 60 out of 100.

An aspect of gameplay in "Murder on the Orient Express" which received largely negative reactions was the repetitive nature of many tasks the player must complete. 2404 accused the game of reducing Christie's novel, and the game, into a series of repetitive and secretarial tasks, such as collecting fingerprints, passports, and other random items. The site further went on to say that the player is made to feel "like a secretary for Poirot." Game Over Online agreed with this view, saying that much of the game consisted of "goofy little errands" such as completing tasks for characters and mindlessly searching for objects. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> provides an example of this, by saying that at one point in the game the player is required to go through each cabin checking the shoe sizes of the various passengers' shoes to check if one matches shoe prints outside the train. The inventory system featured in "Murder on the Orient Express" has also received significant criticism. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> complained that instead of being able to find item combinations through trial and error in the main screen, the player is forced to drag items to a separate screen, leading to tedious gameplay. Some reviewers, in contrast, praised the inventory system, with Quandary calling it intuitive, and easy for players to organize. The puzzles in "Murder on the Orient Express" received positive responses from some reviewers. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> commented favourably on the relatively small number of puzzles in the game, saying that they are integrated fairly well within the plot, and are not excessively difficult. The review went on to say that later puzzles in the game often rely more heavily on inventory combinations, but are still reasonably satisfying to solve. Game Over Online, in comparison, accused the game of giving the player too little information to solve puzzles, and also called the puzzles convoluted. The choice of the developers of "Murder on the Orient Express" to use Antoinette Marceau, rather than Poirot, as the protagonist and player character was criticized by some. 2404 disapproved of the choice, accusing the developers of not fully utilizing the talent of David Suchet, arguably the most famous and successful portrayer of Poirot. The reviewer even went so far as to tell AWE Productions to "make use of talent like David Suchet when you've got it." Like its predecessor, "Murder on the Orient Express" was criticized for diverging from Christie's original ending. <a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a> called the new ending "a little too contrived for the game's good." 2404 also disapproved of the ending, commenting that it goes off in too much of a Hollywood direction, and that the original ending is much better and a far more satisfying conclusion.

"Murder on the Orient Express" received some praise for graphical improvements over its predecessor. Among the aspects of the game which received positive reactions were the game's environments. <a href="Just%20Adventure">Just Adventure</a> called the game environments "head and shoulders above "And Then There Were None"," describing the train's carriages on the Orient Express as oozing with elegance, and a faithful and accurate recreation of the 1930s. The site criticized the game for suffering graphically in later stages, but praised it overall for improving on the graphics of "And Then There Were None". Game Chronicles was less enthusiastic, calling the graphics above average, but standard fare for a current adventure game. Character models were another aspect of "Murder on the Orient Express" which received positive attention. Quandary described the character modelling as much improved from "And Then There Were None", and while still a tinge woody, "all the characters feel as if they just stepped out of the book." Adventure Gamers called the characters "some of the best seen in recent adventure games," saying that each character has a unique design and costume perfect for the game's setting. The reviewer also pointed out several small touches added to the characters, such as the main character shivering when she is outside the train in the cold weather, and also brushing lint off her clothing while waiting for the player to decide what to do next. Adventure Gamers also complimented AWE Productions for lighting effects in the game, and for creating a "very soft glow to the scenes, which give a much more lifelike look to the characters." IGN agreed that the interior of the Orient Express is quite sharp, but complained that character models lack detail and are animated awkwardly. Another complaint from IGN was that the compression used for cutscenes causes the animations to look "washed out and blocky," and that this problem continues as the cutscenes are noticeably pixelated throughout "Murder on the Orient Express".

An aspect of "Murder on the Orient Express" which many reviewers praised was the game's audio. The voice acting in particular gained widespread positive reviews. GameSpot called the voice acting excellent, with the voice actors bringing the characters to life, thanks largely to David Suchet as Poirot. IGN also called the voice acting well done, despite a few characters sounding artificial. Music in the game was positively reviewed by 2404, who said that it was tense at moments, but probably could have been played more frequently throughout the game. 2404 also praised the game for providing realistic sound effects, such as noises coming from the Orient Express itself, and other environmental noises such as howling wind. IGN, in contrast, heavily criticized the game for a lack of background music, and simplistic and monotonous sound effects.

"Murder on the Orient Express" was used as a learning tool during a study on learner autonomy in video games. This study took Greek high school students and had them involved in several tests and evaluations at several different points of the study.

In Rainbows

In Rainbows is the seventh <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by English <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>. It was self-released on 10 October 2007 as a <a href="pay%20what%20you%20want">pay-what-you-want</a> <a href="Music%20download">download</a>, followed by a physical release internationally by <a href="XL%20Recordings">XL Recordings</a> in December 2007 and in the United States on 1 January 2008 by <a href="TBD%20Records">TBD Records</a>. It was Radiohead's first release after their recording contract with <a href="EMI">EMI</a> ended with their previous album "<a href="Hail%20to%20the%20Thief">Hail to the Thief</a>" (2003).

Radiohead worked on "In Rainbows" for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In 2006, after their initial recording sessions with new producer <a href="Spike%20Stent">Spike Stent</a> proved fruitless, the band toured Europe and North America performing "In Rainbows" material before re-enlisting longtime producer <a href="Nigel%20Godrich">Nigel Godrich</a>. The album is more personal than previous Radiohead albums, with singer <a href="Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</a> describing most of the songs as his versions of "seduction songs". Radiohead incorporated a variety of musical styles and instruments, using <a href="Electronic%20musical%20instrument">electronic instruments</a>, <a href="classical%20music">string arrangements</a>, <a href="piano">piano</a>, and the <a href="ondes%20Martenot">ondes Martenot</a>.

The album's pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines around the world and sparked debate about implications for the music industry. The physical release debuted at number 1 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and the <a href="Billboard%20200">US "Billboard" 200</a>, and had sold over three million copies worldwide by October 2008. The album received critical acclaim and was ranked one of the best albums of 2007 and of the decade by various publications. It won two <a href="51st%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Boxed%20or%20Special%20Limited%20Edition%20Package">Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package</a>. In 2012, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" placed "In Rainbows" at number 336 on their updated list of the <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>.

In 2004, after finishing the world tour in support of their sixth studio album "<a href="Hail%20to%20the%20Thief">Hail to the Thief</a>" (2003), Radiohead went on hiatus. As "Hail to the Thief" was the last album released on Radiohead's six-album contract with <a href="EMI">EMI</a>, the band had no contractual obligation to release new material. According to the "New York Times," in 2006, Radiohead was "by far the world's most popular unsigned band". Drummer <a href="Philip%20Selway">Philip Selway</a> said: "It was definitely time to take a break. There was still a desire amongst us to make music, but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected. And we'd come to the end of our contract, which gives you a natural point to look back over at what you've achieved as a band." Singer and songwriter <a href="Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</a> worked on his first solo album, "<a href="The%20Eraser">The Eraser</a>" (2006), and multi-instrumentalist <a href="Jonny%20Greenwood">Jonny Greenwood</a> composed his first solo works, the soundtracks "<a href="Bodysong%20%28album%29">Bodysong</a>" (2004) and "<a href="There%20Will%20Be%20Blood%20%28soundtrack%29">There Will Be Blood</a>" (2007).

In March 2005, Radiohead began writing and recording new music in their Oxfordshire studio without their longtime producer <a href="Nigel%20Godrich">Nigel Godrich</a>. Guitarist <a href="Ed%20O%27Brien">Ed O'Brien</a> said they chose to work without Godrich to "get out of the comfort zone ... we've been working together for 10 years, and we all love one another too much". Bassist <a href="Colin%20Greenwood">Colin Greenwood</a> later denied this, saying Godrich had been busy working with <a href="Charlotte%20Gainsbourg">Charlotte Gainsbourg</a> and <a href="Beck">Beck</a>.

At the Ether Festival in July 2005, Greenwood and Yorke performed a version of the future "In Rainbows" track "Weird Fishes/Arpeggi" with the <a href="London%20Sinfonietta">London Sinfonietta</a> orchestra and the <a href="Arab%20Orchestra%20of%20Nazareth">Arab Orchestra of Nazareth</a>. Regular recording sessions began in August 2005, with Radiohead updating fans on their progress intermittently on their new <a href="blog">blog</a>, Dead Air Space. The sessions were slow, and the band struggled to regain confidence; according to Yorke, "we spent a long time in the studio just not going anywhere, wasting our time, and that was really, really frustrating." O'Brien said the band considered splitting up, but kept working "because when you got beyond all the shit and the bollocks, the core of these songs were really good". They attributed their slow progress to a lack of momentum after their break and the lack of deadline and producer.

In December 2005, Radiohead asked producer <a href="Spike%20Stent">Spike Stent</a>, who had worked with artists including <a href="U2">U2</a> and <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk">Björk</a>, to help them work through their material. O'Brien told "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>": "Spike listened to the stuff we'd been self-producing. These weren't demos, they’d been recorded in proper studios, and he said, 'The sounds aren't good enough.'" The collaboration with Stent was unsuccessful and ended in April 2006. 

In an effort to break the deadlock, Radiohead decided to tour for the first time since 2004. They performed in Europe and North America in May and June 2006, and returned to Europe for several festivals in August, performing many new songs. According to Yorke, "We basically had all these half-formed songs, and we just had to get it together. And rather than it being a nightmare, it was really, really good fun, because suddenly everyone is being spontaneous and no one's self-conscious because you're not in the studio ... It felt like being 16 again." 

After the tour, Radiohead re-enlisted Godrich, who, according to Yorke, "gave us a walloping kick up the arse". In October 2006, recording started at <a href="Tottenham%2C%20Wiltshire">Tottenham House</a> in <a href="Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire">Marlborough, Wiltshire</a>, a <a href="country%20house">country house</a> scouted by Godrich where Radiohead worked for three weeks. The band members lived in caravans, as the building was in a state of disrepair; Yorke described it as "derelict in the stricter sense of the word, where there's holes in the floor, rain coming through the ceilings, half the window panes missing ... There were places you just basically didn't go. It definitely had an effect. It had some pretty strange vibes." The sessions were productive, and the band recorded "<a href="Jigsaw%20Falling%20into%20Place">Jigsaw Falling into Place</a>" and "<a href="Bodysnatchers%20%28song%29">Bodysnatchers</a>". In October, Yorke wrote on Dead Air Space that Radiohead had "started the record properly now ... starting to get somewhere I think. Finally."

In December 2006, sessions took place at <a href="Halswell%20House">Halswell House</a>, <a href="Taunton">Taunton</a> and Godrich's Hospital Studios in <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>, where the band recorded "Videotape" and "<a href="Nude%20%28song%29">Nude</a>". In January 2007, Radiohead resumed recording in their Oxfordshire studio and started to post photos, lyrics, videos and samples of new songs on Dead Air Space. In June, having wrapped up recording, Godrich posted clips of songs on Dead Air Space.

Excluding "Last Flowers", which Yorke recorded in the "Eraser" sessions, the "In Rainbows" sessions produced 16 songs. After the 56-minute, 14-track "Hail to the Thief", Radiohead wanted their seventh album to be concise. They settled on ten songs, saving the rest for the limited edition. The album was <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastered</a> by <a href="Bob%20Ludwig">Bob Ludwig</a> in July 2007 at Gateway Mastering, New York City.

"In Rainbows" incorporates elements of <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a>, <a href="experimental%20rock">experimental rock</a>, and <a href="art%20pop">art pop</a>. The opening track, "15 Step", features a handclap rhythm inspired by "<a href="Fuck%20the%20Pain%20Away">Fuck the Pain Away</a>" by <a href="Peaches%20%28musician%29">Peaches</a>. Radiohead planned to record handclaps by a group of children from the Matrix Music School & Arts Centre in Oxford; when the clapping proved "not quite good enough", they decided to record the children cheering instead.

Radiohead recorded a version of "Nude" during the "OK Computer" sessions, but discarded it. The "OK Computer" version was inspired by <a href="Al%20Green">Al Green</a>, and featured a <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond organ</a>, a "straighter" feel, and different lyrics. During the early sessions for "In Rainbows", Colin Greenwood wrote a new <a href="bassline">bassline</a> for the song, which, according to Godrich, "transformed it from something very straight into something that had much more of a rhythmic flow".

Radiohead performed a song with the working title of "Reckoner" in 2001. working on the song in the "In Rainbows "sessions, they abandoned the original material and created a new song with the same name. Yorke released the song originally known as "Reckoner" as a solo single, "<a href="Feeling%20Pulled%20Apart%20by%20Horses%20/%20The%20Hollow%20Earth">Feeling Pulled Apart by Horses</a>", in 2009.

"Bodysnatchers", a song Yorke described as sounding like <a href="Wolfmother">Wolfmother</a> and "<a href="Neu%21">Neu!</a> meets dodgy <a href="Psychedelic%20rock">hippy rock</a>", was recorded when he was in a period of "<a href="hyperactivity">hyperactive</a> <a href="mania">mania</a>". On "All I Need", Jonny Greenwood wanted to capture the <a href="white%20noise">white noise</a> generated by a band playing loudly in a room, a sound which never occurs in the studio. His solution was to have a <a href="string%20section">string section</a> play every note of the <a href="musical%20scale">scale</a>, blanketing the <a href="frequency">frequencies</a>.

Yorke described the process of composing "Videotape" as "absolute agony", stating that the song "went through every possible parameter". One day, Yorke left the studio, returning to find that Godrich and Jonny Greenwood had stripped the song down to the version found on the album, a minimal piano ballad.

Yorke said that the "In Rainbows" lyrics are based on "that anonymous fear thing, sitting in traffic, thinking, 'I'm sure I'm supposed to be doing something else' ... it's similar to "<a href="OK%20Computer">OK Computer</a>" in a way. It's much more terrifying." At the same time, Yorke felt "there's very little anger in "In Rainbows". It's in no way political, or, at least, doesn't feel that way to me. It very much explores the ideas of transience. It starts in one place and ends somewhere completely different." In another interview, Yorke said the album was "about the fucking panic of realising you're going to die! And that any time soon [I could] possibly [have] a heart attack when I next go for a run."

<a href="Ed%20O%27Brien">Ed O'Brien</a> described the lyrics as "universal. There wasn't a political agenda. It's being human." The song "Bodysnatchers" is inspired by <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> <a href="ghost%20story">ghost stories</a>, the 1972 novel "<a href="The%20Stepford%20Wives">The Stepford Wives</a>" and Yorke's feeling of "your physical consciousness trapped without being able to connect fully with anything else." "Jigsaw Falling into Place" is about a set of observations and different experiences, partly of the chaos witnessed by Yorke when he used to go out on the weekend in Oxford. Yorke said "The lyrics are quite caustic—the idea of 'before you're comatose' or whatever, drinking yourself into oblivion and getting fucked-up to forget ... [there] is partly this elation. But there's a much darker side."

The "In Rainbows" artwork was designed by <a href="Stanley%20Donwood">Stanley Donwood</a>, who has worked with Yorke to design Radiohead's album art since 1994. Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album, which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork, and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final album artwork. Donwood experimented with <a href="Etching">photographic etching</a>, putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper, creating images influenced by <a href="NASA">NASA</a> space photography. He originally planned to explore suburban life, but realised it did not fit the album, saying "it's a sensual record and I wanted to do something more organic." Describing the album cover, Donwood said: "It's very colourful—I've finally embraced colour! It's a <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a> but it is very toxic, it's more like the sort of one you'd see in a puddle." The band decided not to release the cover for the digital release, preferring to hold it back for the physical release. The limited edition includes a booklet containing additional artwork by Donwood.

On 1 October 2007, Jonny Greenwood announced Radiohead's seventh album on Radiohead's blog, writing: "Well, the new album is finished, and it's coming out in 10 days; we've called it "In Rainbows"." The post contained a link to inrainbows.com, where users could pre-order an MP3 version of the album for any amount they wanted, including £0—a landmark use of the <a href="pay-what-you-want">pay-what-you-want</a> model for music sales. Colin Greenwood explained the internet release as a way of avoiding the "regulated playlists" and "straitened formats" of radio and TV, ensuring listeners around the world would experience the music at the same time, and preventing leaks in advance of a physical release.

For the "In Rainbows" download, Radiohead employed the network provider <a href="PacketExchange">PacketExchange</a> to bypass public internet <a href="Server%20%28computing%29">servers</a>, using a less-trafficked private network. The download was packaged as a <a href="ZIP%20%28file%20format%29">ZIP</a> file containing the album's ten tracks encoded in a 160 <a href="Kilobit%20per%20second%23Kilobit%20per%20second">kbit/s</a> <a href="Digital%20rights%20management">DRM-free</a> <a href="MP3">MP3</a> format. The staggered online release began at about 5:30am <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">GMT</a> on 10 October 2007. On 10 December, the download was removed.

Fans could also order a limited "discbox" edition from inrainbows.com, containing the album on CD and two 12" heavyweight <a href="Gramophone%20record">45 rpm</a> vinyl records with artwork and lyric booklets, plus an <a href="enhanced%20CD">enhanced CD</a> with eight additional tracks, digital photos and artwork, packaged in a hardcover book and <a href="slipcase">slipcase</a>. The limited edition was shipped from December 2007. In June 2009, Radiohead made the second "In Rainbows" disc available for download on their website for £6.

Radiohead ruled out an internet-only distribution for fear that some fans would not have internet access. "In Rainbows" was released on CD and vinyl in Japan by <a href="Bertelsmann%20Music%20Group">BMG</a> on 26 December 2007, in Australia on 29 December 2007 by <a href="Remote%20Control%20Records">Remote Control Records</a>, and in the United States and Canada on 1 January 2008 by <a href="ATO%20Records">ATO</a> imprint <a href="TBD%20Records">TBD Records</a> and <a href="MapleMusic%20Recordings">MapleMusic</a>/<a href="Fontana%20Distribution">Fontana</a> respectively. 

Elsewhere, the album was released on 31 December 2007 by independent record label <a href="XL%20Recordings">XL Recordings</a>, which had released Yorke's solo album "The Eraser". The CD release came in a cardboard package containing the CD, lyric booklet, and several stickers that could be placed on the blank <a href="jewel%20case">jewel case</a> to create cover art. "In Rainbows" was the first Radiohead album available for download in several digital music stores, such as the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> and <a href="Amazon%20MP3">Amazon MP3</a>. On 10 June 2016, it was added to the free streaming service <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a>.

Radiohead retained ownership of the <a href="sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction">recordings</a> and <a href="musical%20composition">compositions</a> for "In Rainbows". The download and limited editions of the album were self-released; for the physical release, Radiohead licensed the music to record labels. Licensing agreements for all releases were managed by the band's publisher, <a href="Warner/Chappell%20Music">Warner Chappell Music Publishing</a>.

The pay-what-you-want release, the first for a major act, made headlines worldwide and sparked debate about the implications for the music industry. According to "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>", the release was "hailed as a revolution in the way major bands sell their music", and the media's reaction was "almost overwhelmingly positive". "Time" called it "easily the most important release in the recent history of the music business" and <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that "for the beleaguered recording business Radiohead has put in motion the most audacious experiment in years". The "<a href="NME">NME</a>" wrote that "the music world seemed to judder several rimes off its axis", and praised the fact that everyone, from fans to critics, had access to the album at the same time on release day: "the kind of moment of togetherness you don’t get very often." Singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a> of <a href="U2">U2</a> praised Radiohead as "courageous and imaginative in trying to figure out some new relationship with their audience".

The release also drew criticism. <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> of <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a> thought it did not go far enough, calling it "very much a bait and switch, to get you to pay for a MySpace-quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale". Reznor independently released his sixth album "<a href="Ghosts%20I-IV">Ghosts I-IV</a>" under a <a href="Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a> licence the following year. Singer <a href="Lily%20Allen">Lily Allen</a> called the release "arrogant", saying: "[Radiohead have] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" In the "<a href="The%20Guardian">Guardian</a>", journalist <a href="Will%20Hodgkinson">Will Hodgkinson</a> wrote that Radiohead had made it impossible for less successful musicians to compete and make a living from their music. <a href="Kim%20Gordon">Kim Gordon</a> of <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a> told the "Guardian" the release "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever."

Radiohead's managers defended the release as "a solution for Radiohead, not the industry", and doubted "it would work the same way [for Radiohead] ever again". Radiohead have not used the pay-what-you-want system for subsequent releases. In February 2013, Yorke told the "Guardian" that though Radiohead had hoped to subvert the corporate music industry with "In Rainbows", he feared they had instead played into the hands of content providers such as <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> and <a href="Google">Google</a>: "They have to keep commodifying things to keep the share price up, but in doing so they have made all content, including music and newspapers, worthless, in order to make their billions. And this is what we want?"

As Radiohead's recording contract with <a href="EMI">EMI</a> ended after the 2003 release of "Hail to the Thief", Radiohead recorded "In Rainbows "without a record label. In 2005, Yorke told "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>": "I like the people at our record company, but the time is at hand when you have to ask why anyone needs one. And, yes, it probably would give us some perverse pleasure to say 'Fuck you' to this decaying business model." In August 2007, as Radiohead were finishing "In Rainbows", EMI was acquired by the <a href="private%20equity">private equity</a> firm <a href="Terra%20Firma%20Capital%20Partners">Terra Firma</a> for US$6.4 billion (£4.7 billion). 

EMI executives including Keith Wozencroft, who had signed Radiohead to EMI, travelled regularly to Radiohead's Oxfordshire studio in hopes of negotiating a new contract. Even in the days leading to the album announcement, the executives believed a deal could be made, and were "devastated" when Radiohead's team informed them of their plan a day in advance. Radiohead wanted the rights to their back catalog, which new EMI owner <a href="Guy%20Hands">Guy Hands</a> refused. He believed that Radiohead had already decided on the pay-what-you-want release and would only have canceled it with a "really big" offer. 

After an EMI spokesman stated that Radiohead had demanded "an extraordinary amount of money", Radiohead's management and Yorke released statements denying that they had asked for a large advance, but instead wanted control over their back catalogue. According to Hands: "They wanted a lot of money ... And they wanted their masters back, which we valued even more. At our valuation, it was millions and millions that they wanted."

According to Eamonn Forde, author of "The Final Days of EMI", Radiohead had lost faith in EMI and thought the new ownership would be a "bloodbath". O'Brien said: "It was really sad to leave all the people [we'd worked with] ... But Terra Firma don't understand the music industry." Days after Radiohead signed to XL, EMI announced a <a href="Radiohead%20Box%20Set">box set of Radiohead material</a> recorded before "In Rainbows," released in the same week as the "In Rainbows" special edition. Commentators including the "Guardian" saw the move as retaliation for the band choosing not to re-sign with EMI.

On New Year's Eve 2007, <a href="Current%20TV">Current TV</a> streamed a <a href="webcast">webcast</a> performance filmed at Radiohead's Oxford studios featuring "In Rainbows" songs, poetry and additional footage. In March 2008, Radiohead partnered with animation site <a href="Aniboom">Aniboom</a> to create a contest whereby entrants submitted <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>s for an animated music video for an "In Rainbows "song. The winner, who would receive $10,000 to create a full-length music video, was chosen by AniBOOM, Radiohead, <a href="TBD%20Records">TBD Records</a>, and <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a>; Adult Swim aired the winning video. The band awarded $10,000 each to four different winners, plus $1,000 to each of ten semifinalists to create a one-minute clip. Radiohead toured North America, Europe, South America and Japan in support of "In Rainbows "from May 2008 until March 2009.

"In Rainbows" received widespread critical acclaim, earning a rating of 88 out of 100 on review aggregate site <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which indicates "universal acclaim". Various reviewers, such as "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a>, attributed the album's quality to Radiohead's performance in the studio and that the band sounded like they were enjoying themselves. Others, such as "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"s Jonathan Cohen, commended the album for not being overshadowed by its marketing hype. Andy Kellman of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> wrote that "In Rainbows" "will hopefully be remembered as Radiohead's most stimulating synthesis of accessible songs and abstract sounds, rather than their first pick-your-price download."

The "<a href="NME">NME</a>" described the album as "Radiohead reconnecting with their human sides, realising you [can] embrace pop melodies and proper instruments while still sounding like paranoid androids ... this [is] otherworldly music, alright." <a href="Will%20Hermes">Will Hermes</a>, writing in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", called "In Rainbows" "the gentlest, prettiest Radiohead set yet" and stated that it "uses the full musical and emotional spectra to conjure breathtaking beauty". <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" praised its "vividly collaborative sonic touches" and concluded: "No wasted moments, no weak tracks: just primo Radiohead." In 2011, "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>" described it as Radiohead's "most expansive and seductive album, possibly their all-time high."

Jon Dolan of "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" called "In Rainbows" a "far more pensive and reflective" album than "Hail to the Thief", writing that it "formulates a lush, sensualized ideal out of vague, layered discomfort." "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>"s Mikael Wood felt that the album "succeeds because all of that cold, clinical lab work hasn't eliminated the warmth from their music", while "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>"s Mark Pytlik dubbed it a more "human" album that "represents the sound of Radiohead coming back to earth." <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, writing for <a href="MSN%20Music">MSN Music</a>, gave "In Rainbows" a two-star honourable mention rating and noted that the album, having been developed in concert, was "more jammy, less songy and less Yorkey, which is good." "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>" was more critical, finding "a sense here of a group magisterially marking time, shying away... from any grand, rhetorical, countercultural purpose."

"In Rainbows" was ranked among the best albums of 2007 by many music publications. It was ranked number one by "Billboard", "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" and <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>; third by "NME" and "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>"; fourth by "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" and "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>"; and sixth by "Rolling Stone" and "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>". It was also ranked one of the best albums of the decade by several publications: the "NME" ranked it 10th, "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" ranked it 45th, "Rolling Stone" ranked it 30th, and the "Guardian" ranked it 22nd, while "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" ranked the album fifth on its list of the 10 best albums of the decade.

"Rolling Stone" ranked the album number 336 on their updated 2012 version of <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>. It was included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

"In Rainbows" was nominated for the short list of the 2008 <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a> and was nominated for several awards at the <a href="51st%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">51st Annual Grammy Awards</a>: <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Album of the Year</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Boxed%20or%20Special%20Limited%20Edition%20Package">Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Producer%20of%20the%20Year%2C%20Non-Classical">Producer of the Year, Non-Classical</a> (for Nigel Godrich), with three Grammy nominations also for "House of Cards" for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group%20with%20Vocal">Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal</a>, <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rock%20Song">Best Rock Song</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Music%20Video">Best Music Video</a>. "In Rainbows" won awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package.

In early October 2007, a Radiohead spokesperson reported that most downloaders paid "a normal retail price" for the download version, and that most fans had pre-ordered the limited edition. Citing a source close to the band, Gigwise.com reported that the album had sold 1.2 million digital copies before its retail release; however, this was dismissed by Radiohead manager Bryce Edge as "exaggerated". In December 2007, Yorke stated that Radiohead had made more money from digital sales of "In Rainbows" than the digital sales of all previous Radiohead albums combined.

In October 2008, one year after the album's release, Warner Chappell reported that although most people paid nothing for the download, pre-release sales for "In Rainbows" were more profitable than the total sales of "Hail to the Thief", and that the limited edition had sold 100,000 copies. In 2009, "Wired" reported that Radiohead had made an "instantaneous" £3 million from the album. "Pitchfork" saw this at proof that "Radiohead could release a record on the most secretive terms, basically for free, and still be wildly successful, even as industry profits continued to plummet," thanks to the support of their fan community.

Because inrainbows.com is not a chart-registered retailer, "In Rainbows" download and limited edition sales were not eligible for inclusion in the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. On the week of its retail release, "In Rainbows" peaked at number one on the UK Album Chart, with first week sales of 44,602 copies. After some record stores broke <a href="street%20date">street date</a> agreements, the album entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> at number 156. However, in the first week of official release, it sold 122,000 copies in the United States, making it the <a href="List%20of%20number-one%20independent%20albums%20%28U.S%29">10th independently distributed album to reach number one on the "Billboard" 200</a>. In October 2008, Warner Chappell Music Publishing reported that "In Rainbows" had sold three million copies (1.75 million of which were physical format sales) since its retail release. The vinyl edition of "In Rainbows" was the bestselling vinyl album of 2008.

In the US, "Nude" reached number 35 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, and was Radiohead's first single to appear on the <a href="Billboard%20Pop%20100">"Billboard" Pop 100</a> chart. "<a href="Bodysnatchers%20%28song%29">Bodysnatchers</a>" reached number eight on the US <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Hot Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart. "Jigsaw Falling into Place" peaked at number 69 in airplay on alternative rock-oriented stations.

The special edition of "In Rainbows" included a second disc, "In Rainbows Disk 2", which contains eight additional tracks. In 2009, Radiohead made the tracks available to purchase as downloads on their website. In October 2016, "Disk 2" was made available to stream on services such as Apple Music and Spotify.

Fountain of Time

Fountain of Time, or simply Time, is a <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a> by <a href="Lorado%20Taft">Lorado Taft</a>, measuring in length, situated at the western edge of the <a href="Midway%20Plaisance">Midway Plaisance</a> within <a href="Washington%20Park%20%28Chicago%20park%29">Washington Park</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Illinois, in the United States. This location is in the <a href="Washington%20Park%2C%20Chicago%20%28neighborhood%29">Washington Park</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area</a> on Chicago's <a href="South%20Side%20%28Chicago%29">South Side</a>. Inspired by <a href="Henry%20Austin%20Dobson">Henry Austin Dobson</a>'s poem "Paradox of Time", and with its 100 figures passing before <a href="Father%20Time">Father Time</a>, the work was created as a monument to the first 100 years of peace between the United States and the United Kingdom, resulting from the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">Treaty of Ghent</a> in 1814. Although the fountain's water began running in 1920, the sculpture was not dedicated to the city until 1922. The sculpture is a contributing structure to the Washington Park <a href="Historic%20district%20%28United%20States%29%23Federal%20level">United States Registered Historic District</a>, which is a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> listing.

Part of a larger beautification plan for the Midway Plaisance, "Time" was constructed from a new type of molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more durable and cheaper than alternatives. It was said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete. Before the completion of <a href="Millennium%20Park">Millennium Park</a> in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the <a href="Chicago%20Park%20District">Chicago Park District</a>. "Time" is one of several Chicago <a href="work%20of%20art">works of art</a> funded by <a href="Benjamin%20F.%20Ferguson">Benjamin Ferguson</a>'s <a href="trust%20fund">trust fund</a>.

"Time" has undergone several restorations because of deterioration and decline caused by natural and urban elements. During the late 1990s and the first few years of the 21st century it underwent repairs that corrected many of the problems caused by these earlier restorations. Although extensive renovation of the sculpture was completed as recently as 2005, the supporters of "Time" continue to seek resources for additional lighting, and the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Historic%20Preservation">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a> has nominated it for further funding.

"Time", along with many other public works in Chicago, was funded by Benjamin Ferguson's 1905 gift of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">$</a>1 million ($ million today), to a charitable trust formed to "memorialize events in American History". <a href="Lorado%20Taft">Lorado Taft</a> initially conceived a sculpture carved from <a href="granite">granite</a>; an alternative plan was to have it chiseled out of Georgia marble, which it is estimated would have cost $30,000 ($) a year for five years. The planned work was intended as part of a Midway beautification which was to include a stream, <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s, and a series of bridges: a Bridge of Arts at Woodlawn Avenue, a Bridge of Religion at the intersection of Ellis Avenue, and a Bridge of Science at Dorchester Avenue (formerly Madison Avenue). As part of the plan, the two ends of the Midway were to be connected by a canal in the deep depressions linking lagoons in <a href="Jackson%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Jackson</a> and Washington Parks.

In 1907, Taft had won the first commission from the Ferguson Fund to create the "<a href="Fountain%20of%20the%20Great%20Lakes">Fountain of the Great Lakes</a>" at the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>. Immediately afterwards, inspired by <a href="Daniel%20Burnham">Daniel Burnham's</a> "Make no little plans" quote, he begin lobbying for a grand Midway beautification plan. In 1912, Art Institute Trustee Frank G. Logan formally presented Taft's plans to the fund's administrators at the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>. Taft's proposed Midway Plaisance beautification plan included two possible commemoration themes. His first choice was to honor the memory of the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> that had been held in Jackson Park in 1893. His alternative was to commemorate the centennial of the 1814 Treaty of Ghent "marking a century of perfect understanding between England and America". Since other plans to commemorate the Exposition were under way, the second theme choice was adopted as the justification for a second Taft commission from the Ferguson Fund. Contemporary newspaper accounts anticipated that Taft's entire Midway beautification plan would be approved easily.

Taft's initial commission from the trust was limited to the creation of a full-sized plaster model of "Fountain of Time", under a five-year $10,000 ($) annual installment contract signed on February 6, 1913. This would enable the model to be evaluated in 1918. Taft first created a quarter-scale model which received the Trustees' approval in May 1915. He eventually produced his full-scale plaster model, in width peaking in the center, with an equestrian warrior and a robed model of Father Time with a height of . The installation of this model near its intended location was delayed by Taft's <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a> service with the <a href="Y.M.C.A.">Y.M.C.A.</a> in France as part of a corps of entertainers and lecturers, but was completed in 1920. However, Taft's wider vision of a Chicago school of sculpture, analogous to other philosophical Chicago schools such as the contemporaneous <a href="Chicago%20school%20%28architecture%29">Chicago school of architecture</a> style, had lost momentum after the 1913 dedication of his "Fountain of the Great Lakes". The <a href="Beaux-Arts%20architecture">Beaux Arts</a> style had become dated; instead of funding Taft's large-scale Midway Plaisance beautification plan, and providing the originally planned granite, bronze or Georgia marble materials, the trust only allocated sufficient funds and support for a concrete sculpture.

"Time" is in the Chicago Park District, in the Washington Park community area on Chicago's South Side, near the Midway Plaisance. This location, adjoining the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> campus directly to the East, makes the sculpture a contributing structure to the Washington Park federal <a href="Historic%20district%20%28United%20States%29%23Federal%20level">Registered Historic District</a>, listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. "Time" is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its <a href="reflecting%20pool">reflecting pool</a> by <a href="Howard%20Van%20Doren%20Shaw">Howard Van Doren Shaw</a>. Robert Jones, director of design and construction for the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a> at the time, stated in 1999 that "Time" was the first finished art piece to be made of any type of concrete.

The sculpture is located a few blocks from Taft's studio, the <a href="Lorado%20Taft%20Midway%20Studios">Lorado Taft Midway Studios</a>, now a <a href="Chicago%20Landmark">Chicago Landmark</a> and <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, located at 60th Street and Ingleside Avenue. Other notable sculptures nearby include <a href="Henry%20Moore">Henry Moore</a>'s National Historic Landmark "<a href="Nuclear%20Energy%20%28sculpture%29">Nuclear Energy</a>", which is on the site of the <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">first self-sustaining nuclear reaction</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. Jackson Park, connected to Washington Park and "Time" by the Midway Plaisance, hosts the Chicago Landmark <a href="Statue%20of%20The%20Republic">Statue of "The Republic"</a>; at one time the Midway Plaisance, Jackson Park and Washington Park were jointly known as "South Park".

There is little agreement on the dimensions of "Time", with various sources describing it as between long. One of the few precise estimates describes it as long, wide and tall. The sources are often unclear about whether they are describing the width of the reflecting pool from exterior wall to exterior wall, the width of the water within the reflecting pool's interior walls, the width of the base of the sculpted mass of humanity, the width of the sculpted masses themselves, or the width of the <a href="Lot%20%28real%20estate%29">parcel</a> of land upon which "Time" is built.

Water began running in the completed sculpture on September 1, 1920, although it was not dedicated to the city until November 15, 1922. <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> President <a href="Harry%20Pratt%20Judson">Harry Pratt Judson</a> delivered an address at the dedication ceremony at the Midway Plaisance, before contributions from Taft. President of the B.F. Ferguson Trust Charles Hutchinson, and John Barton Payne, President of the South Park Board.

The sculpture is made of a form of <a href="Hollow%20casting">hollow-cast</a> <a href="concrete">concrete</a>, reinforced with <a href="steel">steel</a>. It was cast in a 4,500-piece <a href="Mold%20%28manufacturing%29">mold</a>, using of a material described as "concrete-like", which incorporated <a href="pebble">pebble</a>s from the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a>. This composite material was an innovation at the time. For years, <a href="John%20Joseph%20Earley">John Joseph Earley</a> of Washington, DC, had used pebbles that seemed durable in the face of elements such as the weather and urban soot and grime. He had determined that by adding crushed pebbles he could create a new concrete mixture more durable than <a href="limestone">limestone</a> but cheaper than marble or <a href="bronze">bronze</a>. The reflection from the <a href="silica">silica</a> of the crushed stones complemented the durability with artistic beauty; the same material was used at Chicago's <a href="Fine%20Arts%20Building%20%28Chicago%29">Fine Arts Building</a>.

The sculpture depicts a hooded <a href="Father%20Time">Father Time</a> carrying a <a href="scythe">scythe</a>, and watching over a parade of 100 figures arranged in an <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>, with an overall <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a>al geometry. The <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> procession depicts the entire spectrum of humanity at various stages of life. The contemporary 1920s "<a href="Chicago%20Daily%20Tribune">Chicago Daily Tribune</a>" described the figures as "heroic", and that choice of adjective has stayed with the piece. The figures are said to be passing in review as they rush through the stages of life, and include soldiers, frolicking children and kissing couples. Father Time is described in various newspaper articles as "huge", "weird", and "dominant". Other "Tribune" critics described "Time" as a "pet atrocity" of Taft in large part due to its ugliness. One critic described the white figures as reminiscent of false teeth smiling across the end of the Midway.

"Time" commemorates the first 100 years of peace between the United States and Great Britain after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">Treaty of Ghent</a> concluded the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> on December 24, 1814. The design was inspired by the poem "Paradox of Time" by <a href="Henry%20Austin%20Dobson">Henry Austin Dobson</a>: "Time goes, you say? Ah no, Alas, time stays, we go". "Time"'s theme has been compared to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s <a href="All%20the%20world%27s%20a%20stage">All the world's a stage</a> monologue in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>", which describes the seven ages of man: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, old age, and dementia. Taft's figures represent birth, the struggle for existence, love, family life, religion, poetry, and war.

Although most of the figures are generic representations of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, with one of his assistants following him, along the west side of the sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.

Taft is remembered for his books, such as "The History of American Sculpture" (1903), regarded as the first comprehensive work on the subject, and was well known for <a href="portrait">portrait</a>s and allegorical public sculpture, of which "Fountain of Time" is a prime example. It was produced in the period following his assignment to design sculptures for <a href="William%20Le%20Baron%20Jenney">William Le Baron Jenney</a>'s 1893 Horticultural Building for the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a>. During this period he designed several large-scale public works, including "Fountain of the Great Lakes". Taft resided in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> for most of his life and worked in the <a href="Lorado%20Taft%20Midway%20Studios">Midway Studios</a> starting in 1906.

Designed without <a href="expansion%20joints">expansion joints</a>, "Time" is one of a small number of outdoor sculptures made of reinforced pebble/concrete aggregate, few of which have been created since the 1930s. In 1936, "Time"'s weather-related cracks were repaired; further work occurred in 1955. The sculpture's subsequent repairs were followed by a rededication celebration in 1966. Although the sculpture received regular maintenance, early repair crews often did more harm than good, by using techniques such as <a href="sandblasting">sandblasting</a> and patching cracks with rigid materials.

By the 1980s the sculpture was crumbling; cracks had developed, details of the figures had worn away, and moisture had eroded the internal structure. In wintertime the fountain had to be protected by a <a href="Tarpaulin">tarp</a>. Weather, <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a>, and vandalism meant that hundreds of thousands of dollars were now needed for restoration.
The Chicago Park District, <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, and <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a> conservators all sponsored restoration work, including drying out the cavity of the hollow sculpture, removal of the deteriorated substructure, a newly designed ventilation system within the piece, a protective exterior coating, and repairs to the reflecting pool. In 1989 Chicago Park District allocated $150,000 to the repair project, which amount was matched by the Ferguson fund. By the end of 1991, the Park District had collected $320,000 of the $520,000 estimated repair costs from public and private funds, although in 1994 the sculpture still awaited repair.

By early 1997, after almost two decades of activity, the only repairs completed were phase one of the air ventilation system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner roof. Plans now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father Time from the harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.

On April 19, 1999, the $1.6 million, two-year phase two restoration began, scheduled for completion by May 2001. Five workers began repairing the cracks, killing biological growth, removing <a href="calcium">calcium</a> deposits and pollution-blackened <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, and coating the surface with a combination of lime putty, <a href="adobe">adobe</a> cement and sand. The inoperable reflecting pool was not repaired in this phase. Although this phase was completed in 2001, its effects were not visible until the following year, when the temporary protective structure was unveiled. The repairs were expected to sustain the sculpture for about 30–50 years before any further repairs would be necessary.

In 2003, the <a href="National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Arts">National Endowment for the Arts</a> committed $250,000 to the Park District for the conservation and restoration of the reflecting pool. In 2004, the University of Chicago contributed $100,000 and the Park District Board $845,000 to repair the pool and its water circulation system. This work was carried out in the summer of 2005 at a slightly reduced budget, and the fountain was filled with water for the first time in over fifty years.
In 2007, efforts began to add lighting. That same year the sculpture was nominated by <a href="Partners%20in%20Preservation">Partners in Preservation</a>, a fund for the preservation of historic sites, backed by the National Trust for Historic Preservation and American Express. In a widely publicized contest that included <a href="wikt%3Aopen%20house">open house</a> events where the public could tour and learn about the competing historic sites, $1 million was available for preservation efforts in the <a href="Chicago%20metropolitan%20area">Chicago metropolitan area</a>, but the fountain was not one of the 15 winning candidates.

"Time" was intended to be matched by a sister fountain, "Fountain of Creation", on the opposite end of the Midway. Work was begun but was never completed. The finished portions of "Fountain of Creation", depicting figures from the Greek legend of the repopulation of earth after the great flood, are considered Taft's final work, and were given to <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a>. The four surviving elements are figures ranging in height from , and are collectively named "Sons and Daughters of <a href="Deucalion">Deucalion</a> and <a href="Pyrrha">Pyrrha</a>". Two of these elements stand outside the entrance to the university's Main Library, and two others are located at the south side of <a href="Foellinger%20Auditorium">Foellinger Auditorium</a>.

The 766th Independent Infantry Regiment () was a <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> <a href="regiment">unit</a> of <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>'s <a href="Korean%20People%27s%20Army">Korean People's Army</a> (KPA) that existed briefly during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. It was headquartered in <a href="Hoeryong">Hoeryong</a>, North Korea, and was also known as the 766th Unit (). Trained extensively in <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious warfare</a> and <a href="unconventional%20warfare">unconventional warfare</a>, the 766th Regiment was considered a <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> <a href="commando">commando</a> unit. The regiment was trained to conduct assaults by sea and then to lead other North Korean units on offensive operations, to infiltrate behind enemy lines and to disrupt enemy supplies and communications.

Activated in 1949, the regiment trained for more than a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of the regiment led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a>, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pusan%20Perimeter">Battle of Pusan Perimeter</a> as part of a push to force <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) troops out of Korea.

The regiment saw its final action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20P%27ohang-dong">Battle of P'ohang-dong</a>, fighting unsuccessfully to take the town from <a href="U.N.">U.N.</a> troops. Racked by <a href="U.N.">U.N.</a> naval and air forces and suffering extensive losses from continuous fighting, the regiment was forced to retreat from the P'ohang-dong battlefield. It moved north, joining a concentration of other KPA units, before being disbanded and absorbed into the KPA's <a href="NK%2012th%20Division">12th Division</a>.

Upon creation, the 766th Unit was designed to vary in size, consisting of a number of smaller units capable of acting alone. Eventually, it was reinforced to the size of a full regiment, with 3,000 men equally distributed across six <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s (numbered 1st through 6th). It was made directly subordinate to the KPA Army headquarters and put under the command of <a href="Senior%20Colonel">Senior Colonel</a> Oh Jin Woo, who would command the unit for its entire existence. All 500 men of the 3rd Battalion were lost just before the war started when their transport was <a href="Battle%20of%20Pusan">sunk while attacking Pusan harbor</a> by the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Navy">Republic of Korea Navy</a>. For the remainder of its existence the regiment was whittled down by losses until it numbered no more than 1,500 men and could not muster more than three battalions.

During the planning for the invasion of <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> in the years before the war, the North Korean leadership began to create large numbers of commando and special forces units to send south. These units subverted South Korean authority before and during the war with <a href="revolutionary%20terror">terror campaigns</a>, sabotage and inducing rebellions in ROK military units. Hundreds of commandos were sent to South Korea in this fashion, and by the end of the war up to 3,000 of them had been trained and armed. During this time, North Korean leadership also ordered the creation of large conventional units to act as advance forces for the actual invasion. The 766th Unit was formed in April 1949 at the Third Military Academy in <a href="Hoeryong">Hoeryong</a>, <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>. The academy was specially designed to train commandos, and the 766th was originally designed to supervise North Korean <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> ranger units. Over the next year, the 766th Unit received extensive training in <a href="unconventional%20warfare">unconventional warfare</a> and <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious warfare</a>. During this time, the unit was expanded in size to 3,000 men in six battalions.

Prior to the beginning of the war in June 1950, the 766th completed training and was moved to the front at <a href="Yangyang">Yangyang</a> to support the KPA's <a href="5th%20Division%20%28North%20Korea%29">5th Division</a>. The North Korean plan was to conduct amphibious landings in <a href="Jeongdongjin">Chongdongjin</a> and Imwonjin on the eastern coast using the 766th Regiment, in conjunction with the <a href="549th%20Unit">549th Unit</a>. These amphibious landings would harass the rear area of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Army">Republic of Korea Army</a>, providing supporting attacks to the planned frontal attack by the KPA's <a href="NK%20II%20Corps">II Corps</a> directly from the north. The 766th was in position by June 23 and prepared for the attack. The unit was moved to the ports of <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a> and <a href="Kansong">Kansong</a> and loaded into ships. With the 3,000 men in the 766th, another 3,000 in the 549th, and 11,000 men in the KPA's 5th Division, the 17,000 North Korean troops outnumbered the <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Army">Republic of Korea Army</a>'s (ROK) <a href="ROK%208th%20Division">8th Division</a>'s 6,866 by a ratio of 2.1 to 1. The combination of the frontal attack and the landings were expected to crush the ROK division and prevent reinforcements from moving in to support it.

The regiment was split into three groups for the attack. Three battalions acted as <a href="spearheads">spearheads</a> for the 5th Division on land while two more battalions conducted the landings in Imwonjin. This 2,500 man force reassembled and then led the North Korean units south. In the meantime, the 3rd Battalion, 766th Regiment was detached and sent on a mission to infiltrate Pusan. Paired with additional support, it formed the 600-man 588th Unit. 588th Unit was tasked with raiding Pusan harbor, destroying vital facilities to make it impossible for UN forces to land troops there. However, the troop transport carrying the 588th Unit was discovered and sunk by United Nations ships outside Pusan harbor the morning of June 25, destroying the 3rd Battalion.

Around 04:00 on June 25, the KPA's 5th Division began its first attacks on the ROK 10th Regiment's forward positions. Three hours later, the 766th Regiment's two battalions landed at the village of Imwonjin, using motor and sail boats to land troops and mustering South Korean villagers to assist in setting up supplies. The two battalions separated; one headed into the <a href="T%27aeback%20Mountains">T'aeback Mountains</a> and the second advanced north toward <a href="Samcheok">Samcheok</a>. At this point, the ROK 8th Division, under heavy attack from the front and aware of attacks in the rear, urgently requested reinforcements. It was denied these reinforcements, as ROK higher commanders informed the division commander that the ROK Army was under heavy attack across the entirety of the <a href="38th%20parallel%20north">38th parallel</a> and had no reinforcements to spare.

The ROK 21st Regiment, 8th Division's southernmost unit, moved to counter the amphibious attack. The regiment's 1st Battalion moved from Bukp'yong into the Okgye area and ambushed forward elements of the 766th in conjunction with local police and militia forces. They were able to drive back the 766th Regiment's northern advance. However, at least one of the 766th Regiment's battalions massed at Bamjae, blocking one of the 8th Division's main supply routes. ROK troops mustered a civilian militia to help fight the North Koreans, which was only moderately effective. The embattled ROK 8th Division was forced to withdraw under overwhelming attacks and breakdowns in communication on July 27. With the retreat of the <a href="ROK%206th%20Division">ROK 6th Division</a>, the entire ROK eastern flank was forced back. The 766th Regiment had been successful in establishing a <a href="bridgehead">bridgehead</a> and disrupting communications in the initial attack.

With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all advanced steadily south along the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed the South Koreans and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an advance force, attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor communication equipment, and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure they would not be threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give the South Koreans valuable time to build up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from <a href="Uljin">Uljin</a> and was moving toward <a href="Ilwolsan">Ilwolsan</a>, Yongyang and <a href="Cheongsong">Cheongsong</a> in order to block communications between <a href="Daegu">Daegu</a> and <a href="Busan">Busan</a>, where <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.

The ROK 23rd Regiment of the <a href="ROK%203rd%20Division">ROK 3rd Division</a> was moved to block the advance of the three units at Uljin. The ROK forces mounted a series of delaying actions against the main North Korean force, which was significantly dispersed throughout the mountainous region and unable to muster its overwhelming strength. The ROK regiment was subsequently able to hold up the North Korean advance until July 5. On July 10, the 766th separated from the 5th Division and met an advance party of North Korean civilians in Uljin who had been sent to set up government in the area. From here, the 766th dispersed in small groups into the mountains. On July 13 it reached Pyonghae-ri, north of <a href="Yeongdeok">Yongdok</a>.

Over the next week the 766th Regiment and the KPA's 5th Division continued in a slow advance south as it met increasing South Korean resistance. <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> air support began to increase, slowing the advance further. The force continued to occupy the eastern flank, and by July 24 it was advancing from the Chongsong-<a href="Andong">Andong</a> region and approaching <a href="Pohang">Pohang</a>. On its flank was the KPA's <a href="NK%2012th%20Division">12th Division</a>. Progress halted as UN aerial and naval bombardment made movement more difficult. At the same time the North Korean units' supply lines were stretched thin and began to break down, forcing them to conscript South Korean civilians to carry supplies.

On July 17, the KPA's 5th Division entered <a href="Yeongdeok%20County">Yongdok</a>, taking the city without much resistance before fierce UN air attacks caused the division heavy losses. Still, it was able to surround the ROK 3rd Division in the city. By now, the 5th Division and the 766th Regiment had been reduced to a combined strength of 7,500 men to the ROK 3rd Divisions' 6,469. The 766th massed its force again to assist the 5th Division in surrounding and besieging the ROK 3rd Division, which was trapped in the city. The 3rd Division, in the meantime, was ordered to remain in the city to delay the North Koreans as long as possible. It was eventually evacuated by sea after delaying North Korean forces for a considerable time. The rugged terrain of the mountains prevented the North Korean forces from conducting the enveloping maneuvers they had used so effectively against other troops, and their advantages in numbers and equipment had been negated in the fight.

By July 28, the division was still embroiled in this fight and the 766th bypassed it and moved toward Chinbo on the left flank of the city. However the 766th had suffered significant setbacks at Yongdok, with substantial losses due to American and British naval artillery fire. Once it arrived in the area, it met heavier resistance from <a href="South%20Korean%20police">South Korean police</a> and militia operating in armored vehicles. With air support, they offered the heaviest resistance the unit had faced thus far. With the support of only one of the 5th Division's regiments, the 766th was unable to sustain its advance, and had to pull back by the 29th. Movement from the <a href="ROK%20Capital%20Division">ROK Capital Division</a> prevented the 766th Regiment from infiltrating further into the mountains. ROK cavalry and civilian police then began isolated counteroffensives against the 766th. These forces included special counter-guerrilla units targeting the 766th and countering its tactics. South Korean troops halted the advance of the North Koreans again around the end of the month thanks to increased reinforcements and support closer to the Pusan Perimeter logistics network.

On August 5, the KPA's 12th Division pushed back the ROK Capital Division in the Ch'ongsong-<a href="Kigye">Kigye</a> area, and linked up with elements of the 766th which had infiltrated the area of Pohyunsan. Unopposed, they began to prepare to attack P'ohang to secure entry into the UN's newly established <a href="Pusan%20Perimeter">Pusan Perimeter</a>. The Regiment was ordered to begin an attack in coordination with the KPA's 5th Division. The Korean People's Army planned <a href="Battle%20of%20Pusan%20Perimeter">simultaneous offensives</a> across the entire Perimeter, including a flanking maneuver by the 766th and the 5th Division to <a href="envelop">envelop</a> UN troops and push them back to Pusan. The 766th was not reinforced; North Korean planners intended it to move unseen around the UN lines while the majority of the UN and North Korean troops were locked in fighting around <a href="Battle%20of%20Taegu">Taegu</a> and the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Naktong%20Bulge">Naktong Bulge</a>.

By this time, however, North Korean logistics had been stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By the beginning of August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.

At dawn on August 11, one 300-man battalion of the 766th Regiment entered the village of P'ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the rear guard of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with <a href="small-arms">small-arms</a> fire until noon. At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove the South Koreans out of the village.
The village was strategically important because it was one of the few direct routes through the mountains and into the <a href="Gyeongsang">Gyeongsang</a> plain. It also led directly to the land routes being used by the UN to reinforce Taegu. Upon hearing of the fall of P'ohang, UN <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth United States Army</a> commander <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28US%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Walton%20Walker">Walton Walker</a> immediately ordered naval and air bombardment of the village. He also ordered ROK and US forces to secure regions around the village to prevent further advance of the North Korean troops. Within a few hours, the village was being blasted by artillery forcing the Regiment's advance force to pull back. The 766th's forces congregated and fought in the hills around the village. They joined elements of the KPA's 5th Division, and did not enter P'ohang until night.

UN forces responded to the threat with overwhelming numbers. A large force of South Korean troops, designated Task Force P'ohang, was massed and sent into P'ohang-dong to engage the 766th Regiment and the 5th Division. ROK troops attacked toward An'gang-ni to the east, forcing the KPA's 12th Division into a full retreat. Threatened with encirclement, the KPA's 5th Division and 766th Regiment were ordered into full retreat on August 17. By this time, the 766th had been reduced to 1,500 men, half its original strength.

Exhausted and out of supplies, the 766th Regiment moved to Pihak-san, a mountain north of Kigye, to join the shattered KPA's 12th Division. The 12th Division was reduced to 1,500 men in the fighting, and 2,000 army replacements and South Korean conscripts were brought to replenish the division. The 766th Regiment was also ordered to merge its remaining troops into the depleted KPA's 12th Division. Upon the completion of the merger with the 12th Division on August 19, 1950, the 766th Regiment ceased to exist. It had trained for close to 14 months prior to the war but fought for less than two.

Chad Harris-Crane

Chad Harris-Crane is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> on the American <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="Passions">Passions</a>", which aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> from 1999 to 2007 and on <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> in 2007–08. Developed by the soap's creator and <a href="head%20writer">head writer</a> <a href="James%20E.%20Reilly">James E. Reilly</a>, Chad was portrayed by two actors over the course of the show: <a href="Donn%20Swaby">Donn Swaby</a> (1999 to 2002) and <a href="Charles%20Divins">Charles Divins</a> (2002 to 2007). Swaby left the show to pursue roles outside daytime television and was replaced by Divins. The role was the first time that either actor had worked on a television series.

Chad is a member of the <a href="Crane%20family">Crane family</a>. The illegitimate son of the evil patriarch <a href="Alistair%20Crane">Alistair Crane</a>, Chad is introduced as a music producer from <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> who is searching for his biological family. Chad becomes involved in a love triangle with sisters <a href="Whitney%20Russell">Whitney</a> and <a href="Simone%20Russell">Simone Russell</a>. His romance with Whitney is complicated by the possibility they may be engaging in an incestuous relationship as Chad is initially believed to be her half-brother, and later revealed to be her adoptive cousin. Chad's later storylines focus on his confusion over his <a href="sexual%20identity">sexual identity</a>, and his sexual relationship with tabloid reporter <a href="Vincent%20Clarkson">Vincent Clarkson</a>. Chad attempts to reconcile with Whitney, after his affair with Vincent is revealed, before being killed by his father Alistair while trying to protect his best friend, <a href="Ethan%20Winthrop">Ethan Winthrop</a>.

Critical response to Chad was mixed; some reviewers praised the sensationalism of the incest storyline with Whitney, while others criticized his relationship with Vincent as an irresponsible and problematic representation of racial and sexual identity. The character marks a notable step in daytime television and soap opera history; it was the first depiction in a soap opera of two men having sex. Chad has also been cited as expanding the representation of <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> characters of color on daytime television. Divins discussed the storyline with his gay friends and researched <a href="LGBT%20culture">LGBT culture</a> to better shape his performance. Media outlets expressed varying opinions of the exact nature of Chad's <a href="sexual%20orientation">sexual orientation</a>.

<a href="Sheraton%20Kalouria">Sheraton Kalouria</a>, senior vice president of NBC's daytime programming, described the show's use of <a href="color-blind%20casting">color-blind casting</a> as part of an effort to build a diverse pool of characters that best reflected the various ethnic and racial groups living in the United States. Kalouria believed the show was set apart from other soap operas by the inclusion of "the African American <a href="Russell%20family%20%28Passions%29">Russells</a> and the Hispanic <a href="Lopez-Fitzgerald%20family">Lopez-Fitzgeralds</a>".

The role was played by two actors over the course of the show: <a href="Donn%20Swaby">Donn Swaby</a> (1999 to 2002) and <a href="Charles%20Divins">Charles Divins</a> (2002 to 2007). "Passions" was Swaby's first role in a television series. On May 27, 2002, Swaby announced on his official website that he had decided to leave the show to pursue other opportunities outside of daytime television. Divins assumed the role on September 12, 2002. It was his first audition and acting experience; he had previously worked full-time as a fashion model and had decided to pursue an acting career after appearing in commercials. Divins initially auditioned for another soap opera, but its producers suggested that he instead take a role on "Passions". He described his time working on the show as a "scholarship to acting".

Chad was initially characterized as a "street-kid" by the show's official website and "a tough dude from the hood" by David Alexander Nahmod of the "<a href="Bay%20Area%20Reporter">Bay Area Reporter</a>". Swaby called his character "talented, ambitious, adventurous, passionate", and said that his guarded personality was a way of "defying the good guy, bad guy stereotype". Chad originally served as the "object of affection for both <a href="Simone%20Russell">Simone</a> and <a href="Whitney%20Russell">Whitney</a>", but his role on the series was expanded following the casting of Divins. An article on <a href="List%20of%20soap%20opera%20media%20outlets">Soaps.com</a> wrote that Divins adapted the character from being a "West Coast music producer to [an] ambitious and tortured Crane heir". Over the course of the show, Chad was defined by his relationships with his supposed half-sister Whitney and his nephew-niece, <a href="Vincent%20Clarkson">Vincent Clarkson</a>. After Swaby left the show, he was disappointed by the direction Chad's storyline took.

Despite the controversy and negative reception of Chad's sexual encounters with Vincent, Divins identified Chad's confusion over his sexual orientation as a vital part of the storyline. While the show was still filming, he expressed an interest in further exploring Chad's rejection of his sexuality. Divins felt that the key element of the storyline was Chad's difficulty in coming to terms with his sexuality. When asked by an interviewer about the revelation of Chad's sexuality, Divins said the show would include clear representations of "male intimacy". Divins said he was uncomfortable shooting scenes related to the storyline, but felt it was an opportunity to sharpen his skills as an actor. He added that he wanted to make the character as "grounded and real as possible" and keep the focus on how Chad reconciles with his sexual orientation.

To prepare for the storyline, Divins consulted with his gay friends and asked them how to ensure the character was "being represented correctly and honestly". <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>'s discussion of the <a href="Down-low%20%28sexual%20slang%29">down-low</a> on her talk show "<a href="The%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a>" also helped Divins better understand the character. Divins was unaware of the developments in Chad's sexuality until he was given the script four days prior to the filming of the episodes. He said he was surprised by the reveal that Chad's affair was with a man, but thought the soap opera's "storytelling style lends itself to dramatic changes". Divins praised the show for its inclusion of a black, gay character on daytime television regardless of any negative feedback from fans who preferred Chad and Whitney as a couple, and said that he wasn't afraid to take on the role, given the increased visibility of LGBT issues on television and in everyday society at the time of the storyline's broadcast. Chad's character and storyline were not to every cast member's taste; <a href="Tracey%20Ross">Tracey Ross</a>, who played <a href="Eve%20Russell">Eve Russell</a>, later said she "was never crazy about" the incest plot, though <a href="Phillip%20Jeanmarie">Phillip Jeanmarie</a>, who played Vincent Clarkson, commented that he was glad to have been part of the taboo-breaking story.

Chad Harris-Crane first appears in the episode airing on September 23, 1999, in which, after discovering he was adopted, he moves from Los Angeles to Harmony to find his real parents. Chad married <a href="Crane%20family%23Second%20generation">Latoya Harris</a> while he was working as a music producer in Los Angeles. Latoya refused to accompany Chad to Harmony as she did not want to leave her friends and family. While in Harmony, Chad encounters two people with information on his past - Orville Perkins and Crystal Harris. Orville, a senile old man, erroneously believes Chad is Eve's long-lost son with <a href="Crane%20Industries">Crane Industries</a> CEO <a href="Julian%20Crane">Julian Crane</a> and claims to have evidence proving this connection. In a desperate attempt to keep her past hidden, Eve burns down Orville's house and any evidence inside and places him in a retirement home. Chad later meets jazz singer Crystal Harris, who was Eve's confidante during her relationship with Julian and subsequent pregnancy. Crystal also offers information about Chad's birth and parents, but is killed by a French drug cartel's assassin Antoine, who mistakes her for socialite <a href="Sheridan%20Crane">Sheridan Crane</a>, before she can deliver it to him.

During this time, Chad meets and falls in love with Whitney Russell. Their relationship is complicated by her sister Simone Russell's crush on him, and her parent's disapproval of him. Eve discourages both of her children from pursuing a relationship with Chad, fearing he will be a bad influence on her daughter in the same way Julian was on her teenage self. Whitney and Chad keep their romantic and sexual encounters secret for years while he pretends to be in love with Simone. The love triangle continues until Simone catches Whitney kissing Chad. Simone breaks up publicly with Chad and tells everyone in Harmony about his relationship with Whitney. During 2003, Chad's connection to Whitney steadily unravels after the discovery of his marriage to Latoya and her attempt to murder Whitney.

In 2004, Eve's vengeful adoptive sister <a href="Liz%20Sanbourne">Liz Sanbourne</a> arranges for Eve's past relationship with Julian to be exposed to the Russell family and the rest of Harmony, resulting in Chad being erroneously identified as their son. From this point on, the apparently incestuous relationship between Chad and Whitney becomes one of the primary storylines on "Passions." Whitney discovers that she is pregnant with Chad's child. She initiates a relationship with <a href="Fox%20Crane">Fox Crane</a> to be able to insinuate that he is the father and protect herself, and her child, from the stigma of incest. She gives birth to a son and immediately uses her then-boyfriend Fox Crane's power of attorney to put him up for adoption. Two couples—Julian and Eve, and T.C. and Liz—compete to adopt the boy, but Chad is awarded custody of the child. He attempts to use the child to reconnect with Whitney. Whitney and Chad name their baby Miles Davis Harris after jazz musician <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>. During the show's 2005 <a href="Passions%23Summertime%20extravaganzas">summertime extravaganza</a>, Whitney has sex with Chad in the middle of a tsunami and admits to Chad that he is Miles' biological father. Identified as the "Vendetta" plot, the show's 2006 summertime extravaganza centers on <a href="Alistair%20Crane">Alistair Crane</a> luring Whitney, Chad, and several other residents of Harmony, to Rome. While in Rome, Chad is given his birth certificate by <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> editor <a href="Minor%20Passions%20characters%23JT%20Cornell">JT Cornell</a> and discovers that he was conceived during Alistair's rape of Liz. Following the revelation of his true paternity, Chad marries Whitney and they decide to raise their son together, and rename him Miles Harris-Crane.

Unbeknownst to Whitney, Chad previously began a sexual relationship with the tabloid reporter <a href="Vincent%20Clarkson">Vincent Clarkson</a> at an unspecified time around the "Vendetta" plot, and he continues the affair after their reunion and wedding. Chad is unaware that Vincent is Eve's child with Julian and his half-brother, making Vincent his half-uncle, adoptive half-cousin, and half-brother-in-law. He is also initially oblivious to the fact that Vincent is <a href="intersex">intersex</a>, and that Valerie Davis, the executive assistant to <a href="Crane%20Industries">Crane Industries</a>' vice president <a href="Theresa%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald</a>, is his split personality. While confessing his affair to his friends <a href="Paloma%20Lopez-Fitzgerald">Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald</a> and <a href="Noah%20Bennett">Noah Bennett</a>, Chad repeatedly insists that he is not gay, and that his relationship with Vincent is based solely on sex. Whitney becomes increasingly suspicious of Chad's fidelity after discovering she is pregnant with their second child. Furious with Chad for continuing to sleep with Whitney, Vincent engineers a scenario in which Whitney sees Vincent and Chad having sex in the back of a <a href="gay%20bar">gay bar</a>; Whitney leaves Chad immediately and he distances himself from Vincent. The estranged couple start to reconcile as they try to help Theresa and <a href="Ethan%20Winthrop">Ethan Winthrop</a> reunite, but that possibility is cut short on August 28, 2007, when Chad is killed by Alistair while trying to protect his best friend Ethan. Chad dies professing his love for Whitney and their children.

Chad's possibly incestuous relationship led media outlets to sensationalize Harmony as the place where "half-siblings sleep with one another", and the 2006 revelation that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood was listed as one of "Passions" most shocking secrets by an article in "<a href="Soap%20Opera%20Digest">Soap Opera Digest</a>". Soapdom.com asserted that the plot enabled Divins to showcase his acting abilities and distinguish himself from his predecessor Swaby.

Media outlets expressed differing opinions over the exact nature of Chad's sexuality. Hartinger called Chad a "closeted bisexual", and the "<a href="Bay%20Area%20Reporter">Bay Area Reporter</a>" referred to him as a gay black man. An article on <a href="Logo%20TV">NewNowNext.com</a> listed Divins' interpretation of the character as a choice for the "Favorite Gay (Male) TV Character Poll". Soap opera journalist Roger Newcomb of <a href="Welovesoaps.net">We Love Soaps</a> questioned whether Chad was truly gay, arguing that Vincent's reveal as intersex leads to Chad's heterosexuality being "rescued" as he "was sleeping only with Vincent's female anatomy". <a href="Joel%20McHale">Joel McHale</a> from <a href="E%21">E!</a>'s weekly television series "<a href="The%20Soup">The Soup</a>" turned a scene in which Chad insisted he was "not gay" despite his affair with Vincent into a <a href="running%20gag">running gag</a> by referring to the character as "Not Gay Chad". During the show's season five premiere, Divins made a cameo appearance on "The Soup" to explain to McHale that he was not his character and was neither dead nor gay.

"Passions" made daytime history by being the first to depict two men having sex, but the pairing of Chad and Vincent drew less media attention than the gay relationships in "<a href="As%20the%20World%20Turns">As the World Turns</a>" and "<a href="One%20Life%20to%20Live">One Life to Live</a>". The complicated incest storyline was described as "insanely convoluted" by <a href="Gawker">Gawker</a>'s Kyle Buchanan, who felt it was one of "the most insane things that have ever happened on television"; the plotline was also praised, by Soaps.com, as reflecting the show's "unique perspective and zest for controversy" while challenging the "often too safe and predictable world of soaps". NewNowNext.com approved of the plotline for increasing the presence of LGBT people of color on daytime television, with Ross von Metze of Edge Media Network commenting that the show was "taking risks where other TV shows have failed".

Viewers were divided over the sexually explicit sequences between Chad and Vincent. Some felt the scenes between Chad and Vincent were "appalling" and inappropriate for daytime television, while one viewer praised the soap opera for "continu[ing] their outstanding jobs as they teach the people of today's world about daily life experiences". A writer from Soaps.com defended the show by pointing out graphic sex scenes between men and women were previously aired without complaint.

Chad's relationship with Vincent received some criticism, with "<a href="Windy%20City%20Times">Windy City Times</a>"; describing the storyline as "reckless" and "outrageous". According to <a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">"Slate"</a>'s Ta-Nehisi Coates, the storyline was also disliked by the show's black audience. Mike Perigard of the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" was critical of the timing of the death of lesbian Rae Thomas following the reveal of Chad's affair with a man; Perigard argued that Thomas's character was removed to reduce the number of gay characters on the show.

Interstate 94 in Michigan

Interstate 94 (I-94) is a part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> that runs from <a href="Billings%2C%20Montana">Billings, Montana</a>, to the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a> of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. In Michigan, it is a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that enters the state south of <a href="New%20Buffalo%2C%20Michigan">New Buffalo</a> and runs eastward through several metropolitan areas in the southern section of the state. The highway serves <a href="Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Benton Harbor</a>–<a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph</a> near <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> before turning inland toward <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a> and <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek</a> on the west side of the peninsula. Heading farther east, I-94 passes through rural areas in the middle of the southern Lower Peninsula, crossing <a href="Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">I-69</a> in the process. I-94 then runs through <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Jackson</a>, <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a>, and portions of <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metro Detroit</a>, connecting Michigan's largest city to its <a href="Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Wayne%20County%20Airport">main airport</a>. Past the east side of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, the Interstate angles northeasterly through farmlands in <a href="The%20Thumb">The Thumb</a> to <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>, where the designation terminates on the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> at the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canadian border</a>.

The first segment of what later became I-94 within the state, the Willow Run Expressway, was built near <a href="Ypsilanti%2C%20Michigan">Ypsilanti</a> and <a href="Belleville%2C%20Michigan">Belleville</a> in 1941, with an easterly extension to Detroit in 1945. This expressway was initially numbered M-112. In the mid-1950s, state and federal officials planned an Interstate to replace the original route of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">U.S. Highway 12</a> (US 12). By 1960, the length of I-94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo. Two years later, the US 12 designation was dropped from the freeway. Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed most of the rest of the route, including the remaining sections between Detroit and Port Huron which superseded the routing of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a>. The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed its connection across the state line. Since completion, I-94 has remained relatively unchanged; a few interchanges have been rebuilt, a second span was constructed for the Blue Water Bridge, and in 1987, <a href="Northwest%20Airlines%20Flight%20255">a plane crashed</a> on the freeway during take off from the airport in Detroit. The routing of I-94 is notable for containing the <a href="Ford%E2%80%93Lodge%20interchange">first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States</a>, connecting to the Lodge Freeway (<a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a>), and for comprising the first complete border-to-border toll-free freeway in a state in the United States. The highway has one auxiliary route, <a href="Interstate%20194%20%28Michigan%29">I-194</a>, which serves downtown Battle Creek, and eight <a href="business%20route">business route</a>s. Various segments have been dedicated to multiple people and places.

The entire length of I-94 is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The freeway carried 168,200 vehicles <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">on average</a> between <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> and Chene Street in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, which is the peak traffic count in 2015, and it carried 12,554 vehicles immediately west of the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> in <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>, the lowest traffic count in 2015. As the state trunkline highway closest to the lake shore in these areas, I-94 carries the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> south of <a href="Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Benton Harbor</a>–<a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph</a> and the <a href="Lake%20Huron%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Huron Circle Tour</a> in the Port Huron area. Sections through the Detroit area are named the Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways. I-94 in the state is either a four- or six-lane freeway for most of its length; one segment in the Detroit area has up to ten lanes total near the airport.

I-94 enters Michigan from Indiana south of New Buffalo. The freeway runs northeasterly through rural <a href="Michiana">Michiana</a> farmland in the southwestern corner of the Lower Peninsula and parallels the Lake Michigan shoreline about inland. I-94 traverses an area just east of the <a href="Warren%20Dunes%20State%20Park">Warren Dunes State Park</a> as the freeway runs parallel to the Red Arrow Highway, a former routing of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 12</a> (US 12) named after the <a href="32nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">32nd Infantry Division</a> (Red Arrow Division). The freeway crosses its companion highway south of St. Joseph; Red Arrow turns northward carrying the business loop for Benton Harbor and St. Joseph (<a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-94</a>, BL I-94). The Interstate curves further inland to bridge the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a> near Riverview Park. East of Benton Harbor, I-94 meets the Napier Avenue interchange, where <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a> merges onto the freeway. East of the <a href="Southwest%20Michigan%20Regional%20Airport">Southwest Michigan Regional Airport</a>, I-94/US 31 meets the southern end of <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a>; US 31 departs the I-94 freeway to follow I-196, and I-94 continues its course away from Lake Michigan.
South of <a href="Coloma%2C%20Michigan">Coloma</a>, the trunkline turns eastward and roughly follows the <a href="Paw%20Paw%20River">Paw Paw River</a> on a course that takes it south of <a href="Watervliet%2C%20Michigan">Watervliet</a> and <a href="Hartford%2C%20Michigan">Hartford</a>. Between the latter two cities, the freeway transitions from northeastern <a href="Berrien%20County%2C%20Michigan">Berrien County</a> into western <a href="Van%20Buren%20County%2C%20Michigan">Van Buren County</a>. It curves around and between Lake Cora and Threemile Lake near the junction with the northern end of <a href="M-51%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-51</a>. About further east, I-94 crosses <a href="M-40%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-40</a> south of <a href="Paw%20Paw%2C%20Michigan">Paw Paw</a>. Continuing eastward, the Interstate runs south of <a href="Mattawan%2C%20Michigan">Mattawan</a> before entering western <a href="Kalamazoo%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo County</a>.

In <a href="Texas%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Texas Township</a>, the freeway enters the western edges of the Kalamazoo suburbs. South of the campus for <a href="Western%20Michigan%20University">Western Michigan University</a>'s College of Engineering & Applied Sciences in <a href="Portage%2C%20Michigan">Portage</a>, I-94 intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a>. That other freeway also carries <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan%29">Kalamazoo's business loop</a> northward. Near the <a href="Kalamazoo/Battle%20Creek%20International%20Airport">Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport</a>, the Interstate passes into the southeastern corner of Kalamazoo before entering <a href="Comstock%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Comstock Township</a>. The freeway intersects the eastern end of the business loop at a partial interchange near Morrow Lake in the township. I-94 continues out of the eastern Kalamazoo suburbs, paralleling the <a href="Kalamazoo%20River">Kalamazoo River</a> through the <a href="Galesburg%2C%20Michigan">Galesburg</a> area. Before crossing into <a href="Calhoun%20County%2C%20Michigan">Calhoun County</a> on the west side of <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek</a>, I-94 has the only driveway on any of Michigan's Interstate Highways for a gate providing access for military vehicles into the <a href="Fort%20Custer%20Training%20Center">Fort Custer Training Center</a>.

The Interstate enters Calhoun County southwest of the <a href="W.%20K.%20Kellogg%20Airport">W. K. Kellogg Airport</a> and enters the city of Battle Creek. Immediately east of the county line, the freeway has an interchange with the western end of <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan%29">Battle Creek's business loop</a>. Next to the <a href="Lakeview%20Square%20Mall">Lakeview Square Mall</a>, I-94 meets its only auxiliary Interstate in Michigan: <a href="Interstate%20194%20%28Michigan%29">I-194</a>. I-94 turns to the northwest to round <a href="Beadle%20Lake">Beadle Lake</a>, intersecting <a href="M-294%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-294</a> before spanning the Kalamazoo River. East of the river crossing, the freeway meets an interchange for <a href="M-96%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-96</a>, <a href="M-311%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-311</a> and the eastern end of the Battle Creek business loop near the <a href="FireKeepers%20Casino%20Hotel">FireKeepers Casino Hotel</a> in <a href="Emmett%20Charter%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Emmett Township</a>. Turning back eastward, The Interstate exits the eastern Battle Creek suburbs and continues to an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">I-69</a> near <a href="Marshall%2C%20Michigan">Marshall</a>; the <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Marshall%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop for Marshall</a> follows I-69 southward.

Continuing eastward, I-94 traverses rural land on the north side of Marshall. The freeway runs north of, and parallel to, the Kalamazoo River through eastern Calhoun County. It angles southeasterly toward <a href="Albion%2C%20Michigan">Albion</a> before returning to an easterly course on the north side of town. I-94 crosses into western <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Michigan">Jackson County</a> before intersecting <a href="M-99%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-99</a>. From there, it runs generally due east with a jog around <a href="Parma%2C%20Michigan">Parma</a>. West of the <a href="Jackson%20County%20Airport%20%28Michigan%29">county airport</a>, the <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Jackson%2C%20Michigan%29">Jackson business loop</a> follows <a href="M-60%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-60</a> southward, and I-94 travels through the north side of <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Jackson</a>. North of downtown, <a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a> merges in from the north and <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> with I-94 around the city. Southeast of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Prison">Michigan State Prison</a>, US 127 departs to the south, and I-94 continues eastward through the rest of the county.
The freeway runs north of the Chrysler <a href="Chelsea%20Proving%20Grounds">Chelsea Proving Grounds</a> in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20Michigan">Chelsea</a> next to the <a href="M-52%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-52</a> interchange. As I-94 continues easterly, it passes into the western edge of the <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> area. West of downtown, the <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a> freeway splits off to the northeast, and the Interstate turns to the south and southeast to curve around the south side of the city. The freeway passes between the <a href="Briarwood%20Mall">Briarwood Mall</a> and the <a href="Ann%20Arbor%20Municipal%20Airport">Ann Arbor Municipal Airport</a>. On the southeastern corner of Ann Arbor, I-94 intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> and continues around the south side of <a href="Ypsilanti%2C%20Michigan">Ypsilanti</a>. South of that city, the freeway also carries US 12 and crosses the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a> north of the river's mouth at <a href="Ford%20Lake">Ford Lake</a>. I-94 jogs southeasterly around the south side of the <a href="Willow%20Run%20Airport">Willow Run Airport</a> complex, separating from US 12 and entering <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wayne County</a>.
South of Willow Run, the Interstate parallels the north shore of <a href="Belleville%20Lake">Belleville Lake</a>. East of the water body, it intersects <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> near the northwest corner of <a href="Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Wayne%20County%20Airport">Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a> and angles northeasterly through the southwestern Detroit suburbs along the Detroit Industrial Freeway. I-94 uses the <a href="Gateway%20Bridge%20%28Michigan%29">Gateway Bridge</a> over the single-point interchange at <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> (Telegraph Road) in <a href="Taylor%2C%20Michigan">Taylor</a>; these bridges were inspired by <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XL">Super Bowl XL</a> and provide a western entrance to the city. Further east, the Interstate intersects <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> (Southfield Freeway) and passes the <a href="Uniroyal%20Giant%20Tire">Uniroyal Giant Tire</a> in <a href="Allen%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Allen Park</a>. I-94 then turns to the northeast through the <a href="Ford%20River%20Rouge%20Complex">Ford River Rouge Complex</a> in <a href="Dearborn%2C%20Michigan">Dearborn</a> before turning back easterly on the Edsel Ford Freeway into Detroit.

I-94 traverses Detroit in an east–west direction well inland of, and parallel to, the <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit River</a>. The freeway intersects <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> (Jeffries Freeway) and <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> (Lodge Freeway) on the West Side, passing the main campus of <a href="Wayne%20State%20University">Wayne State University</a> before entering the East Side at <a href="M-1%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-1</a> (Woodward Avenue). Immediately east of the interchange with <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> (Chrysler Freeway), I-94 forms the southern border of the <a href="Milwaukee%20Junction">Milwaukee Junction</a> district. The Edsel Ford Freeway continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit's East Side. The Interstate turns more northerly, mimicking the shoreline of <a href="Lake%20St.%20Clair">Lake St. Clair</a>, and exits Detroit for <a href="Harper%20Woods%2C%20Michigan">Harper Woods</a>. Just north of the interchange for <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a> (Vernier Road), the freeway crosses 8 Mile Road and enters <a href="Macomb%20County%2C%20Michigan">Macomb County</a>.

Running northward through Macomb County, I-94 meets the eastern end of <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> (Reuther Freeway) about north of the county line in <a href="St.%20Clair%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair Shores</a>. The freeway continues to parallel the lakeshore, and travels to the west of <a href="Selfridge%20Air%20National%20Guard%20Base">Selfridge Air National Guard Base</a> in <a href="Harrison%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Harrison Township</a>. It turns back to the northeast at 23 Mile Road at the interchange with <a href="M-3%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-3</a> and <a href="M-29%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-29</a>. North of 26 Mile Road, the freeway exits the northern suburbs and passes into farmland in <a href="The%20Thumb">The Thumb</a> region.
South of Michigan Meadows Golf Course, I-94 crosses County Line Road and enters <a href="St.%20Clair%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair County</a>. The freeway continues northeasterly as far as <a href="Marysville%2C%20Michigan">Marysville</a> before turning northward near the <a href="St.%20Clair%20County%20International%20Airport">St. Clair County International Airport</a>. From there, it runs roughly parallel to the <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair River</a>. The Interstate travels along the western edge of residential areas for Marysville and Port Huron as it continues northward. Immediately west of downtown Port Huron, it intersects I-69; the two freeways merge and turn first east and then north through an interchange that also features connections to <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-69</a>.

I-94/I-69 turns back to the east about a mile (1.6 km) north of their confluence to span the <a href="Black%20River%20%28St.%20Clair%20County%29">Black River</a> north of downtown. On the eastern bank of the river, there is one final interchange for <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> and BL I-69/<a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-94</a> before the freeway reaches the toll and customs plazas for the twin-span Blue Water Bridge. Past these plazas, I-94/I-69 ascends the approach to the bridge which crosses the St. Clair River to <a href="Point%20Edward%2C%20Ontario">Point Edward</a> (<a href="Sarnia">Sarnia</a>), Ontario. At the international boundary at the center of the river, the Interstate designations jointly terminate, becoming <a href="Ontario%20Highway%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B402">Ontario Highway 402</a>.

The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> foot trails. One of these, the St. Joseph Trail, followed the general route of the modern I-94 across the state from the <a href="Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Benton Harbor</a>–<a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph</a> area east to the <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> area. The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a> was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a>; at the time, Division 6 corresponded to the rough path of today's I-94. In 1919, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and three different highways followed sections of the modern I-94 corridor. The original <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a> ran from the Indiana state line north to <a href="Coloma%2C%20Michigan">Coloma</a> where <a href="M-17%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-17</a> connected easterly to <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>. The third highway was <a href="M-19%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-19</a> from Detroit northeast to <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>.

On November 11, 1926, the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> was approved by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> (AASHO), and the original route of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> replaced the highways from the state line northeasterly to Detroit; <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a> overlapped the highway between <a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph</a> and <a href="Watervliet%2C%20Michigan">Watervliet</a>. The remainder of the future I-94 corridor was served by <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a> between Detroit and Port Huron. The first span of the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> opened between Port Huron and <a href="Point%20Edward%2C%20Ontario">Point Edward, Ontario</a>, in 1938.

The first segments of upgraded highways along the future route of I-94 were added during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Construction on the Willow Run Expressway started in 1941 before the US entered the war. It was opened on September 12, 1942, to provide improved access to <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a>'s <a href="Willow%20Run">Willow Run</a> bomber plants. The highway was given the M-112 designation at the time. The <a href="limited-access%20highway">expressway</a> was extended eastward as the Detroit Industrial Expressway into Detroit; the first section opened in 1943 and the remainder was completed in March 1945. Land acquisition for the Edsel Ford Freeway started in 1945. Originally referred to as the Crosstown Freeway, the freeway became known as the Edsel Ford Freeway following an April 1946 petition. The <a href="Ford%E2%80%93Lodge%20interchange">interchange between the Lodge Freeway and the Edsel Ford Freeway</a> was built in 1953 as the first full freeway-to-freeway interchange in the United States. In mid-1956, the M-112 designation was decommissioned and replaced by a rerouted US 12. During the mid-1950s, the <a href="Detroit%20Streets%20and%20Rails">Detroit Streets and Rails</a> campaign proposed a high-speed rail line in the median of the Willow Run, Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways; instead of building the rail line, special boarding stations adjacent to dedicated bus lanes in the interchanges along the highway were used.

In other parts of the state, other segments of highway were built to bypass the cities along the future I-94 corridor. In 1940, a southern bypass of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue, and the former routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became Business US 12 (Bus. US 12). In late 1951 or early 1952, a northerly bypass of Jackson opened, and the former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus. US 12. By the next year, the western half of the Jackson bypass opened, including a bypass of <a href="Parma%2C%20Michigan">Parma</a>. In 1954, a new bypass of Kalamazoo and Galesburg opened; US 12 was rerouted to follow the new highway while <a href="M-96%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-96</a> replaced part of the old route and US 12A in the area.

The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> included a highway along I-94's route in Michigan. This highway was included on the 1955 plan for the "National System of Interstate and Defense Highways" with a proposed spur in the Battle Creek area. The modern I-94 was numbered I-92 between Benton Harbor–St. Joseph and Detroit with I-77 from Detroit to Port Huron in the August 1957 plans.
In April 1958, the MSHD wanted to provide a single number for a more direct routing of a Detroit–Chicago freeway; the state proposed rerouting I-94 to replace I-92 in the state, but retained the I-77 designation. On June 27, 1958, AASHO adopted their original numbering plan for Michigan, minus the state's proposed changes. Around the same time, a section of <a href="M-146%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-146</a> near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge.

In January 1959, officials announced that sections of US 12, the Willow Run, Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford expressways were to be given the I-94 designation, temporarily co-designated with US 12. These sections connected Ann Arbor to Detroit, along with a bypass of Kalamazoo to Galesburg and a bypass of Jackson. Later that year, additional segments of I-94 were opened, starting with a section from Hartford to Coloma, then another from Paw Paw to Kalamazoo which connected with a segment between Galesburg to Battle Creek. The overall section from Paw Paw to Battle Creek was dedicated on December 7, 1959. In addition, a new northwest–southeast section of freeway was built east of Ypsilanti to create a more gradual curve in the routing between present-day exits 185 and 186, the original routing of the Willow Run Expressway having followed present-day Wiard Road. Signage for the state's Interstate Highways was placed on hold pending finalization of the numbering scheme, and by late 1959 that signage was being added starting with I-75 and followed by the other open segments of freeway in the state.

Sections of freeway opened in southwestern Michigan in 1960 between the Benton Harbor–St Joseph area and between Jackson and Ann Arbor; the latter was built over existing portions of US 12. In this year, Michigan became the first state to complete a border-to-border toll-free Interstate within their state, running for from Detroit toward New Buffalo, creating the longest toll-free freeway in the country at the time.

In January 1962, the US 12 designation was removed from the I-94 freeway. In the process, the designation was transferred to replace the US 112 designation in its entirety. After this transfer, I-94 was no longer concurrent with US 12, except for the Ypsilanti bypass. In 1963, the freeway was extended south of New Buffalo to end at <a href="M-239%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-239</a>. Traffic was diverted down M-239 into Indiana where <a href="Indiana%20State%20Road%2039">State Road 39</a> carried traffic the rest of the way to the <a href="Indiana%20Toll%20Road">Indiana Toll Road</a>. By the end of the year, a section of highway opened between Mount Clemens and Marysville, and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a> was rerouted to run concurrently along the freeway from the New Baltimore area northward.
The eastern terminus of I-94 in the Port Huron area was dedicated on October 14, 1964, signaling the completion of the highway between Marysville and the Blue Water Bridge. This completion displaced part of the M-146 bypass of Port Huron, the southern leg of which was retained as a connector to present-day Lapeer Road. Two years later, the gap between the Wayne–Macomb county line and the end of the freeway near Mount Clemens was filled in when another section of freeway opened. In late 1964, a plan was approved to improve the interchange with Telegraph Road (<a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a>), as the original interchange did not feature access in all directions. North of <a href="Albion%2C%20Michigan">Albion</a>, the route of the freeway previously crossed a branch of the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a> at-grade; the crossing was eliminated when the tracks were removed in 1968.

The sections originally designated as the Willow Run Expressway were rebuilt from Rawsonville Road in <a href="Belleville%2C%20Michigan">Belleville</a> to Ozga Road in <a href="Romulus%2C%20Michigan">Romulus</a> starting in 1972. As part of this reconstruction, the segment between Haggerty Road and Ozga Road was widened from four to six lanes, and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a>, a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time. The Willow Run segment was also resurfaced at this point, as the old road bed did not contain steel mesh. Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive.

The final section of I-94 in Michigan opened to traffic on November 2, 1972, when the connection across the state line into Indiana was dedicated. This last segment in Michigan between M-239 and the state line opened when Indiana completed an segment of freeway in their state.

The interchange with the Southfield Freeway (<a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a>) was closed entirely in 1985 to replace the original exit design, which included four on-ramps that sharply merged into the left lanes of I-94. Reconstruction added new on-ramps that merge into the freeway's right lane, while also moving the carriageways of I-94 closer together.
On August 16, 1987, <a href="Northwest%20Airlines%20Flight%20255">Northwest Airlines Flight 255</a> crashed after attempting to take off from <a href="Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Wayne%20County%20Airport">Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a>, killing all but one passenger upon exploding at the I-94 overpass over Middlebelt Road; that overpass was not damaged in the crash. The freeway was closed until August 18, and a memorial was later installed near the interchange between I-94 and Middlebelt Road.

The completion of I-69 in the 1980s, and the approval of the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>, increased traffic at the Blue Water Bridge. A new toll and customs plaza was built in 1991, and later the next year, an international task force determined that traffic on the existing structure was exceeding capacity. Environmental planning started in 1993, and construction started on the second span between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario in 1995. In July 1997, the second span opened. The original span was closed for rehabilitation, and both were opened to traffic in 1999.

The interchange with US 24 (Telegraph Road) following its mid-1960s redesign had only two bridges, and left hand exits were used throughout. This interchange was reconfigured in 2005 to a <a href="single-point%20urban%20interchange">single-point urban interchange</a> (SPUI) design that was completed in December of that year. A pair of bridges called the <a href="Gateway%20Bridge%20%28Michigan%29">Gateway Arch Bridges</a> (alternately "Gateway to Detroit") was incorporated in the new interchange.

In 2011, construction was started to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge and to allow for dedicated local traffic and bridge traffic lanes. The lane configuration changes confused drivers in the area, especially motorists with outdated <a href="GPS">GPS</a> devices; because of this, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.

Additional construction in the Port Huron area started in late 2013 to rebuild and reconfigure the I-94/I-69 interchange outside the city. The project improved of freeway, replaced several bridges and ramps and cost $76 million (equivalent to $ in ). In June 2014, MDOT closed the ramps from I-69 eastbound to BL I-69 through the interchange until later in the year. The project was completed in September 2015.

In 2016, the sections of I-94 from the Indiana state line to the <a href="M-63%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-63</a> interchange was designated as part of the <a href="West%20Michigan%20Pike%20Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway</a>. The West Michigan Pike originated in efforts in the 1910s to improve a highway along the western part of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and to increase tourism along the Lake Michigan shore. The <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a> was eventually superseded by US 12 and US 31 after the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> in 1926.

MDOT announced in November 2018 that the stretch from I-96 to Conner Avenue within the Detroit city limits would undergo a complete reconstruction project in the 2020s. This project is slated to include new pavement and lighting, and the replacement of 67 bridges.

As the original <a href="limited-access%20highway">expressway</a> through the center of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s, it was unofficially named the Harper–McGraw Expressway after the streets along which it was to run. There was some initial support to name it after <a href="Roy%20Chapin">Roy Chapin</a>, the late president of the <a href="Hudson%20Motor%20Car%20Company">Hudson Motor Car Company</a> and a former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce">United States Secretary of Commerce</a> under President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>. On April 23, 1946, the <a href="Detroit%20Common%20Council">Detroit Common Council</a> voted instead to name the highway after <a href="Edsel%20Ford">Edsel Ford</a>, the son of <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> and president of the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a> from 1918 until his death in 1943.

Two other original sections of I-94's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names. The westernmost of these is the Willow Run Expressway, named for the <a href="Willow%20Run">Willow Run</a> complex. The plants at Willow Run produced <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bombers for Ford Motor Company during World War II. The second, the Detroit Industrial Expressway, continued the route of the Willow Run Expressway eastward into Detroit. Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial plants at Willow Run during the war and were later incorporated into I-94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit–Chicago highway.

The section of I-94 northeast of Detroit was named after former Congressman <a href="James%20G.%20O%27Hara">James G. O'Hara</a> by the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a>. O'Hara was a World War II veteran who served in the <a href="United%20States%20House">United States House</a> from 1959 until 1977. During his tenure in Congress, he procured federal funds for the construction of I-94 through his district. The first attempt to name the highway after him failed in 1991, but the honor was included in a budget bill passed in 1997. The section of I-94 was dedicated on October 16, 1998, after donors privately raised nearly $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to pay for the highway signs.

A segment of I-94 in <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek</a> between the exits for <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-94</a> (BL I-94) and <a href="Interstate%20194%20%28Michigan%29">I-194</a> was named the 94th Combat Infantry Division Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature in 2002. The name honors the US Army's <a href="94th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">94th Infantry Division</a>, which was activated at the nearby <a href="Fort%20Custer%20Training%20Center">Fort Custer</a> in 1942 and served with distinction in the European theatre of World War II. Because the unit originated in Battle Creek, and its number matched that of the freeway, the Legislature added the designation by passing Public Act 305 of 2002. The name was dedicated in ceremonies at a rest stop along the section of I-94 on September 28, 2002.

Another piece of I-94 in Calhoun County was designated in 2004 as part of the Underground Railroad Memorial Highway. Starting in 1990, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> started working to identify routes of the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. The Battle Creek area was active in the railroad during the Civil War, and the section of I-94 between exits 98 and 110 east of Battle Creek was included in the memorial designation.

In June 2012, after a resolution passed by the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> was signed by Gov. Rick Snyder, a portion of I-94 in <a href="Taylor%2C%20Michigan">Taylor</a> between Inkster and Pelham roads was named the "Auxiliary Lt. Dan Kromer Memorial Highway" after a 20-year veteran of the Taylor Police Department, who was killed in 2010 while helping motorists who had car trouble.

There are nine highways related to I-94 in Michigan. The first is the spur into downtown <a href="Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan">Battle Creek</a> numbered I-194 and nicknamed "The Penetrator" and officially called the "Sojourner Truth Downtown Parkway". This <a href="List%20of%20auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highways">auxiliary Interstate Highway</a> runs for about to connect I-94 northward into downtown. The other eight highways are <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s of I-94 that connect various cities' downtowns with the main freeway. Unlike I-194, these loops are not freeways. Located from west to east along I-94's routing in Michigan, they serve <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan%29">Benton Harbor–St. Joseph</a>, <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan%29">Kalamazoo</a>, <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Battle%20Creek%2C%20Michigan%29">Battle Creek</a>, <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Marshall%2C%20Michigan%29">Marshall</a>, <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Albion%2C%20Michigan%29">Albion</a>, <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Jackson%2C%20Michigan%29">Jackson</a>, <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan%29">Ann Arbor</a>, and <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">Port Huron</a>.

Venture Science Fiction

Venture Science Fiction was an American <a href="Digest%20size">digest-size</a> <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, first published from 1957 to 1958, and revived for a brief run in 1969 and 1970. Ten issues were published of the 1950s version, with another six in the second run. It was founded in both instances as a companion to "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>"; <a href="Robert%20P.%20Mills">Robert P. Mills</a> edited the 1950s version, and <a href="Edward%20L.%20Ferman">Edward L. Ferman</a> was editor during the second run. A British edition appeared for 28 issues between 1963 and 1965; it reprinted material from "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction" as well as from the US edition of "Venture". There was also an Australian edition, which was identical to the British version but dated two months later.

The original version was only moderately successful, although it is remembered for the first publication of <a href="Sturgeon%27s%20Law">Sturgeon's Law</a>. The publisher, <a href="Joseph%20Ferman">Joseph Ferman</a> (father of Edward Ferman), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action and adventure; the resulting fiction contained more sex and violence than was usual for the science fiction (sf) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian Mike Ashley has suggested that the magazine was ahead of its time. It succumbed to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more successful, with less attractive cover art and little in the way of notable fiction, though it did publish <a href="Vonda%20McIntyre">Vonda McIntyre</a>'s first story. By the end of 1970, "Venture" had ceased publication permanently.

In late 1949, publisher <a href="Lawrence%20E.%20Spivak">Lawrence E. Spivak</a> launched "The Magazine of Fantasy", one of many new titles in a crowded field of genre magazines. The title was changed to "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>" (usually abbreviated to "F&SF") with the second issue, and the new magazine rapidly became successful and influential within the science fiction field. The editors were <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a> and <a href="J.%20Francis%20McComas">J. Francis McComas</a>, and the managing editor was <a href="Robert%20P.%20Mills">Robert P. Mills</a>. In 1954, <a href="Joseph%20W.%20Ferman">Joseph Ferman</a>, a partner of Spivak's, bought the magazine from him. Ferman subsequently decided to launch a companion magazine, and gave it to Mills to edit.

The new magazine was titled "Venture Science Fiction", and the first issue was dated January 1957. Mills was managing editor of "F&SF" throughout "Venture"'s first run; he became editor of "F&SF" shortly after "Venture" ceased publishing in July 1958. The editorial philosophy was laid out by Ferman in the inaugural issue: "strong stories of action and adventure ... There will be two prime requisites for "Venture" stories: In the first place, each must be a well-told "story", with a beginning, middle and end; in the second place, each must be a strong story—a story with pace, power and excitement." Ferman hoped to take advantage of a gap in the science fiction magazine market opened up by the demise of "<a href="Planet%20Stories">Planet Stories</a>", one of the last sf pulps, which had ceased publication in late 1955. "Planet Stories" had focused on adventure stories, as opposed to the realistic style becoming more popular in science fiction in the 1950s, and Ferman hoped to combine the virtues of the melodramatic pulp fiction style with the literary values that were key to "F&SF"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s success. "Venture"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bias towards action-oriented adventure led to stories with relatively more sex and violence than those in competing magazines, and sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> has commented that it was perhaps five or ten years ahead of its time. One story, "The Girl Had Guts", by <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, involved an alien virus that caused its victims to vomit up their intestines; Ashley records a reviewer saying that the story made him physically ill.

<a href="Ed%20Emshwiller">Ed Emshwiller</a> supplied eight of the ten covers; he had sold several covers to "F&SF" by this time, so his work reinforced the sense of connection between the two magazines. Emshwiller also contributed interior illustrations in the first issue, but the main interior artist was John Giunta, with <a href="John%20Schoenherr">John Schoenherr</a> contributing some of his earliest work to several of the later issues.

Some well-known writers appeared during this incarnation of "Venture", including <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>, <a href="Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>, <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>, and <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>. Not all the fiction was adventure oriented. For example, Sturgeon's story "The Comedian's Children" tells of a telethon host and his relationship with his sponsors, and <a href="Leigh%20Brackett">Leigh Brackett</a>'s "All the Colors of the Rainbow" deals with racism after aliens have contacted humanity. These and other examples can be regarded as stories of character with strong themes, in keeping with Ferman's stated goals in his inaugural editorial. "Venture" was also the place that "<a href="Sturgeon%27s%20Law">Sturgeon's Law</a>" first saw print. This adage is now usually seen in the form "90% of everything is crap". It was formulated by Sturgeon in about 1951, and a version of it appeared in the March 1958 issue of "Venture", under the name "Sturgeon's Revelation".

An editorial, "Venturings," appeared in each issue of the first series; after Ferman used the first one as a platform for editorial policy, it was usually written by Mills, who occasionally turned the column over to letters from SF figures. The very last editorial, in July 1958, featured a eulogy of <a href="Cyril%20M.%20Kornbluth">C.M. Kornbluth</a> by <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, and one of <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a> by Sturgeon. Kornbluth and Kuttner had died within two months of each other earlier that year.

Sturgeon began a book review column, "On Hand . . . Offhand", in the July 1957 issue that continued for the rest of the magazine's run. This was Sturgeon's first review column; more than a decade later he wrote a similar column for "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>". The January 1958 issue saw the first in a series of four science articles by Asimov that also continued until "Venture" folded. The series was transferred to "F&SF", beginning with the November 1958 issue, and eventually ran to 399 consecutive articles; it is not often remembered that it began in "F&SF"'s short-lived companion magazine.

"Venture" kept to a steady bimonthly schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though since many of the competitors lasted for only one or two issues, "Venture" can be thought of as at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, "No Limits", was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed to Joseph Ferman as editor.

In December 1959, a British edition of "F&SF" appeared from Atlas Publishing and Distributing Limited, a London-based publisher. Atlas had published a British edition of "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Analog</a>" (formerly "Astounding Science Fiction") since 1939. In 1963 the abolition of import restrictions meant that "Analog" could be directly imported, and since there was no longer a need for a British edition, Atlas decided to start a new sf magazine to replace it. The new "Venture Science Fiction" drew many of its stories from the US version, but it also reprinted from the late 1950s "F&SF", since there had been no British edition of that magazine until the end of 1959. Within a year Atlas decided to abandon their edition of "F&SF" as well; the last issue appeared in June 1964.

The British version of "Venture" began in September 1963, and ran for 28 numbered issues, through December 1965; the editor was Ronald R. Wickers. The stories selected from "F&SF" for the UK edition of "Venture" did not overlap with material already reprinted in the UK edition of "F&SF". The first five issues had pictorial covers, but thereafter the cover simply listed the names of the contributing authors. This unattractive presentation, and the lack of much in the way of interior artwork, probably hurt sales. Atlas's stated reason for ending the magazine was that it was "due to the expiration of available material", but there were in fact many stories available to reprint. It is more likely that the real reason was that the US edition of "F&SF" was by then easily available in the UK, and that circulation was falling.

Atlas also published an Australian edition, which was identical to the British edition except that it was dated two months later; the issues ran from November 1963 to February 1966.

A little over ten years after the first US edition ceased, a new version appeared, again as a companion to "F&SF". This time the magazine was quarterly. The debut issue was dated May 1969, and it was edited by <a href="Edward%20L.%20Ferman">Edward L. Ferman</a>—son of Joseph Ferman—who was also the editor of "F&SF". There was no statement of editorial intent for this version, but the policy was straightforward: a novel was presented in each issue. Although these were substantially cut, they still took up most of the magazine, with the result that the other stories tended to be very short. As in the first incarnation, the contents were of fairly good quality, with contributions from well-known writers. However, the magazine was no more successful than before, and lasted for only six quarterly issues; the last issue was August 1970.

The condensed novels that appeared in this version of "Venture" included "Hour of the Horde", by <a href="Gordon%20R.%20Dickson">Gordon R. Dickson</a>; "Plague Ship", by <a href="Harry%20Harrison%20%28writer%29">Harry Harrison</a>; "Star Treasure", by <a href="Keith%20Laumer">Keith Laumer</a>; and "Beastchild", by <a href="Dean%20R.%20Koontz">Dean R. Koontz</a>. The short fiction included little of note, though "The Snows Are Melted, the Snows Are Gone", an early story by <a href="James%20Tiptree%2C%20Jr.">James Tiptree, Jr.</a>, appeared in 1969, and "Breaking Point", by <a href="Vonda%20McIntyre">Vonda McIntyre</a>, was published in February 1970. "Breaking Point" was McIntyre's first published fiction, but, perhaps because it was published as by "V. N. McIntyre", it has been missed by several bibliographers. There was also a <a href="Reginald%20Bretnor">Reginald Bretnor</a> <a href="Feghoot">Feghoot</a> story in each issue: these were a series of very short stories, based on bad puns, that had begun in "F&SF" the previous year.

<a href="Ron%20Goulart">Ron Goulart</a> contributed a book review column to each issue of the second incarnation, and there was an occasional film review. This version of "Venture" did not credit the artists, but most of the covers were signed by Bert Tanner, who was listed on the masthead as the art director. Tanner's cover art was much less distinguished than Emshwiller's work for the first run of the magazine, and it is likely that this had a negative effect on sales: Tanner's work has been likened to "pencil sketches overlaid by a single color". Tanner also contributed much, but not all, of the interior art; other artists who can by identified by their signatures include Emshwiller, Derek Carter, and <a href="Bhob%20Stewart">Bhob Stewart</a>, who illustrated Tiptree's story in the November 1969 issue.

For the first incarnation, "Venture" was priced at 35 cents throughout, and maintained a 128-page count along with a regular bimonthly schedule, starting with January 1957 and ending with the July 1958 issue. The first volume had six numbers, and the second had four. The British edition was numbered consecutively from 1 to 28 without any volume numbers, and was priced at 2/6 (₤0.) until the July 1964 issue, after which the price was 3/- (₤0.15). The second US version began in May 1969 with volume 3 number 1, and maintained a regular quarterly schedule until the last issue in August 1970. Each issue was priced at 60 cents, and like its predecessor had a page count of 128.

After the first US edition ceased publication, "F&SF" added the line "including "Venture Science Fiction"" to the masthead, in order to ensure that the publisher retained the rights to the title. The line reappeared in February 1971, several months after the failure of the second US edition, and was finally dropped in February 1990.

Homicide: Life on the Street (season 2)

The second season of "", an American <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> drama television series, originally aired in the United States between January 6 and January 27, 1994. Due to low <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> during the , <a href="NBC">NBC</a> executives decided to order only a four-episode season, after which they would evaluate the ratings and decide whether to renew the show. "Homicide" was moved to a new timeslot of Thursdays at 10 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>, temporarily replacing the legal drama "<a href="L.A.%20Law">L.A. Law</a>". NBC requested several changes from the series, including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and <a href="jump%20cut">jump cut</a>s.

The entire "Homicide" cast returned for the second season. The uncertainty over "Homicide"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s future was stressful for the cast and crew, and the logistics of scheduling the filming around the actors' schedules was difficult. <a href="Daniel%20Baldwin">Daniel Baldwin</a> publicly criticized NBC Entertainment president <a href="Warren%20Littlefield">Warren Littlefield</a> over the matter, and it was initially reported <a href="Ned%20Beatty">Ned Beatty</a> would not return at all. The second season was the last to include original cast member <a href="Jon%20Polito">Jon Polito</a>, who was reportedly dismissed because NBC officials were unhappy with his physical appearance. Polito was publicly critical of the show after his dismissal.

The second season marked the debut of <a href="Jean%20de%20Segonzac">Jean de Segonzac</a> as director of photography and Chris Tergesen as music coordinator. The season premiere, "", was the last of the four episodes filmed, but it was the first to be broadcast due to a guest appearance by <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a>, which NBC hoped would lead to improved ratings. "Bop Gun" differed from other "Homicide" episodes because it focused entirely on one story: the murder of a tourist and its impact on her husband, played by Williams. The episodes "" and "" featured a suspected police shooting, which was based on a real-life incident in <a href="David%20Simon">David Simon</a>'s book "".

In addition to Williams, several actors made guest appearances throughout the second season, including <a href="Julianna%20Margulies">Julianna Margulies</a>, <a href="Wilford%20Brimley">Wilford Brimley</a>, <a href="Isaiah%20Washington">Isaiah Washington</a>, <a href="Adrienne%20Shelly">Adrienne Shelly</a> and a 13-year-old <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>. "Homicide" received generally positive reviews during the season, and the show received one <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy</a> nomination for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%20-%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series</a> for Williams. The "Bop Gun" script won a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a>. "Homicide" was often compared to the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> police drama series "<a href="NYPD%20Blue">NYPD Blue</a>", which Baldwin called "the knockoff of "Homicide"". While ratings improved during the second season, NBC still demanded further changes to the show before committing to a . The first and second seasons of Homicide were released together in a four-<a href="DVD">DVD</a> box-set on May 27, 2003.

<a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> for "Homicide: Life on the Street" had gradually declined throughout the , leaving the show at high risk of cancellation by the time the season concluded. NBC executives asked for several refinements – including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and jump cuts – before approving a second season. Executive producer <a href="Tom%20Fontana">Tom Fontana</a> said he was willing "to do anything to keep NBC from forgetting us", although executive producer <a href="Barry%20Levinson">Barry Levinson</a> said the show would maintain its realistic visual style, claiming, "We want a camera that's almost a participant in the show." "Homicide" was ultimately renewed, but the producers slightly toned down the show's bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif, and focused more strongly on single stories rather than multiple subplots. Fontana said, "We were experimenting with our first nine episodes. Whenever you try something new, you tend to err on the side of breaking ground. But we'd rather have more people watching, so the colors and lighting are slightly brighter, and the camera movements are not as jarring." However, both Levinson and Fontana insisted the changes were not entirely due to network pressure, but rather were evolutionary developments for the series.

NBC ordered a four-episode second season, which would be broadcast in January 1994 as a mid-year replacement. A decision about whether to renew the show for a would then be made based on how those four episodes performed in the ratings. David P. Kalat, author of "Homicide: Life on the Street – The Unofficial Companion", credited NBC Entertainment president <a href="Warren%20Littlefield">Warren Littlefield</a> with that move, although Levinson claimed NBC West Coast president <a href="Don%20Ohlmeyer">Don Ohlmeyer</a> was behind the decision. Ohlmeyer said he believed a better timeslot, less dense stories and less hand-held photography would attract more viewers and help the show succeed better: "For it to succeed long-term, there's a humanity that needs to be brought to the characters. There's more here than there was last year." Littlefield said of "Homicide", "It's a show we think has tremendous potential that was not fully realized in the first nine episodes. And that's why we want to make more."
"Homicide" was moved from its previous timeslot of Wednesdays at 9 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> to a new time on Thursdays at 10 p.m. Levinson and the other series producers considered this an extremely positive move for the show, as "Homicide" suffered greatly in the ratings on Wednesdays due to competition from the highly rated <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> comedy block featuring "<a href="Home%20Improvement%20%28TV%20series%29">Home Improvement</a>" and "<a href="Coach%20%28TV%20series%29">Coach</a>". Even during the first season, Levinson often said the series was truly designed for a 10 p.m. timeslot. "Homicide" took the timeslot previously held by the legal drama "<a href="L.A.%20Law">L.A. Law</a>", which was placed on a six-week hiatus from December 23 until early February. With some critics claiming "L.A. Law" had declined in quality, the hiatus led to speculation that it would be canceled and "Homicide" would replace it. This led to some tension during an NBC reception when "L.A. Law" star <a href="Corbin%20Bernsen">Corbin Bernsen</a> approached "Homicide" actor <a href="Richard%20Belzer">Richard Belzer</a> and shouted expletives at him, yelling, "You stole our timeslot!"

The producers of "Homicide" said the decision to evaluate the series after a four-episode season placed tremendous pressure on the staff of the show. Fontana said one-hour dramas need time to fully develop and allow audiences to become familiar with the characters. Fontana expressed frustration with NBC in some news interviews, claiming the networks seemed to lack the courage to either cancel or renew it: "They will run it in a 10 p.m. time period for a month and then they'll kiss us goodbye. ... I'm used to this kind of treatment from NBC. I'm a little surprised they'd treat Barry Levinson the same way they'd treat me." In other interviews, however, Fontana said he saw the decision as a sign of support: "This is not just a casual action on NBC's part. It's a real statement to me that we have a possibility to return." Levinson said he believed "four shots are better than nothing", adding:

What I learned is that it is very hard for a network to make a real commitment. A hit-and-run sensibility is prevalent. ... In all fairness to NBC, this is a tougher kind of show than any other show they carry. It is different, and no one is going to endorse different in this world, no one celebrates different.

"Homicide" was produced by Levinson's company <a href="Baltimore%20Pictures">Baltimore Pictures</a>, which had partnered with <a href="Alan%20Landsburg%20Productions">Reeves Entertainment</a> during the first season. However, Reeves Entertainment went out of business after the first season concluded, so NBC bought into the show and formally became a co-producer, which gave the network more latitude to demand creative changes. The second season marked the debut of <a href="Jean%20de%20Segonzac">Jean de Segonzac</a> as director of photography. He replaced <a href="Wayne%20Ewing">Wayne Ewing</a>, who Levinson felt was too inexperienced and did not trust with the responsibility of managing the show's cinematography. Among Segonzac's film credits was "<a href="Laws%20of%20Gravity%20%28film%29">Laws of Gravity</a>" (1992), which was directed by <a href="Nick%20Gomez">Nick Gomez</a>, who directed the "Homicide" first-season episode "".

Season premiere "Bop Gun" was directed by <a href="Stephen%20Gyllenhaal">Stephen Gyllenhaal</a>, a feature director then-best known for such films as "<a href="Waterland%20%28film%29">Waterland</a>" (1992) and "<a href="A%20Dangerous%20Woman%20%281993%20film%29">A Dangerous Woman</a>" (1993). Chris Menaul directed the back-to-back episodes "See No Evil" and "Black and Blue", while the season finale, "A Many Splendored Thing", was directed by <a href="John%20McNaughton">John McNaughton</a>, who previously directed "Homicide" star Belzer in the film "<a href="Mad%20Dog%20and%20Glory">Mad Dog and Glory</a>" (1993). The second season included much of the same crew as the first: in addition to executive producers Levinson and Fontana, <a href="Jim%20Finnerty">Jim Finnerty</a> returned as supervising producer, Debbie Sarjeant worked as associate supervisor and screenwriter James Yoshimura became story editor starting with the second season, with <a href="Bonnie%20Mark">Bonnie Mark</a> as a staff writer and Chris Friel as a script supervisor. Other crew included Cindy Mollo as editor, <a href="Vincent%20Peranio">Vincent Peranio</a> as production designer, Susan Kessel as set decorator, Roland Berman as costume designer, Ivan Fonseca as post-production coordinator, Bruce Litkey as sound mixer and Louis DiGiaimo and Pat Moran as casting directors. <a href="Ted%20Zachary">Ted Zachary</a> and Allan Chaflin worked as the executives in charge of production.

Almost the entire original cast from season one returned for the second season, including Daniel Baldwin, Ned Beatty, Richard Belzer, Andre Braugher, Clark Johnson, Yaphet Kotto, Melissa Leo, Jon Polito and Kyle Secor. The only permanent cast member not to return was <a href="Wendy%20Hughes">Wendy Hughes</a>, who previously played medical examiner Carol Blythe; her absence was never explained on-screen. While the rest of the cast was contractually obliged to return, many of them had offers for other films, television shows or plays, and the logistics of arranging their schedules so all of them could return for the show was difficult. In an interview, Fontana claimed the cast was contractually entitled to be paid for 13 episodes but they all agreed to take less money and come back for the shortened-season. The uncertainty over whether "Homicide" would be renewed or not created a great deal of stress for some cast members. Polito said of the feeling, "Where is <a href="limbo">limbo</a>? It's in Baltimore." Baldwin in particular expressed frustration with NBC for failing to renew the show for a full season and said he feared the uncertainty could hurt his film career:

For two years now, I've been walking around thinking, 'Why did I do this? Why did I subject myself to this nonsense?' I will never, ever do another series. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. There is no justice in television. ... Where's the confidence? Why aren't I here talking about being picked up for 22 episodes? I want to say to Warren Littlefield: Can you read? Can you read? I've never seen this kind of critical response to a show before.
Likewise, Beatty said he enjoyed the actual filming of the episodes but hated the television business end of it, claiming, "I can't think of anything I would less rather do than television at this moment." He said the process left him "pretty much burnt" and said his enthusiasm for the show had "eroded as time goes on". It was initially reported that Beatty would not return for the second "Homicide" season at all because he had accepted a starring role in "<a href="The%20Boys%20%281993%20TV%20series%29">The Boys</a>", a <a href="CBS">CBS</a> comedy series also featuring <a href="Christopher%20Meloni">Christopher Meloni</a>. Polito said he did not believe Beatty's departure would hurt the show because of the ensemble nature of the cast: "I love Ned's work, but the show won't fall apart because of one character." Beatty ended up appearing in both shows, and "The Boys" was canceled after six episodes.

Although Belzer said he and the rest of the cast returned to filming with "guarded emotions", he credited his role as John Munch with giving him credibility as an actor. While he previously had to vigorously pursue roles, he was receiving unsolicited offers by the time of the second season, including a recurring role in the ABC television series "". Polito, however, was terminated from the cast after the second season ended, reportedly because NBC officials were unhappy with his weight and physical appearance and did not believe he appealed to audiences. After his dismissal, Polito became publicly critical of the direction "Homicide" had recently taken, saying it changed to a "parody of itself" and claiming he had repeatedly voiced problems with the show's recent scripts to Fontana and Chris Menaul. Polito said:

It would have killed me to come back. The show went from art to mediocrity. I'm relieved that they've freed me legally. I didn't want to go back to another six months of indecision and hurt. I'm shocked that the other actors re-signed. ... The brilliance of the show under Levinson was lost this season. It's like watching the sinking of the <a href="RMS%20Titanic">Titanic</a>. The problem is that the iceberg is the guys who built the ship – the producers. You can never trust producers. They would have said to <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">van Gogh</a>: 'Nice painting. A little lighter on the colors and we can sell it.'

Several notable actors made guest appearances throughout the second season of "Homicide". Robin Williams appeared in "Bop Gun" as Robert Ellison, the husband of a slain woman tourist. Levinson previously directed Williams in the films "<a href="Good%20Morning%2C%20Vietnam">Good Morning, Vietnam</a>" (1987) and "<a href="Toys%20%281992%20film%29">Toys</a>" (1992). Although Williams was primarily known for his comedic work, the "Homicide" producers and Williams himself consciously decided to remain true to the original script, rejecting the idea of adding humor or jokes to the episode. "Bop Gun" also featured a 13-year-old <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, son of the episode's director Stephen, in one of his earliest acting performances; he played Matt, the young son of Robert Ellison. Wilford Brimley portrayed the bed-ridden and suicidal Harry Prentice in "See No Evil", Isaiah Washington played murder suspect Lane Staily in "Black and Blue", and <a href="Adrienne%20Shelly">Adrienne Shelly</a> portrayed S&M fashion store owner Tanya Quinn in "A Many Splendored Thing". Julianna Margulies appeared in the last two episodes of the season as Linda, a waitress who starts dating Bolander. Fontana was so impressed with Margulies that he offered her a recurring role on "Homicide", but she turned it down in favor of the medical drama series "<a href="ER%20%28TV%20series%29">ER</a>".

By the time the first season ended, four additional scripts for the second season had already been written, but before approving the second season, NBC asked for refinements in both the visual style and the scripts. From a screenwriting perspective, NBC asked that the scripts place more emphasis on single storylines, rather than multiple subplots; during the first season, some episodes included as many as four separate storylines. The season premiere, "Bop Gun", was the first "Homicide" episode to revolve entirely around a single plot: the murder of a tourist and its aftermath. Fontana said by focusing on one story, he believed it allows the show to tell that story better, adding, "In some places, there wasn't enough time for the story. The "Bop Gun" script also differed from previous "Homicide" episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, rather than on the detectives. The other three episodes of the season continued to focus on multiple stories, but switched from four different subplots to three.
"Bop Gun" was written by <a href="David%20Mills%20%28TV%20writer%29">David Mills</a> and <a href="David%20Simon">David Simon</a>, the latter of whom wrote the 1991 non-fiction book "", from which the television series was adapted. It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the <a href="University%20of%20Maryland%2C%20College%20Park">University of Maryland, College Park</a>. Writing the script inspired Mills to quit journalism and start writing for television full-time. Simon felt the script's dialogue was faithful to reality, especially the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit. This was particularly embodied by a scene in which the murdered tourist's husband becomes angry after overhearing detectives talk about how much overtime they would get from the case, which Simon claimed was a conversation real-life detectives would really have.

"See No Evil" was written by series creator <a href="Paul%20Attanasio">Paul Attanasio</a>, who had not penned a "Homicide" script since the series premiere "<a href="Gone%20for%20Goode">Gone for Goode</a>". Attanasio deliberately wrote the "See No Evil" script so that it would be morally questionable whether the police handling of both main subplots — the <a href="assisted%20suicide">assisted suicide</a> and the suspected police shooting — were done in an ethically correct way. "Black and Blue" was written by James Yoshimura, who continued working on "Homicide" throughout the entire life of the show, but considered that episode his favorite script. A story arc in "See No Evil" and "Black and Blue" featured Pembleton investigating a suspected police-related shooting. This was based on a real-life 1988 shooting and subsequent investigation by <a href="Baltimore%20Police%20Department">Baltimore Police Department</a> Detective <a href="Donald%20Worden">Donald Worden</a> featured in David Simon's book "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets". Several members of the Baltimore Police Department publicly criticized "Homicide" for its negative portrayal of the police in the storyline, and 22 detectives wrote a formal letter of protest to Levinson over the matter.

"A Many Splendored Thing" was written by Noel Behn, who became consulting producer with the series. That episode featured a subplot about a man who killed another man over a pen, which was inspired by a real-life murder in <a href="Anne%20Arundel%20County%2C%20Maryland">Anne Arundel County</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, in which a 23-year-old man shot another man 10 times in a doughnut shop when the victim refused to sell the shooter his pen. Since NBC had not decided on whether to renew "Homicide" until after the four episodes aired, the screenwriters did not start working on any scripts for the third season until after the second season concluded. As a result, once NBC was committed to renewal, the scripts had to be written later and the "Homicide" producers were not able to turn around new shows until the fall. Additionally, Fontana was working on other projects, including "<a href="Philly%20Heat">Philly Heat</a>", an ABC miniseries about members of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Fire%20Department">Philadelphia Fire Department</a>. Some media outlets criticized NBC for not commissioning Fontana and Levinson to write back-up scripts, which prevented "Homicide" from starting earlier once the show was renewed. Alan Pergament of "<a href="The%20Buffalo%20News">The Buffalo News</a>" wrote, "Understandably, Fontana didn't sit by idly and wait for NBC to make its decision on "Homicide"."

The four second-season episodes were filmed during the summer of 1993. The last of them, "Bop Gun", was filmed in late September 1993, with Fontana just having returned from accepting an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20-%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series</a> for the script of first-season episode "<a href="Three%20Men%20and%20Adena">Three Men and Adena</a>". Like the first season, they were filmed on location in Baltimore. Levinson was not present for the filming and development of the episodes because he was in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> shooting "<a href="Jimmy%20Hollywood">Jimmy Hollywood</a>" (1994), a comedy film starring <a href="Joe%20Pesci">Joe Pesci</a> and <a href="Christian%20Slater">Christian Slater</a>. Fontana said Levinson remained involved in the development of scripts and the production of the shows.

Among the visual changes during "Homicide"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s second season were brighter colors. While colorist Drexel Williams previously drained footage of color value to create a gritty style, cinematographer Jean de Segonzac directed Williams to make the colors less muted and more lively. Segonzac also sought a more restrained visual style, as he believed the previous cinematographer Wayne Ewing tended to "get a little too wild, and someone could complain they got a little dizzy". Levinson praised what he described as a subtler and more effective style under Segonzac. "Bop Gun" was originally meant to serve as the second-season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from Williams' guest appearance. The scenes with Williams were filmed over three days; Fontana said of the shooting, "[Williams] worked like a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us. It's very intense."

Chris Tergesen became music coordinator during the second season, and more music is featured than in the previous episodes as a result. The first scene of "Bop Gun", for example, featured the song "<a href="Killer%20%28Seal%20song%29">Killer</a>" by <a href="Seal%20%28musician%29">Seal</a> and <a href="Adamski">Adamski</a> over a brief montage of images just before a murder took place. In that same episode, the <a href="Buddy%20Guy">Buddy Guy</a> blues song "Feels Like Rain" plays just after Howard speaks with a suspect in jail. Other songs were integrated into the show itself: one suspect listens to the "<a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Public Enemy</a>" song "Gett off My Back" on headphones just before he was arrested. Various songs are featured in other second-season episodes, including the <a href="Gerry%20Goffin">Gerry Goffin</a> and <a href="Carole%20King">Carole King</a> song "<a href="Up%20on%20the%20Roof%20%28song%29">Up on the Roof</a>" in "Black and Blue", and the <a href="Soul%20Asylum">Soul Asylum</a> song "Whoa" and <a href="Donna%20Summer">Donna Summer</a> song "<a href="Bad%20Girls%20%28Donna%20Summer%20song%29">Bad Girls</a>" in "A Many Splendored Thing". "Black and Blue" ended with Bolander and Linda, on cello and violin respectively, performing a movement of "Passacaglia", a classical music piece composed by <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>. Cellist <a href="Zuill%20Bailey">Zuill Bailey</a> served as a body double for Beatty in the scenes with Bolander playing cello.

The second season received generally positive reviews. "Bop Gun" was particularly acclaimed; it was named one of the ten best episodes of the series by "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>", and the "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>" called Williams' performance one of the ten best guest star moments in television history. The performance of Andre Braugher was also particularly praised, especially for his scene in "Black and Blue", in which Pembleton persuades a suspect to confess to a murder he did not commit. Gail Pennington of the "<a href="St.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>" said the second season was an improvement over the first, which she said was excellent but "tended to demand an awful lot from viewers". Pennington said the toned down visual style and stronger emphasis on single stories better focused the show, adding: ""Homicide" is great TV, and NBC believes in it enough to give it what may be the network's best time slot." Bob Langford of "<a href="The%20News%20%26amp%3B%20Observer">The News & Observer</a>" called "Homicide" "absolutely brilliant" and praised it for focusing not on the crimes but on the effects of it, as well as the realistic themes regarding race, such as concerns in "Bop Gun" that the murder would deter white tourists from visiting Baltimore. Langford said it was occasionally preachy, but said, "Sometimes, a good sermon is what we need. Amazing that one this powerful can come from a TV show."

Rick Kogan, television critic with the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", called the show "wholly original" and an example of how good television entertainment can be. He praised the ensemble cast and interesting characters, and said the show would be renewed "if there's any justice in TV". Ray Richmond of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Daily%20News">Los Angeles Daily News</a>" praised NBC for giving "Homicide" a second chance, comparing it to the days when NBC stuck with the comedy series "<a href="Cheers">Cheers</a>" even though it ranked last in the ratings during its first season. Richmond said of "Homicide": "This is also one of the final opportunities to see a television network stick with a struggling show for no better reason than it deserves to be stuck with. In the bottom line-driven 1990s, that's become as rare as quality itself. " Steven Cole Smith with the "<a href="Fort%20Worth%20Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>" said of the evaluation period during "Homicide"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s second season: "If you don't watch it, you may lose your right to complain that there's never anything good on TV." He called it "a gritty, atmospheric police series" and complimented it for showing not only gratuitous violence but the consequences of it.

Robert Bianco of the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>" praised the show and said the decision to focus on fewer subplots might help. Bianco said, "Let's hope the changes work, because "Homicide" is too good to lose, and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside." "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" television reviewer Tom Shales called "Homicide" "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." <a href="David%20Zurawik">David Zurawik</a> of "The Baltimore Sun" called it the best police drama ever made for television besides "Hill Street Blues". "Baltimore Sun" reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." Tom Jicha of "<a href="South%20Florida%20Sun-Sentinel">South Florida Sun-Sentinel</a>" called it "an hour about as fine as there is on the tube" with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." Hal Boedeker, television critic with "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>", strongly praised the series, particularly "Bop Gun", which he called "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting "first-rate" and declared "Homicide" the better choice over "NYPD Blue" because it did not resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.

The second season of "Homicide" drew several comparisons to "<a href="NYPD%20Blue">NYPD Blue</a>", an <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received a large amount of publicity and better ratings than "Homicide", which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like "Homicide", "NYPD Blue" featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support "Homicide". Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to "NYPD Blue" because "Homicide" debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described "NYPD Blue" as "the television version of "Homicide"". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [is] to be mimicked by someone else. So, thank you, "NYPD Blue," because it's the knockoff of "Homicide."" "NYPD Blue" co-creator <a href="Steven%20Bochco">Steven Bochco</a> took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish "Homicide" the best – and they should be so lucky as to do as well as we're doing right now."

Pete Schulberg of "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>" wrote, "Forget all the commotion about "NYPD Blue". "Homicide" delivers without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence in a most compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." Bob Wisehart of "<a href="The%20Sacramento%20Bee">The Sacramento Bee</a>" said, "The bottom line is that while "NYPD Blue" is a fine show – it was on my 10-best list for 1993 – "Homicide" is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of "Hill Street Blues"." Elaine Liner, television critic with the "<a href="Corpus%20Christi%20Caller-Times">Corpus Christi Caller-Times</a>", who called "Homicide" "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from "NYPD Blue", and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" wrote, "If [the nudity] is what it took to get you to watch "NYPD Blue" and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that "Homicide" is so far superior to "NYPD Blue" in all those categories that if you're not [watching it], you're missing the best hour of episodic television since "Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere" left the air."

NBC heavily advertised the second season, especially the guest appearance by Williams in the season premiere, "Bop Gun". Levinson, Baldwin, Belzer and Fontana all participated in multiple media interviews about the show. "Bop Gun" was seen by 16.3 million viewers, a higher-than-usual "Homicide: Life on the Street" rating in large part to interest in Williams' appearance. It received a 17.3 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> and a 28 share, the highest rating for a 10 p.m. drama series since January 1992. The rating placed "Homicide" among the top ten network television Nielsen ratings for the week, and outperformed the ratings of "<a href="L.A.%20Law">L.A. Law</a>", which normally filled the 10 p.m. Thursday timeslot. Warren Littlefield said the ratings "far exceeded expectations", and said he expected the series to return for a third season if the viewership remained strong. Littlefield said of the "Homicide" ratings:

These are outstanding numbers for a dramatic television series. If we can keep a reasonable level of audience, we believe in the work, we believe in the creative team we think we have, perhaps the most outstanding ensemble cast in all of television. We just would like to see continued signs of life.

The other three episodes of the season did not match the viewership of "Bop Gun", but they were nevertheless considered strong ratings for the show, better than past "Homicide" episodes and the average rating for "L.A. Law". "Homicide"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s improved ratings in the Thursday night timeslot fueled speculation that "L.A. Law" might be canceled and "Homicide" would take its place. Warren Littlefield denied such claims, believing the success of one series did not necessarily have to mean the cancellation of the other. Despite "Homicide"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s improvement in the ratings, NBC did not immediately commit to a third season until the producers agreed to even more changes, including more prominent guest stars, more women in the cast and more life-affirming storylines. Outgoing cast member Polito publicly decried these changes, claiming the show was going to change from a drama into a "soap opera".

To cut down on costs, the network also pressured Levinson to relocate filming to California rather than Baltimore, which would reduce costs for travel, lodging and meals. <a href="Governor%20of%20Maryland">Maryland Governor</a> <a href="William%20Donald%20Schaefer">William Donald Schaefer</a> sent a telegram to Levinson encouraging him to remain in the city: "I wanted you to know that we are proud of having this exceptional series shot in your native state and stand ready to help toward a positive decision for additional production of the series." Levinson and Fontana considered leaving Baltimore not only for the cost savings, but also because of the letters of outrage by the city's detectives over "See No Evil," as well as a report in the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> that the show was giving Baltimore a bad image by drawing attention to its murder rate. Ultimately, however, Levinson decided to remain in Baltimore. On February 15, 1994, the day the options of the cast contracts expired, NBC decided at midnight to sign for a third season, but ordered only 13 episodes instead of a full 22-episode season, opting to wait and see how the ratings performed before committing to the final nine.

Robin Williams received an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Drama%20Series">Guest Actor in a Drama Series</a> for his role in "Bop Gun". It was the only Emmy nomination "Homicide: Life on the Street" received in the <a href="46th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">46th Primetime Emmy Awards</a>; the series received four nominations the previous year. Williams lost the Emmy to <a href="Richard%20Kiley">Richard Kiley</a> for his performance in the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> drama series "<a href="Picket%20Fences">Picket Fences</a>". "Bop Gun" won a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a> for <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award%20for%20Best%20Screenplay%20-%20Episodic%20Drama">Best Screenplay of an Episodic Drama</a>. It defeated competing episodes of "<a href="Northern%20Exposure">Northern Exposure</a>" and "<a href="NYPD%20Blue">NYPD Blue</a>", as well as another second season "Homicide" episode, "A Many Splendored Thing".

The first and second seasons of "Homicide" were released together in a four-<a href="DVD">DVD</a> box-set "Homicide: Life on the Street: The Complete Seasons 1 & 2", which was released by <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20Television%20Networks">A&E Home Video</a> on May 27, 2003 for $69.95. The set included an audio commentary by Levinson and Fontana for the first-season premiere, "Gone for Goode", as well as a collection of the commercials that advertised the episode during the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a>.

Galerina marginata

Galerina marginata is a <a href="species">species</a> of poisonous <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Hymenogastraceae">Hymenogastraceae</a> of the order <a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a>. Prior to 2001, the species G. autumnalis, G. oregonensis, G. unicolor, and G. venenata were thought to be separate due to differences in habitat and the <a href="wikt%3Aviscidity">viscidity</a> of their <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a>, but <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis showed that they are all the same species.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of this fungus have brown to yellow-brown caps that fade in color when drying. The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are brownish and give a rusty <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>. A well-defined membranous <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> is typically seen on the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> of young specimens but often disappears with age. In older fruit bodies, the caps are flatter and the gills and stems browner. The species is a classic "<a href="Mushroom%20hunting%23%26quot%3BLittle%20brown%20mushrooms%26quot%3B">little brown mushroom</a>"—a catchall category that includes all small to medium-sized, hard-to-identify brownish mushrooms, and may be easily confused with several <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species.

"Galerina marginata" is widespread in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a <a href="wood-rotting%20fungus">wood-rotting fungus</a> that grows predominantly on decaying <a href="conifer">conifer</a> wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly <a href="amatoxin">amatoxin</a>s found in the death cap ("<a href="Amanita%20phalloides">Amanita phalloides</a>"). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe <a href="liver%20damage">liver damage</a> with vomiting, diarrhea, <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>, and eventual death if not treated rapidly. About ten poisonings have been attributed to the species now grouped as "G. marginata" over the last century.

What is now recognized as a single <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> variable <a href="taxon">taxon</a> named "Galerina marginata" was once split into five distinct species. Norwegian mycologist <a href="Gro%20Gulden">Gro Gulden</a> and colleagues concluded that all five represented the same species after comparing the DNA sequences of the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> region of <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> for various North American and European specimens in "<a href="Galerina">Galerina</a>" section "Naucoriopsis". The results showed no genetic differences between "G. marginata" and "G. autumnalis", "G. oregonensis", "G. unicolor", and "G. venenata", thus reducing all these names to <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymy</a>. The oldest of these names are "Agaricus marginatus", described by <a href="August%20Batsch">August Batsch</a> in 1789, and "Agaricus unicolor", described by <a href="Martin%20Vahl">Martin Vahl</a> in 1792. "Agaricus autumnalis" was described by <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> in 1873, and later moved to "Galerina" by <a href="Alexander%20Hanchett%20Smith">A. H. Smith</a> and <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> in their 1962 worldwide <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on that genus. In the same publication they also introduced the "G. autumnalis" <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a> "robusta" and "angusticystis". Another of the synonymous species, "G. oregonensis", was first described in that monograph. "Galerina venenata" was first identified as a species by Smith in 1953. Since "Agaricus marginatus" is the oldest validly published name, it has <a href="priority%20%28nomenclature%29">priority</a> according to the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">rules of botanical nomenclature</a>.

Another species analysed in Gulden's 2001 study, "<a href="Galerina%20pseudomycenopsis">Galerina pseudomycenopsis</a>", also could not be distinguished from "G. marginata" based on ribosomal DNA sequences and <a href="restriction%20fragment%20length%20polymorphism">restriction fragment length polymorphism</a> analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain "G. pseudomycenopsis" as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in <a href="mating%20in%20fungi">mating</a> experiments suggests that the species are distinct.

In the fourth edition (1986) of Singer's comprehensive <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> of the <a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a>, "G. marginata" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Galerina" section "Naucoriopsis", a subdivision first defined by French mycologist <a href="Robert%20K%C3%BChner">Robert Kühner</a> in 1935. It includes small brown-spored mushrooms characterized by cap edges initially curved inwards, fruit bodies resembling "<a href="Pholiota">Pholiota</a>" or "<a href="Naucoria">Naucoria</a>" and thin-walled, obtuse or acute-ended pleurocystidia that are not rounded at the top. Within this section, "G. autumnalis" and "G. oregonensis" are in <a href="wikt%3Astirps">stirps</a> "Autumnalis", while "G. unicolor", "G. marginata", and "G. venenata" are in stirps "Marginata". "Autumnalis" species are characterized by having a viscid to lubricous cap surface while "Marginata" species lack a gelatinous cap—the surface is moist, "fatty-shining", or matte when wet. However, as Gulden explains, this characteristic is highly variable: "Viscidity is a notoriously difficult character to assess because it varies with the age of the fruitbody and the weather conditions during its development. Varying degrees of viscidity tend to be described differently and applied inconsistently by different persons applying terms such as lubricous, fatty, fatty-shiny, sticky, viscid, glutinous, or (somewhat) slimy."

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "marginata" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for "margin" or "edge", while "autumnalis" means "of the autumn". <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s of the species include the "marginate Pholiota" (resulting from its synonymy with "Pholiota marginata"), "funeral bell", "deadly skullcap", and "deadly Galerina". "G. autumnalis" was known as the "fall Galerina" or the "autumnal Galerina", while "G. venenata" was the "deadly lawn Galerina".

The <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> reaches in diameter. It starts convex, sometimes broadly conical, and has edges (margins) that are curved in against the <a href="Lamellae%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>. As the cap grows and expands, it becomes broadly convex and then flattened, sometimes developing a central elevation, or <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a>, which may project prominently from the cap surface.

Based on the collective descriptions of the five taxa now considered to be "G. marginata", the texture of the surface shows significant variation. Smith and Singer give the following descriptions of surface texture: from "viscid" ("G. autumnalis"), to "shining and viscid to lubricous when moist" ("G. oregonensis"), to "shining, lubricous to subviscid (particles of dirt adhere to surface) or merely moist, with a fatty appearance although not distinctly viscid", to "moist but not viscid" ("G. marginata"). The cap surface remains smooth and changes colors with humidity (<a href="hygrophanous">hygrophanous</a>), pale to dark <a href="ochre">ochraceous</a> <a href="tawny%20%28color%29">tawny</a> over the disc and yellow-ochraceous on the margin (at least when young), but fading to dull tan or darker when dry. When moist, the cap is somewhat transparent so that the outlines of the gills may be seen as striations. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is pale brownish ochraceous to nearly white, thin and pliant, with an odor and taste varying from very slightly to strongly like flour (<a href="wikt%3Afarinaceous">farinaceous</a>).

The gills are typically narrow and crowded together, with a broadly <a href="adnation">adnate</a> to nearly <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> attachment to the stem and convex edges. They are a pallid brown when young, becoming tawny at maturity. Some short gills, called lamellulae, do not extend entirely from the cap edge to the stem, and are intercalated among the longer gills. The <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> ranges from long, thick at the apex, and stays equal in width throughout or is slightly enlarged downward. Initially solid, it becomes hollow from the bottom up as it matures. The membranous <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> is located on the upper half of the stem near the cap, but may be sloughed off and missing in older specimens. Its color is initially whitish or light brown, but usually appears a darker rusty-brown in mature specimens that have dropped spores on it. Above the level of the ring, the stem surface has a very fine whitish powder and is paler than the cap; below the ring it is brown down to the reddish-brown to <a href="bistre">bistre</a> base. The lower portion of the stem has a thin coating of pallid <a href="wikt%3Afibril">fibrils</a> which eventually disappear and do not leave any scales. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is rusty-brown.

The spores measure 8–10 by 5–6 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>, and are slightly <a href="wikt%3Ainequilateral">inequilateral</a> in profile view, and egg-shaped in face view. Like all "Galerina" species, the spores have a <a href="plage%20%28mycology%29">plage</a>, which has been described as resembling "a slightly wrinkled plastic shrink-wrap covering over the distal end of the spore". The spore surface is warty and full of wrinkles, with a smooth depression where the spore was once attached via the <a href="wikt%3Asterigmatum">sterigmatum</a> to the <a href="basidium">basidium</a> (the spore-bearing cell). When in <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH) solution, the spores appear tawny or darker rusty-brown, with an apical callus. The basidia are four-spored (rarely with a very few two-spored ones), roughly cylindrical when producing spores, but with a slightly tapered base, and measure 21–29 by 5–8.4 µm.

<a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> are cells of the fertile <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> that do not produce spores. These sterile cells, which are structurally distinct from the basidia, are further classified according to their position. In "G. marginata", the pleurocystidia (cystidia from the gill sides) are 46–60 by 9–12 µm, thin-walled, and <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> in KOH, <a href="wikt%3Afusoid">fusoid</a> to <a href="ventricose">ventricose</a> in shape with wavy necks and blunt to <a href="wikt%3Asubacute">subacute</a> apices (3–6 µm diameter near apex). The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges) are similar in shape but often smaller than the pleurocystidia, abundant, with no club-shaped or abruptly tapering (<a href="wikt%3Amucronate">mucronate</a>) cells present. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present in the <a href="hyphae">hyphae</a>.

"Galerina marginata" may be mistaken for a few <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a> species. "<a href="Pholiota%20mutabilis">Pholiota mutabilis</a>" (Kuehneromyces mutabilis) produces fruit bodies roughly similar in appearance and also grows on wood, but may be distinguished from "G. marginata" by its stems bearing scales up to the level of the ring, and from growing in large clusters (which is not usual of "G. marginata"). However, the possibility of confusion is such that this good edible species is "not recommended to those lacking considerable experience in the identification of higher fungi." Furthermore, microscopic examination shows smooth spores in "Pholiota". "G. marginata" may be easily confused with other edibles such as "<a href="Armillaria%20mellea">Armillaria mellea</a>" and "<a href="Kuehneromyces%20mutabilis">Kuehneromyces mutabilis</a>". Regarding the latter species, one source notes "Often, "G. marginata" bears an astonishing resemblance to this fungus, and it requires careful and acute powers of observation to distinguish the poisonous one from the edible one." "K. mutabilis" may be distinguished by the presence of scales on the stem below the ring, the larger cap, which may reach a diameter of , and spicy or aromatic odor of the flesh. The related "<a href="Kuehneromyces%20vernalis">K. vernalis</a>" is a rare species and even more similar in appearance to "G. marginata". Examination of microscopic characteristics is typically required to reliably distinguish between the two, revealing smooth spores with a <a href="germ%20pore">germ pore</a>.

Another potential edible lookalike is the "velvet foot", "<a href="Flammulina%20velutipes">Flammulina velutipes</a>". This species has gills that are white to pale yellow, a white spore print, and spores that are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5–9 by 2.5–4 µm. A rough resemblance has also been noted with the edible "<a href="Hypholoma%20capnoides">Hypholoma capnoides</a>", the 'magic' mushroom <a href="Psilocybe%20subaeruginosa">Psilocybe subaeruginosa</a> as well as "<a href="Conocybe%20filaris">Conocybe filaris</a>", another poisonous amatoxin-containing species.

"Galerina marginata" is a <a href="detritivore">saprobic</a> fungus, obtaining nutrients by breaking down organic matter. It is known to have most of the major classes of secreted <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that dissolve plant <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s, and has been used as a model saprobe in recent studies of <a href="mycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizal</a> fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.

"Galerina marginata" is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, found in North America, Europe, Japan, Iran, continental Asia, and the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. In North America, it has been collected as far north as the <a href="boreal%20forest%20of%20Canada">boreal forest of Canada</a> and <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> and <a href="arctic">arctic</a> habitats in <a href="Labrador">Labrador</a>, and south to <a href="Jalisco%2C%20Mexico">Jalisco, Mexico</a>. It is also found in Australia.

The toxins found in "Galerina marginata" are known as <a href="amatoxin">amatoxin</a>s. Amatoxins belong to a family of bicyclic octapeptide derivatives composed of an <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> ring bridged by a <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> atom and characterized by differences in their <a href="substituent">side groups</a>; these compounds are responsible for more than 90% of fatal <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">mushroom poisoning</a>s in humans. The amatoxins inhibit the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="RNA%20polymerase%20II">RNA polymerase II</a>, which copies the <a href="genetic%20code">genetic code</a> of DNA into <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> molecules. The toxin naturally accumulates in <a href="hepatocyte">liver cells</a>, and the ensuing disruption of metabolism accounts for the severe liver dysfunction cause by amatoxins. Amatoxins also lead to <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a> because, as the kidneys attempt to filter out poison, it damages the <a href="Kidney%20tubule%23Renal%20tubule">convoluted tubules</a> and reenters the blood to recirculate and cause more damage. Initial <a href="symptoms">symptoms</a> after ingestion include severe <a href="abdominal%20pain">abdominal pain</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, and <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a> which may last for six to nine hours. Beyond these symptoms, toxins severely affect the liver which results in <a href="gastrointestinal%20bleeding">gastrointestinal bleeding</a>, a <a href="coma">coma</a>, kidney failure, or even death, usually within seven days of consumption.

"Galerina marginata" was shown in various studies to contain the amatoxins <a href="alpha-amanitin">α-amanitin</a> and <a href="gamma-amanitin">γ-amanitin</a>, first as "G. venenata", then as "G. marginata" and "G. autumnalis". The ability of the fungus to produce these toxins was confirmed by growing the <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> as a <a href="microbiological%20culture">liquid culture</a> (only trace amounts of <a href="beta-amanitin">β-amanitin</a> were found). "G. marginata" is thought to be the only species of the amatoxin-producing genera that will produce the toxins while growing in culture. Both amanitins were quantified in "G. autumnalis" (1.5 mg/g <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>) and "G. marginata" (1.1 mg/g dry weight). Later experiments confirmed the occurrence of γ-amanitin and β-amanitin in German specimens of "G. autumnalis" and "G. marginata" and revealed the presence of the three amanitins in the fruit bodies of "G. unicolor". Although some mushroom <a href="field%20guide">field guide</a>s claim that the species (as "G. autumnalis") also contains <a href="phallotoxin">phallotoxin</a>s (however phallotoxins cannot be absorbed by humans), scientific evidence does not support this contention. A 2004 study determined that the amatoxin content of "G. marginata" varied from 78.17 to 243.61 µg/g of fresh weight. In this study, the amanitin amounts from certain "Galerina" specimens were higher than those from some "<a href="Amanita%20phalloides">Amanita phalloides</a>", a European fungus generally considered as the richest in amanitins. The authors suggest that "other parameters such as extrinsic factors (environmental conditions) and intrinsic factors (genetic properties) could contribute to the significant variance in amatoxin contents from different specimens." The lethal dose of amatoxins has been estimated to be about 0.1 mg/kg human body weight, or even lower. Based on this value, the ingestion of 10 "G. marginata" fruit bodies containing about 250 µg of amanitins per gram of fresh tissue could poison a child weighing approximately . However, a 20-year retrospective study of more than 2100 cases of amatoxin poisonings from North American and Europe showed that few cases were due to ingestion of "Galerina" species. This low frequency may be attributed to the mushroom's nondescript appearance as a "<a href="little%20brown%20mushroom">little brown mushroom</a>" leading to it being overlooked by collectors, and by the fact that 21% of amatoxin poisonings were caused by unidentified species.

The toxicity of certain "Galerina" species has been known for a century. In 1912, <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> reported a human poisoning case due to "G. autumnalis". In 1954, a poisoning was caused by "G. venenata". Between 1978 and 1995, ten cases caused by amatoxin-containing Galerinas were reported in the literature. Three European cases, two from Finland and one from France were attributed to "G. marginata" and "G. unicolor", respectively. Seven North American exposures included two fatalities from Washington due to "G. venenata", with five cases reacting positively to treatment; four poisonings were caused by "G. autumnalis" from Michigan and Kansas, in addition to poisoning caused by an unidentified "Galerina" species from Ohio. Several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming the mushrooms after mistaking them for the hallucinogenic <a href="Psilocybe%20stuntzii">Psilocybe stuntzii</a>.

Free Association of German Trade Unions

The Free Association of German Trade Unions (; abbreviated FVdG; sometimes also translated as Free Association of German Unions or Free Alliance of German Trade Unions) was a <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> federation in <a href="German%20Empire">Imperial</a> and early <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Germany</a>. It was founded in 1897 in <a href="Halle%2C%20Saxony-Anhalt">Halle</a> under the name "Representatives' Centralization of Germany" as the national <a href="umbrella%20organization">umbrella organization</a> of the <a href="localist">localist</a> current of the <a href="trade%20unions%20in%20Germany">German labor movement</a>. The localists rejected the centralization in the labor movement following the <a href="sunset%20provision">sunset</a> of the <a href="Anti-Socialist%20Laws">Anti-Socialist Laws</a> in 1890 and preferred <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> democratic structures. The lack of a <a href="strike%20action">strike</a> code soon led to conflict within the organization. Various ways of providing financial support for strikes were tested before a system of voluntary solidarity was agreed upon in 1903, the same year that the name "Free Association of German Trade Unions" was adopted.

During the years following its formation, the FVdG began to adopt increasingly radical positions. During the German socialist movement's debate over the use of mass strikes, the FVdG advanced the view that the <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> must be a weapon in the hands of the working class. The federation believed the mass strike was the last step before a socialist revolution and became increasingly critical of <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">parliament</a>ary action. Disputes with the mainstream labor movement finally led to the expulsion of FVdG members from the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democratic Party of Germany</a> (SPD) in 1908 and the complete severing of relations between the two organizations. <a href="Anarchism">Anarchist</a> and especially <a href="syndicalism">syndicalist</a> positions became increasingly popular within the FVdG. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the FVdG rejected the SPD's and mainstream labor movement's cooperation with the German state—known as the "<a href="Burgfriedenspolitik">Burgfrieden</a>"—but was unable to organize any significant resistance to or continue its regular activities during the war. Immediately after the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%931919">November Revolution</a>, the FVdG very quickly became a mass organization. It was particularly attractive to miners from the <a href="Ruhr%20area">Ruhr area</a> opposed to the mainstream unions' reformist policies. In December 1919, the federation merged with several minor <a href="left%20communist">left communist</a> unions to become the <a href="Free%20Workers%27%20Union%20of%20Germany">Free Workers' Union of Germany</a> (FAUD).

According to Angela Vogel and Hartmut Rübner, <a href="Carl%20Hillmann">Carl Hillmann</a>, a typesetter and prominent trade unionist in the 1870s, was the "intellectual father" of the localist and anarcho-syndicalist movement. Vogel's and Rübner's claim is based on the fact that Hillmann was the first in Germany to consider unions' primary role to be the creation of the conditions for a socialist revolution, not simply to improve workers' living conditions. He also advocated a de-centralized trade union federation structure. Many of the later anarcho-syndicalists including <a href="Rudolf%20Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a> agree with this notion. Hans Manfred Bock, on the other hand, sees no evidence for Hillmann's influence on the FVdG.
From 1878 to 1890, the <a href="Anti-Socialist%20Laws">Anti-Socialist Laws</a> forbade all socialist trade unions. Only small local organizations, which communicated via intermediaries such as stewards, who worked illegally or semi-legally, survived. This form of organization was easier to protect against state repression. After the laws were <a href="sunset%20provision">sunset</a> in 1890, the <a href="General%20Commission%20of%20the%20Trade%20Unions%20of%20Germany">General Commission of the Trade Unions of Germany</a> was founded on November 17 at a conference in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> to centralize the socialist labor movement. In 1892, the <a href="Trade%20Union%20Congress%20of%20Halberstadt">Trade Union Congress of Halberstadt</a> was held to organize the many local unions under the committee. The localists, 31,000 of whom were represented at the congress, wanted to retain many of the changes that had been adopted during the repressive period. For example, they opposed separate organizations for political and economic matters, such as the party and the trade union. They especially wanted to keep their <a href="Grassroots%20democracy">grassroots democratic</a> structures. They also advocated local trade unions being networked by delegates rather than ruled centrally, and were wary of bureaucratic structures. The localists' proposals were rejected at the Halberstadt congress, so they refused to join the centralized trade unions, which became known as the <a href="Free%20Trade%20Unions%20%28Germany%29">Free Trade Unions</a>. They did not renounce <a href="social%20democracy">social democracy</a>, but rather considered themselves to be an <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> within the social democratic movement in Germany.

The localists' main stronghold was in Berlin, although localist unions existed in the rest of the Empire as well. Masons, carpenters, and some metal-working professions—especially those requiring a higher degree of qualification like coppersmiths or gold and silver workers—were represented in large numbers. By 1891, there were at least 20,000 metal workers in localist trade unions, just as many as in the centralized <a href="German%20Metal%20Workers%27%20Union">German Metal Workers' Union</a>.

At a congress in 1897 in <a href="Halle%2C%20Saxony-Anhalt">Halle</a>, the localists founded a national organization of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany ("Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands"). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but a lack of interest forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. <a href="Fritz%20Kater">Fritz Kater</a> became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, "Solidarität" ("Solidarity"), was founded, but the name was changed to "<a href="Die%20Einigkeit">Die Einigkeit</a>" ("Unity") the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.
The decision to found a national organization was likely the result of several factors. First, the mainstream trade unions were increasingly <a href="reformism">reformist</a> and centralized. Second, the localists gained confidence from their involvement in the dock workers' strike in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in late 1896 and early 1897. Third, loss of membership (for example, the Berlin metal workers rejoined the DMV in 1897) convinced the localists of the need for action.
The Representatives' Centralization's relationship to the SPD was ambivalent. The organization was allied with the SPD and supported the <a href="Erfurt%20Program">Erfurt Program</a>. At the same time, the party mostly opposed the founding of the Representatives' Centralization and called upon its members to rejoin the centralized trade unions. The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD, which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split would lead to a large loss of members. The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG's organizational principles.

The early years of the Representatives' Centralization of Germany were dominated by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions. The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance. Originally, all support between local organizations had been voluntary. But this system became more and more impractical, especially after the turn of the 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively — often by <a href="Lockout%20%28industry%29">locking out</a> workers. In 1899, the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in <a href="Braunschweig">Braunschweig</a>. It took out a loan, which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions. The following year, the Business Committee incurred 8,000 <a href="German%20gold%20mark">Marks</a> in debt by supporting strikes. Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD, while the rest was apportioned among the local unions.

This practice was replaced in 1900 by a far more complex system of assessments and donations designed to raise the money to support strikes. This system was replaced in 1901 because it was impractical. The 1901 system required every local union and the central committee to create strike funds. Local unions would receive support for strikes from Berlin under certain circumstances, and the central Business Committee's fund would be replenished by all member organizations in amounts proportional to their membership and the average wage of their members. This system, too, proved problematic because it penalized the larger, wealthier unions — especially the construction workers in Berlin who had higher wages but also higher costs of living. From 1901 to 1903, many small organizations joined the federation, yet the FVdG's membership fell as the punitive strike support system drove some larger unions out. In 1903, the federation not only changed its name to the "Free Association of German Trade Unions" but also decided to return to the old system of voluntary contributions. This system remained in place until 1914. The Business Committee worked to ensure that unions contributed as much as they could. Often the committee resorted to threatening unions with expulsion in order to raise funds for a strike. Fritz Kater called this a dictatorship necessary for the movement, but local organizations still had far more autonomy than their counterparts in other German labor federations.

During the first decade of the 20th century, the FVdG was transformed from a localist union federation into a syndicalist labor organization with anarchist tendencies. The process was initiated by the death of <a href="Gustav%20Ke%C3%9Fler">Gustav Keßler</a>, the most important ideologue in the FVdG, in 1903. His role was largely assumed by the physician <a href="Raphael%20Friedeberg">Raphael Friedeberg</a>.

In 1903, a dispute between the FVdG and the Free Trade Unions in Berlin led the party commission to intervene and to sponsor talks aimed at re-unification of the two wings of the German labor movement. At the meeting, the FVdG made a number of compromises, which led to member protests. Soon, over one-third of the members left the union. The 1903 FVdG congress elected a panel to continue negotiations with the Free Trade Unions. This panel demanded that the Free Trade Unions adopt localist organizational principles as a prerequisite for re-unification. The FVdG panel realized this demand was unrealistic, but hoped the expulsion of <a href="Revisionism%20%28Marxism%29">revisionists</a> from the SPD during the debate on <a href="Eduard%20Bernstein">Eduard Bernstein's</a> theses would strengthen their position. The impossibility of a reconciliation between the two became obvious by March 1904, since the re-unification envisioned by both the leadership of the SPD and the Free Trade Unions was more along the lines of an integration of the FVdG into the Free Trade Unions.

The FVdG's disillusionment with the social democratic movement deepened during the <a href="mass%20strike%20debate">mass strike debate</a>. The role of the <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> for the socialist movement was first discussed within the FVdG in 1901. At the SPD's 1903 congress in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, Raphael Friedeberg proposed discussing the topic, but his proposal was rejected by the congress. The following year, a proposal by <a href="Wilhelm%20Liebknecht">Wilhelm Liebknecht</a> and Eduard Bernstein to initiate debate on the topic was accepted, since they had distanced themselves from Friedeberg's positions.

Liebknecht and Bernstein, like the left wing of the party, felt the general strike should not be used to provoke the state but rather to defend political rights (especially the right to vote) should the state seek to abolish them. The more conservative faction in the party was opposed to this concept. In 1904, Friedeberg, speaking for the FVdG, advanced the view that the general strike must be a weapon in the hands of the <a href="proletariat">proletariat</a> and would be the last step before the socialist revolution. In 1905, his speech on the topic was even more radical. He claimed that <a href="historical%20materialism">historical materialism</a>, a pillar of <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, was to blame for social democracy's alleged powerlessness, and introduced the alternative concept of "historical psychism"—which held that human psychology was more significant for social development than material conditions. He also recommended the anarchist literature especially <a href="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>'s writings rather than <a href="Marx">Marx</a>'s works, which were most influential in the SPD.
The position that the general strike could be used, but only as a last resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in "Die Einigkeit," greatly angering the party leadership.

At the 1905 party convention, <a href="August%20Bebel">August Bebel</a>, who had always favored a stronger role for the SPD-affiliated unions, proposed a resolution requiring all members of the party to join the centralized trade unions for their respective professions. This would have forced all FVdG members to either leave the party or the trade union. The resolution was adopted, and implemented in 1907. An FVdG survey returned a vote of twenty-two to eight opposing rejoining the centralized unions. This led some of the <a href="Masonry">masons</a>, <a href="Carpentry">carpenters</a>, and <a href="construction%20worker">construction worker</a>s in the union to leave the FVdG in 1907 to avoid being expelled from the SPD, saying the organization was "taking a path, which would certainly lead to strife with the SPD and to syndicalism and anarchism." In 1908, the SPD's Nuremberg congress finally voted to make SPD and FVdG membership incompatible.

In addition to causing about two-thirds of its members to quit between 1906 and 1910, the radicalization of the FVdG also correlates to a slight change in the milieu, industries, and regions from which the organization drew its members. Many metal and construction workers, who had a localist tradition, left as a result of the syndicalist and anarchist tendencies in the FVdG. Miners, who worked mostly in the <a href="Ruhr%20area">Ruhr area</a>, did not have this tradition but developed a certain skepticism of bureaucratic structures. About 450 of them joined the FVdG before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, a sign of what was to come after the war.

Following the split from the SPD, the FVdG was increasingly influenced by French syndicalism and anarchism. In 1908, Kater called the <a href="Charter%20of%20Amiens">Charter of Amiens</a>, the platform of the French <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20du%20travail">General Confederation of Labor</a> (CGT), the earliest and largest syndicalist union worldwide, "a new revelation". Although there was no contact between German "intellectual anarchists" (like <a href="Gustav%20Landauer">Gustav Landauer</a> and <a href="Erich%20M%C3%BChsam">Erich Mühsam</a>) and the FVdG, it did have influential anarchist members, most notably <a href="Andreas%20Kleinlein">Andreas Kleinlein</a> and <a href="Fritz%20K%C3%B6ster">Fritz Köster</a>. Kleinlein and Köster increasingly influenced the federation from 1908 on, and this led to the founding of "<a href="Der%20Pionier">Der Pionier</a>" in 1911. This newspaper, which was edited by Köster, had a much more aggressive tone than "Die Einigkeit". Despite these developments, the influence of the anarchists in the pre-World War I FVdG remained quantitatively minute, especially as leading members like Kater were at the time very skeptical of the anarchist ideology.
After both the British <a href="Industrial%20Syndicalist%20Education%20League">Industrial Syndicalist Education League</a> (ISEL), a short-lived syndicalist organization heavily involved in the strike wave in Britain from 1910, and the Dutch syndicalist union <a href="National%20Labor%20Secretariat">National Labor Secretariat</a> (NAS) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913, the FVdG was the first to express support. There were difficulties in organizing the congress, and the largest syndicalist union worldwide — the CGT — refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Trade%20Unions">International Federation of Trade Unions</a>. Despite these challenges, the <a href="First%20International%20Syndicalist%20Congress">First International Syndicalist Congress</a> took place at <a href="Holborn%20Town%20Hall">Holborn Town Hall</a> in <a href="London">London</a> from September 27 to October 2. British, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, French, Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Brazilian, and Argentine organizations—both labor unions and political groups — had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG, which was represented by <a href="Karl%20Roche">Karl Roche</a>, <a href="Carl%20Windhoff">Carl Windhoff</a>, and Fritz Kater. There were also links with Norwegian, Polish, and American groups. Kater was elected co-president of the congress alongside <a href="Jack%20Wills%20%28trade%20unionist%29">Jack Wills</a>. After Wills was forced to resign, Kater served as co-president with <a href="Jack%20Tanner%20%28trade%20unionist%29">Jack Tanner</a>. The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues, the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement (as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands) should be risked. The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism, while their Italian, French, and Spanish counterparts, most notably <a href="Alceste%20De%20Ambris">Alceste De Ambris</a> of the Italian <a href="Unione%20Sindacale%20Italiana">USI</a>, were more intent on preventing further division. Accordingly, the congress was divided on the question of whether its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded. The opponents of a new organization prevailed, but the congress agreed to establish an Information Bureau. The Information Bureau was based in Amsterdam and published the "<a href="Bulletin%20international%20du%20mouvement%20syndicaliste">Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste</a>." The congress was considered a success by most who attended, with the notable exception of De Ambris. A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years' time in Amsterdam. Due to the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the congress did not take place. The "Bulletin" only published for eighteen issues before the war caused it to cease publication.

During the buildup to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the FVdG denounced the SPD's anti-war rhetoric as "complete humbug". With the start of war, the SPD and the mainstream labor movement entered into the "<a href="Burgfriedenspolitik">Burgfrieden</a>" (or civil truce) with the German state. Under this agreement, the unions' structures remained intact and the government did not cut wages during the war. For their part, the unions did not support new strikes, ended current ones, and mobilized support for the war effort. The 1916 <a href="Auxiliary%20War%20Service%20Law">Auxiliary War Service Law</a> established further cooperation between employers, unions, and the state by creating workers' committees in the factories and joint management-union arbitration courts.
The FVdG, on the other hand, was the only labor organization in the country which refused to participate in the "Burgfrieden." The union held that war-time patriotism was incompatible with <a href="proletarian%20internationalism">proletarian internationalism</a> and that war could only bring greater exploitation of labor. (Indeed, the average <a href="real%20wage">real wage</a> fell by 55 percent during the war.) While the mainstream labor movement was quick to agree with the state that <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> were to blame for igniting the war, the FVdG held that the cause for the war was <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a> and that no blame could be assigned until after the conflict ended. The federation strongly criticized hostility towards foreigners working in Germany, especially Poles and Italians. It also rejected the concepts of the "<a href="nation">nation</a>" and national identity invoked in support of the war, claiming that common language, origin and culture (the foundations of a nation) did not exist in Germany. The FVdG's newspapers also declared that the war refuted <a href="historical%20materialism">historical materialism</a>, since the masses had gone to war against their own material interests.
After Fritz Kater and Max Winkler reaffirmed syndicalist <a href="antimilitarism">antimilitarism</a> in the August 5, 1914 "Der Pionier" edition, the newspaper was banned. Three days later, "Die Einigkeit" criticized the SPD's stance on the war. It was then suppressed as well. The FVdG promptly responded by founding the weekly "Mitteilungsblatt." After it was banned in June 1915, the federation founded the bi-weekly "Rundschreiben," which survived until May 1917. Social Democratic publications on the other hand were allowed by Prussian War Minister <a href="Erich%20von%20Falkenhayn">Erich von Falkenhayn</a> to be distributed even in the army. In the first days of the war, about 30 FVdG activists in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="Elberfeld">Elberfeld</a>, <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, <a href="Krefeld">Krefeld</a> and other cities were arrested—some remaining under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> for two years. The government repression against the FVdG was heavy. While bans were often placed on the union's regular meetings, authorities in Düsseldorf even banned meetings of the syndicalist choir. Another problem for the union was that many of its members were conscripted. Half of the Berlin construction workers, the federation's largest union, were forced to serve in the army. In some places, all FVdG members were called into service.

Although the FVdG insisted that the "goal is everything and ... must be everything" (a play on Bernstein's formula that "the final goal, whatever it may be, is nothing to me: the movement is everything"), it was unable to do much more than keep its own structures alive during World War I. Immediately after the declaration of war, FVdG tried to continue its antiwar demonstrations to no avail. Although it constantly criticized the "Burgfrieden" and militarism in general, industrial action was not possible except for a few minor cases (most notably resistance by the carpenters' union to Sunday work). The FVdG also received support from abroad. The faction in the Italian <a href="Unione%20Sindacale%20Italiana">USI</a> led by <a href="Armando%20Borghi">Armando Borghi</a>, an antimilitarist minority in the French CGT, the Dutch NAS, as well as Spanish, Swedish, and Danish syndicalists were all united with the FVdG in their opposition to the war.

As the Great War progressed, <a href="war%20exhaustion">war exhaustion</a> in Germany grew. The first strikes in the country since the start of the war broke out in 1915, steadily increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions steadily lost members. Correspondingly, the <a href="Reichstag%20%28German%20Empire%29">Reichstag</a> faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> as the "Rundschreiben" had been banned by the time it broke out.

Some claim that the FVdG influenced strikes in the arms industry as early as February or March 1918, but the organization was not re-established on a national level until December 1918. On December 14, Fritz Kater started publishing "<a href="Der%20Syndikalist">Der Syndikalist</a>" ("The Syndicalist") in Berlin as a replacement for "Die Einigkeit." On December 26 and 27, a conference organized by Kater and attended by 33 delegates from 43 local unions took place in Berlin. The delegates reflected upon the difficult times during the war and proudly noted that the FVdG was the only trade union which did not have to adjust its program to the new political conditions because it had remained loyal to its anti-state and internationalist principles. The delegates reaffirmed their rejection of parliamentarianism and refused to participate in the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Germany%29">National Assembly</a>.

In Spring 1919, Karl Roche wrote a new platform for the FVdG entitled "Was wollen die Syndikalisten? Programm, Ziele und Wege der 'Freien Vereinigung deutscher Gewerkschaften'" ("What Do the Syndicalists Want? The Program, Goals, and Means of the 'Free Association of German Trade Unions'"). In addition to reiterating pre-war ideas and slogans, it went further by criticizing participation in electoral democracy, claiming that this handicapped and confused proletarian class struggle. The platform also called for the establishment of the <a href="dictatorship%20of%20the%20proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>, a position which was designed to reach out to the newly formed <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Germany">Communist Party</a> (KPD) and <a href="International%20Communists%20of%20Germany">International Communists of Germany</a>. In late 1918 and early 1919, the FVdG became an important player in the strike movement in the Ruhr region (which mostly involved miners). Its organizers, most notably Carl Windhoff, became regular speakers at workers' demonstrations. On April 1, a general strike supported by the FVdG, the KPD and the <a href="Independent%20Social%20Democratic%20Party">Independent Social Democratic Party</a> (USPD) began. The strike eventually involved up to 75 percent of the region's miners until it was violently suppressed in late April by the SPD-led government. After the strike and the ensuing collapse of the <a href="General%20Miners%27%20Union">General Miners' Union</a>, the FVdG expanded its unions rapidly and independently of the aforementioned political parties, especially in the Ruhr region. This led to a massive expansion in FVdG membership. The FVdG's criticism of the bureaucratic centralized trade unions, its advocation of <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a>, and its low membership dues were received well by the workers in the Ruhr region. By August 1919, the federation had around 60,000 members throughout Germany. However, its Ruhr miners' unions left the <a href="craft%20unionism">craft unionist</a> scheme the FVdG had traditionally been organized by behind, preferring simpler <a href="industrial%20unionism">industrial</a> structures.
The end of cooperation between the FVdG and the political parties in the Ruhr region was part of a nationwide trend after <a href="Paul%20Levi">Paul Levi</a>, an anti-syndicalist, became chairman of the KPD in March. Moreover, <a href="Rudolf%20Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a>, a <a href="communist%20anarchist">communist anarchist</a> and follower of <a href="Kropotkin">Kropotkin</a>, joined the FVdG in March 1919. He returned via The Netherlands in November 1918 after living in exile in London, where he had been active in the Jewish anarchist scene. <a href="Augustin%20Souchy">Augustin Souchy</a>, more of a <a href="Gustav%20Landauer">Landauer</a>-esque anarchist, also joined the federation in 1919. Both rapidly gained influence in the organization and—as anti-Marxists—were opposed to close collaboration with communists.

Nevertheless, the FVdG's <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a> and <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a> section merged with <a href="left%20communist">left communist</a> unions to form the Free Workers' Union (FAU) in September 1919. Syndicalists from the FVdG were the biggest and most dominant faction in the FAU. The FAU's statutes mostly reflected compromises by the federation's member unions, but also reflected the FVdG's significant influence.

Soon it was decided to complete the merger in Rhineland and Westphalia on a national level. The FVdG's 12th congress, held December 27 to 30, became the <a href="Free%20Workers%27%20Union%20of%20Germany">Free Workers' Union of Germany</a>'s (FAUD) founding congress. Most left communists (including the influential veteran member Karl Roche) had already quit or were in the process of leaving the FAU in Rhineland and Westphalia by this point. The majority of them would join the <a href="General%20Workers%27%20Union%20of%20Germany">General Workers' Union of Germany</a> (AAUD), which was founded in February 1920. Without the left communists to oppose its adoption, Rocker's thoroughly anarchist "Prinzipienerklärung des Syndikalismus" ("Declaration of Syndicalist Principles"), which the Business Commission had charged him with drafting, became the FAUD's platform without much controversy. The FAUD also rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat and other Marxist terms and ideas. According to the Business Commission, the congress was attended by 109 delegates representing 111,675 workers, twice as many as were claimed just four and a half months earlier.

Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards

Bone Sharps, Cowboys, and Thunder Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of Paleontology is a 2005 <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> written by <a href="Jim%20Ottaviani">Jim Ottaviani</a> and illustrated by the company <a href="Big%20Time%20Attic">Big Time Attic</a>. The book tells a fictionalized account of the <a href="Bone%20Wars">Bone Wars</a>, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry which led to a greater understanding of <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s and other prehistoric life in the western United States during the late 19th century. "Bone Sharps" follows the two scientists <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> and <a href="Othniel%20Marsh">Othniel Marsh</a> as they engage in an intense competition for prestige and discoveries. Along the way, the scientists interact with historical figures of the <a href="Gilded%20Age">Gilded Age</a>, including <a href="P.%20T.%20Barnum">P. T. Barnum</a> and <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>.

Ottaviani grew interested in the time period after reading a book about the Bone Wars. Finding Cope and Marsh unlikeable and the historical account dry, he decided to fictionalize events to service a better story. Ottaviani placed the artist <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> into the story as a relatable character for audiences. The novel was the first work of historical fiction Ottaviani had written; previously he had taken no creative license with the characters depicted. Upon release, the novel received praise from critics for its exceptional historical content, although some reviewers wished more fiction had been woven into the story.

The novel begins with Othniel Charles Marsh on a steam train between <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="New%20Haven">New Haven</a>, where he first meets the showman <a href="Phineas%20T.%20Barnum">Phineas T. Barnum</a>. Barnum shows Marsh a copy of the <a href="Cardiff%20Giant">Cardiff Giant</a>; Marsh informs him he intends to expose the giant as a fake. In <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a> introduces artist <a href="Charles%20R.%20Knight">Charles R. Knight</a> to Edward Drinker Cope, a paleontologist whose entire house is filled with bones and specimens. Cope is commissioning a painting, something to "catch the spirit" of the sea creature "<a href="Elasmosaurus">Elasmosaurus</a>". Cope leaves for the West as the official scientist for the <a href="U.S.%20Geological%20Survey">U.S. Geological Survey</a> (USGS). On the way, he meets Othniel Charles Marsh, a fellow paleontologist, and shows him his dig site at a <a href="marl">marl</a> pit in New Jersey; after Cope leaves, Marsh talks to the owner of the land and pays him off to gain exclusive digging rights. At Fort Bridger, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, Cope meets Sam Smith, a helper to the USGS. During excavations, Cope finds some of the richest bone veins ever. Sending back carloads of dinosaur bones east by train, Cope encounters Marsh, who is heading out west as well. Marsh travels in style, lounging in coach while the rest of his team travels third class. At Fort McPherson, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, Marsh meets "Buffalo" <a href="Bill%20Cody">Bill Cody</a>, who serves as their guide, along with a Native American Indian tribe. Marsh discovers many new fossils, and promises to Chief <a href="Red%20Cloud">Red Cloud</a> that he will talk to the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> about the situation of the Native Americans—they have been given spoiled food in exchange for their land. Back East, Knight has finished his reconstruction of "Elasmosaurus". He and Knight return to the marl pits of New Jersey, but are forced away. Cope becomes furious and storms away when he learns Marsh has bought the digging rights and published a paper revealing his reconstruction of "Elasmosaurus" is flawed.

Some time later, bone hunter <a href="John%20Bell%20Hatcher">John Bell Hatcher</a> has taken to gambling, as his employer Marsh is not providing him with enough funds. Marsh lobbies the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of Red Cloud, but also visits with the Geological Survey, insinuating that he would be a better leader of the USGS than Cope. After learning about Sam Smith's attempted sabotage of Cope and once again receiving no payment from Marsh, Hatcher leaves his employ. Marsh, now representing the survey, heads west with wealthy businessmen, scoffing at the financial misfortunes of Cope, whose investments have failed.
Cope travels with Knight to Europe; Knight with the intention of visiting Parisian zoos, Cope with the intent of selling off much of his bone collection. Cope has also spent much of his money buying "The American Naturalist", a paper in which he plans to attack Marsh's dealings. Hatcher arrives in New York to talk about the find "<a href="Dryptosaurus">Laelaps</a>"; in his speech, he subtly hints at the folly of Marsh's elitism and backstabbing, as well as Cope's collecting obsession. While attending a conference, Marsh learns that his USGS expense tab (to which he had been charging drinks) has been withdrawn, his publication has been suspended, and the fossils he found as part of the USGS are to be returned to the Survey. His colleagues now shun him, the <a href="Bone%20War">Bone War</a> feud having alienated them. He is forced to go to Barnum to try to obtain a loan.

Osborn and Knight arrive at Cope's residence to find the paleontologist has died of illness. The funeral is markedly pitiful, with only a few <a href="Quakers">Quakers</a> and the two friends in attendance. Cope has bequeathed his remains to science, and requested to have his bones considered for the "Homo sapiens" <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a>. Back at Marsh's residence, the visiting Chief Red Cloud examines Marsh's luxuries. Red Cloud's interest is piqued by a long tusk from a <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a>. Marsh relates an ancient <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> legend that once there were giant men proportionate to the mastodons before they died out. Chief Red Cloud remarks that it is a true story; Marsh rebukes him, saying that science tells modern man that his ancestors were smaller, not larger, than him. Red Cloud, on his way out, responds, "It is not a story about science. It is about "men"."

Years later Knight and his wife are taking their granddaughter Rhoda to the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>. Knight, well-known to the staff, is visiting the closed-off areas to have a look at the new mammoth specimens: the girl, however, is eager to see more of her grandfather's paintings. Meanwhile, the staff are finally getting around to sorting out Marsh's long-neglected collection of fossils. Two of the workers discover Knight's "Leaping Laelaps" has been accidentally left in the storeroom yesterday. The painting is taken back downstairs while the workmen unknowingly leave Cope's and Marsh's bones behind.

<a href="Jim%20Ottaviani">Jim Ottaviani</a> conceived of "Bone Sharps" while working at the University of Michigan Library in Ann Arbor. Ottaviani's job included purchasing books for engineering topics, but a new book about the Bone Wars caught his eye. He bought the book himself and found himself fascinated by the rivalry between Cope and Marsh. He described his process as spending time doing research, before turning an outline and timeline into a structured story. Using the book as a starting point, Ottaviani read the accounts and biographies of Cope and Marsh as well as other period sources. During the course of his research Ottaviani found the then-unpublished autobiography of Charles Knight, which inspired him to make the book into a work of historical fiction. Ottaviani had previously written non-fiction books and comics on scientific figures, but had never written a work of historical fiction. "I found the whole 'war' aspect over-hyped," Ottaviani recalled. "These guys never came to blows, or even did anything that went very far beyond questionable ethics." In comparison to his previous works, Ottaviani called the scientists "the bad guys".

While the majority of "Bone Sharps" is true and all of it is based on history, Ottaviani took liberties throughout to better serve the story. In real life, Knight did not meet Cope until only a few years before Cope's death; In addition, Knight's autobiography states that it was reporter <a href="William%20Hosea%20Ballou">William Hosea Ballou</a> who introduced the two, not Osborn. There is also no evidence Marsh and Knight ever met. On Knight's role in the story, Ottaviani wrote:
As I was reading about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as something of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.
Ottaviani's interest in Knight eventually led to his company G.T. Labs publishing Knight's autobiography, with notes by Ottaviani and forewords by <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> and <a href="Ray%20Harryhausen">Ray Harryhausen</a>. Other character relationships were fictionalized as well: editor James Gordon Bennet, Jr. never lobbied with Cope, and never exposed Marsh's will. Cope's bones also never made it to New York. Some conversations, due to their private nature, were fictionalized; Ottaviani makes up Marsh's lobby to Congress and what happened during his meeting with President Grant, and P.T. Barnum never told off Marsh the way he did in the novel. Ottaviani also wove the story Marsh tells about the <a href="Mastodon">Mastodon</a> from several different versions of the legend. A key plot point is fabricated for the purposes of dramatic irony: in the book, Marsh has his agent Sam Smith leave a "Camarasaurus" skull for Cope to find and mistakenly put on the wrong dinosaur. Instead, Hatcher finds it; Smith tries to keep an unwitting Marsh from getting it, but due to Marsh's obnoxious manner he lets him after all. As a result, Marsh mistakenly classifies the (non-existent) "Brontosaurus". Ottaviani admits in the book he invented this, as "the literary tradition of hoisting someone up by his own petard was too good to pass up".

While Ottaviani was putting his ideas together, he met <a href="Zander%20Cannon">Zander Cannon</a> at the 2004 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic%20Convention">San Diego Comic Convention</a>. Cannon and associates were forming a new production studio, "Big Time Attic"; Ottaviani mentioned he had a proposal he wanted to show them. Referring to Big Time Attic, Ottaviani stated in an interview that "A newly formed studio taking on a 160-page graphic novel is ambitious" and that he was lucky to have had the book published. Even the format—the book is wider than it is tall—was a departure for Ottaviani. He explained that since the story was talking about "wide expanses of territory" and the <a href="American%20West">American West</a>, the artists at Big Time Attic wanted a more non-traditional landscape page design.

The book was generally well-received upon release. Comic book <a href="letterer">letterer</a> <a href="Todd%20Klein">Todd Klein</a> recommended the book to his readers, stating that the novel was able to convey the depths of Cope and Marsh's rivalry and "we can only wonder how much more could have been accomplished if [Cope and Marsh] had only been willing to team up instead". Klein's complaints focused on the somewhat stiff art and the difficulty in telling some characters apart, but said these shortcomings did not affect the flow and reading. Johanna Carlson of Comics Worth Reading found "Bone Sharps"s central message, "the question of whether promotion is a necessary evil (to gather funds through attention) or a base desire of those with the wrong motivations", still relevant to today's society; Carlson also lauded the flow of the novel and some of the intricate details in the story and setting. Other reviewers praised Ottaviani's inclusion of notable historical figures, and the educational yet entertaining feel of the work, and expressive artwork.

In addition to minor issues with the art, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s Tom Russo felt that more fiction could have been used in the mostly non-fiction writing. Due to the historical background of the book, "Bone Sharps" has been used in schools, as part of a study testing the effects of using comic books to educate young children. Since the release of the graphic novel, Ottaviani has published other slightly fictionalized historical stories, including "Levitation: Physics and Psychology in the Service of Deception" and "Wire Mothers: Harry Harlow and the Science of Love".

The Truth (The X-Files)

"The Truth" is the collective name for the 201st and 202nd episodes of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>". The last episodes of the show's <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%209%29">ninth season</a>, "The Truth" originally served as the finale for the entire series, until the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%2010%29">return of the series</a> in January 2016. First aired together on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on May 19, 2002, the episodes were written by series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> and directed by <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a>. "The Truth" was the most-watched episode of the ninth season and was seen by 13.25 million viewers upon its initial broadcast. The finale received mixed reviews, with many commentators criticizing the episode's lack of closure. Others were pleased with the full return of actor <a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a> to the series, as well as the episode's conclusion.

The show centers on <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> special agents who work on unsolved paranormal cases called <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s; this season focuses on the investigations of <a href="John%20Doggett">John Doggett</a> (<a href="Robert%20Patrick">Robert Patrick</a>), <a href="Monica%20Reyes">Monica Reyes</a> (<a href="Annabeth%20Gish">Annabeth Gish</a>), and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>). In this episode, Walter Skinner (<a href="Mitch%20Pileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>) and Scully learn that Mulderwho has been missing for almost a yearhas been placed under military arrest for the supposed murder of <a href="Knowle%20Rohrer">Knowle Rohrer</a> (<a href="Adam%20Baldwin">Adam Baldwin</a>), one of the government's secret "Super Soldiers". Mulder breaks out of prison with the help of Skinner, Reyes, Doggett, Scully and Alvin Kersh (<a href="James%20Pickens%2C%20Jr.">James Pickens, Jr.</a>). Mulder and Scully travel to <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> where helicopters destroy an Anasazi cliff dwelling ruin along with <a href="The%20Smoking%20Man">The Smoking Man</a> (<a href="William%20B.%20Davis">William B. Davis</a>).

The episode featured the return of Duchovny—following his departure after the <a href="Existence%20%28The%20X-Files%29">eighth-season finale</a>—as well as several other recurring characters. "The Truth" served to conclude many long-time story arcs while creating new ones for a possible <a href="The%20X-Files%20franchise">film franchise</a>. Shooting took place at various <a href="California">California</a> locales, including a hydroelectric power plant east of <a href="Fresno%2C%20California">Fresno</a> and <a href="Anza-Borrego%20Desert%20State%20Park">Anza-Borrego Desert State Park</a>. Carter would return to "The X-Files" universe with a feature film, "" (2008), and has publicly discussed the possibility of a third film, which would focus on the impending extraterrestrial invasion revealed in "The Truth".

At the <a href="Mount%20Weather%20Emergency%20Operations%20Center">Mount Weather</a> military base, <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) appears with several government officials. He gains access to highly classified documents on a secure computer system, and is shocked and dismayed to read the documents, which provide details of the final colonization of the planet by <a href="Colonist%20%28The%20X-Files%29">alien forces</a>. Before he can continue reading, Mulder hears another person approaching. He hides quickly and observes <a href="Knowle%20Rohrer">Knowle Rohrer</a> (<a href="Adam%20Baldwin">Adam Baldwin</a>), a former friend of <a href="John%20Doggett">John Doggett</a> (<a href="Robert%20Patrick">Robert Patrick</a>) but who has been irreversibly transformed into an enemy "<a href="Super%20Soldiers%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Super Soldier</a>", approach the computer system. Rohrer immediately realizes the system has been accessed. Mulder attempts to attack Rohrer, but Rohrer overpowers him. Mulder frantically flees, but Rohrer outflanks him. In a violent altercation, Mulder flips Rohrer off a catwalk onto high-voltage wiring, and Rohrer apparently dies by electrocution. Mulder attempts to escape, but is quickly arrested by several soldiers.

News of Mulder's arrest spreads to the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a>. Upon hearing that he has resurfaced, and in such a dire manner, <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) and <a href="Walter%20Skinner">Walter Skinner</a> (<a href="Mitch%20Pileggi">Mitch Pileggi</a>) visit him in military custody. During his time in captivity, Mulder receives mysterious visits from two phantoms of his past: <a href="Alex%20Krycek">Alex Krycek</a> (<a href="Nicholas%20Lea">Nicholas Lea</a>) and <a href="X%20%28The%20X-Files%29">X</a> (<a href="Steven%20Williams">Steven Williams</a>). Meanwhile, Scully and Skinner go to great lengths to get him released, but are unsuccessful. Mulder's fate is ultimately made the subject of a military tribunal with Deputy Director <a href="Alvin%20Kersh">Alvin Kersh</a> (<a href="James%20Pickens%2C%20Jr.">James Pickens, Jr.</a>) in charge. At the outset, it appears Mulder will become the hopeless victim of a <a href="show%20trial">show trial</a> stacked against him.

Skinner takes Mulder's defense, while Scully, Doggett, <a href="Monica%20Reyes">Monica Reyes</a> (<a href="Annabeth%20Gish">Annabeth Gish</a>), <a href="Marita%20Covarrubias">Marita Covarrubias</a> (<a href="Laurie%20Holden">Laurie Holden</a>), <a href="List%20of%20minor%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Gibson%20Praise">Gibson Praise</a> (Jeff Gulka) and <a href="Jeffrey%20Spender">Jeffrey Spender</a> (<a href="Chris%20Owens%20%28actor%29">Chris Owens</a>) testify on Mulder's behalf. The prosecution presents Rohrer's body as evidence against Mulder. Aware that Rohrer is a seemingly-invincible "Super Soldier", Scully performs a medical examination and proves that the body is not that of Rohrer. Despite this, the evidence is rejected, given that the autopsy was not authorized, and the defense is overruled. Mulder is sentenced to death for the murder of a military officer. Later, Doggett, Skinner, Reyes, and Scully help Mulder escape, with the unexpected help of Kersh who decided he should have let Mulder go in the first place. Despite being advised to immediately leave the continent via Canada, Mulder instead takes Scully to <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>. On their way, Mulder receives a visit by three additional ghosts: <a href="The%20Lone%20Gunmen">The Lone Gunmen</a>, who advise him to flee for his life rather than continue his pursuit of the truth. Mulder politely declines. Meanwhile, Doggett and Reyes find their office emptied, suggesting that the X-Files have been closed down for the third time.

Mulder and Scully arrive at <a href="Anasazi">Anasazi</a> ruins to find a "wise man" who they believe can make sense of the classified documents Mulder has read. They discover the so-called "wise man" is none other than <a href="The%20Smoking%20Man">The Smoking Man</a> (<a href="William%20B.%20Davis">William B. Davis</a>), who, still alive after all, is hiding out to survive the colonization—an event that will happen on <a href="2012%20doomsday%20prediction">December 22, 2012</a>, the predicted <a href="Eschatology">end of the world</a>. Outside, Reyes and Doggett arrive and prepare to fight Rohrer, who has been sent to kill Mulder and The Smoking Man. Rohrer is killed when the <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> in the ruins affects his superhuman body. Switching cars with Mulder and Scully, Doggett and Reyes drive off. <a href="Black%20helicopters">Black helicopters</a> destroy the cliff dwellings—and The Smoking Man within—thinking that Mulder is still inside before flying away. Doggett and Reyes are last seen speeding away.

In a motel room in <a href="Roswell%2C%20New%20Mexico">Roswell, New Mexico</a>, Mulder and Scully prepare for bed and talk. Mulder explains his belief "that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us—greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves." Despite their slim chance for success, Mulder declares, "Maybe there's hope", as they lay back, content in each other's arms, in a loving embrace.

The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter. He noted, "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up." He expounded on the idea, saying that executive producer <a href="Frank%20Spotnitz">Frank Spotnitz</a> and he decided "it was probably time to go [...] it was strange to be writing these things knowing it was the last time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things." Spotnitz explained that Carter made the announcement in January so that "we had time to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due." Gish later said, "I have a great respect for the elegant way in which they're closing the curtain". Actor <a href="Bruce%20Harwood">Bruce Harwood</a>, who played John Fitzgerald Byers on the show, called the finale the "passing of a generation".

Several of the episode's scenes feature elements that refer to the earlier installments. The final scene in which Mulder and Scully speak in a hotel room is reminiscent of the series' <a href="Pilot%20%28The%20X-Files%29">pilot episode</a>. Furthermore, in "The Truth," it is revealed to Mulder by The Smoking Man that the aliens plan to colonize the earth on December 22, 2012, an event that, according to the show, the <a href="Maya%20peoples">Mayans</a> predicted. This is a throw-back to the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> episode "<a href="Red%20Museum">Red Museum</a>," which featured members of a <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a> who believed that the year 2012 would bring about the dawning of the New Age.

Before the release of the 2008 film "", Carter expressed an intent to make a third "X-Files" feature film that would focus on the impending alien invasion revealed in this episode, depending on the success of "The X-Files: I Want to Believe". Following the release of "The X-Files: I Want to Believe", Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny, and Anderson all expressed their interest in making one. However, on January 17, 2015, <a href="Fox%20Television%20Stations">Fox Television Group</a> chairman and CEO Gary Newman revealed that there was network interest in reviving "The X-Files", not as a movie franchise, but as a <a href="miniseries">limited run television event</a>.

With this episode, Duchovny rejoined the main cast of "The X-Files" after his departure following the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%208%29">eighth season</a> finale "Existence". The episode marks the only time that all five principal actors—Duchovny, Anderson, Patrick, Gish, and Pileggi—are credited together in the opening titles. Mulder, Scully, and the Smoking Man are the only characters to appear in both this episode and the series' pilot. This episode is the fourth of only four episodes in season nine where Duchovny appeared, the others being "<a href="Trust%20No%201">Trust No 1</a>", "<a href="Jump%20the%20Shark%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Jump the Shark</a>", and "<a href="William%20%28The%20X-Files%29">William</a>". Duchovny appeared in the first two via archival footage and only made a small cameo in the third. The episode marks the return of several characters who had either previously been killed off or had left the show, including <a href="X%20%28The%20X-Files%29">X</a>, who was killed in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%204%29">season four</a> opener "<a href="Herrenvolk%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Herrenvolk</a>"; Alex Krycek, who was shot and killed by Skinner in the eighth-season finale "Existence"; The Smoking Man, who was purportedly killed in "Requiem"; <a href="Gibson%20Praise">Gibson Praise</a>, who was last seen in the eighth-season episode "<a href="Without%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Without</a>"; <a href="The%20Lone%20Gunmen">The Lone Gunmen</a>, who were killed off in the ninth-season episode "Jump the Shark"; Jeffrey Spender, who originally was killed off in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a> episode "<a href="One%20Son">One Son</a>" but reappeared in the ninth-season episode "William"; and Marita Covarrubias, who last appeared in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a> finale "<a href="Requiem%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Requiem</a>".

Originally, this episode was to feature the recurring character <a href="Shannon%20McMahon">Shannon McMahon</a>. However, actress <a href="Lucy%20Lawless">Lucy Lawless</a> became pregnant shortly after filming the two-part episode, "<a href="Nothing%20Important%20Happened%20Today">Nothing Important Happened Today</a>" and was not available for subsequent episodes. Actress Julia Vera was called in to play the role of the woman who is helping the Smoking Man live in the Anasazi ruins. Vera had previously appeared in the sixth season two-part episode "<a href="Dreamland%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Dreamland</a>". She later called the opportunity "amazing" and declared that "my greatest experience was "The X-Files"". The final scene of the episode was originally going to feature the <a href="List%20of%20The%20X-Files%20characters%23Toothpick%20Man">Toothpick Man</a>, the alien leader of the <a href="Syndicate%20%28The%20X-Files%29">New Syndicate</a> played by <a href="Alan%20Dale">Alan Dale</a>, informing U.S. President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, played by actor Gary Newton, of Mulder's escape. The scene was filmed, but was not included in the broadcast version; executive producer Frank Spotnitz later said that he was "so happy" that the producers cut the scene, noting that—despite "a lot of debate about it, on both sides"—the scene was unable to top the final scene with Mulder and Scully. On the DVD's audio commentary, the producers mentioned that they had considered filming the shot on the Oval Office set created by "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>", a <a href="serial%20%28radio%20and%20television%29">serial</a> drama created by <a href="Aaron%20Sorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a> that was originally broadcast on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. In addition, they originally wanted to have <a href="Martin%20Sheen">Martin Sheen</a> appear as his character on "The West Wing", <a href="Josiah%20Bartlet">Josiah Bartlet</a>, instead of Bush, noting that the cameo would have been "a nice, sort of wink" to the television audience. Despite being cut from the final episode, the shot was featured as a deleted scene on the season nine video release.

The majority of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>. The first scene, featuring Mulder breaking into a military base, was shot in a hydroelectric power plant east of <a href="Fresno%2C%20California">Fresno, California</a>. The rooms that were featured in the episode were the main rooms for the power plant that "The X-Files" design team redecorated; the crew later called the set the "war room". Most of the decoration and interior scene was done by the visual effect crew; the only visible part seen in real life was a large <a href="sump%20pump">sump pump</a>. Bill Roe, the cinematographer for the episode, spent "four or five days lighting [the] set" for filming. <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a> called his work "a great job". The scenes that take place in the main computer terminal room were shot on a <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> sound stage, whereas the scenes with Mulder being tortured by the military guards were shot at <a href="Fort%20MacArthur">Fort MacArthur</a>, a former military base in <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20California">San Pedro, California</a> that was decommissioned in 1974, including The Marine Mammal Care Center located at Fort MacArthur. Filming the court room was one of the "most challenging sequences" Manners had ever done. Carter wanted the courtroom to have no spectators and no jury. This meant that Manners had to shoot each scene with a limited number of actors and make them look "fresh". Manners was terrified to film the 40-page long courtroom scene, pointing out that the show was basically re-telling a nine-year history of "The X-Files". Corey Kaplan designed the set.

The Anasazi ruins were constructed in <a href="Anza-Borrego%20Desert%20State%20Park">Anza-Borrego Desert State Park</a>. Location manager Mac Gordon later noted that, due to the presence of a rare "spiny black <a href="Horned%20lizard">horned toad</a>" in the area, he and his crew were forced to hire several biologists to locate any lizards in the area and move them elsewhere. In addition, Gordon had a difficult time persuading the park rangers to build and then blow up faux-ruins. He explained, "we were on a state park property that was an off road park, with motorcycles and [All-terrain vehicles] flying all over the place, but they still blanched when I said we have to build Indian ruins and then blow it up." However, the cameo of The Smoking Man was filmed on the <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> sound stage. Manners noted that Davis had "a hell of a time" trying to smoke his cigarettes through a hole in his neck, because the hole was "phony". The scene featuring The Smoking Man being burnt up by the fire from a missile was done via computer animation. The missiles were created via CGI technology by animator Mat Beck. The helicopter, however, included real smoke bombs. A shot of William B. Davis was overlapped with fire, and eventually a skull to give the effect that The Smoking Man's flesh was burnt away. Paul Rabwin later called the scene a "great sequence".

The last scene of the episode shot was between Anderson and Duchovny and was called "extremely tough" by Manners, due to it being "very emotional". He noted that the scene "sums up the series" about a "man who believed and a woman who was skeptical but became a believer". The scene was filmed at an actual motel, called La Cresenta. The location had previously been used in episodes "<a href="Sein%20Und%20Zeit%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Sein Und Zeit</a>" and "<a href="This%20is%20Not%20Happening">This is Not Happening</a>".

The final scene, featuring a conversation between Mulder and Scully, has been examined by author V. Alan White due to its perceived religious undertones. In the book "The Philosophy of The X-Files", he notes that the final scene "undermines Mulder's seemingly persistent scorn of traditional" religion and his subtle acceptance of <a href="theism">theism</a>. In previous episodes—mainly those dealing with Scully's <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>—Mulder shows a lack of approval when it came to the concept of <a href="organized%20religion">organized religion</a>, often pointing out that "theologians can be just as dogmatic as scientists" when it comes to unexplained phenomena. White proposes that this needling may be intentional on Mulder's part, as a form of "ironic reversal of [Scully's] skepticism about the paranormal". However, the final lines of "The Truth" see Mulder talking about a belief in "something greater than us, greater than any alien force". White also points out the fact that during this scene Mulder grabs Scully's gold cross, an icon that symbolizes her belief through much of the series.

Several of the episode's scenes and motifs have been compared to popular myths and legends. Michelle Bush, in her book "Myth-X", equated Mulder's overall quest to that of the search for the <a href="Holy%20Grail">Holy Grail</a>. She notes that in "The Truth", Mulder and Scully metaphorically "find their way to the Grail castle" only to discover that the <a href="Fisher%20King">Fisher King</a>—the wounded knight charged with protecting the secret—is actually The Smoking Man. Furthermore, Bush compared the final scene of the episode—featuring Mulder musing about hope regarding an alien invasion—to the myth of <a href="Pandora%27s%20Box">Pandora's Box</a>. According to legend, the ancient <a href="List%20of%20Greek%20mythological%20figures">Greek gods</a> gave <a href="Pandora">Pandora</a> a box filled with evils and told her not to open it. Due to her curiosity, she disobeyed and unleashed various calamities unto the world. Bush argues that the <a href="Syndicate%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Syndicate</a>'s tampering with alien technology—such as their <a href="alien-human%20hybrid">alien-human hybrid</a> experiments—are similar to the contents of the box. She notes that, in both cases, "man's curiosity is his downfall". In the end, however, both Pandora's box and the world of "The X-Files" contain hope, which, in the legend, was the only thing in the box that Pandora did not let go of.

"The Truth" was originally aired on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on May 19, 2002, and became the most-watched episode of the ninth season, receiving the season's highest <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a>s. Nielsen ratings are <a href="audience%20measurement">audience measurement</a> system that determine the audience size and composition of <a href="broadcast%20programming">television programming</a> in the United States. "The Truth" earned a household rating of 7.5, meaning that it was seen by 7.5 percent of the nation's estimated households. It was viewed by a total of 13.25 million viewers in the United States. On the date of its airing, the episode ranked third in its timeslot, behind the season finale of "" and the heavily promoted reunion of "<a href="The%20Cosby%20Show">The Cosby Show</a>". "The Truth", however, placed ahead of the season finale of "<a href="The%20Practice">The Practice</a>". In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the episode made its first appearance on <a href="Sky1">Sky1</a> on September 26, 2002 and received 1.03 million viewers, placing "The X-Files" second in the top ten broadcasts for Sky1 for that week, behind "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>". The episode was included on "<a href="The%20X-Files%20Mythology%2C%20Volume%204%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Super%20Soldiers">The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers</a>", a DVD collection that contains installments involved with the alien "Super Soldiers" arc.

The entry received mixed reviews by critics; the main reason for criticism was that, instead of creating a conclusion, the episode raised new questions for the audience. <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it one star out of five. The two, despite calling the opening "promising", derided the episode's ending—especially the revelation of alien colonization of December 22, 2012—writing, "is this really what the series was about?" Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson concluded that the problem with the episode was that the show, which he called "brilliant—frequently, truly brilliant" decided "to define itself in the summing up" with the episode, which did not answer very many questions. <a href="UGO">UGO</a> named the episode the fourteenth "Worst Series Finale" and wrote that the episode—and the show's eighth and ninth seasons by extension—were negatively affected by the series' lack of a defining plot line. The article noted that, while the episode claimed to wrap up the story arcs for the series, "the trial of Mulder ultimately resulted in very little satisfying payoff to the series' overarching mysteries". Joyce Millman, writing for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", after the premiere of "The Truth", said of the show: "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination." M.A. Crang, in his book "Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11", was critical of the episode's trial sequences. While he stated that these scenes "do a good job of bringing together the many disparate threads of this arc", he felt that they were "interminably dull".

Not all reviews were critical. Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", wrote a rather positive review of the episode. He noted that, while the episode "told us nothing of significance" regarding the "big picture" mythology story arc, the chance to see Mulder and Scully together one last time resulted in "an exquisite Mulder-Scully moment". He was particularly pleased with the final scene, noting that it was an appropriate conclusion; he called it "fitting", as well as "wonderful". Kessenich maintained that, were it not for the return of Duchovny, "nobody would have given a damn about the end of this series." Julie Salamon of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" gave the episode a positive review. Salamon noted that "Until the end, the series maintained its mesmerizing visual gloominess, cleverly punctuated with suggestive plays of color and light". She claimed the show "also retained its conspiracy-theory heart that has appealed so greatly to viewers". John C. Snider of <a href="SciFiDimensions">SciFiDimensions</a> praised the episode, stating "The Truth is a satisfying conclusion to the series, with plenty of twists and turns, a few surprise guest appearances, and an explosive finale complete with requisite black helicopters. The romantics among us will also be pleased with the culmination of the Mulder/Scully relationship".

In 2011, the finale was ranked number twenty-two on the <a href="TV%20Guide%20Network">TV Guide Network</a> special, "TV's Most Unforgettable Finales".

Badnjak (Serbian)

The badnjak (<a href="Serbian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic</a>: бадњак, ), also called veseljak (весељак, , literally "jovial one" in <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a>), is a tree branch or young tree brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, a central tradition in <a href="Serbian%20Christmas%20traditions">Serbian Christmas celebration</a>s. The tree from which the badnjak is cut, preferably a young and straight <a href="Quercus%20cerris">Austrian oak</a>, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve. The felling, preparation, bringing in, and laying on the fire, are surrounded by elaborate rituals, with many regional variations. The burning of the log is accompanied by prayers that the coming year brings food, happiness, love, luck, and riches. The log burns on throughout <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a>, when the first visitor strikes it with a poker or a branch to make sparks fly, while wishing that the family's happiness and prosperity be as abundant as the sparks. As most <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a> today live in towns and cities, the badnjak is often symbolically represented by a cluster of oak twigs with brown leaves attached, with which the home is decorated on Christmas Eve.

Since the early 20th century, the Serbian badnjak tradition has also been celebrated more publicly. Before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, soldiers of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Kingdom of Serbia</a> developed the custom of laying a badnjak on a fire in their <a href="barracks">barracks</a>. In the succeeding <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated and standardized in army service regulations, but the tradition ended at the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Since the early 1990s, the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox Church</a> has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the sapling to be used as the badnjak and take it to their church, where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially placed on a fire built in the churchyard.

The festive kindling of the badnjak commemorates the fire that—according to Serbian folk tradition—the shepherds of <a href="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> built in the cave where <a href="Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> was <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">born</a>, to warm the Baby Jesus and <a href="Theotokos">his mother</a> throughout the night. The badnjak may also be seen as a <a href="Christian%20symbolism">symbol</a> of the cross upon which Christ was <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucified</a>, the warmth of its fire symbolizing the <a href="Atonement%20in%20Christianity%23Eastern%20Christianity">salvation</a> which, in the <a href="Christianity">Christian belief</a>, the crucifixion made possible for mankind. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the <a href="Slavic%20mythology">old Slavic religion</a>. They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. The burning symbolized sunshine, securing the vitalizing power of the sun in the coming year. Other <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slavic peoples</a> have similar traditions, and the custom that a family brings a log into the house and burns it on Christmas Eve has also been recorded in other parts of Europe.

Traditionally, the badnjak ceremony begins on Christmas Eve, but there are many regional variations surrounding the details. Early in the morning the head of each family, usually accompanied by several male relatives, selects and fells the tree from which a log will be cut for their household. The group announces its departure by firing guns or small celebratory <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a> called "prangija". The <a href="Quercus%20cerris">Turkey oak</a> is the most popular species of tree selected in most regions, but other oaks are also chosen. <a href="Beech">Beech</a>, <a href="pear">pear</a>, <a href="quince">quince</a>, <a href="hornbeam">hornbeam</a>, and <a href="plum">plum</a> trees are used in eastern <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, although less frequently than oak trees. In some areas of <a href="Montenegrin%20Littoral">Montenegrin Littoral</a> where oaks do not grow, <a href="olive">olive</a>s, <a href="bay%20laurel">bay laurel</a>s, <a href="elm">elm</a>s, or <a href="Arbutus%20unedo">strawberry tree</a>s are used instead. Young, straight, and undamaged specimens are preferred. The badnjak may be more valued if it is felled stealthily in someone else's rather than in one's own woods.

Generally, each household prepares one badnjak, although more are cut in some regions. Depending on the local custom, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegrin</a> Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means that each of the males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and the thinnest linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a>, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of <a href="New%20Years%20Day">New Years Day</a>, <a href="Epiphany%20%28holiday%29">Epiphany</a>, and the Feast of <a href="Saint%20Sava">Saint Sava</a>.

In Grbalj, south-west of <a href="Kotor">Kotor</a>, the number of the logs is equal to the number of people in the household. A <a href="Pistacia%20terebinthus">terebinth</a> is cut down for the badnjak associated with the woman of the house, called the "badnjačica" (), meaning she-badnjak. The same term is also used in other areas where only a pair of oak logs is cut, in which case "badnjačica" refers to the smaller of the two. In <a href="Resava%20River%23Region">Resava</a>, the "badnjačica" is prepared from an <a href="Quercus%20frainetto">Italian oak</a>, and the badnjak from a Turkey oak. In Zagarač, central Montenegro, both of the logs may be cut from the same tree if it is tall enough, the "badnjačica" then coming from the upper, thinner part of the trunk. The pair is in some regions joined by a third log called the "badnjačić"—badnjak the child. Although young and thin trees are usually used for the badnjak, in northern <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>'s region of <a href="Bukovica%2C%20Croatia">Bukovica</a> two relatively thick logs with diameters of 30 to 50 centimeters (12 to 20 inches) are prepared, plus one thinner log (called trinity). In other areas dry oak branches are collected from the ground, and used instead of a log.

When the head of household finds a suitable tree, he stands in front of it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the <a href="Sign%20of%20the%20Cross">Sign of the Cross</a>, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: "I have come to you to take to my home, to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place." He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put gloves on before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. It must not be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man. In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off from the base of the tree. In <a href="%C5%A0umadija">Šumadija</a>, half of a circular loaf of bread is left on the stump, the other half being eaten on the way back home. In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.

The first splinter from the tree is taken home and placed where prosperity is especially desired, such as beside the <a href="beehive">beehive</a>s, in the hen roost, or between milk basins in the <a href="dairy">dairy room</a>, in the hope that the coming year's <a href="kaymak">kaymak</a> will clot to form thick layers in the basins. It may also be placed beneath some <a href="baker%27s%20yeast">baker's yeast</a>, so that the prosperity of the household may grow like yeast. In <a href="Semberija">Semberija</a>, a piece of the splinter is put in the dough for the <a href="%C4%8Desnica">česnica</a>, a round loaf of bread prepared specially for Christmas dinner. This is done "because of bees", as the reason is traditionally termed.

The top of the felled tree is removed, leaving the badnjak of such a length that allows it to be carried on a man's shoulder, up to about long. Its branches may be lopped off, or not, depending on the local custom. Once in the home, each badnjak is leaned vertically against the house beside the entrance door. In Montenegrin Littoral, each should be adorned with leaved bay laurel, olive, <a href="juniper">juniper</a>, and <a href="rosemary">rosemary</a> twigs, which are tied to the trunk's top, middle, and base with <a href="ivy">ivy</a> or red silken or woolen threads. In parts of eastern Serbia and <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> the badnjak is wrapped in a man's shirt.

In west Serbia's region of Rađevina, centered on the town of <a href="Krupanj">Krupanj</a>, the badnjak prepared for each household is cut into three logs, the most important of which is the "dozemak"—the log that comes from the part of the trunk that grew nearest to the ground. In Resava, <a href="Leva%C4%8D">Levač</a>, Temnić, and <a href="Jadar%20%28Serbia%29">Jadar</a> of Serbia, as well as in <a href="Ozren%20%28Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina%29">Ozren</a> and <a href="Romanija">Romanija</a> of Bosnia, the badnjak is cut into three logs associated respectively with the men, the women, and the children.

In the evening, a man of the family brings their badnjak into the house. If there is more than one badnjak, the thickest of them is regarded as the main one, and is brought in first. Stepping across the threshold, right foot first, the man greets his gathered family with the words "Good evening and happy Christmas Eve to you." The woman of the house greets him back, saying "May God give you well-being, and may you have good luck", or "Good luck to you, and together with you for many years to come [may we be]", or similar, before throwing grain from a sieve at the man and the badnjak he carries. In the <a href="Serb%20clans">clan</a> of <a href="Ku%C4%8Di">Kuči</a>, the woman touches the "beard" of the main badnjak with a whole loaf of bread. In Montenegro, two women holding lighted candles stand one on either side of the house door as the badnjaks are carried in.

Upon entering the house the man approaches the fireplace, called "ognjište" ()—the hearth of an "ognjište" is similar to a <a href="campfire">campfire</a>, in that it has no vertical surround. He lays the badnjak down on the fire and moves it a little forward, to summon prosperity for the household. Any other logs are brought in by other males and laid on the fire parallel or perpendicular to the first. In a family with the tradition of burning the badnjak and "badnjačica", they are laid one across the other; the males then kiss the former, and the females the latter. In Bukovica the two thicker logs are placed side by side, and the thinner one (trinity) is placed in parallel on top. In 19th-century <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>, families with large houses would load their logs onto three or four pairs of oxen, which were then led into the house. The logs were unloaded and laid on the fire, and the oxen driven out through the back door.

Immediately after the badnjak has been brought in, or immediately before in some places, an armful of straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, ""Kvo", "kvo", "kvo"", with the family's children imitating chicks, ""Piju", "piju", "piju"", while they pick at the straw. In <a href="%C4%8Ce%C4%8Dava">Čečava</a>, northern Bosnia, the children then lie down on the straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year. In the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a>, the ceremony is accompanied by the words ""Kuda slama, tuda slava""—"Whither straw, thither celebration." A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw. It will be collected and taken out of the house on the morning of the second day after Christmas. Some of the straw may be set aside and used in <a href="apotropaic%20magic">apotropaic</a> practices in the coming year.

The thicker end of the log, the end that was nearest to the tree's roots, may have a special significance. In Montenegro it is called the head of the badnjak; the main log is laid on the fire with its head pointing east. In central Serbia the badnjak is laid with its thicker end sticking out from the "ognjište". The household's shepherds would kiss over it to ensure an abundance of lambs in the coming year. In <a href="Gru%C5%BEa%20%28region%29">Gruža</a> it is coated with honey which is then licked by children. At the side of "ognjište" where the thicker end is situated, the family may place a <a href="plowshare">plowshare</a>, a round loaf of bread, a glove filled with wheat, sugar, or a sieve containing grain, honey, cakes, wine, salt, prunes, walnuts, and apples. The cut surface of the thicker end is in Čečava kissed by all the family members after the badnjak is laid on the fire.

The head of the household takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a <a href="toast%20%28honor%29">toast</a>: "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" or, "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" or similar. The name "veseljak", literally "jovial one", is used along with "badnjak" in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the "beard" of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.

The badnjak should not be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It should not be moved when about to burn through, lest the log break at the place most consumed by the fire, which is usually strongest at the center of the fireplace; the separation of the log should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should fall asleep before the log splits, otherwise some of them may die in the coming year, without warning.

The moment when the badnjak burns through may be marked with festivities, such as the log being kissed by the head of household, and wine being poured over it accompanied by toasts. A reward may be given to the family member who was the first to notice the event, and in the past the men would go outside and fire their guns in celebration. There is a special verb "preveseliti" used instead of the common "pregoreti" to express "to burn through" when referring to the badnjak, which has the same <a href="root%20%28linguistics%29">root</a> as the noun "veseljak". Once the log has burnt through, some families let the fire go out, while in others the men keep watch in shifts during the night to keep the badnjak burning.

Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end is often taken out of the fire and used according to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and <a href="apiary">apiaries</a>, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.

The badnjak burns on through Christmas Day, whether rekindled or kept burning from the Eve. The first visit the family receives that day is considered important, comparable to New Years Day <a href="first-foot">first-foot</a>ing in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. The family may choose someone, usually a young male, to be their first visitor, known as a "polaznik", before the arrival of whom no outsider is allowed to enter the house. Early on the morning of Christmas Day he steps into the house, right foot first, and greets the family with "Christ is Born", to which they reply "Truly He is Born." The "polaznik" then approaches the "ognjište" and repeatedly strikes the burning log with a poker or a branch to make sparks fly. At the same time he utters a wish that the happiness and prosperity of the household be as abundant as the sparks:

The wording of this well-wishing may vary, but its intention is always the same, to invoke happiness and prosperity. The "polaznik" will then throw a coin into the fire before being presented with a round loaf of bread, the traditional gift for the "polaznik", usually accompanied by some other present. The custom to use a domestic animal as a "polaznik" was kept in some regions until the first half of the 20th century. In Rađevina, the head of the household would lead a sheep into the house, place it between the "ognjište" and himself, and utter the wishes while striking the badnjak with a branch cut from it, before saying: "We passed one fire, we are not afraid of another." His wife would then kiss him over the sheep after saying "may the ewes kiss the lambs as we kiss each other."

Embers of the badnjak may be used for <a href="divination">divination</a> in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and livestock sorts grown by the family are taken out from the "ognjište" and placed on the <a href="%C4%8Desnica">česnica</a>. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set aside to be taken with water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.

These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses usually have no "ognjište" on which to burn a badnjak, but it may be symbolically represented by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs so that they can be put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches. In a common arrangement, the cluster of oak twigs is bound together with twigs of <a href="European%20Cornel">European Cornel</a> and several stalks of straw.

The laying of a badnjak on the fire was considered the least a Serbian family could do to show their devotion to Serbian tradition. In <a href="Petar%20II%20Petrovi%C4%87-Njego%C5%A1">Petar II Petrović-Njegoš</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Mountain%20Wreath">The Mountain Wreath</a>", the plot of which takes place in 18th-century Montenegro, <a href="Voivode">Voivode</a> Batrić urges converts to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> to return to Christianity and Serbdom: "[...] Lay the Serbian Christmas-log [badnjak] on the fire, paint the <a href="Easter%20egg">Easter egg</a>s various colours, observe with care the <a href="Lent">Lent</a> and <a href="Nativity%20Fast">Christmas fasts</a>. As for the rest, do what your heart desires!" Petrović-Njegoš describes the holiday atmosphere that surrounds the burning badnjak on Christmas Eve through the words of Abbot Stefan, one of the mains characters of "The Mountain Wreath":

The badnjak ceremony, originally performed only within the family, became a more public celebration. A custom developed before World War I in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Kingdom of Serbia</a> to lay the badnjak on a fire built in military barracks, so that the soldiers stationed there over Christmas could share in the holiday atmosphere. In the succeeding <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, the military badnjak ceremony was standardized in army service regulations. On Christmas Eve, under the command of a specially appointed officer, the representatives of military units of a garrison formed a festive procession on horses, accompanied with music. Members of citizens' associations and other civilians of the garrison town usually joined the procession as it proceeded to the nearest wood to collect the badnjak. They felled a set number of trees, dedicated respectively to the <a href="Royal%20Compound">Royal Palace</a>, the military command of the town, the respective commands of units of the garrison, its oldest officer, and its officers' assembly house. The procession brought the trees to the barracks, in whose yard an open fire was built. The garrison commander then placed the trees ceremonially on the fire, and gave an appropriate address.

More and more state institutions, private firms, organizations, and clubs joined the procession each year, and the event began to take on the character of a public holiday. During the 1930s, the laying of badnjak on the fire became a court ritual. It was performed, in the presence of the <a href="House%20of%20Kara%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87">royal family</a>, by representatives of the army in the Royal Palace's room with a fireplace. At the end of the 1930s in some parts of Yugoslavia, especially <a href="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a> and Montenegro, the military badnjak ceremony was performed not in the barracks yard but in a square in the garrison town. An open fire was built, on which the badnjak was placed by an Orthodox priest in the presence of soldiers and citizens. This tradition, symbolizing the unity of state, church, and people, was ended by the outbreak of World War II.

<a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia's socialist government</a> suppressed or discouraged public religious celebrations until the early 1990s. Since then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically three elements to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the oak sapling to be used as the badnjak, taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes <a href="Vespers">Vespers</a>, placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.

The expedition to cut down the badnjak is the basic activity in the preparation part of the celebration. It can be performed by an individual, but it is usually a collective act accompanied by a festive procession that may include <a href="carriage">carriage</a>s and horsemen. After the tree to be used as the badnjak is cut down, it is adorned with straw, ribbons, oranges, apples, and sometimes with the <a href="Flag%20of%20Serbia">Serbian flag</a>. In some parishes more than one badnjak is used in the celebration, and a different tree is felled for each. Often bunches of leaved oak twigs are prepared to be distributed to the congregation gathered at the church. Each badnjak is festively taken to the church gate, often transported on carriages. The badnjak may be taken into the churchyard without any ceremony, or it may be followed by a procession, as is the case in parts of <a href="Republika%20Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> and the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Bay of Kotor</a>.

The ritual is the central part of the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the beginning of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, the trees are placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, <a href="Thurible">censes</a> it while singing the <a href="Troparion">Troparion of the Nativity</a>, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, <a href="Holy%20water%20in%20Eastern%20Christianity">holy water</a> may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of <a href="basil">basil</a> into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.

After the ritual the priest delivers a short sermon, followed by the church choir singing Christmas songs; poems that praise the Nativity of Jesus Christ may be recited. In Montenegro, <a href="decasyllable">decasyllable</a> <a href="Serbian%20epic%20poetry">Serbian epics</a> are sung to an accompaniment played on the <a href="gusle">gusle</a>, a traditional Serbian bowed string instrument. The celebration ends with parishioners gathered around the fire, served with cooked <a href="rakia">rakia</a>, wine, or tea, and the food allowed during the <a href="Nativity%20Fast">Nativity Fast</a>. Parishioners may pick a twig from the badnjak and take it home to place in front of their <a href="icon">icon</a>, or at another appropriate location.

Although Serbian public religious celebrations, as those of other peoples, were discouraged in Socialist Yugoslavia until the early 1990s, they continued among <a href="Serbian%20American">Serbian American</a>s. The public badnjak ceremony was held in Serbian Orthodox parishes in the United States during that period, as it is today.

The origin of the badnjak is explained by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> , <a href="Theotokos">Mary Theotokos</a> gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By <a href="Holy%20Tradition">Holy Tradition</a>, the manger was located in a <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nativity">cave near that town</a>. An angel of the Lord appeared to a group of shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By folk tradition, the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.

While blessing the badnjak, some priests chant the following prayer: "O Lord Jesus Christ, our God, who did plant the <a href="Tree%20of%20Life%20%28Judeo-Christian%29%23Eastern%20Christianity">Tree of Life</a> in paradise so that it might bestow upon us eternal blessedness, bless also now this tree which is a <a href="Christian%20symbolism">symbol</a> of <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Thy cross</a> and the Tree of Life in paradise, and which reminds us of Thy holy birth and of the logs which the shepherds of Bethlehem kindled to warm themselves when they came to worship Thee, the divine infant, and thereby prefigured Thy salvation-bearing cross."

Scholars regard the badnjak customs as practises inherited from the <a href="Slavic%20mythology">old Slavic religion</a>. In the pre-Christian religion of the Serbs, as shown by Serbian scholar <a href="Veselin%20%C4%8Cajkanovi%C4%87">Veselin Čajkanović</a>, there were trees seen as dwelling places of spirits or divinities. Čajkanović argues that there were also trees seen as divinities "per se". He considers the badnjak as a convincing example of the latter. Salutations, prayers, and sacrifices such as grain, wine, and honey are offered to him (the name "badnjak" is of masculine gender in <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a>); he is consistently treated not as a tree but as a person.

German scholar and folklorist <a href="Wilhelm%20Mannhardt">Wilhelm Mannhardt</a> holds that the log represented an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation. The sacrifices offered to the badnjak were meant to guarantee the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family. Its burning symbolized sunshine, and was intended to secure the vitalizing power of the sun in the ensuing year. The lighting of the log could be regarded as a fusion of <a href="tree%20worship">tree worship</a> and <a href="fire%20worship">fire worship</a>, attested in Slavic customs; e.g., <a href="Istria">Istria</a>ns fed the logs lighted on <a href="Nativity%20of%20St.%20John%20the%20Baptist">St. John's Day</a> by sprinkling wheat upon them. Čajkanović characterizes the pre-Christian badnjak as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, comparing it in this respect with <a href="Attis">Attis</a>, <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a>, and <a href="Desmodium%20oojeinense">Sandan</a>. He also proposes that the crosses made from the thicker end of the log may have originated from <a href="Idolatry">idols</a> representing deities comparable with the <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman</a> <a href="Lares">Lares</a>, the cruciform having developed from an <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> shape of the idols. The badnjak is preferably cut from an oak, which was the most respected tree in the old Slavic religion, associated with the supreme god <a href="Perun">Perun</a>.

Archaeologist <a href="Arthur%20Evans">Sir Arthur Evans</a> was a guest in a Serbian highlander family in the region of <a href="Krivo%C5%A1ije">Krivošije</a>, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he concluded that the badnjak customs were connected with <a href="ancestor%20worship">ancestor worship</a>. The lighting of the log on the "ognjište" could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the "polaznik" after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.

Fire from the domestic hearth was under no circumstances given out of the house on Christmas Eve, not even to a neighbor whose fire had gone out. The reason for this prohibition, according to Čajkanović, was the belief that the Eve is a time when the ancestral spirits, guardians of the family's happiness and prosperity, are especially active in this world. Christmas Eve dinner is a feast prepared in their honor, and they join the family at it. They gather on the straw spread over the floor, and on the hearth. These spirits could be removed from the family if any piece of their fire were taken away by an outsider. In people's words, fire should not be given lest the luck be taken away from the house, or for better crops, or because of bees. Referring to the latter explanation, Čajkanović argues that, in the old religion of the Serbs, the bees were regarded as pure and sacred insects, in whom ancestral spirits could dwell. The same explanation, "because of bees", is also given for the aforementioned custom of putting a piece of the badnjak's first splinter in the dough for the česnica.

Russian philologist <a href="Vladimir%20Toporov">Vladimir Toporov</a> has proposed that the felling of the badnjak was originally a reenactment of the mythical fight in which "Mladi Božić" ("young god") slew his father "Stari Badnjak" ("old Badnjak"). "Božić", the <a href="diminutive">diminutive form</a> of the noun "bog", meaning god, is also the Serbian for "Christmas". The characters of "Stari Badnjak" and "Mladi Božić" are found in old Serbian Christmas songs, where they are not explicitly referred to as father and son, and no fight between them is mentioned. By Toporov, the former personified the last day of the Old Year, the climax of the power of <a href="Chaos%20%28mythology%29">Chaos</a>, and the latter personified the first day of the New Year, the beginning of reestablishment of <a href="Cosmos">Cosmic Order</a>. He regards "Stari Badnjak" and "Mladi Božić" as originating from respectively the dragon and the dragon slayer of the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20mythology%23Dragon%20or%20Serpent">Proto-Indo-European mythology</a>. "Stari Badnjak" would be related to both the <a href="Vedas">Vedic</a> serpent "Ahi Budhnya" ("the Dragon of the Deep") killed by <a href="Indra">Indra</a>, and the <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek</a> dragon <a href="Python%20%28mythology%29">Python</a> killed by <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>. The words "badnjak", "budhnya", and "python" stem from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> <a href="root%20%28linguistics%29">root</a> <a href="Asterisk%23Historical%20linguistics">*</a>"bhudh-", denoting bottom, foundation, depths, and related notions.

According to Russian philologist and mythographer <a href="Boris%20Uspensky">Boris Uspensky</a>, "Stari Badnjak" and "Mladi Božić" have analogues in <a href="East%20Slavs">East Slavic</a> tradition—Nikola's Dad and Nikola. The name Nikola is a popular reference to <a href="Saint%20Nicholas">Saint Nicholas of Myra</a>, whose feast falls nineteen days before Christmas, on 6 December, his "dad" being celebrated the day before. Nikola is portrayed in East Slavic folklore as merciful and protective towards the common people, patron of animals and agriculture, connected with riches, abundance, and fertility. Uspensky argues that this saint took on attributes of the serpentine god <a href="Veles%20%28god%29">Volos</a>, whose cult was very strong among East Slavs before Christianization. He was the adversary of the dreadful thunder-god Perun, who is in this case reflected in Nikola's Dad.

The notion of a quarrel between Nikola and his "dad" is present in a number of legends. The connection between the father–son pairs of "Stari Badnjak"–"Mladi Božić" and Nikola's Dad–Nikola is corroborated by the fact that, in many East Slavic regions, practices characteristic for Christmas have been transferred to the Feast of Saint Nicholas. There is, however, an inversion in the comparison between these two pairs. In the former pair, the first stems from the mythical dragon, and the second from the dragon fighter, while in the latter pair it is vice versa. This inversion explains, by Uspensky, the fact that in some areas Nikola's Dad is celebrated on the day after his son's feast, rather than on the eve of it. In that way, the "dragon" (Nikola) comes before the "dragon fighter" (Nikola's Dad), as is the case with "Stari Badnjak" and "Mladi Božić".

Serbian ethnologist Petar Vlahović has proposed that the noun "badnjak" and the related adjective "badnji" (attributive "Christmas Eve") are derived from the root of the verb "bdeti" ("to be awake"), referring to a custom of staying awake through the night before Christmas Day. The same etymology of the adjective "badnji" has also been proposed by <a href="Vuk%20Stefanovi%C4%87%20Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87">Vuk Stefanović Karadžić</a>, 19th-century Serbian philologist, systematizer of <a href="oral%20literature">oral literature</a>, and ethnographer.

The custom that a family solemnly brings a log into the house and lights it on the hearth on Christmas Eve has been recorded in various parts of Europe. In England, a <a href="Yule%20log">Yule log</a> used to be festively kindled on the domestic hearth so "that sweet luck may come while the log is a-teending", as described by 17th-century poet <a href="Robert%20Herrick%20%28poet%29">Robert Herrick</a>. In France, the log had different regional names: "chalendal", "calignaou", "tréfoir", and "tréfouet". In <a href="Provence">Provence</a>, it had to be cut from a fruit tree; it was brought in by the whole family while they sang a carol praying for blessing on the house, that the women might bear children, the nanny-goats kids, and the ewes lambs, and that their grain and wine might abound. Before the log was placed on the fire, the youngest child in the family poured wine on it. Logs were devotionally laid on the domestic fire on Christmas Eve in various parts of Italy; in <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, Christmas is called "Festa di Ceppo", literally "feast of log". In the <a href="Valdichiana">Val di Chiana</a>, the children of the family were blindfolded and commanded to beat the burning log with tongs. Traces of Christmas-log customs can also be found in Germany and Scandinavia. In <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a> the family placed a "Christklotz" (Christ log) on the fire before going to bed, so that it might burn all through the night.

In <a href="Croats">Croatian</a> tradition, objects of two different types are referred to as "badnjak". The first type includes leaved branches cut from Turkey oaks or <a href="hazel">hazel trees</a>, up to long with as many <a href="catkin">catkin</a>s as possible. Such a branch used to be placed on Christmas Eve morning above the house door, under the eaves, or on the roof, and had an aesthetic role. The other type includes logs cut usually from oak trunks. In the evening the family used to ritually bring three such logs into the house and burn them on the hearth. These practices are no longer performed, but in some places a modified form of badnjak is used: a cross is carved into the bark of pieces of firewood which are burned in kitchen stoves on Christmas Eve. In Bulgaria, the youngest man of the family goes on the Eve into a forest to cut down an oak, elm, or pear tree, which will be used as the "badnik" (бъдник). After the man brings it into the house, a hole is bored in one end of the "badnik" and filled with wine, cooking oil, and <a href="incense">incense</a>. The hole is plugged, and that end of the log is wrapped with a white linen cloth before the "badnik" is festively burned on the hearth.

In Greece, a large log was lit on the hearth on Christmas Eve and kept burning or smoldering through the <a href="Twelve%20Days%20of%20Christmas">Twelve Days of Christmas</a>. This was done as a protection against the demons called "<a href="Kallikantzaros">Kallikantzaroi</a>", believed to be emerging from their dens at night during that period to attack people and damage their property. The fire and smoke from the log was thought to prevent the "Kallikantzaroi" from entering the house down the chimney. The ritual burning of logs on the Eve was also carried out in Albania. When the "buzm", as the log was called there, was about to be brought into the house, a member of the family would go out into the yard, shout the name of the household's head, and proclaim that the "buzm" was coming and bringing all kinds of delicious things. The head of the household would respond by saying "You are welcome!" and the "buzm" would be ceremonially brought in, greeted by the family and treated with great respect. The log would be placed on the hearth, and often a significant part of all food and drink in the house would be put on the log and burned together with it.

Home (The X-Files)

"Home" is the second episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>", which originally aired on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox Broadcasting Company</a> network on October 11, 1996. Directed by <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a>, it was written by <a href="Glen%20Morgan">Glen Morgan</a> and <a href="James%20Wong%20%28producer%29">James Wong</a>. "Home" is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story—a stand-alone plot unconnected to the overarching <a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">mythology</a> of "The X-Files". Watched by 18.85 million viewers, the initial broadcast had a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 11.9. "Home" was the only episode of "The X-Files" to carry a <a href="TV-MA">TV-MA</a> rating upon broadcast and the first to receive a <a href="Television%20content%20rating%20systems">viewer discretion warning</a> for <a href="Graphic%20violence">graphic content</a>. Critics were generally complimentary, and praised the disturbing nature of the plot; several made comparisons to the work of director <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>. Some reviewers felt that the violence was excessive.

The series centers on <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> special agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>), who work on cases linked to the <a href="paranormal">paranormal</a>, called "<a href="X-File">X-File</a>s". Mulder is a believer in the paranormal; the skeptical Scully was initially assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the death of a baby born with <a href="Congenital%20disorder">severe physical defects</a>. Traveling to the small isolated town of <a href="Home%2C%20Pennsylvania">Home, Pennsylvania</a>, the pair meet the Peacocks, a family of deformed farmers who have not left their house in a decade. Initially, Mulder suspects that the brothers kidnapped and raped a woman to father the child, but the investigation uncovers a long history of incest involving the Peacocks' own mother.

"Home" marks the return of writers Morgan and Wong, who left the show following its <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a>. They attempted to make the episode as ambitious and shocking as possible and were inspired by real-life events, including a story from <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>'s <a href="My%20Autobiography%20%28Chaplin%29">autobiography</a> about an encounter in a Welsh lodging. The graphic content of the script attracted controversy from early in the production process. Commentators have identified themes within the episode that satirize the <a href="American%20Dream">American Dream</a>, address globalization, and explore the nature of motherhood. It has been cited as a seminal episode of "The X-Files" by critics and crew members.

In the small town of <a href="Home%2C%20Pennsylvania">Home, Pennsylvania</a>, a woman gives birth to a deformed baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury it near their dilapidated house during a rainstorm. <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a <a href="Sandlot%20ball">sandlot ball game</a>. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (<a href="Tucker%20Smallwood">Tucker Smallwood</a>), Mulder asks whether the Peacock brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and is without electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> since the war. The three Peacock brothers watch the agents from their front porch.

During an <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a>, the agents discover that the baby suffocated by inhaling dirt—meaning it was buried alive. Scully suggests that the baby's defects could have been caused by inbreeding. Mulder insists this would be impossible, since the Peacocks seem to live in an all-male household. Suspecting that the Peacocks have kidnapped and raped a woman, Mulder and Scully investigate their now-abandoned residence and discover blood, scissors, and a shovel on a table. In retaliation, the Peacocks enter Sheriff Taylor's house during the night and murder him and his wife, Barbara (Judith Maxie).

Laboratory tests indicate the baby's parents were members of the Peacock family. Believing that the three Peacock brothers must be holding the dead baby's mother hostage, the agents and Deputy Barney Paster (<a href="Sebastian%20Spence">Sebastian Spence</a>) go to arrest them. When Paster breaks down the front door of their residence, he is decapitated by a <a href="booby%20trap">booby trap</a>. Mulder and Scully release the Peacocks' pigs to lure them out of the house before searching it. The agents find a quadruple <a href="amputee">amputee</a> hidden under a bed. She is revealed to be Mrs. Peacock, the mother of the boys, who has been breeding with them for years. The brothers realize Mulder and Scully are inside their house and attack. The two youngest sons withstand several gunshots before dying, one of them impaled on another booby trap. Afterwards, the agents discover that Mrs. Peacock and her eldest son have escaped in their car, planning to start a new family elsewhere.

"Home" marked the return of writers <a href="Glen%20Morgan">Glen Morgan</a> and <a href="James%20Wong%20%28producer%29">James Wong</a>, who had left production of "The X-Files" after the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> to work on other television projects. Before their departure, Morgan and Wong had written many episodes of the series and were instrumental in the success of its <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%201%29">first season</a>. The two developed "", a science fiction television series canceled after one season. Subsequently, the two rejoined the staff of "The X-Files" and became writers for the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a>. To make an impact for their return, they decided to write an ambitious story and attempted to produce a script shocking enough to push the boundaries of television. "Space: Above and Beyond" co-star <a href="Kristen%20Cloke">Kristen Cloke</a> advised them to study books about the "dark" side of nature so that they could write about subjects like <a href="survivalism">survivalism</a>.

Many actors from "Space: Above and Beyond" appeared in the fourth season; the first was Tucker Smallwood, who portrays Sheriff Andy Taylor in "Home". When Morgan first pitched the episode to <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a>, he specifically described three actors from the show—<a href="James%20Morrison%20%28actor%29">James Morrison</a>, <a href="Rodney%20Rowland">Rodney Rowland</a> and <a href="Morgan%20Weisser">Morgan Weisser</a>—as the trio of "big freak brothers". The episode contained references to popular television, such as the use of the names Andy Taylor and Barney, and referring to <a href="Mayberry">Mayberry</a>, which are references to characters and fictional town from "<a href="The%20Andy%20Griffith%20Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a>".

Sources consulted by the writers included "<a href="Brother%27s%20Keeper%20%281992%20film%29">Brother's Keeper</a>" (1992), a <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> depicting the story of the Wards, four "barely literate" brothers who lived on a farm that had been passed on through their family for generations. The brothers drew international attention following the alleged murder of William Ward by his brother Delbert. With an estimated IQ of 68, Delbert escaped prosecution by claiming that the police had tricked him during <a href="interrogation">interrogation</a>. Wong chose to base the Peacock family on the Wards, incorporating their lifestyles into the script. The name "Peacock" came from the former neighbors of Morgan's parents.

A further inspiration came from a story in <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>'s <a href="My%20Autobiography%20%28Chaplin%29">autobiography</a>; while touring with a British musical theatre, he stayed at a tenement home. After dinner, the family took him upstairs to meet their son, pulling him out from under a bed. The son ("a half man with no legs, an oversized, blond, flat-shaped head, a sickening white face, a sunken nose, a large mouth," according to Chaplin) "flopp[ed] around" while they sang and danced. Morgan used this incident within the screenplay, although at Wong's suggestion they changed the character to the boy's mother. The episode was also made as an homage to 1970s horror films such as <a href="Tobe%20Hooper">Tobe Hooper</a>'s "<a href="The%20Texas%20Chain%20Saw%20Massacre">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>" (1974) and <a href="Wes%20Craven">Wes Craven</a>'s "<a href="The%20Hills%20Have%20Eyes%20%281977%20film%29">The Hills Have Eyes</a>" (1977).

It took some time for the concepts to come together into a story; elements first appeared in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> episode "<a href="Humbug%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Humbug</a>", written by Morgan's brother <a href="Darin%20Morgan">Darin</a> and featuring a cast of circus <a href="sideshow">sideshow</a> performers. The episode incorporated several themes that had an influence on "Home", including the use of a "benign soul trapped in the body of a monster".

When director <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a> read the script for "Home", he called it "as classic a horror script [as] I'm ever going to see." The producers, on the other hand, felt the show had gone too far, and called it "tasteless". <a href="William%20B.%20Davis">William B. Davis</a>, the actor who portrayed the series' main antagonist <a href="The%20Smoking%20Man">The Smoking Man</a>, argued that the screenplay read like Morgan and Wong deliberately wanted to go back to the stylistic origins of the series.

Like the rest of the fourth season, "Home" was filmed in British Columbia. Most of the scenes depicting buildings were shot in the town of <a href="Surrey%2C%20British%20Columbia">Surrey, British Columbia</a>. As the town's architecture comprised both old and new styles, careful <a href="180-degree%20rule">reverse angles</a> were employed to preserve the impression of "small-town America". The building used as the Peacock house had been previously utilized in the season two episode "<a href="Aubrey%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Aubrey</a>". At that time, the producers noted that the house had been "untouched for years" and was "so good" that they had to return to film it again. The car that the Peacock family drives in the episode was found on a farm outside Vancouver. It was rented and restored for use in the episode. <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a> later sent the producers a letter thanking them for including one of their cars in the show.

After the episode aired, Tucker Smallwood recalled that the filming was an unpleasant experience. He entered production of the episode with little knowledge of the nature of "The X-Files", and was surprised when he received the screenplay. During his first day on set, he asked other cast members if the series was always so violent. An unidentified crew member said, "this is awful even for us", and commented that it was probably the most gruesome episode of the series run. During the sheriff's death scene Smallwood insisted on performing his own stunts, until he hit his head attempting a dive. Another uncomfortable moment for the actor involved lying face down in a pool of fake blood for more than 90 minutes.

The episode incorporates the song "<a href="Wonderful%21%20Wonderful%21">Wonderful! Wonderful!</a>" by musician <a href="Johnny%20Mathis">Johnny Mathis</a>. Having read the screenplay Mathis refused to allow his version to be used, owing to the episode's graphic content, and a cover version had to be created. Producer <a href="David%20Nutter">David Nutter</a>, who had a background as a singer, intended to record the vocals but at the last minute another singer, who sounded more like Mathis, was used. Manners explained that he wanted to use the song because "certain songs have a creepy, icky quality that none of us have really openly acknowledged".

"Home" was first submitted to the <a href="Film%20censorship">censors</a> featuring audio of the baby screaming while being buried alive. <a href="Ten%20Thirteen%20Productions">Ten Thirteen Productions</a> was asked by <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> executives to alter the audio so that the baby would sound sick; they noted that the audio change was needed to show the child was diseased and that the Peacocks were not simply killing an innocent child. Manners called the shot, shown from the child's perspective, of the baby's burial as "the most awful shot of my career". He said that he approached filming as seriously as he could because he felt the script was a classic. When production was finished, he said that he loved the episode and called it one of his favorites. Duchovny agreed with Manners, saying, "I really like that one. Although it didn't scare me." He explained that it "touched" him with its themes concerning the desire to "live and to propagate."

"Home" presents a satirical view of traditional <a href="family%20values">family values</a>, showcasing the conflict between classic American values and more modern culture. It contains parallels to <a href="Sam%20Shepard">Sam Shepard</a>'s play "<a href="Buried%20Child">Buried Child</a>", which opens with a child's corpse being discovered in the family's backyard. Writer <a href="Sarah%20Stegall">Sarah Stegall</a> viewed the opening as a commentary on the ideology of the <a href="American%20Dream">American Dream</a>, using the death of a child to "speak to us of buried hopes and fears, and the dark secrets that can hold a family together."

The town of Home encompasses the traditional values of the <a href="nuclear%20family">nuclear family</a>—only for it to be victimized by the Peacock family—who represent the darker side of paradise. The town depicted in "Home" showcases the positive qualities of a world without globalization, but the Peacock family exhibit the negative aspects. The episode's closing scene has been described as "quintessentially American", featuring the final Peacock brother driving away in a white Cadillac with his mother "safely stowed in the trunk", ready to explore a brand new life. M. Keith Booker, in "Blue-Collar Pop Culture", compared the brothers to <a href="Leatherface">Leatherface</a>'s cannibalistic family from "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" (1974). Booker also identified similarities between the brothers and the family from "The Hills Have Eyes" (1977), expressing the view that the brothers represented "pure evil".

The concept of motherhood is also explored in the episode. According to Elyce Rae Helford, in her book "Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television", Mrs. Peacock functions as a being who has been reduced "to all female functions" by her sons. She is "the grotesquely willing mother who has lost any sense of individual purpose" other than to do anything for her children. Sonia Saraiya of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" writes that "Scully's sympathy for a mother that she imagines to be persecuted is turned violently on its head, to reveal a monster whose priorities are not quite so straightforward." The episode is also one of the first to explore Scully's desire to become a mother. Booker states that the episode presents the dual nature of Scully's "modern desire for motherhood", as opposed to Mrs. Peacock's "perverted notion of family". Helford writes that the entry predicts "Scully's fate as the mother of 'immaculately' (technologically) conceived and monstrous progeny". In the fifth season, Scully indeed learns that she is a mother, albeit accidentally, after her ova was harvested following her abduction in <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a>, and an alien/human hybrid named Emily is the result. With the revelation that Scully is pregnant at the end of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a> finale, "<a href="Requiem%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Requiem</a>", the concept revolving around Scully as a mother took center stage in seasons <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%208%29">eight</a> and <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%209%29">nine</a> with the birth of <a href="baby%20William">baby William</a>.

The use of the up-tempo "Wonderful! Wonderful!" during a violent murder sequence attracted attention for its ironic presentation. Jan Delasara in "X-Files Confidential" called the murder of Sheriff Taylor and his wife the most "chilling moment in the series' run", highlighted by the use of a bouncy, classic pop song. It further establishes the episode's subversion of nostalgia, by using a well-known pop song during a death scene.

"Home" originally aired on the Fox network on October 11, 1996. It had a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of 11.9, with a 21 share, meaning that roughly 11.9 percent of all television-equipped households, and 21 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was watched by approximately 18.85 million viewers. "Home" was the first "X-Files" episode to have a viewer discretion warning for graphic content and the only one to have carried a TV-MA rating upon broadcast, with the opening scene being cited in particular due to its gruesomeness and its similarity to "stock horror film conventions". The only other instance of an episode of "The X-Files" earning a viewer discretion warning was in the season eight episode, "<a href="Via%20Negativa%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Via Negativa</a>". Owing to that content, the network would not repeat the episode, the only time in the history of the series that this happened. In 1997, when the channel <a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a> ran an all-day marathon of the most popular X-Files episodes, "Home" was the number one choice.

Upon its first broadcast, "Home" received several positive reviews from critics, although some were critical of its violence. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the episode an "A", describing it as "one of TV's most disturbing hours" and as "a cinematic feast for the eyes, packed with audacious wit". Sarah Stegall awarded the episode three stars out of five, comparing it positively to the more gruesome work of directors <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a> and Tobe Hooper. Stegall praised the atmosphere and commented that Morgan and Wong's "long-awaited return" to the series was "definitely disturbing, thought-provoking, and nasty."

Among less favorable reviews, author Phil Farrand called "Home" his least-favorite episode of the first four seasons of the show in his book "The Nitpicker's Guide to the X-Files", writing that he "just [did not] get this episode" because "Mulder and Scully seem reckless" and the Peacock brothers "are better suited for comic books". Paul Cornell, Keith Topping, and Martin Day, in their book "X-Treme Possibilities", were critical of the violent content of the episode. Topping called the episode "sick", Cornell felt that Mulder and Scully's wisecracks made them come off as cruel, and Day felt that the violence went overboard. Day, however, offered a few complimentary observations, noting that "Home" did, indeed, have merit, and that the juxtaposition of "Wonderful! Wonderful!" with the violent antics of the Peacocks was something "David Lynch would be proud of".

"Home" has continued to receive positive reviews. In a 2011 review, Todd VanDerWerff from "The A.V. Club" gave the episode an "A" rating and wrote that, like many episodes of "The X-Files", the episode was a statement of its time and likely could not be produced in a <a href="post-9/11">post-9/11</a> climate. He praised the depiction of urban sensibilities and the frightening Peacock family, observing that it represented a "sad farewell to a weird America that was rapidly smoothing itself out." Author Dean A. Kowalski, in "The Philosophy of The X-Files", cited "Home", "<a href="Squeeze%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Squeeze</a>", and "<a href="The%20Host%20%28The%20X-Files%29">The Host</a>" as the most notable "monster-of-the-week" episodes.

"Home" has often been cited as one of the best "X-Files" episodes. VanDerWerff of "The A.V. Club" placed it among the 10 best chapters of the series and called it one of the scariest hours of television he had seen. In 2009, "<a href="The%20Vancouver%20Sun">The Vancouver Sun</a>" named "Home" one of the best stand-alone episodes of the series and wrote that, because of its horrific theme of incest, the episode "doesn't pull any punches". Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi placed the entry as the fourth best of the series in 2009, viewing its bleak humor and "thought-provoking moments" of dialogue as the factors that made it one of the most popular episodes. In 2008, "Starpulse" gave the installment an honorable mention as one of the 10 best "X-Files" episodes. In 2009, Connie Ogle from <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> rated the Peacock family among the greatest monsters of the series and stated that it was a miracle that the program "slipped past" the censors.

Critics have also named "Home" one of the scariest installments of the series. Novelist <a href="Scott%20Heim">Scott Heim</a> in "The Book of Lists: Horror" rated it as the tenth most frightening television broadcast. Heim wrote that several aspects of the episode were creepy, including the gothic house and the family itself. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book "Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files", listed the program as the fifth best of the series. Kessenich reported that it was the pinnacle of the horror episodes featured on "The X-Files". William B. Davis said that "Home" was both well written and directed, but was so gruesome that it led to some fans questioning whether or not they wanted to continue watching the series. He argued that modern horror films were far more violent than anything depicted in "Home" but, at the time, "it was quite disturbing." In 2017, <a href="Vulture.com">Vulture.com</a> named "Home" the most terrifying television episode to watch on Halloween.

L'Arianna

The opera was composed under severe pressure of time; the composer later said that the effort of creating it almost killed him. The initial performance, produced with lavish and innovative special effects, was highly praised, and the work was equally well received in Venice when it was revived under the composer's direction in 1640 as the inaugural work for the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Mois%C3%A8">Teatro San Moisè</a>.

Rinuccini's libretto is available in a number of editions. The music of the "Lamento" survives because it was published by Monteverdi, in several different versions, independently from the opera. This fragment became a highly influential musical work and was widely imitated; the "expressive lament" became an integral feature of <a href="Italian%20opera">Italian opera</a> for much of the 17th century. In recent years the "Lamento" has become popular as a concert and recital piece and has been frequently recorded. 

In about 1590 Claudio Monteverdi, born in <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a> in 1567, secured a position as a <a href="viol">viol</a> player at the <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>n court of <a href="Vincent%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua%20and%20Montferrat">Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga</a>. Over the following ten years he advanced to become the duke's "maestro della musica". During that time, significant developments were taking place in the world of musical theatre; in 1598 the work generally recognised as the first in the new genre of "opera"—<a href="Jacopo%20Peri">Jacopo Peri</a>'s "<a href="Dafne">Dafne</a>"—was performed in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. The duke was quick to recognise the potential of this new musical form, and its potential for bringing prestige to those willing to sponsor it.

As part of his duties to the Gonzaga court, Monteverdi was often required to compose or arrange music for staged performances. These works included a fully-fledged opera, "<a href="L%27Orfeo">L'Orfeo</a>", written to a libretto by <a href="Alessandro%20Striggio%20the%20Younger">Alessandro Striggio the Younger</a> and presented before the court on 24 February 1607. This performance pleased the duke, who ordered a repeat showing for 1 March. A contemporary account records that the piece "could not have been done better ... The music, observing due propriety, serves the poetry so well that nothing more beautiful is to be heard anywhere". Monteverdi was then required to write several pieces for performance at the wedding of the duke's son and heir <a href="Francesco%20IV%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Francesco</a>, planned for early May 1608. These included a musical prologue for Battista Guarini's play "L'idropica" and a setting of the dramatic ballet "<a href="Il%20ballo%20delle%20ingrate">Il ballo delle ingrate</a>" ("Dance of the Ungrateful Ladies"), with a text by <a href="Ottavio%20Rinuccini">Ottavio Rinuccini</a>. There was also to be an opera, though it was not initially certain that Monteverdi would provide this. Other works under consideration were Peri's "Le nozze di Peleo e Tetide" ("The marriage of Peleus and Thetis") with a libretto by Francesco Cini, and a new setting of "Dafne" by <a href="Marco%20da%20Gagliano">Marco da Gagliano</a>. In the event, the former was rejected and the latter designated for performance at the 1607–08 Carnival. The duke decreed that the wedding opera should be based on the myth of Arianna (Ariadne), and that Rinuccini should write the text. Monteverdi was instructed to provide the music.

At the time of his commission for "L'Arianna", Rinuccini was probably the most experienced and distinguished of all librettists. His writing career stretched back to 1579, when he had written verses for the Florentine court entertainment "Maschere d'Amazzoni". He had become widely known through his verse contributions to the celebrated <a href="Intermezzo">intermedi</a> for Girolamo Bargagli's play "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%20Woman">La Pellegrina</a>" ("The Pilgrim Woman"), performed in May 1589 at the wedding of <a href="Ferdinando%20I%20de%27%20Medici%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Tuscany">Ferdinando I de' Medici</a> and <a href="Christina%20of%20Lorraine">Christina of Lorraine</a>. According to Gagliano, Rinuccini was a primary influence in the emergence of opera as a genre; he adapted the conventions of his contemporary lyric poets to produce the librettos for two of the earliest operas, "Dafne" and "Euridice"—the latter set to music by both Peri and <a href="Giulio%20Caccini">Giulio Caccini</a>.

For his "Arianna" libretto Rinuccini drew on a variety of classical sources, notably the tenth book of <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Heroides">Heroides</a>", parts of the "<a href="Poetry%20of%20Catullus">Carmina</a>" of <a href="Catullus">Catullus</a>, and the section in <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s epic <a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a> dealing with <a href="Dido%20%28Queen%20of%20Carthage%29">Dido</a>'s abandonment by <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a>. He also used aspects of more recent literary works—<a href="Ludovico%20Ariosto">Ludovico Ariosto</a>'s "<a href="Orlando%20Furioso">Orlando Furioso</a>", <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Torquato Tasso</a>'s "<a href="Jerusalem%20Delivered">Gerusalemme liberata</a>", and <a href="Giovanni%20Andrea%20dell%27%20Anguillara">Giovanni Andrea dell' Anguillara</a>'s 1561 translation of Ovid's "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>". The libretto was extended during the rehearsals when Carlo de' Rossi, a member of the duke's court, reported the <a href="Eleanor%20de%27%20Medici">Duchess Eleonora's</a> complaint that the piece was "very dry" and needed to be enriched with further action. The libretto published in Venice in 1622 takes the form of a prologue and eight scenes, although other arrangements of the text have been suggested. For example, the musicologist Bojan Bujić has posited an alternative of a prologue and five scenes.

Monteverdi probably began composing in late October or early November 1607, since Rinuccini's arrival in Mantua can be dated to 23 October. With rehearsals due to begin in the new year, Monteverdi composed the work in a hurry and under considerable pressure; nearly 20 years later he was still complaining, in a letter to Striggio, of the hardships he had been made to suffer: "It was the shortness of time that brought me almost to death's door in writing "L'Arianna"".

Monteverdi had apparently completed the score by early January, and rehearsals began. However, his work was not over as he was required to write further music when the work was extended after Rossi's intervention. Among the material added or lengthened were the early scene between Venus and Cupid, and Jupiter's blessing from heaven at the end of the opera. In March 1608, well into the rehearsal period, the opera's scheduled performance was jeopardised by the death, from smallpox, of the leading soprano <a href="Caterina%20Martinelli">Caterina Martinelli</a>. Fortunately a replacement was to hand, a renowned actress and singer, <a href="Virginia%20Ramponi-Andreini">Virginia Ramponi-Andreini</a>, known professionally as "La Florinda", who was performing in Mantua. A courtier, Antonio Costantini, later reported that she learned the part of Arianna in six days. The musicologist <a href="Tim%20Carter%20%28musicologist%29">Tim Carter</a> suggests that Arianna's lament may have been added to the opera at this late stage, to exploit La Florinda's well-known vocal capabilities.

The casting for the opera's premiere is uncertain. While the participation of singers such as La Florinda and <a href="Francesco%20Rasi">Francesco Rasi</a> can be established, sources have speculated on the involvement of other singers. There are several versions of the published libretto; the list of roles is taken from the publication by Gherardo & Iseppo Imberti, Venice 1622.

The action is preceded by a brief prologue, delivered by Apollo. Venus and Cupid are then discovered, in conversation, on a desolate seashore. Venus informs Cupid that Duke Theseus of Athens, together with Ariadne, will soon be arriving on the island of Naxos on their way to Athens. They are fleeing from Crete, where the pair have been complicit in the slaying of Ariadne's monster half-brother, the Minotaur, in the labyrinth below the palace of her father, King Minos. Venus is aware that Theseus intends to abandon Ariadne on Naxos, and to proceed to Athens alone. Cupid offers to rekindle Theseus's passion for Ariadne, but Venus has decided to unite her with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this.

Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne arrive on the island a short distance away. Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but declares her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with the stars of heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as she will not be acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.

A chorus greets the dawn as Ariadne, after a troubled night's sleep, returns to the shore with her companion, Dorilla, to find that Theseus has departed. Dorilla offers her comfort. In despair at the thought that Theseus will not return, Ariadne nevertheless decides to go to the landing area to wait for him. In a <a href="pastoral">pastoral</a> interlude a chorus sings of the joys of rural life, and expresses the hope that Theseus will not forget Ariadne. Primed by an envoy with the news that Ariadne is alone and sorrowing, the chorus again sings in sympathy with her. On the beach, Ariadne sings her lament for her lost love and prepares to kill herself. At this point fanfares are heard heralding an arrival, causing Ariadne to hope that it is Theseus returning. In another interlude the chorus empathises, but a second envoy announces that it is Bacchus who has arrived, having taken pity on Ariadne. A sung "ballo" celebrates the anticipated betrothal of Bacchus and Ariadne. In the final scene Cupid reappears, and Venus rises from the sea before Jupiter speaks his blessing from the heavens. The union is sealed as Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality in heaven, and a crown of stars.

The date of the Gonzaga wedding was repeatedly postponed, because of diplomatic problems which delayed the bride's arrival in Mantua until 24 May. The wedding festivities began four days later; "L'Arianna" was performed on 28 May 1608, the first of the several spectacular entertainments. A large temporary theatre had been built for the occasion; according to the court's chronicler Federico Follino this held 6,000 people—a figure which Carter deems unlikely. Whatever its size, the arena could not hold everyone who wished to be present. Follino's account records that although the duke had strictly limited the numbers from his household entitled to be there, many distinguished foreign visitors could not be seated and were obliged to crowd around the doors.

Although contained within a single stage set, the production was lavish, with 300 men employed to manipulate the <a href="stage%20machinery">stage machinery</a>. Follino's report described the set as "a wild rocky place in the midst of the waves, which in the furthest part of the prospect could be seen always in motion". As the action began, Apollo was revealed "sitting on a very beautiful cloud ... which, moving down little by little ... reached in a short space of time the stage and ... disappeared in a moment". Thereafter, all the performers proved excellent in the art of singing; "every part succeeded more than wondrously". Follino's enthusiasm was echoed in other reports made by dignitaries to their own courts. The ambassador for the <a href="House%20of%20Este">House of Este</a>, who referred to the work as "a comedy in music", mentioned in particular Andreini's performance which, in her lament, "made many weep", and that of Francesco Rasi, who as Bacchus "sang divinely". Monteverdi's fellow composer Marco da Gagliano wrote that Monteverdi's music had "moved the entire audience to tears". In all, the opera lasted for two and a half hours.

Despite the positive reception accorded to "L'Arianna" at its premiere, the duke did not request a second showing, as he had with "L'Orfeo" the previous year". The next hint of a performance of "L'Arianna" is in 1614, when the Medici court in Florence requested a copy of the score, presumably with the intention of staging it. There is, however, no record of any such performance there. Early in 1620 Striggio asked Monteverdi to send him the music for a projected performance in Mantua as part of the celebration for the Duchess <a href="Catherine%20de%27%20Medici">Caterina</a>'s birthday. Monteverdi went to the trouble and expense of preparing a new manuscript with revisions; had he had more time, he informed Striggio, he would have revised the work more thoroughly. Hearing nothing further from the Mantuan court, Monteverdi wrote to Striggio on 18 April 1620, offering to help with the staging. A month or so later, however, he learned that the duchess's celebrations had been scaled back, and that there had been no performance of "L'Arianna".

There is some evidence to suggest a possible performance in <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>, in or some time after 1620; a Croatian translation of the libretto was published in <a href="Ancona">Ancona</a> in 1633. However, the only known revival of the work came in Venice, in 1640. Public theatre opera had come to the city in March 1637, when the new <a href="Teatro%20San%20Cassiano">Teatro San Cassiano</a> opened with a performance of "L'Andromeda" by <a href="Francesco%20Manelli">Francesco Manelli</a>. The popularity of this and other works led to more theatres converting their facilities for opera; "L'Arianna" was chosen to inaugurate the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Mois%C3%A8">Teatro San Moisè</a> as an opera house during the 1639–40 Carnival (the precise date of this performance is not recorded). A revised version of the libretto had been published in 1639, with substantial cuts and revisions from the 1608 version to remove passages too specifically linked to the Mantuan wedding. The composer, who was by then 73 years old, had acquired considerable prestige in Venice, having been director of music at <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a> since 1613. The dedication in the revised and republished libretto describes him as "[the] most celebrated Apollo of the century and the highest intelligence of the heavens of humanity". The opera was received with great enthusiasm by a Venetian audience already familiar with the lament, which had been published in the city in 1623. Within a few weeks the theatre replaced "L'Arianna" with Monteverdi's new opera "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria", which proved an even greater success.

After the Venice revival of 1639–40 there are no further records of performances of "L'Arianna". Rinuccini's libretto, which was published on several occasions during Monteverdi's lifetime, has survived intact, but the opera's music disappeared some time after 1640, with the exception of Ariadne's Scene 6 lament, known as "Lamento d'Arianna". In the loss of its music the opera shares the fate of most of Monteverdi's theatrical works, including six of his other nine operas. Carter's explanation for the high rate of attrition is that "memories were short and large-scale musical works often had limited currency beyond their immediate circumstances"; such music was rarely published and quickly discarded.

The lament was saved from oblivion by Monteverdi's decision to publish it independently from the opera: first in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal, then in 1623 as a <a href="monody">monody</a>, and finally in 1641 as a sacred hymn, "Lamento della Madonna". The five-voice adaptation was included in the composer's "Sixth Book of Madrigals"; there is evidence that this arrangement was made at the suggestion of an unnamed Venetian gentleman who thought that the melody would benefit from <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>. In 1868 the lament was published in Paris, and in 1910 the Italian composer <a href="Ottorino%20Respighi">Ottorino Respighi</a> issued an edited, orchestral transcription.

In her analysis of the lament, the musicologist <a href="Suzanne%20Cusick">Suzanne Cusick</a> asserts that a large extent Monteverdi's fame and historical status rested for centuries on the universal appreciation of his achievement in the celebrated lament [which] was among the most emulated, and therefore influential, works of the early 17th century". In Cusick's view Monteverdi "creat[ed] the lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera ... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice" and she concludes by noting that the women of Mantua would have recognised the transformations enacted in the lament as representative of their own life stories. Monteverdi, she believes, sought to represent in music the eventual triumph of female piety over promiscuity: "Arianna's gradual loss of her passionate self in the lament constitutes a public musical chastening of this incautious woman who dared to choose her own mate". In her study "The Recitative Soliloquy", Margaret Murata records that laments of this kind became a staple feature of operas until about 1650, "thereafter more rarely until the total triumph of the aria around 1670". Mark Ringer, in his analysis of Monteverdi's musical drama, suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which, two-and-a-half centuries later, the "Prelude" and the "<a href="Liebestod">Liebestod</a>" in "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>" announced <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner's</a> discovery of new expressive frontiers.

In its operatic context the lament takes the form of an extended recitative of more than 70 vocal lines, delivered in five sections divided by choral comments. Some of the wording is prefigured in the immediately preceding scene in which the First Envoy describes Arianna's plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen. The lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Cusick draws attention to the manner in which Monteverdi is able to match in music the "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" in Rinuccini's text. The opening repeated words "Lasciatemi morire" (Let me die) are accompanied by a <a href="Dominant%20seventh%20chord">dominant seventh</a> chord which Ringer describes as "an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain"; Monteverdi was one of the first users of this musical device. What follows, says Ringer, has a range and depth "comparable to Shakespeare's most searching soliloquies". The words "Lasciatemi morire" are followed by "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two phrases represent Arianna's contrasting emotions of despair and longing. Throughout the lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until the final iteration of "O Teseo", after which a descending line brings the lament to a quiet conclusion.

Among other composers who adopted the format and style of Arianna's lament were <a href="Francesco%20Cavalli">Francesco Cavalli</a>, whose opera "Le nozze di Teti e di Peleo" contains three such pieces; <a href="Francesco%20Costa%20%28composer%29">Francesco Costa</a>, who included a setting of Rinuccini's text in his madrigal collection "Pianta d'Arianna"; and <a href="Sigismondo%20d%27India">Sigismondo d'India</a>, who wrote several laments in the 1620s after the monodic version of Arianna's lament was published in 1623. Monteverdi himself used the expressive lament format in each of his two late operas, "<a href="Il%20ritorno%20d%27Ulisse%20in%20patria">Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria</a>" and "<a href="L%27incoronazione%20di%20Poppea">L'incoronazione di Poppea</a>", for the respective characters of Penelope and Ottavia. In 1641 Monteverdi adapted Arianna's lament into a sacred song with a Latin text "Pianto della Madonna" (incipit: "Iam moriar, mi fili"), which he included in "<a href="Selva%20morale%20e%20spirituale">Selva morale e spirituale</a>", the last of his works published during his lifetime.

Many recordings are available of both the five-voice madrigal and the solo voice version of the "Lamento". The solo recordings include several versions which use a tenor or baritone voice. Among leading singers who have issued recordings are the sopranos <a href="Emma%20Kirkby">Emma Kirkby</a> and <a href="V%C3%A9ronique%20Gens">Véronique Gens</a>, and the mezzo-sopranos <a href="Janet%20Baker">Janet Baker</a> and <a href="Anne%20Sofie%20von%20Otter">Anne Sofie von Otter</a>.

At least eight versions of the libretto were published between 1608 and 1640. The following is a list of the known editions:

Swift Justice

Swift Justice is an American <a href="Detective%20fiction">detective drama</a> television series created by <a href="Dick%20Wolf">Dick Wolf</a> and Richard Albarino. It aired for one season on <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN) from March 13 to July 17, 1996. It follows former <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">Navy SEAL</a> Mac Swift (<a href="James%20McCaffrey%20%28actor%29">James McCaffrey</a>), a private investigator who was fired from the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department">New York City Police Department</a>. He receives support from his former partner Detective Randall Patterson (<a href="Gary%20Dourdan">Gary Dourdan</a>) and his father Al Swift (<a href="Len%20Cariou">Len Cariou</a>). Completed on a limited budget, episodes were filmed <a href="Location%20shooting">on location</a> in New York.

Critics noted "Swift Justice"'s emphasis on violence, specifically in the <a href="Pilot%20Episode">pilot episode</a>'s opening sequence, comparing it to the <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> "<a href="The%20Equalizer">The Equalizer</a>" (1985–1989) and the 1988 film "<a href="Die%20Hard">Die Hard</a>". UPN canceled the program after receiving complaints from viewers, advertisers, and critics of its violent scenes. Wolf considered the cancellation a mistake due to the show's good ratings. The series was praised for its visuals and McCaffrey's performance, but criticized as being either too violent or formulaic.

A <a href="Detective%20fiction">detective drama</a>, "Swift Justice" follows Mac Swift (<a href="James%20McCaffrey%20%28actor%29">James McCaffrey</a>), a former <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEALs">United States Navy SEAL</a> who joins the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department">New York City Police Department</a> (NYPD). He is aided by his best friend and partner, Detective Randall Patterson (<a href="Gary%20Dourdan">Gary Dourdan</a>), but is frequently reprimanded by his police sergeant father Al Swift (<a href="Len%20Cariou">Len Cariou</a>) and other superiors, including Andrew Coffin (<a href="Giancarlo%20Esposito">Giancarlo Esposito</a>). The <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot episode</a> focuses on Mac's attempts to arrest a man (<a href="Skipp%20Sudduth">Skipp Sudduth</a>) who runs a <a href="prostitution%20ring">prostitution ring</a> as part of a <a href="Honey%20trapping">honey trap</a> involving <a href="extortion">extortion</a>, drugs, and credit card information. For the case, he collaborates with a prostitute, Annie (<a href="Kim%20Dickens">Kim Dickens</a>), and becomes romantically involved with her. She turned to the profession to pay for her college tuition and her mother's nursing home bills. When Annie is murdered, Mac's behavior becomes increasingly erratic and violent, leading to his termination from the police department at the end of the pilot.

In subsequent episodes, Mac works as a <a href="private%20investigator">private investigator</a> who assists those "denied [help] because of the rules of conventional law enforcement". He helps people by improving their chances against criminals in court, rather than by <a href="vigilantism">vigilantism</a>. Portrayed as experienced with computers, Mac is financially stable due to <a href="royalty%20payment">royalty payment</a>s from software he has developed. He sets up an email address to receive messages from his clients. According to a publicity note from <a href="United%20Paramount%20Network">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN), Mac relies on "technology, intellect, charisma[,] and muscle" to solve cases. The network promoted the character as "a true crime fighter of the technology-driven 90's". Throughout the season, Randall provides information about cases to Mac. Al is demoted from being a <a href="beat%20officer">beat officer</a> to working at a desk.

Storylines include a <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> singer who is denied a divorce from her abusive husband, a woman whose son is kidnapped by her ex-husband, and a man who ties up and tortures his victims by <a href="Drive%20%28golf%29">driving</a> them with golf balls. <a href="Guest%20appearance">Guest appearance</a>s include <a href="Jennifer%20Garner">Jennifer Garner</a>, <a href="Drea%20de%20Matteo">Drea de Matteo</a>, and <a href="Ice-T">Ice-T</a>. Many commentators noted the show's use of violence, particularly that the pilot's opening sequence involves nine deaths. Despite its frequent inclusion of violent scenes, the show does not show blood or gore. Critics compared the violence in "Swift Justice" to the <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> "<a href="The%20Equalizer">The Equalizer</a>" and the 1988 <a href="action%20movie">action movie</a> "<a href="Die%20Hard">Die Hard</a>", and the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>"'s Hal Boedeker identified it as an "urban <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">western</a>". Co-creator and executive producer <a href="Dick%20Wolf">Dick Wolf</a> likened the series to "<a href="Batman">Batman</a> without the mask", and characterized its tone as <a href="Political%20correctness">politically incorrect</a>. He based Mac on the gunfighter Paladin from "<a href="Have%20Gun%20%E2%80%93%20Will%20Travel">Have Gun – Will Travel</a>" and compared his friendship with Randall to <a href="Martin%20Riggs">Martin Riggs</a>' partnership with <a href="Roger%20Murtaugh">Roger Murtaugh</a> in the <a href="Lethal%20Weapon%20%28franchise%29">"Lethal Weapon"</a> films.

Produced by <a href="Wolf%20Films">Wolf Films</a> in association with <a href="Universal%20Television">Universal Television</a>, "Swift Justice" was created by Wolf and Richard Albarino. According to <a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">"New York"</a>'s Maureen Callahan, the episodes, shot <a href="Location%20shooting">on location</a> in New York, were low-budget productions. During filming, <a href="Jean-Claude%20La%20Marre">Jean-Claude La Marre</a>, who <a href="guest%20star">guest star</a>red as a hustler, was nearly arrested by a police officer. La Marre accused him of <a href="racial%20profiling">racial profiling</a>. Representatives from "Swift Justice" and the NYPD did not comment on the incident. <a href="Rick%20Marotta">Rick Marotta</a> produced the music, which <a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">"Variety"</a>'s Todd Everett described as having a good synthesizer- and percussion-based sound. "Swift Justice" was the first time that <a href="Gary%20Glasberg">Gary Glasberg</a> wrote for an hour-long television program. Referring to the experience as his "big break", he would later be a <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a> for the <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> <a href="NCIS%20%28TV%20series%29">"NCIS"</a>.

"Swift Justice" was part of UPN's "aggressive new spring schedule" that expanded the network's programming to three nights per week. Picked up as a <a href="mid-season%20replacement">mid-season replacement</a>, the series was broadcast on Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a>. Thirteen episodes aired between March and July 1996. "<a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20News">Rocky Mountain News</a>"' Dusty Saunders cited the series as an example of the network shifting toward <a href="Action%20adventure%20film">action-adventure</a> programming. "<a href="Mediaweek">Mediaweek</a>"'s Scotty Dupree wrote that "Swift Justice" and <a href="The%20Sentinel%20%28TV%20series%29">"The Sentinel"</a> were meant to attract a male audience, saying they were the only shows, aside from <a href="JAG%20%28TV%20series%29">"JAG"</a>, marketed to men on Wednesday nights. Wolf specified the target audiences of males as being aged 18 to 34.

"Swift Justice"s pilot episode was shown with a viewer advisory regarding its violence. During the show's broadcast, <a href="watchdog%20organization">watchdog organization</a>s and viewers were critical of the representation of violence on television. UPN canceled "Swift Justice", <a href="Nowhere%20Man%20%28TV%20series%29">"Nowhere Man"</a>, "<a href="Minor%20Adjustments">Minor Adjustments</a>", and "The Paranormal Borderline", in favor of <a href="black%20sitcom">black sitcom</a>s. The network decided to remove "Swift Justice" from its schedule following viewer and advertiser complaints about its violence. During a 2013 interview with the <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Television Arts & Sciences</a>, Wolf referred to the decision to end "Swift Justice" as a "cancellation error", particularly since UPN did not have a drama with comparable ratings at the time. Following the show's cancellation, when Wolf was casting for the television productions <a href="Players%20%281997%20TV%20series%29">"Players"</a> and "" in the late 1990s, he again hired Ice-T, who has noted that Wolf often collaborated with the same actors.

Critics praised "Swift Justice" for its visuals, although some criticized the storylines as unoriginal. "Variety"'s Todd Everett and the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>"'s Steve Johnson found fault with the show for relying on clichés, but both enjoyed the look of the show. Everett wrote that "Swift Justice" was the most visually attractive program on UPN, and Johnson that it had "a visceral, close-to-the-streets feel". Judy Nichols of "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" likewise commented on the "fast-moving action" and "spurts of breakneck-pace camera work". By contrast, "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>"s Frederic M. Biddle felt the visuals alone could not carry the show, saying that they did not justify the frequent violence scenes. Biddle described the series as "utterly empty at its soul" underneath its "over the top in slick visuals". 

James McCaffrey and his character received a positive response from critics. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" John O'Connor praised the show for characterizing him as an <a href="action%20hero">action hero</a> with a sensitive side. <a href="People%20%28magazine%29">"People"</a>'s Tom Gliatto and "<a href="The%20Virginian-Pilot">The Virginian-Pilot</a>"'s Larry Bonko singled out McCaffrey for his handsomeness. Gliatto described him as "handsome, but neither too impressed nor too pretty to buy as an action lead", and Bonko called him attractively toughened. "The Virginian-Pilot"'s Larry Bonko said casting him was a perfect choice.

The show's frequent use of violence was criticized. Panning the premise as unrealistic, Scott D. Pierce of the "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" summed up the series as "full of violence, questionable messages, violence and more violence". The "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>"s John Carman described "Swift Justice" as a "competent action show", but felt that "it isn't good enough to compensate for its excesses". Some commentators criticized the series' plot as generic. In their 2007 book "", Susanne Daniels and Cynthia Littleton dismissed "Swift Justice" as a "run-of-the-mill gumshoe drama". Hal Boedeker of the "Orlando Sentinel" referred to the show as "an unpleasant throwback to the 1980s". <a href="Howard%20Rosenberg">Howard Rosenberg</a>, writing for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", was critical of the pilot episode for its <a href="plot%20hole">plot hole</a>s, and Gliatto described the episodes as having "some of the dumbest villains in the annals of crime".

Taare Zameen Par

Taare Zameen Par (titled Like Stars on Earth internationally) is a 2007 Indian <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> produced and directed by <a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a>. The film explores the life and imagination of Ishaan, an 8-year-old <a href="Dyslexia">dyslexic</a> child. Although he excels in art, his poor academic performance leads his parents to send him to a <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a>. Ishaan's new art teacher suspects that he is dyslexic and helps him to overcome his disability. <a href="Darsheel%20Safary">Darsheel Safary</a> stars as 8-year-old Ishaan, and Khan plays his art teacher. Creative director and writer <a href="Amole%20Gupte">Amole Gupte</a> initially developed the idea with his wife <a href="Deepa%20Bhatia">Deepa Bhatia</a>, who served as the film's editor. <a href="Shankar%E2%80%93Ehsaan%E2%80%93Loy">Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy</a> composed the film's score, and <a href="Prasoon%20Joshi">Prasoon Joshi</a> wrote the lyrics for many of the songs. Principal photography took place in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and in <a href="Panchgani">Panchgani</a>'s <a href="New%20Era%20High%20School">New Era High School</a>, and some of the school's students make appearances.

The film made its theatrical debut in India on 21 December 2007, and <a href="UTV%20Software%20Communications">UTV Home Entertainment</a> released a DVD for Indian audiences in 2008. <a href="Disney">Disney</a>'s later release of the international edition DVD marked the first purchase of distribution rights for an Indian film by a global company.

"Taare Zameen Par" has received numerous awards, including the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Filmfare Award for Best Film</a> for 2008 and the 2008 <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20on%20Family%20Welfare">National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare</a>. It was India's official entry for the 2009 <a href="List%20of%20submissions%20to%20the%2081st%20Academy%20Awards%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Awards Best Foreign Film</a>, but did not progress to the short-list.

Eight-year-old Ishaan Awasthi dislikes school and fails every test or exam. He finds all subjects difficult and is belittled and berated by his teachers and classmates. However, Ishaan's internal world is full of wonders that he is unable to convey to others, magical lands filled with colour and animated animals. He is also an artist whose talent is unrecognised.

Ishaan's father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his children to excel. Ishaan's mother, housewife Maya Awasthi, is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan, is an exemplary scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of.

After receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's parents send him to a boarding school. There he sinks into a state of fear and depression, despite being befriended by Rajan Damodharan, a <a href="disability">physically disabled</a> boy and one of the top students in the class. He even contemplates suicide by climbing up the fence in a terrace, which Rajan manages to save him from.

Ishaan's situation changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, joins the school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with <a href="Developmental%20disability">developmental disabilities</a>, Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia.

On his day off, Nikumbh sets off to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is surprised to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia and may well be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child.

Still unsatisfied with Nikumbh's interpretation, Awasthi bluntly dismisses Ishaan's disability as mental retardation, which frustrates Nikumbh, who criticises Awasthi for his crude and inaccurate explanation of Ishaan's condition. Nikumbh argues that Ishaan is an above-average child whose condition suppresses his artistic and mental talent, leading Awasthi to feel regret for his treatment of Ishaan.

Nikumbh returns, and subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in class and offers a <a href="List%20of%20people%20diagnosed%20with%20dyslexia">list of famous people who were dyslexic</a>. Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that he too is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using <a href="Dyslexia%23Management">remedial techniques</a> developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.

Towards the end of the school year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year.


The husband and wife team of <a href="Amole%20Gupte">Amole Gupte</a> and Deepa Bhatia developed the story that would eventually become "Taare Zameen Par" as a way of understanding why some children cannot conform to a conventional educational system. Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>, who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of "a child who did not fit into the school stream." She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawa's biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene "became the inspiration for how a teacher could transform the life of a student".

In developing the character of a young boy based on Kurosawa, Bhatia and Gupte explored some possible reasons why he failed in school. Their research led them to groups such as the Maharashtra Dyslexia Association and Parents for a Better Curriculum for the Child (PACE). Dyslexia eventually became the central topic and theme of the film. The pair worked with dyslexic children to research and develop the screenplay, basing characters and situations on their observations. Bhatia and Gupte carefully concealed the children's identities in the final version of the script.

Khan and Gupte first met in college. Khan has said that he admired Gupte's abilities as an actor, writer, and painter. Three years before the film's release Gupte brought Khan to the project as a producer and actor. Gupte himself was to direct, but the first week's <a href="dailies">dailies</a> were a great disappointment to Khan, who "lost faith in Amol and his capability of translating on screen what he had so beautifully written on paper". Khan was on the verge of withdrawing his participation in the film because of these "creative differences", but Gupte kept him onboard by stepping down as director. Contrary to Khan's claim, Gupte lashed out saying that after the wrap-up party, Khan announced that he was the director of the film, despite Gupte acting as director. Had it been necessary to hire a third party, production would have been postponed for 6–8 months as the new director prepared for the film. Keen to keep Safary as Ishaan—the actor might have aged too much for the part had production been delayed—Khan took over the role of director. "Taare Zameen Par" was Khan's first experience in the dual role of actor and director. He has admitted that the transition was challenging, stating that while he had always wanted to direct a film, it was unknown territory for him. Gupte remained on set, "guiding [Khan] and, at times, even correcting [him]".

Initially the film was to retain the short story's title of "High Jump", because of Ishaan's inability to achieve the <a href="high%20jump">high jump</a> in gym class. This subplot—filmed but later cut—tied into the original ending for the movie. In this rendition, a "ghost image" separates from Ishaan after the art competition and runs to the sports field; the film would end on a freeze frame of Ishaan successfully making the leap. Khan, however, was unhappy with that proposed ending and convinced Gupte to rewrite it.

With the working title no longer relevant, Khan, Gupte, and Bhatia discussed several alternatives, eventually deciding on "Taare Zameen Par." Possible translations of this title include "Stars on the Ground" and "Stars on Earth". According to Khan:
"Taare Zameen Par" is a film about children and it is a film which celebrates the abilities of children. "Taare Zameen Par" is a title which denotes that aspect. It is a title with a very positive feel to it. All the kids are special and wonderful. They are like stars on earth. This particular aspect gave birth to the title.

Principal photography for the film took place in India over five months. Khan spent his first two days as director <a href="Blocking%20%28stage%29">blocking</a> the first scene to be filmed—Ishaan returning home from school and putting away his recently collected fish—and becoming comfortable with his new responsibilities. Believing that the audience should not be aware of the camera, he chose a simple shooting style for the film that involved relatively little <a href="Cinematography%23Camera%20movement">camera movement</a>.

At the same time, Khan also made use of illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan collecting fish outside his school was shot on location and at <a href="Film%20City">Film City</a>. Shots focusing on Ishaan took place at the former, while those involving the gutter <a href="Vivarium">terrarium</a> were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film. The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the "absolutely petrified" Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor. Ishaan's nightmare—he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd—was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set. To work around the train set piece's immobility, production placed the camera on a moving trolley to create the illusion of a departing train. For the sequences related from the mother's point of view—shot from behind the actress—Chopra stood on a trolley next to a recreated section of the train's door.

All the school sequences were filmed on location. The production team searched for a Mumbai school with an "oppressive" feel to establish the "heaviness of being in a metropolitan school", and eventually chose . As the school is situated along a main road filming took place on weekends, to minimise the background noise, but an early scene in which Ishaan is sent out of the classroom was filmed on the day of the <a href="Mumbai%20Marathon">Mumbai Marathon</a>. The production staff placed acrylic sheets invisible to the naked eye on the classroom windows to mask the sounds of nearby crowds and helicopters. <a href="New%20Era%20High%20School">New Era High School</a> served as Ishaan's boarding school. The change of setting was a "breath of fresh air" for the production crew, who moved from Ishaan's small house in Mysore Colony, <a href="Chembur">Chembur</a> to the "vast, beautiful environs" of <a href="Panchgani">Panchgani</a>.

Production relied on <a href="stock%20footage">stock footage</a> for the brief scene of a bird feeding its babies. Khan carefully selected a clip to his liking, but learned three weeks before the film's release that the footage was not available in the proper format. With three days to replace it or else risk delaying the release, Khan made do with what he could find. He says that he "cringes" every time he sees it.

Real schoolchildren participated throughout the movie's filming. Khan credited them with the film's success, and was reportedly very popular with them. Furthermore, Khan placed a high priority on the day-to-day needs of his child actors, and went to great lengths to attend to them. The production staff made sure that the students were never idle, and always kept them occupied outside of filming. New Era Faculty Coordinator Douglas Lee thought the experience not only helped the children to learn patience and co-operation, but also gave them a better understanding of how they should behave towards children like Ishaan who have problems in school. Because filming at New Era High School occurred during the winter holiday, those portraying Ishaan's classmates gave up their vacation to participate. To fill in the campus background, students from nearby schools were also brought in. A total of 1,500 children were used for wide-shots of the film's art-fair climax; medium shots only required 400 students.

New to acting, the children often made errors such as staring into the camera, and Khan resorted to unorthodox methods to work around their rookie mistakes. For example, an early scene in the film featured a school assembly; Khan wanted the students to act naturally and to ignore the principal's speech, but recognised that this would be a difficult feat with cameras present. First Assistant Director Sunil Pandey spoke continuously in an attempt to "bore the hell out of [them]", and they eventually lost interest in the filming and behaved normally. A later scene involved Nikumbh enlightening his class about famous people who suffer from dyslexia, and the children's responses to his speech were the last portion to be filmed. Having already spent 3–4 days hearing the dialogue the children's reactions were "jaded". Khan opted to film them while he recited a tale, and manipulated his storytelling to achieve the varying spontaneous reactions. The following scene had the children playing around a nearby pond. Horrified when he learned that the water was deep, Khan recruited four lifeguards in case a child fell in.

Khan found it important that the audience connect the film to real children, and had Pandey travel throughout India filming documentary-style footage of children from all walks of life. Those visuals were integrated into the end credits.

While <a href="Clay%20animation">claymation</a> has been used in Indian television commercials, the film's title sequence—a representation of Ishaan's imagination—marked its first instance in a Bollywood film. Khan gave claymation artist Dhimant Vyas free rein over the various elements. The storyboarding took one and a half months and the shooting required 15 days. The "3 into 9" sequence, in which Ishaan delves into his imagination to solve a math problem, was originally conceived as a 3D animation. Halfway through its creation, however, Khan felt it was not turning out as he had envisioned it. Khan scrapped the project and hired Vaibhav Kumaresh, who hand-drew the scene as a 2D animation.

Artist <a href="Samir%20Mondal">Samir Mondal</a> composed Ishaan and Nikumbh's art-fair watercolour paintings. He held a workshop with the schoolchildren, and incorporated elements from their artwork into Ishaan's. Mondal also instructed Khan on a painter's typical mannerisms and movements. Gupte created the rest of Ishaan's artwork and Assistant Art Director Veer Nanavati drew Ishaan's flipbook. The art department's designs for Ishaan's school notebooks disappointed Khan, who had familiarised himself with dyslexic writing. Using his left hand, Khan instead wrote it himself.

The musical sequence of "Jame Raho" establishes the characters of the four members of Ishaan's family; for example, the father is hardworking and responsible, and Yohaan is an "ideal son" who does all the right things. A robotic style of music overlaps most of the sequence—this is mirrored by the machine-like morning routines of the mother, father, and Yohaan—but changes for Ishaan's portion to imply that he is different from the rest. This concept is furthered by <a href="Slow%20motion%23In%20action%20films">speed ramping</a> and having the camera sway with the music to create a distinct style. The twilight scenes of "Maa" were a particular issue for the production crew. Because the specific lighting only lasted ten to fifteen minutes a day, the scenes took nearly ten evenings to film. Production at one time considered having a child singing, but ultimately deemed it too over the top and felt it would connect to more people if sung by an adult. Shankar initially performed the song as a sample—they planned to replace him with another singer—but production eventually decided that his rendition was best.

Ishaan's truancy scene—he leaves school one day after realising that his mother has not signed his failed math test—originally coincided with the song "Kholo Kholo," but Khan did not believe it worked well for the situation. In his opinion, the accompanying song should focus on what a child wants—to be free—and be told from the first-person perspective instead of "Kholo Kholos second person. When Khan took over as director, he opted to use "Mera Jahan"—a song written by Gupte—and moved "Kholo Kholo" to the art fair. Viewers of test screenings were divided over the truancy scene. Half thoroughly enjoyed it but the rest complained that it was too long, did not make sense, and merely showed "touristy" visuals of Mumbai. Khan nevertheless kept the scene, because he "connected deeply" with it and felt that it established Ishaan's world.

<a href="Shiamak%20Davar">Shiamak Davar</a> choreographed the dance sequence of "Bum Bum Bole," and was given free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40 students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers. Davar gave the children certain cues and a general idea of what to do, but left the style and final product up to them to avoid a choreographed appearance. Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming "Bum Bum Bole," <a href="Ram%20Madhvani">Ram Madhvani</a> took over as director for "Bheja Kum". The latter sequence, containing a "fun-filled" song of rhythmic dialogue, allowed the audience to perceive how Ishaan sees the world and written languages. It was intended to represent "a young boy's worst nightmare, in terms of ... the worst thing that he can think of"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of "creepy-crawlies" such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards. <a href="Tata%20Elxsi">Tata Elxsi</a>'s <a href="Tata%20Elxsi%23Visual%20Computing%20Labs%20%28VCL%29">Visual Computing Labs</a> made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English. The chalkboard writing's transformation into a snake was included to surprise the audience and "end the song on a high note."

In writing the song "Taare Zameen Par," lyricist <a href="Prasoon%20Joshi">Prasoon Joshi</a> followed the theme of "however much you talk about children, it's not enough." Every line throughout the song describes children, and only one repeats: "Kho Naa Jaaye Yeh / Taare Zameen Par" ("Let us not lose these / Little stars on earth"). The song is mostly set to the annual day performance by the developmentally disabled children of Tulips School. Actual students from Tulips School and Saraswati Mandir participated, and were filmed over a period of five days. The sequence originally featured numerous dance performances, but was trimmed down when test audiences found it too long. A song accompanying the scene in which Ishaan's mother is watching home videos of her son was also cut, and replaced with background music after test audiences expressed their opposition to yet another song.

Timing and other aspects are usually planned when scoring a film, but Khan chose to take a more improvised approach. Instead of using a studio, he and the trio <a href="Shankar%E2%80%93Ehsaan%E2%80%93Loy">Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy</a> recorded it at Khan's home in Panchgani, to clear their heads and not be in the mindset of the city. As they watched the film, Khan pointed out when he wanted music to begin and of what type. Ehsaan Noorani noted that this strategy allowed the score to have a "spontaneity to it."

Different styles of background music were used to convey certain things. For example, a guitar is played when Ishaan is tense or upset, sometimes with discordant notes. The music of the opening scene—the recurring "Ishaan's Theme," which represents the character's peace of mind—overpowers the background noise to show that Ishaan is lost in his own world; the noise becomes louder after he snaps back to reality. But the scene in which Nikumbh explains dyslexia to Ishaan's family took the opposite approach. Silent at first, the music is slowly introduced as the father begins to understand his son's dilemma. The almost seven-minute long scene scarcely used any background music, to slow the pace and make it seem more realistic.

"Taare Zameen Par" was released worldwide on 21 December 2007, although countries such as Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Fiji opened it on 20 December. It debuted in India with 425 prints, although revenue-sharing issues between the film's distributors and theatre owners caused some slight delays. The movie grossed domestically within the first three days. Its theatre occupancy in Mumbai dropped to 58 percent during its third week, but climbed back to 62 percent the following week—this brought the total to —after the <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> government granted the film exemption from the <a href="entertainment%20tax">entertainment tax</a>. Anticipating further tax exemption in other states, world distributor <a href="PVR%20Pictures">PVR Pictures</a> circulated 200 more prints of the film. The film completed its domestic run with $19,779,215. To reach more audiences, the film was later dubbed in the regional languages of <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> and <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>. Both were scheduled for release on 12 September 2008, the former under the title "Vaalu Nakshatram". It grossed $1,223,869 in the US by its seventh week, and £351,303 in the UK by its ninth week. Reports regarding the film's worldwide gross have conflicted, with sources citing , , , and .

In response to Khan's support for the <a href="Narmada%20Bachao%20Andolan">Narmada Bachao Andolan</a> and his criticism of Chief Minister <a href="Narendra%20Modi">Narendra Modi</a>, approximately 50 activists of the <a href="Sardar%20Patel">Sardar Patel</a> Group conducted protests outside of PVR and <a href="INOX%20Leisure%20Limited">INOX</a> theatres in <a href="Vadodara">Vadodara</a>, <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. The group also issued statements to all the multiplexes of Gujarat, suggesting that the film not be screened unless Khan apologised for his comments. The INOX cinema eventually boycotted the film; INOX Operations Manager Pushpendra Singh Rathod stated that "INOX is with Gujarat, and not isolated from it".

The <a href="International%20Dyslexia%20Association">International Dyslexia Association</a> screened "Taare Zameen Par" on 29 October 2008 in <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>. Khan noted in his official blog that there were about 200 people in the audience and that he was "curious to see the response of a non-Indian audience to what we had made." He felt some concern that "Taare Zameen Par" was shown in a conference room rather than a cinema hall and was projected as a DVD rather than as a film. He said that the showing concluded to an "absolutely thunderous standing ovation" which "overwhelmed" him and that he "saw the tears streaming down the cheeks of the audience." Khan also noted that the reaction to the film "was exactly as it had been with audiences back home in India".

"Taare Zameen Par" received critical acclaim from critics. On <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film received an <a href="approval%20rating">approval rating</a> of 90% based on 10 reviews, with an <a href="average%20rating">average rating</a> of 7/10. <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> suggests that the film is "a work of art, a water painting where the colors drip into our hearts, which could easily have fallen into the motions of over-sentimentality. Aamir Khan holds back where he could easily resort to an extravagant display of drama and emotions." <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> of <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a> argued that the true power of the film lies in its "remarkable, rooted, rock-solid script which provides the landscape for such an emotionally engaging, heart-warming experience." Manish Gajjar from the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> stated that the film "touches your heart and moves you deeply with its sterling performances. [It is] a film full of substance!" Jaspreet Pandohar, also of BBC, posited that "Taare Zameen Par" is a "far cry from the formulaic masala flicks churned out by the Bollywood machine," and is "an inspirational story that is as emotive as it is entertaining; this is a little twinkling star of a movie." Furthermore, Aprajita Anil of "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">Screen</a>" gave the film four stars and stated, ""Taare Zameen Par" cannot be missed. Because it is different. Because it is delightful. Because it would make everyone think. Because it would help everyone grow. Because very rarely do performances get so gripping. And of course because the 'perfectionist' actor has shaped into a 'perfectionist' director." In addition, filmmaker <a href="Anurag%20Kashyap%20%28director%29">Anurag Kashyap</a> stated that, ""Taare Zameen Par" took me back to my hostel days. If you take away the dyslexia, it seems like my story. The film affected me so deeply that I was almost left speechless. After watching the film, I was asked how I liked "Taare Zameen Par." I could not talk as I was deeply overwhelmed."

However, there were some criticisms. Jha's only objection to the film was Nikumbh's "sanctimonious lecture" to Ishaan's "rather theatrically-played" father. Jha found this a jarring "deviation from the delectable delicacy" of the film's tone. Although she applauded the film overall and recommended "a mandatory viewing for all schools and all parents", <a href="Nikhat%20Kazmi">Nikhat Kazmi</a> of "The <a href="Times%20of%20India">Times of India</a>" believed the second half was "a bit repetitive," the script needed "taut editing," and Ishaan's trauma "[seemed] a shade too prolonged and the treatment simplistic." Despite commending the "great performances" and excellent directing, Gautaman Bhaskaran of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>", too, suggested that the movie "suffers from a weak script." Likewise, Derek Kelly of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" criticised it for what he described as its "touchy-feely-ness" attention to "a <a href="special%20needs">special needs</a> kid's plight." Kelly also disliked the film for being "so resolutely caring ... and devoid of real drama and interesting characters" that "it should have 'approved by the Dyslexia Assn.' stamped on the posters."

In his article ""Taare Zameen Par" and dyslexic savants" featured in the "Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology", Ambar Chakravarty noted the general accuracy of Ishaan's dyslexia. Though Chakravarty was puzzled by Ishaan's trouble in simple arithmetic—a trait of <a href="dyscalculia">dyscalculia</a> rather than dyslexia—he reasoned it was meant to "enhance the image of [Ishaan's] helplessness and disability". Labeling Ishaan an example of "dyslexic savant syndrome", he especially praised the growth of Ishaan's artistic talents after receiving help and support from Nikumbh, and deemed it the "most important (and joyous) neurocognitive phenomenon" of the film. This improvement highlights cosmetic neurology, a "major and therapeutically important issue" in <a href="cognitive%20neuroscience">cognitive neuroscience</a> and <a href="neuropsychology">neuropsychology</a>.

Likewise, in their article "Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'" for the "Indian Journal of Psychiatry", T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T. Krishna wrote that the film "deserves to be vastly appreciated as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended "modern professional knowledge" with a "humane approach" in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading to a state of mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" The film depicts how "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a "naive oversimplification" in the film. With India "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they "easily [forgave the film's fault] under artistic license".

The film raised awareness of the issue of dyslexia, and prompted more open discussions among parents, schools, activists, and policymakers.
Anjuli Bawa, a parent-activist and founder of Action Dyslexia Delhi, said that the number of parents who visit her office increased tenfold in the months following the film's release. Many began taking a more proactive approach by contacting her after noticing problems, rather than using her as a last resort. Gupte himself received "many painful letters and phone calls" from Indian parents. He noted, "Fathers weep on the phone and say they saw the film and realized that they have been wrong in the way they treated their children. This is catharsis."

These reactions have also brought about a change in policies. The film, only ten days after its debut, influenced the <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Secondary%20Education">Central Board of Secondary Education</a> to provide extra time to special children—including the visually impaired, physically challenged and dyslexic—during exams. In 2008, Mumbai's civic body also opened 12 classrooms for autistic students. In <a href="Chandigarh">Chandigarh</a>, the education administration started a course to educate teachers on how to deal with children with learning disabilities.

The film has had a similarly positive response in <a href="Greater%20China">Greater China</a>, where the film was not officially released yet has a large online cult following due to Aamir Khan's popularity in the region after the success of "<a href="3%20Idiots">3 Idiots</a>" (2009). The film has been well received by Chinese audiences for how it tackles issues such as education and dyslexia, and is one of the highest-rated films on popular Chinese film site <a href="Douban">Douban</a>, along with two other Aamir Khan films, "3 Idiots" and "<a href="Dangal%20%28film%29">Dangal</a>" (2016).

Among its many awards, "Taare Zameen Par" won the <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Movie%20Award%232000s">Filmfare Best Film Award</a> for 2008, as well as the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20on%20Family%20Welfare">National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare</a>. Khan's directorial role and Safary's performance were recognised at the 2008 Zee Cine Awards, 2008 Filmfare Awards, and 4th Apsara Film & Television Producers Guild Awards.

"Taare Zameen Par" was initially acclaimed as India's official entry for the 2009 <a href="List%20of%20submissions%20to%20the%2081st%20Academy%20Awards%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Awards Best Foreign Film</a>, but after it failed to progress to the short list, a debate began in the Indian media as to why Indian films never win Academy Awards. Speculation for the reasons behind "Taare Zameen Par"s failed bid included <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a>'s Arthur J. Pai's observation that it lacked mainstream media attention; AMPAS jury member Krishna Shah criticised its length and abundance of songs.

Khan claimed that he was "not surprised" that "Taare Zameen Par" was not included in the Academy Award shortlist, and argued, "I don’t make films for awards. I make films for the audience. The audience, for which I have made the film, really loved it and the audiences outside India have also loved it. What I am trying to say is that film has been well loved across the globe and that for me it is extremely heartening and something that I give very high value to."

The Indian news media also frequently compared "Taare Zameen Par's" nomination failure with the British film "<a href="Slumdog%20Millionaire">Slumdog Millionaire</a>"s multiple Academy Award nominations and wins, and noted that other Indian films in the past were overlooked. Film critic <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> argued that it is difficult to compare the two films and noted that "Slumdog Millionaire" was being marketed in a way that Indian films such as "Taare Zameen Par" could not compete with. In this context, "Slumdog Millionaire" actor <a href="Mahesh%20Manjrekar">Mahesh Manjrekar</a> stated, "I’m sad that Aamir’s "Taare Zameen Par" didn’t make it to the final round of the Oscars. I thought it to be way better than "Slumdog" ["Millionaire"]..., without taking away anything from Boyle and the kids. But, Indian movies are underestimated there."

<a href="UTV%20Software%20Communications">UTV Home Entertainment</a> released the film on DVD in India on 25 July 2008. It was launched at Darsheel Safary's school, <a href="Green%20Lawns%20High%20School">Green Lawns High School</a>, in Mumbai. Aamir Khan, Tisca Chopra, Vipin Sharma, Sachet Engineer, and the rest of the cast and crew were present. In his speech, Khan stated, "Darsheel is a very happy child, full of life and vibrant. I am sure it's because of the way his parents and teachers have treated him. I must say Darsheel's principal Mrs. Bajaj has been extremely supportive and encouraging. The true test of any school is how happy the kids are and by the looks of it, the children here seem really happy."

<a href="List%20of%20Disney%20home%20entertainment">Walt Disney Company Home Entertainment</a>, which acquired 33 percent of <a href="UTV%20Software%20Communications">UTV Software Communications</a>, bought the DVD rights for distribution in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia for . This marked "the first time an international studio has bought the video rights of an Indian film." Retitling it "Like Stars on Earth", Disney released the film in <a href="DVD%20region%20code%23Region%20codes%20and%20countries">Region</a> 2 on 26 October 2009, in Region 1 on 12 January 2010, and in Region 4 on 29 March 2010. A three-disc set, the Disney version features the original Hindi audio soundtrack with English subtitles or another dubbed in English, as well as bonus material such as audio commentary, deleted scenes, and the musical soundtrack.

The soundtrack for "Taare Zameen Par" was released on 4 November 2007 under the label <a href="Super%20Cassettes%20Industries%20T-Series">T-Series</a>. The music is mainly composed by <a href="Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy">Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy</a>, with lyrics by <a href="Prasoon%20Joshi">Prasoon Joshi</a>. However, "Mera Jahan" was scored by Shailendra Barve and written by Gupte, with the latter also composing "Ishaan's Theme." Joshi received the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Lyrics">National Film Award for Best Lyrics</a>, and <a href="Shankar%20Mahadevan">Shankar Mahadevan</a> won the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Male%20Playback%20Singer">National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer</a> for "Maa."

Joginder Tuteja of <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> praised the variety of genres present in the soundtrack and the lack of <a href="remix">remix</a>es. He gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a "zero compromise album" that "stays true to the film's spirit". Planet Bollywood's Atta Khan rated it 9 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack "unquestionably lives up to all expectations". He felt that it maintained an "all round polished nature" and "is destined to become a classic". Although he, too, enjoyed the musical variety, he believed the composers overused the guitar and synthesizers. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the soundtrack a score of 3 out of 5, commenting, ""Taare Zameen Par" isn't your regular soundtrack about fluttering hearts and sleepless nights. What makes these delicate and whimsical creations special is their underlying innocence." According to the Indian trade website <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a>, with around 11,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's thirteenth highest-selling.

White-necked rockfowl

The white-necked rockfowl ("Picathartes gymnocephalus") is a medium-sized <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Picathartidae">Picathartidae</a>, with a long neck and tail. Also known as the white-necked picathartes, this <a href="passerine">passerine</a> is mainly found in rocky forested areas at higher altitudes in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a> from <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a> to <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and <a href="inselberg">inselberg</a>s. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with the <a href="grey-necked%20rockfowl">grey-necked rockfowl</a>. The white-necked rockfowl has greyish-black upperparts and white underparts. Its unusually long, dark brown tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being bright yellow except for two large, circular black patches located just behind the eyes. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.

These rockfowl feed primarily on insects, though parents feed small frogs to their young. One feeding strategy involves following "<a href="Dorylus">Dorylus</a>" army ant swarms, feeding on <a href="Ant%20follower">insects flushed by the ants</a>. Rockfowl move through the forest primarily through a series of hops and bounds or short flights in low vegetation. This species rarely flies for long distances. The white-necked rockfowl is <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a> and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs, sometimes in colonies with as many as eight nests. These nests are constructed out of mud formed into a deep cup and are built on rock surfaces, typically in caves. Two eggs are laid twice a year. Though the birds breed in colonies, infanticide is fairly common in this species, with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs. Nestlings mature in about a month. This bird is long-lived.

This species is classified as <a href="vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a> as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are underway in parts of its range in the form of habitat protection, education efforts, and new laws. Some of the indigenous peoples of Sierra Leone considered the species to be a protector of the home of their ancestral spirits. This rockfowl is considered one of Africa's most desirable birds by <a href="birder">birder</a>s and is a symbol of <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a> across its range.

This species was first <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Jacob Temminck</a> in 1825 from a specimen collected on the Guinean coast. He published his description in the 2nd volume of "Nouveau recueil de planches coloriées d'oiseaux" and described it as "Corvus gymnocephalus", placing it in the crow genus "<a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">Corvus</a>". The species name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "gymnos" "naked", and "kephalē" "head". However, only three years later the bird was removed from the genus "Corvus" by <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Primev%C3%A8re%20Lesson">René Primevère Lesson</a> and placed in its own genus, "Picathartes", as it did not share characteristics common to members of "Corvus" such as a feathered head. This generic name comes from a combination of the Latin genera "pica" for "magpie" and "cathartes" for "vulture". Since its initial description, the picathartes have been placed in more than five different families, including those of crows (<a href="Corvidae">Corvidae</a>), starlings (<a href="Sturnidae">Sturnidae</a>), Old World flycatchers (<a href="Muscicapidae">Muscicapidae</a>), babblers (<a href="Timaliidae">Timaliidae</a>) and Old World warblers (<a href="Sylviidae">Sylviidae</a>). Today the white-necked rockfowl and its close relative the <a href="grey-necked%20rockfowl">grey-necked rockfowl</a> are believed to comprise a unique family, <a href="Picathartidae">Picathartidae</a>. It has also been suggested though not generally accepted that the two rockfowl represent the remnants of an ancient bird order. Recent <a href="DNA%20analysis">DNA analysis</a> has shown that Picathartidae and its closest relatives, southern Africa's <a href="rockjumper">rockjumper</a>s and southeast Asia's <a href="rail-babbler">rail-babbler</a>, form a <a href="clade">clade</a>. The analysis suggests that the rockfowl split from the common ancestor of their clade 44 million years ago. It is believed that the ancestor of this clade originated in Australia and spread to Africa. Though the white-necked rockfowl has no <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, it is believed to form a <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a> with the grey-necked rockfowl, with plumage and facial pattern being the primary differences between the two species.

Common names used for this species include white-necked rockfowl, white-necked picathartes, yellow-headed picathartes, bare-headed rockfowl, and the less frequently used white-necked bald crow. Rockfowl is a reference to the species' habit of building mud nests on rock surfaces and caves. Picathartes refers to the species' scientific name. Bald crow is a reference to its featherless head and somewhat crow-like appearance, especially its beak.

This rockfowl measures around in length, with its notably long tail contributing about . Adult rockfowl show little <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> in plumage and the sexes cannot be told apart by appearance. On the adult, the head, excluding the chin and throat, is completely bare of feathers except for a thin layer of fuzz on the forehead. The head's skin is bright yellow except for two large, circular patches of black skin located just behind the eye and containing the ear; only a thin, wide patch of yellow skin on the crown prevents the two black patches from connecting. The black patch has a raised edge and appears to be a distinct part of the face. The eyelid and eyering are a thin line of black surrounding the bird's large, dark brown eyes. The <a href="beak">beak</a> is robust, disproportionately large, and black. This beak can be considered crow-like, is noticeably decurved in the upper mandible, and is about long. The bird's chin and throat are covered in a thin layer of white feathers, and the neck is long and slender. The <a href="nape">nape</a> is also covered in white feathers, while the hindneck is nearly bare, revealing the orange-yellow skin. The upper mantle is a solid black, merging into a greyish-black lower mantle. The rockfowl's thighs are very muscular and aid its partially terrestrial lifestyle. The back, rump, and undertail are a bluish grey, while the tail is a dark brown and tented in shape. The moderately-sized wings are also a dark brown. The underparts are a creamy white and appear their creamiest in the upper breast. In dim light the white-necked rockfowl can appear to be solely black above and white below. The legs are blue and relatively long. Overall the plumage appears to be smooth with long feathers. The adult weighs .

The nestling is born naked with dark-brown skin above and translucent pink skin below, blind, and with an orange-red <a href="gape">gape</a>. After a few days, the gape changes to a bright yellow-orange. After hatching, the head's skin is all yellow without the black patches of the adult; these are gained about a week before leaving the nest. An immature rockfowl after its fourth week is very similar to the adult, but its underparts are creamier and silkier than those of the adult, its neck possesses fewer feathers, and the yellow on the head is paler. Most noticeably, its tail is significantly shorter than that of the adult.

Although numerous calls have been recorded, the white-necked rockfowl is normally a silent bird. Its call has been compared to the clucks of a <a href="chicken">chicken</a>, with clucks of "chuk-chuk-chuk" or "choop-choop-choop" being made at a constant rate of eight notes every five seconds. This call typically lasts for at least a minute. It has been suggested that this call may be a proper song, but more research is required to determine if this is accurate. The rockfowl's alarm call, one of its more frequent sounds, has been described as a continuous, low-pitched, guttural chatter similar to "ow, ow, ow". Adults and juveniles have also been known to produce a long-drawn "owooh" call note. Additionally, fledglings can give a loud, quavering second-long whistle as a contact call.

This species is only found in West Africa from Guinea to Ghana. It is locally common in southeastern Guinea, and is widespread in Sierra Leone except for the north and northwest, and in Liberia except for the north and northeast. In Côte d'Ivoire the species is currently restricted to areas near the Guinean and Liberian border. The bird also lives in Ghana, where it is both local and uncommon in the south central parts of the nation. The white-necked rockfowl's total range covers approximately . However, the species occurs in low population densities in patches across this large range. The species does not <a href="Bird%20migration">migrate</a>, though it does disperse widely after the <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>.

This rockfowl lives on steep slopes in both primary and mature secondary forests. These <a href="Upper%20Guinean%20forests">forests</a> are typically covered in rocks and are found in hilly lowland areas up to . The white-necked rockfowl often lives near flowing streams and rivers so that it has access to wet mud for nest construction. Colonies are typically found within of a stream. The species also seems to show a preference for living near <a href="inselberg">inselberg</a>s. Rockfowl are occasionally seen in partly cleared forests and near cities, but this appears to be abnormal. Recent surveys have shown that abandoned rockfowl nests are more likely to be in or near secondary forest.

This picathartes typically keeps low in the vegetation or on the ground near its nesting grounds. It moves quickly through its forested habitat primarily through a series of hops and bounds, followed by a pause before resuming its movements. It uses its tail for balance while traversing the forest. The rockfowl also flies at a low altitude for short distances between vines and trees, and it rarely flies for long distances. This species can disappear from sight into a mass of creepers or rocks. It is capable of high jumps, sometimes jumping off the cave floor to its nest while only partly using its wings.

It was once thought that the rockfowl rarely ventures far from its breeding grounds; however, new data suggests that the species has a much broader range than previously thought. Rockfowl have been known to continue roosting on their nests for a period following the breeding season. These birds are normally solitary or in pairs, though sometimes they live in groups of three to five birds. Typically, they silently evade any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. One of the rockfowl's displays entails several of the birds in a colony forming a loose circle. Individual rockfowl run at each other, forcing the approached bird to retreat slightly before chasing either the bird that charged it or another in the circle. At intervals during this display a rockfowl leans forward on a branch, tucking its head between its legs and half-spreading its wings, thus revealing its crown to the other rockfowl. It is believed that this behavior shows the intent of the rockfowl to roost in a group, though recent evidence suggests that the display could be involved in breeding. To scratch its head, the bird lifts its foot over its wing. This species is long-lived.

The white-necked rockfowl forages across slopes on <a href="moss">moss</a>y, creeper-covered boulders and in trees covered in <a href="liana">liana</a>s and hanging mosses. It occasionally forages by hopping across sand by a stream or even in the stream, as evidenced by crab remains in the rockfowl's droppings. While foraging on the ground, the rockfowl picks up leaves with its bill and tosses them aside. It feeds in <a href="Mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species groups</a> ahead of swarms of "<a href="Dorylus">Dorylus</a>" ants with <a href="Alethe%20%28genus%29">alethe</a>s, <a href="bristlebill">bristlebill</a>s, and <a href="Finsch%27s%20rufous%20thrush">Finsch's rufous thrush</a>es, picking off insects <a href="Ant%20follower">flushed by the ants</a>, mostly off the ground. The rockfowl has also been observed hopping from the ground and snatching prey midair.

The diet is diverse and generalized, enabling the white-necked rockfowl to have a degree of adaptability in collecting food. This rockfowl primarily eats insects, including larval <a href="cockroach">cockroach</a>es, <a href="tettigoniid">tettigoniid</a> grasshoppers, <a href="earwig">earwig</a>s, ants from the genera "<a href="Pachycondyla">Pachycondyla</a>" and "Dorylus", <a href="click%20beetle">click beetle</a>s from the genus "<a href="Psephus">Psephus</a>", and termites. Other than insects, it has been observed eating <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s, <a href="centipede">centipede</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s, and occasionally small frogs and lizards. When feeding its nestlings, the rockfowl primarily collects earthworms, small frogs, and lizards, with the vertebrates forming most of the biomass fed to the young. In addition, rockfowl are occasionally seen eating plant material, normally from <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s or mosses.

The White-necked rockfowl breeds primarily in caves and pairs nest either alone or as part of a small colony. While its courtship behavior is unknown, the species is <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate despite earlier suggestions that it bred cooperatively. The White-necked rockfowl has two breeding seasons throughout the year, though the timing of the breeding seasons is determined by the location of the birds and the timing of the wet season, with nesting occurring just before and after the wet season and averaging 127 days apart. The rockfowl reuses its nest, and typically repairs it two to eight weeks prior to laying eggs. Guinean birds breed from July to January, while those in Sierra Leone breed from November to February and from April to October. In Liberia, breeding occurs from September to December and from March to July. Ghana's rockfowl breed from March to June and September to November. Breeding caves are traditionally deserted while the rockfowl are not breeding, so increased usage by the rockfowl is considered a first sign of breeding. Nesting colonies average two to five nests, although one colony had forty nests. In addition to breeding birds, sometimes non-breeding rockfowl are present. These birds occasionally attempt infanticide to gain access to prime nesting sites or mates. Birds in these colonies often chase each other in circles, even through the treetops, a rare destination for this species.

Unusually for a rainforest-dwelling bird, the white-necked rockfowl builds a nest out of mud with varying amounts of plant fibers mixed in. Mud is collected from nearby rivers and streams and is shaped into a strong, thick-walled, and deep cup attached to the cave wall or roof, a cliff, or a large boulder approximately above the ground. These rocks must be sloped inwards to provide the nest with protection from the rain. <a href="Phloem">Phloem</a> fibers and roots from plants line the inside of the cup. The white-necked rockfowl's nesting caves normally are populated by <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s, and the wasp nests long are often found embedded in the rockfowl's nests. It is believed that in order to build their nest on the smooth cave walls, rockfowl use the nests of the wasps as a nucleus to build around. Cliff nests are always built at a distance from nearby plants. Both birds work on the construction of the nest, with roles alternating as one bird collects the materials while the other shapes them into the nest. The mud is sometimes swallowed and regurgitated prior to use. While nearly all rockfowl nests are found in caves or on cliffs, there are records of nesting occurring on a riverbank and on a fallen tree trunk. Nests are typically constructed at least apart, but one colony had six nests adjoining each other. Nests also vary widely in size, though they average to be long, wide, and deep. It used to be believed that each pair builds two nests, one for breeding and one for roosting; however, recent surveys have found no evidence of this, with all nests in the colony being used for breeding.
One to two eggs, typically two, are laid in each nest a day or two apart. The eggs weigh about and have an average size of . The eggs are a creamy white with dark brown blotches spread across the egg but in higher density near the larger end. <a href="avian%20incubation">Incubation</a>, which begins after the first egg is laid, lasts for 23 to 28 days. The parents take turns incubating their eggs. Hatching typically takes at least 12 hours. The infant rockfowl's eyes open after nine to eleven days, while feathers begin to grow seven days after hatching. After the young hatch, food is brought to them almost four times an hour. To feed its young, the adult rockfowl clings to the side of its nest while fluttering its wings; some birds use their tails as a prop underneath the nest to help support themselves. Rockfowl have been known to kill the young of other rockfowl, while nest predation is carried out by <a href="cobra">cobra</a>s of the genus "<a href="Naja">Naja</a>", the <a href="Nile%20monitor">Nile monitor</a>, <a href="sun%20squirrel">sun squirrel</a>s, <a href="red-chested%20goshawk">red-chested goshawk</a>s, and "<a href="Procolobus">Procolobus</a>" monkeys. This leads on average to only 0.44 nestlings surviving per pair of rockfowl. Due to potential infanticide by other rockfowl, parents protect their nest and vicious fights often occur. Rare among other bird species, this behaviour is prevalent in white-necked rockfowl. Not fully understood, it is thought to occur for the sake of resource competition or <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a>. The young leave the nest after 23 to 27 days, at which time they resemble the adult rockfowl but with much shorter tails. The young leave the nest by standing on the edge, emitting a piercing whistle, and then gliding down to the ground on spread wings where they are met by an adult bearing insects. Even after leaving the nest, the young return to roost on it with their parents.

In the lore of Sierra Leone's indigenous people, the often bizarre rock formations near which the white-necked rockfowl lives were believed to house ancestral spirits. Its residence there led it to be considered a guardian of the formations, leading to a degree of residual respect for the species that persists despite the beliefs that spawned this respect being practically extinct. However, in some regions the rockfowl's secretive habits and inaccessible habitat have meant it was unknown to the local population. Conversely, migrant Liberian hunters sometimes catch the nestlings for food. Due to this species' uniqueness it became a symbol for ecotourism and rainforest conservation in the region in the 1990s. The white-necked rockfowl has been depicted on numerous postage stamps from Ghana and Sierra Leone. Due to its strange appearance and behavior and the difficulty in seeing the species, this bird is considered particularly fascinating by <a href="birdwatchers">birdwatchers</a>. This species is considered to be one of the five most desirable birds in Africa by ornithologists.

This species also helped launch Sir <a href="David%20Attenborough">David Attenborough</a>'s career in 1954, when he was the producer on the new television program "<a href="Zoo%20Quest">Zoo Quest</a>". The show's presenter Jack Lester was required to travel to Africa to record attempts to capture animals for display in zoos, with the focus of the series being on the white-necked rockfowl. However, when he fell ill, Attenborough took his place, which launched him into the limelight and starting his narrating career.

This species is considered <a href="vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> due to its highly fragmented distribution, dwindling population, and <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>. It is considered to be less common and more threatened than the closely related <a href="grey-necked%20rockfowl">grey-necked rockfowl</a>. The stronghold of the species is in Sierra Leone and southern Guinea, where the bird is still locally common if difficult to locate. It is estimated that only 2,500 to 10,000 white-necked rockfowl survive, with the population dwindling and spread out over a known 32 sites; however, most individuals studying this species believe that the population is far fewer than the 10,000 maximum. Many of its colonies are currently approaching the minimum population size necessary to guarantee long-term viability against inbreeding. The primary threat is the commercial destruction of its habitat for timber. Although the white-necked rockfowl is capable of withstanding some disturbance of the nearby habitat, as demonstrated by one colony surviving after it was completely surrounded by a <a href="Theobroma%20cacao">cocoa</a> plantation, habitat disturbance is far more likely to negatively impact on breeding success. Most of the remaining colonies in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Côte d'Ivoire are on protected land, while Liberia and Ghana's colonies are mostly unprotected. In part to protect this species, Sierra Leone recently upgraded its protection of the Gola forest by turning it into its second national park, <a href="Gola%20National%20Park">Gola National Park</a>, and has announced that the country intends to work with Liberia to form a trans-national park protecting the Gola rainforest. In return for lost logging rights, Sierra Leone has compensated locals with road and school renovations, additional training for police officers, and construction of churches and a mosque. Liberia has also expressed a desire to expand its national park system, which would help protect the species. In Guinea, the bird's forests are being logged to provide land for rice farming to help support farmers immigrating from the country's drier north.

Laws exist in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ghana to protect this species, but enforcement is minimal. International trading of the white-necked rockfowl is regulated as the bird is currently listed under <a href="CITES">CITES</a> Appendix I. Additionally, in 2004 <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> drafted an international action plan to provide strategies for protecting this species. This plan focused on surveying the remaining habitat, raising awareness amongst the local populace, and limiting the continued destruction of its habitat. In 2006, BirdLife International received a US$19,900 grant from the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund to help enact this plan. Surveys conducted with this funding have resulted in the discovery of additional populations in Sierra Leone. Additionally, wardens have been trained to protect Sierra Leone's <a href="Western%20Area%20Forest%20Reserve">Western Area Forest Reserve</a>. This plan, coupled with the bird's appearance and unusual habits, have led it to become a flagship species for <a href="habitat%20conservation">habitat conservation</a> across Africa and particularly in its <a href="upper%20Guinean%20forests">upper Guinean forests</a>.

Until 2003, the species was thought to be extinct in Ghana. Most of the Ghanaian sites from which it is known are active forest reserves, where logging periodically occurs. Outside of the reserves, bush-burning and mining for gold and other metals threaten remaining habitat. Following its rediscovery in Ghana, the <a href="Ghana%20Wildlife%20Society">Ghana Wildlife Society</a> has begun to survey remaining habitat and implement conservation strategies.

In the 1950s and 1960s, collecting this species for display in zoos was a major threat, and in Liberia in particular this practice destroyed several of the bird's colonies. The rockfowl were captured by the indigenous peoples through the use of traps, while hunters in Guinea, who were already catching rodents and <a href="hyrax">hyrax</a>es at the bird's nesting colonies, sometimes captured rockfowl at night. In Côte d'Ivoire specimens were sometimes caught by bat-catchers. Most birds collected from the wild die within 24 hours. Despite over 70 white-necked rockfowl being displayed in zoos during the 1970s, captive breeding was a rare occurrence and no stable captive populations have been formed. Despite this, zoos did have limited success and at least one zoo was able to hand-rear a white-necked rockfowl. As of 2002, no white-necked rockfowl have existed outside of Africa since 1998.

Year Zero (album)

Year Zero is the fifth studio album by American <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a> band <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, released by <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a> on April 17, 2007. Conceived while touring in support of the band's previous album, "<a href="With%20Teeth">With Teeth</a>" (2005), the album was recorded throughout late-2006, and was produced by frontman <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> and <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a>. It was the band's last album for Interscope, following Reznor's departure the same year over a dispute of overseas pricing.

In contrast to the introspective style of songwriting featured on the band's previous work, the record is a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> that criticizes contemporary policies of the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States government</a> by presenting a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n vision of the year 2022. It was part of a larger Year Zero project, which included a <a href="Year%20Zero%20Remixed">remix album</a>, an <a href="Year%20Zero%20%28video%20game%29">alternate reality game of the same name</a>, as well a conceived television or film adaptation. The game expanded upon the album's storyline, using websites, pre-recorded phone messages, murals, among other media in promotion of the project. The album was promoted by two singles: "<a href="Survivalism%20%28song%29">Survivalism</a>" and "<a href="Capital%20G">Capital G</a>".

"Year Zero" received positive reviews from critics, who complimented its concept and production, as well as the accompanying alternate reality game. The album reached number two in the US, number six in the UK, and the top 10 in various other countries. 

In a 2005 interview with "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>", Trent Reznor expressed his intentions to write material for a new release while on tour promoting "<a href="With%20Teeth">With Teeth</a>". He reportedly began work on the new album by September 2006. Reznor devised much of the album's musical direction on his laptop. Reznor told "Kerrang!" in a later interview, "When I was on the "" tour, to keep myself busy I just really hunkered down and was working on music the whole time, so this kept me in a creative mode and when I finished the tour I felt like I wasn't tired and wanted to keep at it."

The limitations of devising the album's musical direction on a tour bus forced Reznor to work differently from usual. Reznor said, "I didn't have guitars around because it was too much hassle ... It was another creative limitation ... If I were in my studio, I would have done things the way I normally do them. But not having the ability to do that forced me into trying some things that were fun to do."

By the end of the tour, Reznor began work on the album's lyrical concepts, attempting to break away from his typically introspective approach. Reznor drew inspiration from his concern at the state of affairs in the United States and at what he envisioned as the country's political, spiritual, and social direction. "Year Zero" was <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> in January 2007, and Reznor stated on his <a href="blog">blog</a> that the album was finished as of February 5. The album's budget was a reported <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>2 million, but since Reznor composed most of the album himself on his laptop and in his home-studio, much of the budget instead went toward the extensive accompanying promotional campaign.

A song cut from the album included vocal work by <a href="Queens%20of%20the%20Stone%20Age">Queens of the Stone Age</a>'s <a href="Josh%20Homme">Josh Homme</a>. The same year, Reznor contributed vocals to their song "Era Vulgaris", which was also cut from the <a href="Era%20Vulgaris%20%28album%29">album of the same name</a>.

The album's music features the styles of <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a>, <a href="electro-industrial">electro-industrial</a>, <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a>, and <a href="digital%20hardcore">digital hardcore</a>. Reznor called "Year Zero" a "shift in direction" in that it "doesn't sound like "<a href="With%20Teeth">With Teeth</a>"". He also said that when he finishes a new album, he has to "go into battle with the people whose job it is to figure out how to sell the record. The only time that didn't happen was [for] "With Teeth". This time, however, [he was] expecting an epic struggle. ["Year Zero"] is not a particularly friendly record and it certainly doesn't sound like anything else out there right now."

Fifteen original tracks were considered for inclusion on the album, which Reznor described as "Highly conceptual. Quite noisy. Fucking cool." Reznor also described the album as a "collage of sound type of thing", citing musical inspiration from early <a href="Public%20Enemy%20%28band%29">Public Enemy</a> records, specifically the production techniques of <a href="The%20Bomb%20Squad">The Bomb Squad</a>. Most of "Year Zero"s musical elements were created by Reznor solely on his laptop, as opposed to the instrument-heavy "With Teeth". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s review described the album's laptop-mixed sound: "guitars squall against glitches, beeps, pops, and blotches of blurry sonic attacks. Percussion looms large, distorted, organic, looped, screwed, spindled and broken." Many reviews of the album compared the album's electronic sound to earlier Nine Inch Nails releases such as "<a href="The%20Downward%20Spiral">The Downward Spiral</a>" and "<a href="The%20Fragile%20%28Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20album%29">The Fragile</a>", while contrasting its heavily modified sounds to the more "organic" approach of "With Teeth". Many critics also commented on the album's overall tone, including descriptions such as "lots of silver and grey ambience" and reference to the album's "oblique tone". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" review described the album's sound by saying "Hard beats are softened with distortion, static cushions the tantrums, sneaky bass lines float beneath the surface." The article went on to describe individual tracks: "And as usual the music is packed with details: "Meet Your Master" goes through at least three cycles of decay and rebirth; part of the fun of "The Warning" is tracking the ever-mutating timbres."

Many of the songs on the album feature an extended instrumental ending, which encompasses the entire second half of the three-minute long "The Great Destroyer". The album was co-produced by Reznor and <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a>, mixed by long-time collaborator <a href="Alan%20Moulder">Alan Moulder</a>, and <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastered</a> by <a href="Brian%20Gardner">Brian Gardner</a>. The album features instrumental contributions by <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20live%20performances">live band member</a> <a href="Josh%20Freese">Josh Freese</a> and vocals by <a href="Saul%20Williams">Saul Williams</a>.

Nine Inch Nails' 2006 tour merchandise designs featured overt references to the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States military</a>, which Reznor said "reflect[ed] future directions". Reznor later described "Year Zero" as "the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist". The album criticizes the American government's policies, and "could be about the end of the world". Reznor specifically cited what he labeled as the "erosion of freedoms" and "the way that we treat the rest of the world and our own citizens". Reznor had previously called the results of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 US election</a> "one step closer to the end of the world."

Even though the fictional story begins in January 2007, the <a href="Campaign%20timeline%20of%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game">timeline</a> of the album and alternate reality game mentions historical events, such as the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> and the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. From there, fictional events lead to worldwide chaos, including <a href="bioterrorism">bioterrorism</a> attacks, the United States engaging in <a href="Nuclear%20warfare">nuclear war</a> with <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and the elimination of American <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a> at the hands of the fictional government agency <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23Bureau%20of%20Morality">The Bureau of Morality</a>. Regardless of being fictional, a columnist of the "<a href="Hartford%20Courant">Hartford Courant</a>" commented, "What's scary is that this doesn't seem as far-fetched as it should, given recent revelations about the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a>'s abuse of the <a href="USA%20PATRIOT%20Act">Patriot Act</a> and the dissent-equals-disloyalty double-speak coming out of Washington in recent years."

All of the artwork for "Year Zero" was created by <a href="Rob%20Sheridan">Rob Sheridan</a>, <a href="art%20director">art director</a> for Nine Inch Nails, who is also credited for artwork on "With Teeth", among other Nine Inch Nails releases since 2000. The album features a thermo-chrome heat-sensitive CD face which appears black when first opened, but reveals a black binary code on a white background when heat is generated from the album being played. The binary sequence translates to "exterminal.net", the address of a website involved in the alternate reality game. Reznor displayed displeasure at the extra $10 added to the CD's price in Australia for the thermo-coating, saying it only cost an extra 83¢ per CD and that the extra cost came from his pocket.

Included with the album is a small insert that is a warning from the fictional United States Bureau of Morality (USBM), with a phone number to report people who have "engaged in subversive acts". When the number is called, a recording from the USBM is played, claiming "By calling this number, you and your family are implicitly pleading guilty to the consumption of anti-American media and have been flagged as potential militants."

It was named one of the best album covers of 2007 by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>".

While work continued on the album, Reznor hinted in an interview that it was "part of a bigger picture of a number of things I'm working on". In February 2007 fans discovered that a new Nine Inch Nails tour t-shirt contained highlighted letters that spelled out the words "I am trying to believe". This phrase was registered as a website URL, and soon several related websites were also discovered in the <a href="IP%20address">IP range</a>, all describing a dystopian vision of the fictional "<a href="Year%20Zero%20%28game%29%23Plot">Year 0</a>". It was later reported that <a href="42%20Entertainment">42 Entertainment</a> had created these websites to promote "Year Zero" as part of <a href="Year%20Zero%20%28alternate%20reality%20game%29">an alternate reality game</a>.

The "Year Zero" story takes place in the United States in the year 2022; or "Year 0" according to the American government, being the year that America was reborn. The United States has suffered several major terrorist attacks, and in response the government has seized absolute control on the country and reverted to a Christian <a href="Fundamentalism">fundamentalist</a> <a href="theocracy">theocracy</a>. The government maintains control of the populace through institutions such as the <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23Bureau%20of%20Morality">Bureau of Morality</a> and the <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23First%20Evangelical%20Church%20of%20Plano">First Evangelical Church of Plano</a>, as well as increased surveillance and the secret drugging of tap water with a mild sedative. In response to the increasing oppression of the government, several corporate, government, and subversive websites were transported back in time to the present by a group of scientists working clandestinely against the authoritarian government. The websites-from-the-future were sent to the year 2007 to warn the American people of the impending dystopian future and to prevent it from ever forming in the first place.

The "Year Zero" game consisted of an expansive series of websites, phone numbers, e-mails, videos, <a href="MP3">MP3</a>s, murals, and other media that expanded upon the fictional storyline of the album. Each new piece of media contained various hints and clues to discover the next, relying on fan participation to discover each new facet of the expanding game. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" described the fan involvement in this promotion as the "marketing team's dream". Reznor, however, argued that "marketing" was an inaccurate description of the game, and that it was "not some kind of gimmick to get you to buy a record – it IS the art form".

Part of this promotional campaign involved <a href="USB%20flash%20drive">USB drives</a> that were left in concert venues for fans to find during Nine Inch Nails' 2007 European tour. During a concert in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, Portugal, a <a href="USB%20flash%20drive">USB flash drive</a> was found in a bathroom stall containing a high-quality <a href="MP3">MP3</a> of the track "My Violent Heart", a song from the then-unreleased album. Another USB drive was found at a concert in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, Spain, containing the track "Me, I'm Not". Messages found on the drives and tour clothing led to additional websites and images from the game, and the early release of several unheard songs from the album. Following the discovery of the USB drives, the high-quality audio files quickly circulated the internet. Owners of websites hosting the files soon received <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease and desist</a> orders from the <a href="RIAA">Recording Industry Association of America</a>, despite Interscope having sanctioned the viral campaign and the early release of the tracks. Reznor told "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>":

On February 22, 2007 a teaser trailer was released through the official "Year Zero" website. It featured a quick glimpse of a blue road sign that said "I AM TRYING TO BELIEVE", as well as a distorted glimpse of "<a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game%23The%20Presence">The Presence</a>" from the album cover. One frame in the teaser led fans to a URL containing the complete album cover. In March, the <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack</a> audio files of "Year Zero"s first single, "<a href="Survivalism%20%28song%29">Survivalism</a>", were released in <a href="GarageBand">GarageBand</a> format for fan <a href="remix">remix</a>ing. The multitrack files for "<a href="Capital%20G">Capital G</a>", "My Violent Heart" and "Me, I'm Not" were released the following month, and files for "The Beginning of the End", "Vessel" and "God Given" were released on the month after that. In response to an early leak of the album, the entire album became available for streaming on Nine Inch Nails' <a href="MySpace">MySpace</a> page a week before the album's official release.

After taking a break from touring to complete work on "Year Zero", the <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20live%20performances">Nine Inch Nails live band</a> embarked on a world tour in 2007 dubbed <a href="Performance%202007%20Tour">Performance 2007</a>. The tour included the band's first performance in China. Reznor continued to tour with the same band he concluded the previous tour with: <a href="Aaron%20North">Aaron North</a>, <a href="Jeordie%20White">Jeordie White</a>, <a href="Josh%20Freese">Josh Freese</a>, and <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a>. The tour spanned 91 dates across Europe, Asia, Australia, and Hawaii.

Between tour legs Nine Inch Nails gave a performance as part of the "Year Zero" game. A small group of fans received fictional in-game telephone-calls that invited them to a "resistance meeting" in a Los Angeles parking lot. Those who arrived were given "resistance kits", some of which contained cellphones that would later inform the participants of further details. After receiving instructions from the cellphones, fans who attended a fictional <a href="Characters%20and%20organizations%20in%20the%20Year%20Zero%20alternate%20reality%20game">Art is Resistance</a> meeting in Los Angeles were rewarded with an unannounced performance by Nine Inch Nails. The concert was cut short as the meeting was raided by a fictional <a href="SWAT">SWAT</a> team and the audience was rushed out of the building.

Upon its release in April 2007, "Year Zero" sold over 187,000 copies in its first week. The album reached number two on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> and peaked in the top 10 in six other countries, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. The album's lead single, "<a href="Survivalism%20%28song%29">Survivalism</a>" peaked at number 68 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, and topped the <a href="Hot%20Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock</a> and Canadian singles charts. The second single, "<a href="Capital%20G">Capital G</a>", reached number six on the Modern Rock chart.

In a post on the official Nine Inch Nails website, Reznor condemned <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a>—the parent company of Interscope Records—for its pricing and distribution plans for "Year Zero". He wrote that he hated Interscope for setting the price of the album higher than usual, humorously labeling the company's retail pricing of "Year Zero" in Australia as "ABSURD", and concluding that "as a reward for being a 'true fan' you get ripped off." Reznor went on to say in later years the "climate" of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music. Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention. Reznor continued his attack on Universal Music Group during a September 2007 concert in Australia, where he urged fans to "steal" his music online instead of purchasing it legally. Reznor went on to encourage the crowd to "steal and steal and steal some more and give it to all your friends and keep on stealin'." Although Universal never replied publicly to the criticism, a spokesperson for the Australian Music Retailers Association said "It is the same price in Australia as it is in the US because of the extra packaging." Due to the pricing dispute, plans to release a "Capital G" maxi-single in Europe were scrapped. The track was instead released as a limited-edition single, without a "<a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20discography%23Halo%20numbers">Halo number</a>", unlike most official Nine Inch Nails releases.

"Year Zero" was the last Nine Inch Nails studio album released on Interscope. Reznor announced in October 2007 that Nine Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope and could proceed "free of any recording contract with any label", effectively ending the band's relationship with its record label.

A <a href="remix%20album">remix album</a>, titled "<a href="Year%20Zero%20Remixed">Year Zero Remixed</a>", was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a>, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including <a href="The%20Faint">The Faint</a>, <a href="Ladytron">Ladytron</a>, <a href="Bill%20Laswell">Bill Laswell</a>, <a href="Saul%20Williams">Saul Williams</a>, <a href="Olof%20Dreijer">Olof Dreijer</a> of <a href="The%20Knife">The Knife</a>, and <a href="Sam%20Fogarino">Sam Fogarino</a> of <a href="Interpol%20%28band%29">Interpol</a>. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website. Instrumental versions of the songs on "Year Zero" are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including <a href="MP3">MP3</a>, <a href="WAV">WAV</a>, <a href="GarageBand">GarageBand</a>, and <a href="Ableton%20Live">Ableton Live</a> formats.

A planned film adaption of "Year Zero" became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike</a> affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is "still churning along", and that he had begun working with American film producer <a href="Lawrence%20Bender">Lawrence Bender</a>. In 2010, Reznor started developing the "Year Zero" miniseries with <a href="HBO">HBO</a> and <a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a> Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with "<a href="Carniv%C3%A0le">Carnivàle</a>" writer <a href="Daniel%20Knauf">Daniel Knauf</a> to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an "Ask Me Anything" session on <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a> on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was "currently in a holding state" and explained, "We [Reznor and Sheridan] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves. [...] This project means a lot to me and will see the light of day in one form or another." In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP "<a href="Add%20Violence">Add Violence</a>", Reznor said that "They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer. I should have just done it [myself]."

Year Zero received generally favourable reviews from music critics, with an average rating of 76% based on 28 reviews on review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> described "Year Zero" as Reznor's "most songful album", while Thomas Inskeep of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus</a>" magazine praised it as "one of the most forward-thinking 'rock' albums to come down the pike in some time". <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" called the album Reznor's "strongest, weirdest and most complex record since "<a href="The%20Downward%20Spiral">The Downward Spiral</a>"", and concluded that "he's got his bravado back." "Rolling Stone" ranked it at number 21 on its "Top 50 Albums of 2007" list.

Several reviewers also commented on the accompanying alternate reality game. <a href="Ann%20Powers">Ann Powers</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", praised the album and game concept as "a total marriage of the pop and gamer aesthetics that unlocks the rusty cages of the music industry and solves some key problems facing rock music as its cultural dominance dissolves into dust." In relation to the declining music industry, Joseph Jaffe of "<a href="Brandweek">Brandweek</a>" commented that such "mysterious marketing measures [...] are what's desperately needed to gain attention in this uncertain era of distribution dilemmas and sagging sales", also commending acts such as Nine Inch Nails and <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> for being "more innovative than marketers". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the album a B+, comparing it to "The X-Files" and calling it "A sci-fi concept album whose end-of-days, paranoia-drenched storyline has been disseminated via the Internet". It also stated: "Amid its carefully calibrated sonic assaults, "Year Zero" has a number of tracks that will stop you in yours. Sometimes, it's a matter of dropping the volume [...] Even his use of electronics has shifted to a new level [...] Is the truth in here? Dunno, but Reznor's claim that 'I got my violence in high def ultra-realism' sounds like gospel to us."

On the fictional world depicted in the album and promotional campaign, the "<a href="Cleveland%20Free%20Times">Cleveland Free Times</a>" commented that the album's fictionalized world and characters "often seemed heavy-handed and forced", but also conceded that "its clotted claustrophobia suited its subject matter". Ann Powers added, "The songs on 'Year Zero,' each from the perspective of a character or characters already existent in the ARG, draw a connection between the music fan's passionate identification with songs and the gamer's experience of becoming someone else online." In 2008, 42 Entertainment won two <a href="Webby%20Awards">Webby Awards</a> for its work on the "Year Zero" game, in the categories of "Integrated Campaigns" and "Other Advertising: Branded Content".

Paramount Television Network

The Paramount Television Network (PTN) was a venture by American film corporation <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> to organize a <a href="television%20network">television network</a> in the late 1940s. The company built television stations <a href="KTLA">KTLA</a> in Los Angeles and <a href="WBBM-TV">WBKB</a> in Chicago; it also invested <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>400,000 in the <a href="DuMont%20Television%20Network">DuMont Television Network</a>, which operated stations <a href="WNYW">WABD</a> in New York City, <a href="WTTG">WTTG</a> in Washington, D.C., and <a href="KDKA-TV">WDTV</a> in Pittsburgh. Escalating disputes between Paramount and DuMont concerning breaches of contract, company control, and network competition erupted regularly between 1940 and 1956, and culminated in the dismantling of the DuMont Network. Television historian Timothy White called the clash between the two companies "one of the most unfortunate and dramatic episodes in the early history of the television industry."

The Paramount Television Network aired several programs, including the <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>-winning children's series "<a href="Time%20for%20Beany">Time for Beany</a>". Filmed in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, the programs were distributed to an ad-hoc network of stations across the United States. The network signed <a href="network%20affiliate">affiliation</a> agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. The <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC), which filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up on the idea of a television network, and continued to produce series for other networks. In 1995, after four decades of television production for other companies, Paramount re-entered the broadcast network field when the company and <a href="Chris-Craft%20Industries">Chris-Craft Industries</a> launched the United Paramount Network (<a href="UPN">UPN</a>), a television network that operated until 2006. Paramount's longtime television division is now owned by <a href="CBS%20Television%20Studios">CBS Television Studios</a>, and it has since founded a second <a href="Paramount%20Television">version of Paramount Television</a> under Viacom ownership.

<a href="William%20Wadsworth%20Hodkinson">William Wadsworth Hodkinson</a> founded American film corporation <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> in 1914. <a href="Famous%20Players-Lasky%20Corporation">Famous Players-Lasky Corporation</a> acquired the company in 1916 and by the 1920s Paramount became a key player in <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>. The company founded or acquired many film production and exhibition properties; among these were the 2,000-screen theater chain <a href="United%20Paramount%20Theatres">United Paramount Theatres</a> (UPT), newsreel service <a href="Paramount%20News">Paramount News</a>, the <a href="Famous%20Players">Famous Players</a> theater chain in Canada and animation studio <a href="Famous%20Studios">Famous Studios</a>. The company became one of the "<a href="Big%20Five%20%28movie%20studios%29%23The%20majors%20during%20the%20Golden%20Age">big five</a>" Hollywood studios. By the 1940s, however, Paramount was the target of several <a href="antitrust">anti-trust</a> lawsuits by the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government</a>, culminating with "<a href="U.S.%20vs.%20Paramount%20Pictures%2C%20et%20al.">U.S. vs. Paramount Pictures, et al.</a>" (1948), which found that Paramount and other studios conducted monopolistic practices. Due to this Supreme Court decision, the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) forced Paramount to sell off its theater division in 1949.

As early as 1937, executives at Paramount Pictures were interested in the <a href="History%20of%20television%23United%20States">new medium of television</a>. The following year, Paramount purchased a minority interest in <a href="DuMont%20Laboratories">DuMont Laboratories</a>, a pioneer in early television technology founded by Dr. <a href="Allen%20B.%20DuMont">Allen B. DuMont</a>. Relations between Paramount and DuMont staff were strained by 1940, when Paramount, without DuMont, opened Chicago television station <a href="WBBM-TV">WBKB</a> and Los Angeles station <a href="KTLA">KTLA</a>. Dr. DuMont claimed that the original 1937 acquisition proposal required that Paramount would expand its television interests "through DuMont". Paramount representative Paul Raibourn denied that any such restriction was ever discussed (a 1953 examination of the original draft document vindicated DuMont on this point). The stock in DuMont, coupled with the Chicago and Los Angeles stations, gave Paramount full or partial ownership of four of the first nine television stations in the United States.

DuMont Laboratories launched the <a href="DuMont%20Television%20Network">DuMont Television Network</a> in 1946. Despite Paramount's partial ownership of DuMont, Paramount's two stations never aired television programs from DuMont's television network (with the exception of KTLA, which ran DuMont programs for one year from 1947 to 1948), and competed against DuMont's affiliates in Los Angeles and Chicago. According to authors Auter and Boyd, Paramount's construction of KTLA and WBKB and its subsequent launch of the Paramount Television Network "undercut" DuMont, a company it had invested in.

KTLA began commercial broadcasts on January 22, 1947; its first evening broadcast was hosted by <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and featured <a href="Kirk%20Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, <a href="William%20Bendix">William Bendix</a>, <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a>, <a href="William%20Demarest">William Demarest</a>, <a href="Ray%20Milland">Ray Milland</a> and <a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a>. KTLA was the first commercial television station to sign on west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. Although other Los Angeles television stations operated experimentally and eventually received commercial licenses, KTLA had a head start as the first commercially-licensed station in Los Angeles. The revenue stream from commercials helped to fund more professional programming, therefore generating a large viewership; a 1949 audience estimate from the <a href="C.%20E.%20Hooper">C. E. Hooper</a> company indicated that KTLA was broadcasting 28 of the top 30 television series in Los Angeles. The popularity of KTLA's local programs opened up the possibility that they would become national hits if released to other stations across the country.

Paramount's television division, Television Productions, Inc., created the Paramount Television Network in 1948. A full-page advertisement announcing the newly created network, with KTLA as the <a href="flagship%20%28broadcasting%29">flagship station</a>, ran in "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" on May 22 of that year. Filming of programs took place at KTLA; a <a href="coaxial%20cable">coaxial cable</a> link between KTLA and <a href="KFMB-TV">KFMB-TV</a> in San Diego transmitted a live signal to San Diego viewers. Other television stations across the United States received Paramount programs via <a href="kinescope">kinescope</a> recording for airing; these filmed series allowed stations to "fill in" their schedules during hours when <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> and DuMont were not broadcasting shows, or when station managers preferred Paramount's filmed offerings to those of the four networks. Station managers at WBKB-TV in Chicago also had plans to distribute their own kinescoped programs.

Paramount management planned to acquire additional <a href="owned-and-operated%20station">owned-and-operated station</a>s ("O&Os"); the company applied to the FCC for additional stations in San Francisco, Detroit and Boston. Officials at the FCC, however, denied Paramount's applications. A few years earlier, the federal regulator had placed a five-station cap on all television networks: no network was allowed to own more than five <a href="Very%20high%20frequency">VHF</a> television stations. Paramount was hampered by its minority stake in the DuMont Television Network. Although both DuMont and Paramount executives stated that the companies were separate, the FCC ruled that Paramount's partial ownership of DuMont meant that DuMont and Paramount were in theory branches of the same company. Since DuMont owned three television stations and Paramount owned two, the federal agency ruled neither network could acquire additional television stations. The FCC requested that Paramount relinquish its stake in DuMont, but Paramount refused. According to television historian William Boddy, "Paramount's checkered anti-trust history" helped convince the FCC that Paramount controlled DuMont. Both television networks suffered as a result, with neither company being able to acquire five O&Os. Meanwhile, CBS, ABC and NBC had each acquired the maximum of five stations by the mid-1950s.

Author Timothy White has called Paramount's efforts to launch its own television service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – Paramount in effect was competing with itself. The resulting ill feelings between Paramount's and DuMont's executives continued to escalate throughout the early 1950s, and the lack of cooperation hindered both entities' network plans. According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense of cooperation between Paramount and DuMont was gone.

The Paramount Television Network aired several television series during its years of operations. The following is a partial list:

Various press releases indicated that other KTLA series would be offered on the network. There is no indication, however, that the following series aired outside Los Angeles:

<a href="Paul%20Raibourn">Paul Raibourn</a> served as the president of Paramount Television Productions. Raibourn was also appointed vice president of Paramount Pictures Corporation, and, due to Paramount's minority interest in DuMont, was installed as treasurer of the DuMont Television Network. This appointment created another point of conflict between Paramount and DuMont. According to <a href="Leonard%20Goldenson">Leonard Goldenson</a>, president of ABC during this era, Raibourn "constantly nitpicked and needled [Allen DuMont] over the smallest expenditures. DuMont came to the point where, psychologically, he thought he couldn't do anything without Raibourn's approval." Raibourn trimmed DuMont's budgets at a time when the network should have been expanding. Goldenson credits Raibourn as one of the reasons ABC eventually became a successful, established television network while the DuMont network failed: "the name of the television game is programs. If you won't put money into programs, you won't succeed."

<a href="Klaus%20Landsberg">Klaus Landsberg</a>, a German immigrant, produced many Paramount Television Network series; he also served as one of the company's vice presidents and as KTLA's <a href="general%20manager">general manager</a>. Other Paramount executives included George T. Shupert, Paramount Television Productions' program sales executive; Burt Balaban, programming executive; John Howell, sales executive; and Bernard Goodwin, a director and vice president of Paramount Television Productions.

During the 1940s and 1950s, television networks in the United States were restricted to owning no more than five local VHF television stations. This system, which evolved from similar FCC regulations governing radio, resulted in executives of television networks forming alliances with local station owners in order to air network programs across the U.S. These alliances were codified in network affiliation contracts; Paramount Television Network staff required affiliate station managers to sign a network contract even if the station only aired one Paramount program. At its peak in late 1950, the Paramount Television Network was distributing five television series a week to over 40 affiliated television stations. Most Paramount stations were in the United States, but at least two were <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> stations.

During this era, American television programs were either broadcast live to local television stations via <a href="microwave%20relay">microwave relay</a> and <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation">AT&T</a>'s coaxial cable service or were recorded on kinescope and delivered through the mail to local stations. The live broadcast method was expensive, but was preferred by executives at each of the four major U.S. television networks (ABC, NBC, CBS and DuMont); in 1954, DuMont alone spent $3 million on live television broadcasts. The major networks sent kinescopes to stations when live transmissions were not possible. "Film networks", which sent out only prerecorded material, also existed; kinescopes were cheap to produce and cost little to mail. Paramount's television service was a hybrid of the two systems, with a live connection between KTLA and KFMB-TV in San Diego, and other affiliates broadcasting programs from kinescope recordings. Paramount executives considered a live connection between Los Angeles and San Francisco too expensive. Uniquely, Paramount's "The Harry Owens Show" was broadcast live in Los Angeles and San Francisco by having the program's performers and crew commute via airplane between the two stations for sequential performances.

The table below lists stations that carried Paramount Television Network programs, including the company's two owned-and-operated stations, KTLA and WBKB. DuMont's three VHF stations, WABD, WTTG and WDTV, which aired little or no Paramount programming but which the FCC ruled were O&Os of the same entity, also appear in this list. Also included are DuMont's two short-lived <a href="Ultra%20high%20frequency">UHF</a> licenses: KCTY-TV – which only operated for a few months, and WHK-TV – which never signed on. A number of stations carried "Armchair Detective", "Sandy Dreams" and "Frosty Frolics" when those programs aired on CBS and ABC. Stations that aired those programs as part of an ABC or CBS affiliation are not shown in the table below.

In May 1951, ABC chairman <a href="Edward%20J.%20Noble">Edward J. Noble</a> and United Paramount Theatres president Leonard Goldenson announced a proposed merger between their companies. The plan was to merge ABC and its five television stations with United Paramount Theatres, a company only recently spun off from Paramount Pictures. UPT also owned the network's Chicago station, WBKB; that station would have to be sold in order for the merged company to stay under the five-station cap. Because the proposed merger involved the sale of a television station, it required the approval of the FCC, which opened a hearing on the issue that August. The proposed deal was complex, and would affect many parties involved in television broadcasting, including Paramount, DuMont, and CBS (CBS executives wanted to purchase WBKB). During the hearing, Allen DuMont asked the FCC to force Paramount to sell its share of the DuMont Network. He stated that Paramount in effect owned two television networks, the PTN and DuMont; the FCC had similarly forced NBC to sell off one of its two radio networks eight years earlier due to concerns about multi-network ownership. Paramount executives, however, denied ever having operated a television network. Evidence presented against Paramount included network affiliation contracts and advertisements for the Paramount Television Network from 1951. Despite Paramount executives' testimony, advertisements for the Paramount Television Network ran as late as 1952.

After a grueling 18-month trial, the federal agency allowed the ABC-UPT merger, but never ruled on Paramount's partial ownership of a second network; Paramount was allowed to retain its shares in DuMont. Leo Resnick, hearing examiner for the Commission, concluded that Paramount did not control DuMont, but the FCC rejected this portion of Resnick's findings, restricting Paramount and DuMont to a total of five stations. The commissioners had not forgotten Paramount's previous anti-trust violations, and believed Paramount executives were attempting to control television by operating two television networks. According to White, the FCC's ruling "ensured that television broadcasting would be controlled by the same three companies that had dominated radio broadcasting, thus fostering a lack of diversity in both station and network ownership".

The February 1953 merger of ABC and United Paramount Theatres lead to the divestiture of WBKB (now <a href="WBBM-TV">WBBM-TV</a>), which was sold to CBS. Paramount retained KTLA and applied to the FCC for a new station in Boston, but the construction permit was never granted. By this time, Paramount's television arm was called Paramount TV Productions, Incorporated; Paramount ceased using the PTN name. The company continued to distribute programs nationally, however, and continued to sign network affiliation agreements with local television stations.

With just one owned-and-operated station, Paramount's program service never gelled into a true television network; television historians such as Alex McNeil (1996) consider Paramount programs <a href="broadcast%20syndication">syndicated</a> rather than network series. While the Paramount series "Hollywood Wrestling" and "Time For Beany" were widely seen on stations across the United States, most other Paramount television programs aired in only a handful of markets (another exception, "Hollywood Reel", aired in fourteen major cities in 1950).

Paramount's revenues were much smaller than those of a true television network, and gradually Paramount began losing program sponsors or ended production on formerly-popular television series. American Vitamin Corporation, Paramount's sponsor for both "The Spade Cooley Show" and "Frosty Frolics", pulled its $25,000 weekly sponsorship in October 1951. In June 1953, it was announced that "Time For Beany" and Paramount Television Productions were "calling it a day". Paramount ended production of its flagship series in October 1953; rival Los Angeles station <a href="KTTV">KTTV</a> and independent distributor Consolidated Television respectively took over production and distribution of "Time For Beany". Independent distributor Cinema-Vue took over "Hollywood Wrestling". By late 1955, "Billboard" reported the Paramount Network consisted of just 15 stations airing "Bandstand Revue". "Billboard" called this a "sort of" network. Management changes at KTLA, coupled with low local ratings, caused the cancellation of "Bandstand Revue" in October 1956. Klaus Landsberg, who had produced many of the series for KTLA, died in September 1956 and the new station manager made what "Billboard" called "sweeping changes" at the station.

By the autumn of 1955, Hollywood insiders were predicting that Paramount would launch a major television network using KTLA and the DuMont stations as charters. Articles reported that Paramount was seeking television scripts, and was constructing theaters and studios that rivaled those of ABC, CBS and NBC. In a dramatic move, Paramount's board of directors seized control of DuMont Laboratories in a <a href="boardroom%20coup">boardroom coup</a> in August 1955. Paramount executives replaced DuMont's board of directors, Dr. DuMont was removed as president of the company, and DuMont Network operations ceased the following year. However, no combined Paramount-DuMont network ever materialized; according to television historian Timothy White, by this time "a television network was no longer among Paramount's plans for exploitation of the small screen"; some of the primary and secondary affiliates, and even some of the programming of both networks, migrated to the emerging, similarly loosely-scheduled <a href="NTA%20Film%20Network">NTA Film Network</a>. Paramount sold its interest in DuMont (by this time renamed as the "Metropolitan Broadcasting Company") in 1959; the sale ended Paramount's first ventures into network television.

Despite Paramount's failure to build a national broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, and executives at Paramount continued to toy with the idea of entering the television medium once more. Paramount sold its library of shorts and cartoons in separate deals to <a href="U.M.%20%26amp%3B%20M.%20TV%20Corporation">U.M. & M. TV Corporation</a>, <a href="Associated%20Artists%20Productions">Associated Artists Productions</a> and <a href="Harvey%20Comics">Harvey Comics</a> (the "<a href="Superman%20%281940s%20cartoons%29">Superman</a>" cartoons were already sold to <a href="DC%20Comics">National Comics</a> when Paramount's license to "Superman" expired). In 1957, Paramount sold most of its pre-1950 sound live action feature film library to <a href="EMKA%2C%20Ltd.">EMKA, Ltd.</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="MCA%20Inc.">MCA</a>. The live action films would end up with what became <a href="Universal%20Television">Universal Television</a> after MCA bought Universal Pictures in 1962. KTLA was eventually sold to Golden West Broadcasters, a company owned by actor and singer <a href="Gene%20Autry">Gene Autry</a>, for $12 million in 1964.

After acquiring <a href="Desilu%20Productions">Desilu Productions</a> in 1967, the company continued to <a href="Paramount%20Television">produce series</a> for the <a href="Big%20Three%20television%20networks">"big three" broadcast networks</a>. Among them were "<a href="Here%27s%20Lucy">Here's Lucy</a>", "" and "<a href="Mannix">Mannix</a>" for CBS; "<a href="The%20Brady%20Bunch">The Brady Bunch</a>", "<a href="The%20Odd%20Couple%20%281970%20TV%20series%29">The Odd Couple</a>" and "<a href="Happy%20Days">Happy Days</a>" for ABC; and (in later years) "<a href="Family%20Ties">Family Ties</a>" and "<a href="Cheers">Cheers</a>" for NBC.

In 1978, Paramount CEO <a href="Barry%20Diller">Barry Diller</a> planned to launch the <a href="Paramount%20Television%20Service">Paramount Television Service</a>, a new "<a href="fourth%20television%20network">fourth television network</a>"; its programs would have aired only one night a week. 30 "<a href="television%20film">Movies of the Week</a>" would have followed "" on Saturday nights. This plan was aborted when head of <a href="Gulf%20and%20Western%20Industries">Gulf and Western Industries</a> (Paramount's parent company at the time), Charles Bluhdorn, canceled the project for fear of bleeding money; as a result, Paramount made the decision to transform "Phase II" into "". Despite this failure, Diller would eventually launch a successful fourth network, when in late 1986, he joined the <a href="Rupert%20Murdoch">Rupert Murdoch</a>-owned <a href="News%20Corporation">News Corporation</a> to create the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network, which went on to be one of the most successful networks in the country.

In the 1980s, Paramount became increasingly involved with original syndicated programming in the U.S., with such successful series being "<a href="Entertainment%20Tonight">Entertainment Tonight</a>", "", "" and "<a href="The%20Arsenio%20Hall%20Show">The Arsenio Hall Show</a>", all of which were among the most popular syndicated series broadcast during that decade; with the continuing success of the "Star Trek" franchise (notably, "") and the purchase of television station owner <a href="TVX%20Broadcast%20Group">TVX Broadcast Group</a> (which owned <a href="independent%20station%20%28North%20America%29">independent stations</a> in several large and mid-sized markets), the groundwork for a new network venture was laid.

On January 16, 1995, Paramount launched a new broadcast television network, the <a href="UPN">United Paramount Network</a> (UPN), in a programming partnership with <a href="Chris-Craft%20Industries">Chris-Craft Industries</a>; <a href="Viacom%20%28original%29">Viacom</a> (which acquired Paramount Pictures and its related holdings in 1994) would acquire 50% interest in the network in 1996 and acquire Chris-Craft's remaining stake in 2000. During its 11-year existence, UPN never made a profit; "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" reported that the network had lost $800 million during its first five years of operation. UPN ceased operations in September 2006, when it merged with the <a href="The%20WB">WB Television Network</a> to form <a href="The%20CW">The CW Television Network</a>.

The Four Stages of Cruelty

The Four Stages of Cruelty is a series of four printed <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s published by English artist <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> in 1751. Each print depicts a different stage in the life of the fictional Tom Nero.

Beginning with the <a href="cruelty%20to%20animals">torture of a dog</a> as a child in the "First stage of cruelty", Nero progresses to beating his horse as a man in the "Second stage of cruelty", and then to robbery, <a href="seduction">seduction</a>, and murder in "Cruelty in perfection". Finally, in "The reward of cruelty", he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who start down the path Nero has followed: his body is taken from the <a href="gallows">gallows</a> after his execution as a murderer and is mutilated by <a href="surgery">surgeon</a>s in the <a href="anatomical%20theatre">anatomical theatre</a>.

The prints were intended as a form of <a href="morality">moral</a> instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the <a href="working%20class">lower classes</a>. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth.

In common with other prints by Hogarth, such as <a href="Beer%20Street%20and%20Gin%20Lane">"Beer Street" and "Gin Lane"</a>, "The Four Stages of Cruelty" was issued as a warning against immoral behaviour, showing the easy path from childish thug to convicted criminal. His aim was to correct "that barbarous treatment of animals, the very sight of which renders the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling mind". Hogarth loved animals, picturing himself with his <a href="pug">pug</a> in a self-portrait, and marking the graves of his dogs and birds at his home in <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a>.

Hogarth deliberately portrayed the subjects of the engravings with little subtlety since he meant the prints to be understood by "men of the lowest rank" when seen on the walls of workshops or <a href="tavern">tavern</a>s. The images themselves, as with "Beer Street" and "Gin Lane", were roughly drawn, lacking the finer lines of some of his other works. Fine engraving and delicate artwork would have rendered the prints too expensive for the intended audience, and Hogarth also believed a bold stroke could portray the passions of the subjects just as well as fine lines, noting that "neither great correctness of drawing or fine engraving were at all necessary".

To ensure that the prints were priced within reach of the intended audience, Hogarth originally commissioned the block-cutter J. Bell to produce the four designs as <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s. This proved more expensive than expected, so only the last two of the four images were cut and were not issued commercially at the time. Instead, Hogarth proceeded to create the engravings himself and announced the publication of the prints, along with that of "Beer Street" and "Gin Lane", in the "<a href="London%20Evening%20Post">London Evening Post</a>" over three days from 14–16 February 1751. The prints themselves were published on 21 February 1751 and each was accompanied by a moralising commentary, written by the Rev. <a href="James%20Townley">James Townley</a>, a friend of Hogarth's. As with earlier engravings, such as "<a href="Industry%20and%20Idleness">Industry and Idleness</a>", individual prints were sold on "ordinary" paper for "1s." (one <a href="shilling">shilling</a>, equating to about £  in 2019 terms), cheap enough to be purchased by the lower classes as a means of moral instruction. "Fine" versions were also available on "superior" paper for "1s. 6d." (one shilling and <a href="Sixpence%20%28British%20coin%29">sixpence</a>, about £  in 2019 terms) for collectors.

Variations on plates III and IV exist from Bell's original woodcuts, bearing the earlier date of 1 January 1750, and were reprinted in 1790 by <a href="John%20Boydell">John Boydell</a>, but examples from either of the woodcut printings are uncommon.

In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero, whose surname may have been inspired by the <a href="Nero">Roman Emperor of the same name</a> or a <a href="contraction%20%28grammar%29">contraction</a> of "No hero". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's <a href="rectum">rectum</a>, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in <a href="Jacques%20Callot">Jacques Callot</a>'s "Temptation of St. Anthony". An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the <a href="charity%20school">charity school</a> of the parish of <a href="St%20Giles%2C%20London">St Giles</a>. Hogarth used this notorious <a href="slum">slum</a> area as the background for many of his works including "Gin Lane" and "Noon", part of the "<a href="Four%20Times%20of%20the%20Day">Four Times of the Day</a>" series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. This boy supposedly represents a young <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a>. His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture, made clear in the text at the bottom of the scene:
The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts: the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the <a href="link-boy">link-boy</a>'s torch; the boys in the foreground are <a href="cock%20throwing">throwing at a cock</a> (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the <a href="Early%20Modern%20France">French</a>, and a suggestion that the action takes place on <a href="Shrove%20Tuesday">Shrove Tuesday</a>, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat, with the latter's <a href="intestine">intestine</a>s spilling out onto the ground; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two <a href="wikt%3Abladder">bladders</a> is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a> that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.

Below the text the authorship is established: "Designed by W. Hogarth, Published according to Act of Parliament. 1 Feb.. 1751" The <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> referred to is the <a href="Engraving%20Copyright%20Act%201734">Engraving Copyright Act 1734</a>. Many of Hogarth's earlier works had been reproduced in great numbers without his authority or any payment of <a href="royalties">royalties</a>, and he was keen to protect his artistic property, so had encouraged his friends in <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> to pass a law to protect the rights of engravers. Hogarth had been so instrumental in pushing the Bill through Parliament that on passing it became known as the "Hogarth Act".

In the second plate, the scene is <a href="Thavies%20Inn">Thavies Inn</a> Gate (sometimes ironically written as Thieves Inn Gate), one of the <a href="Inns%20of%20Chancery">Inns of Chancery</a> which housed associations of lawyers in London. Tom Nero has grown up and become a <a href="hackney%20carriage">hackney</a> <a href="coachman">coachman</a>, and the recreational cruelty of the schoolboy has turned into the professional cruelty of a man at work. Tom's horse, worn out from years of mistreatment and overloading, has collapsed, breaking its leg and upsetting the carriage. Disregarding the animal's pain, Tom has beaten it so furiously that he has put its eye out. In a satirical aside, Hogarth shows four corpulent <a href="barrister">barrister</a>s struggling to climb out of the carriage in a ludicrous state. They are probably <a href="caricature">caricature</a>s of eminent jurists, but Hogarth did not reveal the subjects' names, and they have not been identified. Elsewhere in the scene, other acts of cruelty against animals take place: a <a href="drover%20%28Britain%29">drover</a> beats a <a href="domestic%20sheep">lamb</a> to death, an <a href="donkey">ass</a> is driven on by force despite being overloaded, and an <a href="bull-baiting">enraged bull</a> tosses one of its tormentors. Some of these acts are recounted in the moral accompanying the print:
The cruelty has also advanced to include abuse of people. A <a href="Wagon">dray</a> crushes a playing boy while the <a href="drayman">drayman</a> sleeps, oblivious to the boy's injury and the beer spilling from his barrels. Posters in the background advertise a <a href="cockfight">cockfight</a> and a <a href="boxing">boxing</a> match as further evidence of the brutal entertainments favoured by the subjects of the image. The boxing match is to take place at Broughton's Amphitheatre, a notoriously tough venue established by the "father of pugilism", <a href="Jack%20Broughton">Jack Broughton</a>: a contemporary bill records that the contestants would fight with their left leg strapped to the floor, with the one with the fewest bleeding wounds being adjudged the victor. One of the advertised participants in the boxing match is <a href="James%20Field%20%28criminal%29">James Field</a>, who was hanged two weeks before the prints were issued and features again in the final image of the series; the other participant is <a href="George%20Taylor%20%28boxer%29">George "the Barber" Taylor</a>, who had been champion of England but was defeated by Broughton and retired in 1750. On Taylor's death in 1757, Hogarth produced a number of sketches of him wrestling Death, probably for his tomb.

According to Werner Busch, the composition alludes to Rembrandt's painting, "Balaam's Ass" (1626).

In an echo of the first plate, there is but one person who shows concern for the welfare of the tormented horse. To the left of Nero, and almost unseen, a man notes down Nero's hackney coach number to report him.

By the time of the third plate, Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder. Having encouraged his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and <a href="index%20finger">index finger</a> are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words "God's Revenge against Murder" written on a book that, along with the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>", has fallen from the box. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of <a href="pocket%20watch">pocket watch</a>es—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in "<a href="Industry%20and%20Idleness">Industry and Idleness</a>"), and a letter from Ann Gill which reads:

The spelling is perfect and while this is perhaps unrealistic, Hogarth deliberately avoids any chance of the scene becoming comical. A discarded envelope is addressed "To Tho Nero at Pinne...". <a href="Ronald%20Paulson">Ronald Paulson</a> sees a parallel between the lamb beaten to death in the "Second Stage" and the defenceless girl murdered here. Below the print, the text claims that Nero, if not repentant, is at least stunned by his actions:

Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in a graveyard, said to be <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20London">St Pancras</a> but suggested by <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28biographer%29">John Ireland</a> to resemble <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>; an <a href="owl">owl</a> and a <a href="bat">bat</a> fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one for the end of the <a href="witching%20hour%20%28supernatural%29">witching hour</a>. The composition of the image may allude to <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>'s "The Arrest of Christ". A lone <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Good%20Samaritan">Good Samaritan</a> appears again: among the snarling faces of Tom's accusers, a single face looks to the heavens in pity.

In the alternative image for this stage, produced as a woodcut by Bell, Tom is shown with his hands free. There are also differences in the wording of the letter and some items, like the lantern and books, are larger and simpler while others, such as the man to the left of Tom and the <a href="topiary">topiary</a> bush, have been removed. The owl has become a winged <a href="hourglass">hourglass</a> on the clock tower.

Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been <a href="hanging">hanged</a> and his body taken for the ignominious process of <a href="public%20dissection">public dissection</a>. The year after the prints were issued, the <a href="Murder%20Act%201752">Murder Act 1752</a> would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be "dissected and anatomised". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could.

A <a href="tattoo">tattoo</a> on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in "Cruelty in Perfection", in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.

While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the <a href="square%20academic%20cap">mortar-boarded</a> academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves. The president has been identified as <a href="John%20Freke%20%28surgeon%29">John Freke</a>, president of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> at the time. Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter <a href="Bosavern%20Penlez">Bosavern Penlez</a> for dissection in 1749.
Aside from the over-enthusiastic dissection of the body and the boiling of the bones "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>", the image portrays the procedure as it would have been carried out.

Two skeletons to the rear left and right of the print are labelled as <a href="James%20Field%20%28criminal%29">James Field</a>, a well-known boxer who also featured on a poster in the second plate, and <a href="James%20MacLaine">Macleane</a>, an infamous <a href="highwayman">highwayman</a>. Both men were hanged shortly before the print was published (Macleane in 1750 and Field in 1751). The skeletons seemingly point to one another. Field's name above the skeleton on the left may have been a last minute substitution for "GENTL HARRY" referring to <a href="Henry%20Simms">Henry Simms</a>, also known as Young Gentleman Harry. Simms was a robber who was executed in 1747. The motif of the lone "good man" is carried through to this final plate, where one of the academics points at the skeleton of James Field, indicating the inevitable outcome for those who start down the path of cruelty.
The composition of the scene is a <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of the frontispiece of <a href="Vesalius">Andreas Vesalius</a>'s "<a href="De%20humani%20corporis%20fabrica">De humani corporis fabrica</a>", and it possibly also borrows from "Quack Physicians' Hall" (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist <a href="Egbert%20van%20Heemskerck">Egbert van Heemskerck</a>, who had lived in England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 "<a href="Fasciculus%20medicinae">Fasciculo di medicina</a>" by <a href="Johannes%20de%20Ketham">Johannes de Ketham</a> which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.

Below the print are these final words:

Hogarth was pleased with the results. "<a href="European%20Magazine">European Magazine</a>" reported that he commented to a bookseller from <a href="Cornhill%2C%20London">Cornhill</a> (a Mr. Sewell):

In his unfinished "Apology for Painters" he commented further:

In his 1817 book "Shakespeare and His Times", <a href="Nathan%20Drake%20%28essayist%20and%20physician%29">Nathan Drake</a> credits the representation of "throwing at cocks" in the first plate for changing public opinion about the practice, which was common at the time, and prompting magistrates to take a harder line on offenders. In his "Lectures on Ethics" <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> refers to the engravings as an example of how cruelty towards animals leads indirectly to failing duties towards humans as Hogarth "brings home to us the terrible rewards of cruelty, and this should be an impressive lesson to children."
Others found the series less to their liking. <a href="Charles%20Lamb%20%28writer%29">Charles Lamb</a> dismissed the series as mere caricature, not worthy to be included alongside Hogarth's other work, but rather something produced as the result of a "wayward humour" outside of his normal habits. Art historian <a href="Allan%20Cunningham%20%28author%29">Allan Cunningham</a> also had strong feelings about the series:

The <a href="Anatomy%20Act%201832">Anatomy Act 1832</a> ended the dissection of murderers, and most of the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the <a href="Cruelty%20to%20Animals%20Act%201835">Cruelty to Animals Act 1835</a>, so by the 1850s "The Four Stages of Cruelty" had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience.


a. A pair of impressions from Bell's original printing were acquired for £1600 by the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a>'s <a href="Hunterian%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery</a> in 2005.

b. There is some confusion over the date of George "The Barber" Taylor's career and death. In his earlier work Paulson puts him as a pupil of Broughton, killed in a fight with him in 1750, and the Tate Gallery dates Hogarth's sketches to c. 1750. In "Hogarth's "Harlot"", he states that Taylor retired in 1750 but came out of retirement in 1757 for a final fight in which he was badly beaten, dying from his injuries several months later. Most records date Taylor's championship to the middle 1730s.

c. The initials on the box are normally read as A. G. for Ann Gill, but the G resembles a D, suggesting the box too may have been stolen.

d. John Ireland identifies the president as "Mr Frieake, the master of Nourse, to whom <a href="Percival%20Pott">Mr Potts</a> was a pupil". Since Ireland identifies him as the master of Nourse, he undoubtedly means John Freke, an acquaintance of Hogarth's and surgeon at <a href="St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Hospital">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> from 1729–1755 and a Governor 1736–1756. The dissection could be taking place at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where all three surgeons were based, but it also has features of the Cutlerian Theatre of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">Royal College of Physicians</a> near <a href="Newgate">Newgate</a> (particularly the throne, which bears their arms, and its curved wall resembling a <a href="Cockfight">cockpit</a>) and the niches of the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Barbers">Barber-Surgeons' Hall</a> (which was not used for dissection after the surgeons split away to form the <a href="Company%20of%20Surgeons">Company of Surgeons</a> in 1745).

1956 FA Cup Final

The 1956 FA Cup Final was the final match of the <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20FA%20Cup">1955–56 staging</a> of English <a href="association%20football">football</a>'s primary <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">cup competition</a>, the Football Association Challenge Cup, better known as the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>. The showpiece event was contested between <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> and <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in London on Saturday 5 May 1956. Two-time winners Manchester City were appearing in their sixth final, whereas Birmingham City were seeking to win the competition for the first time, having lost their only previous <a href="1931%20FA%20Cup%20Final">final in 1931</a>.

Each club needed to win five matches to reach the final. Manchester City's victories were close affairs, each settled by the odd goal, and they needed a replay to defeat fifth-round opponents <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. Birmingham City made more comfortable progress: they scored eighteen goals while conceding only two, and won each match at the first attempt despite being drawn to play on their opponents' ground in every round. They became the first team to reach an FA Cup final without playing at home.

Birmingham City entered the match as favourites, in a contest billed as a contrast of styles. Watched by a crowd of 100,000 and a television audience of five million, Manchester City took an early lead through <a href="Joe%20Hayes%20%28footballer%29">Joe Hayes</a>, but <a href="Noel%20Kinsey">Noel Kinsey</a> equalised midway through the first half. Second half goals from <a href="Jack%20Dyson">Jack Dyson</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Johnstone">Bobby Johnstone</a> gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory. The match is best remembered for the heroics of Manchester City goalkeeper, <a href="Bert%20Trautmann">Bert Trautmann</a>, who continued playing despite breaking a bone in his neck in a collision with Birmingham City's <a href="Peter%20Murphy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201922%29">Peter Murphy</a>.

As both Birmingham City and Manchester City were <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> clubs, they entered the competition in the third round. Manchester City's cup run started with a home tie against <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a>. The visitors took the lead after only 10 seconds (their fastest goal ever), but midway through the match, fog enveloped <a href="Maine%20Road">Maine Road</a>. The match was abandoned during the second half, immediately after City had scored an equalising goal, and replayed the following Wednesday; City won 2–1. In the fourth round Manchester City faced <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a> at <a href="Roots%20Hall">Roots Hall</a>. The <a href="Essex">Essex</a> club's ground had only opened five months previously, and was suffering from drainage problems. Torrential rainfall meant that in the week before the match a trench was dug across the pitch, and sand added. Though Southend were a <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division</a> team, their familiarity with the uneven pitch meant the match was closely contested. Southend pressured the Manchester City goal, requiring <a href="Bert%20Trautmann">Bert Trautmann</a> to make several saves, but <a href="Joe%20Hayes%20%28footballer%29">Joe Hayes</a> scored the only goal of the game on a City counter-attack to earn a fifth-round tie against <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>.

In the fifth-round match, the teams saw out a 0–0 draw at Maine Road, and the match was replayed at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>. Goals from <a href="Jack%20Dyson">Jack Dyson</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Johnstone">Bobby Johnstone</a> gave Manchester City a 2–1 lead, but the game finished in controversial circumstances when the referee blew his whistle for full time as Liverpool's <a href="Billy%20Liddell">Billy Liddell</a> was bearing down on goal. Liddell put the ball in the net, but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already over. In the quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> at Maine Road. Trailing 1–0 at half-time after a <a href="Jimmy%20Harris%20%28footballer%29">Jimmy Harris</a> goal, City overcame the deficit in the second half with goals from Hayes and Johnstone. Further controversy followed in the semi-final against <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1–0 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward <a href="George%20Robb">George Robb</a>'s leg. No further goalscoring opportunities occurred, and City hung on for the victory.

Manager <a href="Arthur%20Turner%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201909%29">Arthur Turner</a> called on his team to match their Third Division opponents <a href="Torquay%20United%20F.C.">Torquay United</a> for fighting spirit and to produce a "90-minute performance". The players complied; leading 4–0 at half-time, they finished as comfortable 7–1 winners. In the fourth round, <a href="Leyton%20Orient%20F.C.">Leyton Orient</a>, who had beaten Birmingham at the same stage four years earlier, posed more of a potential problem. In reality the win was equally comfortable: <a href="Eddy%20Brown">Eddy Brown</a> added two goals to his <a href="hat-trick%23Association%20football">hat-trick</a> at Torquay. A tight <a href="local%20derby">local derby</a> game followed on a snow-covered frozen pitch at <a href="The%20Hawthorns">The Hawthorns</a>. In the first half, goalkeeper <a href="Gil%20Merrick">Gil Merrick</a> and his defence did well to keep <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> out; <a href="Trevor%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201936%29">Trevor Smith</a> had to clear a <a href="Ronnie%20Allen">Ronnie Allen</a> header from under the crossbar. In the second half, Birmingham wasted several chances before a <a href="Push%20and%20run">one-two</a> with Brown allowed <a href="Peter%20Murphy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201922%29">Peter Murphy</a> to score from the edge of the <a href="penalty%20area">penalty area</a>.

In the sixth round, Birmingham faced <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> on a muddy pitch. In order to relieve the tension on the way to important matches, manager Turner used to encourage the players to sing. <a href="Scotland">Scotsman</a> <a href="Alex%20Govan">Alex Govan</a>'s contribution, <a href="Harry%20Lauder">Harry Lauder</a>'s rousing "Keep right on to the end of the road", was adopted by his teammates. As the team coach approached <a href="Arsenal%20Stadium">Highbury</a> with the windows wound down, the fans joined in, continuing their rendition during the game. After first-half goals from <a href="Gordon%20Astall">Gordon Astall</a> and Murphy, Birmingham went 3–0 up through Brown with twenty minutes left. Two minutes later, Arsenal scored from , Birmingham were unsettled, and Merrick needed to make a fine save from <a href="Vic%20Groves">Vic Groves</a> to prevent a second Arsenal goal. Turner felt the motivation from such a powerful song played a significant part in the day's victory.

Semi-final opponents <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> found Birmingham without "hard-man" <a href="left-half">left-half</a> <a href="Roy%20Warhurst">Roy Warhurst</a>, who had injured a thigh against Arsenal, but in <a href="Jack%20Badham">Jack Badham</a> they had an effective replacement. The club's official history describes this as "probably the finest team performance against top class opposition ever produced" by a Birmingham team. They attacked from the kick-off and nullified Sunderland's pressure and the threat of <a href="Len%20Shackleton">Len Shackleton</a>. <a href="Noel%20Kinsey">Noel Kinsey</a> scored early and the second goal came from a passing move down the left side finished by Astall. As Sunderland threw everyone forward, which left them open at the back, Brown picked up a long through ball and lobbed the goalkeeper. Astall said afterwards that he was surprised they had not scored five, and Brown wrote in his newspaper column:

Now Sunderland found out how hard it is to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say to do justice to that brilliant goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to destroy it.

Birmingham City thus reached the final without playing a single tie at home, a feat which had never previously been accomplished.

The 1956 final was the second time that Birmingham had reached the showpiece match, having lost 2–1 to West Bromwich Albion in <a href="1931%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1931</a>. Manchester City were appearing in the final for the sixth time, and for the second consecutive year. They had won the cup twice previously (in <a href="1904%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1904</a> and <a href="1934%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1934</a>), and had been beaten in the final three times (in <a href="1926%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1926</a>, <a href="1933%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1933</a> and <a href="1955%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1955</a>). Though Birmingham had less pedigree in the competition, the press viewed them as favourites. The "<a href="Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" contrasted Birmingham's "dazzling Cup run" with the manner in which Manchester City "scraped through", describing the Midlanders as "firm favourites". Interviews with players were typically bullish in tone. Manchester City's Bobby Johnstone opined that "Even an unbiased fan must regard Manchester City with favour", whereas Birmingham's <a href="Len%20Boyd">Len Boyd</a> gauged opinion quite differently: "They say Birmingham City are the hottest Cup favourites since <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a> crashed to <a href="Portsmouth%20F.C.">Portsmouth</a> <a href="1939%20FA%20Cup%20Final">in 1939</a>".

During the 1950s the FA Cup final was the only football match to be televised nationally, resulting in heightened media attention for the players and clubs involved. The <a href="Players%27%20Union">Players' Union</a> successfully requested an additional £5 per man for appearing in a televised match, the first time such appearance money had been paid. Birmingham's players signed an exclusive contract with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> committing them to appear only on BBC programmes in the weeks leading up to the final, though their post-match celebration would be covered live by the regional commercial station <a href="Associated%20TeleVision">ATV</a>. The match itself attracted a television audience of five million, a high figure for the period.

Each club received 15,000 tickets for the final from <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a>. Birmingham distributed their share by ballot among those supporters who had followed the team in the earlier rounds of the competition; 22,000 had attended the semi-final, so many thousands were left disappointed. Of the remaining tickets, 4,640 were allocated to the FA, 40,640 to <a href="County%20Football%20Association">County Associations</a>, 20,090 to Football League clubs, 2,550 to FA members and 2,080 to the <a href="FA%20Council">FA Council</a> and stadium authorities. An enquiry into the <a href="black%20market">black market</a> held following the previous year's Cup Final meant ticket touts kept a lower profile than usual. However, in the week leading up to the game, the cheapest standing tickets, originally sold for <a href="%C2%A3sd">3s 6d</a>, were changing hands in Birmingham for twenty times face value, or 35% of a manual worker's weekly earnings.

Manchester City spent the week preceding the final at a training camp in <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>. Two days before the final <a href="Bert%20Trautmann">Bert Trautmann</a>, who had originally arrived in England as a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a>, was named <a href="FWA%20Footballer%20of%20the%20Year">Footballer of the Year</a>. Eight players who had played in the previous year's final were selected in the starting line-up. Press speculation in the run-up to the match pondered which of <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a> and Bobby Johnstone would be selected, as Johnstone had been suffering from a calf problem. <a href="Bill%20Leivers">Bill Leivers</a> was also an injury doubt due to a twisted ankle, and <a href="Billy%20Spurdle">Billy Spurdle</a> had a boil on his left arm lanced on the eve of the final. Consequently, the Manchester City line-up was not named until the morning of the match. Leivers was passed fit after having two pain-killing injections, but contrary to press expectations Spurdle missed out. This meant both Revie and Johnstone appeared in the line-up, Johnstone switching to <a href="outside%20right">outside right</a>.

Birmingham also had doubts over their selection. Captain Len Boyd had for some time been suffering from a debilitating back problem, and relied on injections to keep him playing. He missed five of the last seven games of the season, but was passed fit on the Wednesday before the game. Fellow <a href="wing%20half">wing half</a> Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle three weeks before the final, travelled on the Thursday with the rest of the team to their base in <a href="Twyford%2C%20Berkshire">Twyford, Berkshire</a>. <a href="Jeff%20Hall%20%28footballer%29">Jeff Hall</a> was struggling with a virus. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old <a href="Johnny%20Newman%20%28footballer%29">Johnny Newman</a> came in on the right.

<a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>ways laid on 38 special trains to take some 19,000 supporters to London, the first of which arrived at <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras station</a> from <a href="Manchester%20Central%20railway%20station">Manchester Central</a> shortly after 3 a.m. For the first time, the official <a href="event%20program">programmes</a> were on sale from early morning in an attempt to thwart sellers of unofficial versions. The "<a href="Birmingham%20Mail">Birmingham Mail</a>" set up a temporary <a href="Printing%20press">press</a> in a Wembley car park to produce a special edition of their <a href="Saturday%20sports%20paper">Saturday sports paper</a>, the "<a href="Sports%20Argus">Sports Argus</a>", on blue paper rather than the usual pink. As the teams prepared in the dressing rooms, the crowd was led in communal singing, including songs with resonance for each of the two teams, "She's a lassie from Lancashire" and "Keep right on to the end of the road", and the hymn "<a href="Abide%20with%20Me">Abide with Me</a>", traditionally sung before every FA Cup final. As the teams emerged from the tunnel, Manchester City captain <a href="Roy%20Paul">Roy Paul</a> seized one last opportunity to stir emotion within the players by stopping, raising his fist and shouting "If we don't fucking win, you'll get some of this".

Both teams employed the formation typical of the era: two <a href="Full%20back%20%28association%20football%29">full backs</a>, a <a href="centre%20half">centre half</a>, two <a href="wing%20half">wing halves</a>, two <a href="outside%20forward">outside forward</a>s, two <a href="inside%20forward">inside forward</a>s and a <a href="centre%20forward">centre forward</a>. However, their tactical approaches differed. Birmingham, described by "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as using "iron determination, powerful tackling and open direct methods", employed the traditional English approach of getting the ball to the outside-forwards as quickly as possible, whereas Manchester City adopted tactics inspired by the <a href="Magical%20Magyars">Hungarian team</a> which had <a href="England%20v%20Hungary%20%281953%29">soundly beaten England at Wembley</a> three years before. The system involved using <a href="Don%20Revie">Don Revie</a> in a deeper position than a traditional centre-forward in order to draw a defender out of position, and was therefore known as the "<a href="Revie%20Plan">Revie Plan</a>". As both teams' first-choice colours were blue, each team wore their change strip to prevent confusion. Manchester City therefore wore maroon, and Birmingham City wore white.

Birmingham won <a href="coin%20flipping">the toss</a> and Manchester City kicked off. The Birmingham goal came under pressure almost immediately. Within a minute a far post cross from <a href="Roy%20Clarke%20%28footballer%29">Roy Clarke</a> narrowly eluded Hayes. Two <a href="corner%20kick">corners</a> followed, the second resulting in a shot by Roy Paul. The next attack, in the third minute, resulted in the opening goal. Revie began the move, exchanging passes with Clarke, and back-heeling for the unmarked Hayes to sweep the ball past <a href="Gil%20Merrick">Gil Merrick</a> to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's confidence was shaken, resulting in a series of Manchester City corners and a chance for Hayes, but they fought back to equalise in the 15th minute. Astall slipped the ball to Brown, who helped it forward. It rebounded off a Manchester City defender into the path of <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Welsh international</a> inside‑forward <a href="Noel%20Kinsey">Noel Kinsey</a>, who fired home via Trautmann's far post. For the remainder of the first half Birmingham had most of the play, exerting pressure on Manchester City full-back Leivers, but were unable to make a breakthrough. Though Birmingham put the ball in the net twice, Brown was adjudged to be <a href="offside%20%28association%20football%29">offside</a> on both occasions. With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully fit, Birmingham's strength and balance was disrupted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City's unconventional style.

During the half-time interval, a row erupted between the Birmingham manager and some of his players about their fitness; in the Manchester City dressing room, a heated exchange took place between Barnes and Revie. Barnes had played defensively in the first half to counter the threat of <a href="Peter%20Murphy%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201922%29">Peter Murphy</a>, but Revie urged him to play further forward. Meanwhile, manager <a href="Les%20McDowall">Les McDowall</a> exhorted his players to keep possession and make their opponents chase the ball.

The period immediately after half‑time saw few chances, but then, after just over an hour's play, Manchester City regained their stride and suddenly went two goals ahead. A throw-in to Revie led to interplay on the right wing involving Barnes, Dyson, and Johnstone, resulting in a through-ball which put Dyson clear of the defence to score. Two minutes later, Trautmann collected the ball at the end of a Birmingham attack and kicked the ball long to Dyson, over the heads of the retreating Birmingham players. Dyson flicked the ball on to <a href="Bobby%20Johnstone">Bobby Johnstone</a>, who scored Manchester City's third, becoming the first player ever to score in consecutive Wembley finals in the process.
With 17 minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced <a href="Dave%20Ewing">Dave Ewing</a>. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at the feet of Murphy to win the ball, but in the collision Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No <a href="substitute%20%28football%29">substitutes</a> were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put <a href="Roy%20Little">Roy Little</a> in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.

No further goals were scored, and the referee blew for full time with the final score 3–1 to Manchester City. As the players left the field, the crowd sang a chorus of "For he's a jolly good fellow" in tribute to Trautmann's bravery. Roy Paul led his team up the steps to the royal box to receive Manchester City's third FA Cup. Trautmann's neck continued to cause him pain, and the <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a> commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal. Three days later, an examination revealed that Trautmann had broken a bone in his neck.

Trautmann attended the evening's post-match banquet (where <a href="Alma%20Cogan">Alma Cogan</a> sang to the players) despite being unable to move his head, and went to bed expecting his injury to heal with rest. As the pain did not recede, the following day he went to <a href="St%20George%27s%20Hospital">St George's Hospital</a>, where he was told he merely had a crick in his neck which would go away. Three days later, he got a <a href="second%20opinion%20%28medicine%29">second opinion</a> from a doctor at <a href="Manchester%20Royal%20Infirmary">Manchester Royal Infirmary</a>. An <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> revealed he had dislocated five <a href="vertebrae">vertebrae</a> in his neck, the second of which was cracked in two. The third vertebra had wedged against the second, preventing further damage which could have cost Trautmann his life.

When Manchester City's train from London reached Manchester, the team were greeted by cameras from <a href="Granada%20TV">Granada TV</a> and an open-top bus. They embarked on a journey from <a href="Manchester%20Piccadilly%20Station">London Road station</a> to the town hall in <a href="Albert%20Square%2C%20Manchester">Albert Square</a>, taking a route along some of Manchester's main shopping streets. The size and spirit of the crowds led the "<a href="Manchester%20Evening%20Chronicle">Manchester Evening Chronicle</a>" to make comparisons with <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">VE Day</a>. The boisterousness of the crowds in Albert Square meant the <a href="Lord%20Mayor">Lord Mayor</a> struggled to make his speech heard above chants of "We want Bert". After the civic reception at the Town Hall and a banquet at a <a href="Piccadilly%20Gardens">Piccadilly</a> restaurant, the team returned to the open-top bus and headed to <a href="Belle%20Vue%20Zoo">Belle Vue Pleasure Gardens</a>, near the club's former home of <a href="Hyde%20Road%20Football%20Stadium">Hyde Road</a> in east Manchester, where the "Chronicle" held a function.

An estimated 10,000 people met the Birmingham City party on their return to <a href="Birmingham%20Snow%20Hill%20railway%20station">Snow Hill station</a>. The players, in the first of a convoy of four coaches, waved to the assembled crowds through the open sun-roof as they proceeded to the <a href="Council%20House%2C%20Birmingham">Council House</a>, where the Lord Mayor welcomed them on behalf of the city. Len Boyd addressed the crowds from the balcony before the coaches continued through the city centre and back to <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20%28stadium%29">St Andrew's</a>, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements. Guests included the 84-year-old <a href="Billy%20Walton">Billy Walton</a>, who had joined the club in 1888, six members of Birmingham's <a href="1931%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1931 cup final</a> team, and a trade delegation from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> city of <a href="Yekaterinburg">Sverdlovsk</a>.

Though the thousands gathered outside the Council House roared "No!" when Boyd said the team felt they had let the supporters down, there were recriminations concerning Birmingham's performance and team selection. The local press suggested that attempts to combat "Wembley nerves" had resulted in an "over-casual approach to the game". The row at half-time had done little for second-half morale, but speaking fifty years later, Gil Merrick placed the blame less on Boyd's questionable fitness than on a failure to discuss how to stop Revie. Alex Govan, convinced that "if Roy Warhurst had been fit then there would only have been one winner", blamed "bad team selection", saying that even without Warhurst he firmly believed "that if Badham had been in we would have won that game. He would never have given Don Revie the room to run the match." Warhurst himself thought the selection of Newman "meant the team had to adapt its style and in the end we used different tactics to those that had been successful all season".

Ivan Bagramyan

Ivan Khristoforovich Bagramyan (; ), also known as Hovhannes Khachaturi Baghramyan (; ) ( – 21 September 1982), was a <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> military commander and <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Marshal of the Soviet Union</a> of <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a> origin. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Bagramyan was the first non-<a href="Slavic%20people">Slavic</a> military officer to become a commander of a <a href="Front%20%28Soviet%20Army%29">Front</a>. He was among several <a href="Armenian%20people">Armenians</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a> who held the highest proportion of high-ranking officers in the Soviet military during the war.

Bagramyan's experience in military planning as a chief of staff allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander in the early stages of the Soviet counter-offensives against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942, and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the commander of the <a href="1st%20Baltic%20Front">1st Baltic Front</a>. As commander of the Baltic Front, he participated in the <a href="Baltic%20Offensive">offensives</a> which pushed <a href="Wehrmacht">German forces</a> out of the <a href="Baltic%20republics">Baltic republics</a>.

He did not immediately join the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party</a> after the consolidation of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>, becoming a member only in 1941, a move atypical for a Soviet military officer. After the war, he served as a deputy of the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a>s of the <a href="Latvian%20SSR">Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> and <a href="Armenian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> and was a regular attendee of the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Party Congresses</a>. In 1952, he became a candidate for entry into the <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Central Committee</a> and, in 1961, was inducted as a full member. For his contributions during the war, he was widely regarded as a national hero in the Soviet Union, and continues to hold such esteemed status among Armenians.

Ivan Bagramyan was born to Armenian parents in the village of <a href="%C3%87ardaql%C4%B1%2C%20Shamkir">Çardaqlı</a>, near Yelizavetpol (modern <a href="Ganja%2C%20Azerbaijan">Ganja, Azerbaijan</a>), then a part of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. Çardaqlı was one of the largest Armenian settlements in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in <a href="Nagorno%20Karabakh">Nagorno Karabakh</a> who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. <a href="Hamazasp%20Babadzhanian">Hamazasp Babadzhanian</a>, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, stayed at home to take care of her seven children. Because his parents could not afford to send him to the local "<a href="Gymnasium%20%28school%29">gymnasium</a>", they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.

Graduating in 1912, Bagramyan, whom everyone affectionately called Vanya, followed his father and his brothers in a path in rail work, attending the three-year railway technical institute located in <a href="Tiflis">Tiflis</a>. He graduated with honors and was slated to become a railway engineer within a few years when events in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> changed his life.

Bagramyan was well aware of the military situation at the <a href="Caucasus%20Campaign">Caucasus front</a> during the first months of the world war. In the winter of 1914–15, the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a> was able to <a href="Battle%20of%20Sarikamish">withstand and repel</a> the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>'s offensive at <a href="Sar%C4%B1kam%C4%B1%C5%9F">Sarikamish</a>, and to take the fight to its territory. Bagramyan also began reading harrowing reports in the Russian press of what was taking place against his fellow kinsmen across the border: the Ottomans had <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">embarked on a campaign</a> to commit genocide upon their Armenian subjects. He desperately attempted to join the military effort but because he was only seventeen and a railway mechanic, he was not liable to be drafted. This did not dissuade him from trying, as he later remarked, "My place was at the front."

His opportunity came on 16 September 1915, when he was accepted by the Russian Army as a volunteer. He was assigned to the 116th Reserve Battalion and sent to <a href="Akhaltsikhe">Akhaltsikhe</a> for basic training. With his training complete in December, he joined the 2nd Caucasus Frontier Regiment of the <a href="Russian%20Caucasus%20Army%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Russian Expeditionary Corps</a>, which was sent to dislodge the Ottoman Turks in <a href="Iran">Persia</a>. Bagramyan participated in several battles in <a href="Asadabad%2C%20Iran">Asadabad</a>, <a href="Hamedan">Hamedan</a> and <a href="Kermanshah">Kermanshah</a>, the Russian victories here sending Ottoman forces reeling toward Anatolia.

Learning about the exploits of the men in the outfit, the chief of staff of the regiment, General Pavel Melik-Shahnazaryan, advised Bagramyan to return to Tiflis to enroll in the "<a href="Praporshchik">Praporshchik</a>" Military Academy. But in order to attend the school, Bagramyan needed to satisfy the academy's requirement of having completed school at a "gymnasium". This did not deter him and, after preparing for the courses in <a href="Armavir%2C%20Armenia">Armavir</a>, he passed his exams and began attending the academy on February 13, 1917. He graduated in June 1917 and was assigned to the 3rd Armenian Infantry Regiment, stationed near <a href="Lake%20Urmia">Lake Urmia</a>. But with the overthrow of the <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Russian Provisional Government</a> in the midst of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> of 1917, his unit was demobilized.

However, with the creation of the newly established <a href="First%20Republic%20of%20Armenia">First Republic of Armenia</a> in 1918, Bagramyan enlisted in the 3rd Armenian Regiment of that country's <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Armenia">armed forces</a>. From 1 April 1918, that is, after the Ottoman Empire signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk">Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</a> (March 3, 1918) with the <a href="Russian%20SFSR">Russian SFSR</a>, he was in the 1st Armenian Cavalry Regiment, which put a halt to the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29">Ottoman 3rd Army</a>, which was bent on conquering the remains of the republic, in <a href="Karaurgan">Karaurgan</a>, Sarikamish and <a href="Kars%20Province">Kars</a>. He most notably took part in the May 1918 <a href="Battle%20of%20Sardarapat">Battle of Sardarapat</a>, where the Armenian military scored a crucial victory against Turkish forces. He remained in the regiment until May 1920.

Three years after the toppling of the Provisional Government by the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s in October 1917, the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> invaded the southern Caucasus republics of <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>. In May 1920, Bagramyan, upset with the country's social and political conditions, participated in a <a href="May%20Uprising">failed rebellion</a> against the <a href="Dashnak">Dashnak</a>-led government of Armenia. He was jailed and sent to work in the fields for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with the outbreak of the <a href="Turkish%E2%80%93Armenian%20War">Turkish–Armenian War</a>. But in December 1920, Armenia was sovietized and the national army was subsequently disbanded. Bagramyan, however, chose to join the <a href="11th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">11th Soviet Army</a> and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander.

As life in Armenia grew relatively more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought to locate a woman he had met several years earlier, Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in <a href="Nakhchivan%20Autonomous%20Republic">Nakhichevan</a> with her family, had been married to an Armenian officer who had been killed during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who went on to become a painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.

In 1923, Bagramyan was appointed commander of the Alexandropol Cavalry Regiment, a position he held until 1931. Two years later, Bagramyan graduated from the Leningrad Cavalry School and, in 1934, from the <a href="Frunze%20Military%20Academy">Frunze Military Academy</a>. In his memoirs, <a href="Pyotr%20Grigorenko">Pyotr Grigorenko</a>, a Ukrainian commander who attended Frunze, recalled how Bagramyan was expelled from the academy by his superiors after they had learned that he had been a secret member of the banned Dashnak Armenian nationalist party for more than a decade. Pending his arrest, Grigorenko described Bagramyan "deeply depressed, saying he only wished they'd arrest him soon so that he could get it over with." Grigorenko advised that he appeal the arrest warrant which Bagramyan reluctantly did and, with the help of Armenian <a href="politburo">politburo</a> member <a href="Anastas%20Mikoyan">Anastas Mikoyan</a>, the arrest warrant was revoked and he accepted to be "<a href="Rehabilitation%20%28Soviet%29">rehabilitated</a>." From 1934 to 1936, he served as the <a href="chief%20of%20staff">chief of staff</a> of the 5th Cavalry Division, and from 1938, he worked as a senior instructor and lecturer at the Military Academy of the Soviet General Staff. Concurrently, Soviet leader <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> had <a href="Great%20Purge">purged</a> much of the Soviet officer corps of its veteran commanders. While fellow students from the military academy, <a href="Andrei%20Yeremenko">Andrei Yeremenko</a> and <a href="Georgy%20Zhukov">Georgy Zhukov</a>, had seen their careers rise, Bagramyan's had remained stagnant.
In 1940, when General Zhukov was promoted to commander of the <a href="Kiev%20Military%20District">Kiev Military District</a> in the <a href="Ukrainian%20SSR">Ukrainian SSR</a>, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to be presented to the commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, "Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation," apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet <a href="12th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">12th Army</a> based in Ukraine. Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, was appointed deputy chief of staff of the <a href="Southwestern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Southwestern Front</a>, headquartered in Kiev.

In June 1941, <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invaded</a> the Soviet Union. Unlike many of the border troops who were caught off guard by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General <a href="Mikhail%20Kirponos">Mikhail Kirponos</a>, believed an invasion by Germany was inevitable. However, Kirponos chose to ignore Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed <a href="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a> tactics like those seen in the campaigns in <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland%20%281939%29">Poland</a> in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940. Since the winter of 1939–40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine, which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940.

On the morning of 22 June, he was tasked with the overseeing of a transfer of a military convoy to <a href="Ternopil">Ternopil</a>. While his column was passing the Soviet <a href="airfield">airfield</a>s near the city of <a href="Brody">Brody</a>, German air strikes hit the aircraft on the ground. Several hours later, they arrived in Ternopil, having been strafed twice by the planes. Three days after the invasion, the plans for the counter-offensive were implemented, but disorder engulfed the troops, and the counter-attack collapsed. Bagramyan took part in the great tank battles in western Ukraine and the defensive <a href="Battle%20of%20Kiev%20%281941%29">operation around Kiev</a>, in which Kirponos was killed and the entire Front captured by the Germans. He was one of a handful of senior officers who escaped from the encircled Front.

Bagramyan was then appointed chief of staff to Marshal <a href="Semyon%20Timoshenko">Semyon Timoshenko</a> and along with future Soviet premier <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, then a <a href="Political%20commissar">political officer</a>, coordinated the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rostov%20%281941%29">fighting around Rostov</a>. In his memoirs, Khrushchev described Bagramyan as a "very precise person who reported on everything just as it was. How many troops we had, their positions, and the general situation."

Khrushchev went on to detail an account where Marshal <a href="Semyon%20Budyonny">Semyon Budyonny</a>, sent by the chief of the operations department from <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> as a representative of <a href="STAVKA">STAVKA</a>, arrived in Kiev to <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> Bagramyan, who vigorously protested and said that if he was an incapable staff officer, then he should instead be given a field unit to command. To Bagramyan's astonishment, Budyonny went on to attempt to convince him to agree to his execution. Khrushchev remarked that the argument was sparked arbitrarily and had taken place after an "abundant feast with cognac" and that "in those days we didn't take that kind of conversation seriously." According to him, at the time however, the Soviet military was especially suspicious of the men in its ranks, itself judging that there were "<a href="enemy%20of%20the%20people">enemies of the people</a>...everywhere, especially the Red Army."

Bagramyan was instrumental in the planning of two Soviet counter-offensives against the Germans, including the major push made by Soviet forces in December during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a>, and for this was promoted to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a>. In the same month, he was made the chief of staff of a military operations group that would oversee three Army Groups: the <a href="Soviet%20Southern%20Front">Southern</a>, the Southwestern and <a href="Bryansk">Bryansk</a> Fronts. In March 1942, he went along with Khrushchev and Timoshenko to Moscow to present the plans of a new counter-offensive in the Ukrainian city of <a href="Kharkiv">Kharkiv</a> to Stalin. Stalin, impressed with his plan, approved the operation and on April 8, promoted Bagramyan as Chief of Staff of the Southwestern Front. On 12 May 1942, armies of the Southwestern Front attacked Kharkiv but the launch of the offensive came at an inopportune moment since they were attacking from the Barvenkovo <a href="Salient%20%28geography%29">Salient</a>, a region that German forces were near closing.

While Soviet forces were initially successful in <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Kharkov">recapturing Kharkiv</a>, they found themselves trapped by the German Army after the closing of Barvenkovo. On 18 May, Bagramyan asked Timoshenko to alter the plans but Timoshenko along with Stalin refused to approve his request. Soviet losses were heavy as the <a href="6th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">6th</a>, 9th and 57th armies (approximately 18–20 <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisions</a>) comprising a large portion of the Southwestern Front, were all destroyed and Bagramyan was removed from his post on 28 June by STAVKA. According to Khrushchev, Bagramyan was so devastated from the immense loss of men that after the operation was called off, "he burst into tears. His nerves cracked...He was weeping for our army." Held responsible for the failure of the operation and "poor staff work", he was demoted to chief of staff of the Soviet 28th Army. Several days later, he wrote a letter to Stalin asking to "serve at the front at any capacity, however modest." British military historian <a href="John%20Erickson%20%28historian%29">John Erickson</a> contends that Bagramyan was unfairly scapegoated by Stalin in his attempts to "hunt for [the] culprits" of the mismanagement of operations.

Though he had never led a fighting unit prior to the war, he was given his first command of an army in the Western Front as his superiors, and particularly Marshal Zhukov were impressed with his skills and capabilities as a staff officer. Zhukov, with the approval of STAVKA, appointed him commander of the <a href="16th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">16th Army</a> (2nd formation), (July 1942 – April 1943) replacing its former commander, <a href="Konstantin%20Rokossovsky">Konstantin Rokossovsky</a> who had been sent to command the <a href="Bryansk%20Front">Bryansk Front</a>. The 16th Army transferred its troops to the <a href="5th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">5th Army</a>, and its command and staff were moved to the second echelon of the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Western Front</a> where the Army took up command of part of the <a href="10th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">10th Army</a>'s troops, and its defensive positions. On 11 August, however, German forces mounted a surprise offensive on the southern flank of Western Front, splitting the 61st Army from the 16th Army which was not taking part in the Rzhev-Sychevka Offensive operation. The German forces threatened Bagramyan's left flank as he quickly moved his forces to counter their movements and halted them from advancing further on 9 September.

With the rest of the Eastern Front battles almost entirely focused on <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> and the Germans' attempts to advance to the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, the 16th Army was not called up to action until February 1943. By then, the <a href="6th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 6th Army</a> besieged in Stalingrad had been encircled and surrendered. The 16th Army at the time was composed of four divisions and one infantry <a href="brigade">brigade</a> and in light of the new offensive, Bagramyan's force was given two extra divisions, an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> brigade, four <a href="tank">tank</a> brigades and several <a href="artillery">artillery</a> regiments.

As the battle of Stalingrad marked the turning point of the war, German forces reorganized for a new offensive in the summer of 1943 to attack the Soviet held <a href="Kursk">Kursk</a> salient in Russia. The German High Command was to deploy veteran units to destroy the salient, including the <a href="9th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">Ninth Army</a> and the <a href="II%20SS%20Panzer%20Corps">II SS Panzer Corps</a>. STAVKA, already informed of the impending offensive, called for an advance toward the German defenses positioned near the town of <a href="Kozelsk">Kozelsk</a>, which would drive south with the help of the armies of the <a href="Soviet%20Central%20Front">Central Front</a>. The forces would then proceed to cut off a gap that would effectively surround the Germans and cut if off from reinforcements. This was similar to "<a href="Operation%20Uranus">Operation Uranus</a>", where the Soviet Army encircled and trapped the Sixth Army in Stalingrad.

Bagramyan's <a href="11th%20Guards%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">11th Guards Army</a> (the renamed 16th Army) was tasked to take part in the offensive and was given an additional three infantry divisions and two tank <a href="corps">corps</a>, a force composed of fifteen divisions. Bagramyan, however, argued to STAVKA that its planning was too audacious in the hopes of repeating a successful encirclement like that in "Uranus". He claimed that his forces would be overstretched and would have difficulty in attacking the entrenched German positions in <a href="Bolkhov">Bolkhov</a>. To avoid a repetition of the failure in Kharkov the previous year, he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid his 11th Guards in destroying the German forces in Bolkhov, thus eliminating the Ninth Army's protection from the north. He appealed to his front commander <a href="Vasily%20Sokolovsky">Vasily Sokolovsky</a> as well the Bryansk's <a href="M.%20A.%20Reyter">M. A. Reyter</a>, both of whom rejected his proposal. In April, STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle. Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and Reyter, Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin, who agreed that it would be the more correct course to follow. Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the 11th Guards Army and on 24 May reported that his forces were ready. The 11th Guards now was composed of 135,000 men, 280 <a href="armored%20fighting%20vehicle">armored fighting vehicle</a>s, 2,700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces. Stalin, however, felt it necessary to further wear thin the fighting abilities of the German forces and delayed the offensive.

Ultimately, it was the German forces on who took the initiative by launching "<a href="Operation%20Citadel">Operation Citadel</a>" on 5 July in the area around Kursk. German losses were initially heavy due to Soviet defensive preparations. Taking advantage of this, on 12 July, Bagramyan's forces commenced their offensive, codenamed "<a href="Operation%20Kutuzov">Operation Kutuzov</a>", and quickly breached the German defenses, advancing a distance of 45 miles (72 km) by 18 July. By 28 July, the operation concluded successfully and he was promoted to the rank of <a href="Colonel-General">Colonel-General</a>. In the following month, his forces took part in the large-scale tank offensives which routed the German assaults and forced Germany to remain on the defensive for the remainder of the war.

With the end of operations in Kursk, the Soviets began a series of offensives on various fronts to push the Germans out of the occupied Soviet republics. In October 1943, Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> and namely, the <a href="Baltic%20republics">Baltic republics</a>. In November, Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the <a href="First%20Baltic%20Front">First Baltic Front</a> which had the similar objectives of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards.

Stalin would allow him to retain the 11th Guards and suggested that Colonel-General <a href="N.%20E.%20Chibisov">N. E. Chibisov</a>, an officer he had served under, assume his position. Bagramyan, however, commented that he had had a frictional relationship with Chibisov and instead nominated <a href="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</a> K. N. Galitsky. Stalin, belatedly realizing that Bagramyan was implying that the two would be unable to coordinate harmoniously due to a conflict of holding the same rank, agreed to Bagramyan's suggestion and promoted him to the rank <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28USSR%29">Army General</a>. He also agreed to have the Second Baltic Front return a tank corps and an infantry division that was taken from the 11th Guards, thus bolstering the forces under Bagramyan to a total of four armies: 11th Guards, 39th, 43rd and the 4th Shock.

In the winter of 1943, his forces advanced forward towards the Belarusian city of <a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a>. One of the key elements to Bagramyan's success was that many of the soldiers were part of veteran units that had been trained in the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> regions of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, enabling them to easily push through entrenched defenses the Germans had spent months preparing. Among the key locations imperative to reach Vitebsk was the small town of <a href="Haradok">Gorodok</a>, which served as a communications hub that the Germans had heavily fortified. Despite the heavy defense preparations, Bagramyan was able to utilize his heavy artillery and air support from the <a href="Red%20Air%20Force">Red Air Force</a> in late December to bombard the town and then launch a three-pronged attack from the ground. The German garrison was overwhelmed, and by 24 December, two infantry divisions and one tank division had surrendered. In Moscow, the news of the victory at Gorodok prompted a 124-cannon salute in honor of Bagramyan and the First Baltic Front.

On 2 April 1944 Stalin granted Bagramyan's request to relieve the troops of the Front of offensive duties. However, German forces took this to their advantage as they mounted a new offensive against <a href="Soviet%20partisan">Soviet partisan</a> fighters in Belarus. Bagramyan's senior staff diverted air support and other crucial supplies to aid the partisans, allowing most of them to escape the German encirclement. With the advance of Soviet forces in the Baltic and the Ukraine, German <a href="Army%20Group%20Center">Army Group Center</a> had largely been isolated as STAVKA prepared to eliminate the pocket (consisting of <a href="Third%20Panzer%20Army%20%28Germany%29">Third Panzer</a>, Second, Fourth, and Ninth Armies). STAVKA's plan, codenamed "<a href="Operation%20Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>" was kept secret from all of the involved Front commanders. Bagramyan himself was only informed in May 1944 of his role in the offensive.

"Bagration" called for the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the <a href="Daugava%20River">Daugava River</a> and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the surrounding areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt the plans for the "Bagration" were sound, he worried about the possibility of a German incursion by <a href="Army%20Group%20North">Army Group North</a> against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and <a href="Aleksandr%20Vasilevsky">Alexander Vasilevsky</a>, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.

Although Bagramyan found it acceptable to sustain heavy casualties (as did all the commanders of the Red Army), he was disturbed with the immense loss of life his forces were sustaining. He, however, attempted to reduce those levels primarily by maintaining the element of surprise in operations. In his preparations for "Bagration", he planned for the 43rd Army to move through the more geographically difficult swamps and marshlands to Army Group North's right flank. This maneuver would thus take North by surprise since it expected the Soviet offensive to move through more suitable terrain. He proved correct, as in early June 1944, the 43rd achieved success in its attack. Commander of the 43rd Army, General <a href="Afanasy%20Beloborodov">Afanasy Beloborodov</a>, wrote that during the offensive they apprehended a German general who stated that German forces had been blindsided by the attacking forces.

As Bagramyan pushed towards Vitebsk, his forces were aided by the same Belorussian <a href="guerrilla">guerrilla</a> fighters who had escaped the German encirclement in April. They provided vital intelligence, including information on the location of bridges and troop movements, and launched attacks against German logistic lines. On 22 June 1944, "Bagration" began as Bagramyan proceeded in moving westwards as previously planned. However, a widening gap on the Front's northern flank grew as it advanced while the Second Baltic Front, tasked to help defend that area, took no action. Stalin agreed to send a tank corps to reinforce Bagramyan's forces but ordered him to capture <a href="Polotsk">Polotsk</a>, which would sever Army Group North's communication lines and open up a route towards the central Baltic. By 3 July, his troops had accomplished the tasks set forth in the directive, destroyed the Third Panzer Army and captured Polotsk. For his achievements, on 7 July he was decorated with the title of <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>.

With the overall success of Soviet forces in "Bagration", his Front was expanded by three armies (although he ceded the 4th Shock Army to Second Baltic), the 39th Army (previously under the command of Third Belorussian), the 51st and the 2nd Guards Armies. The First Baltic Front was ordered by STAVKA to move westward in order to stop Army Group North's remaining forces from escaping to Germany. Despite this, Bagramyan understood that many of the general orders being given to the German Army were directed by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, rather than the General Staff, and knew that while there was a possibility that they would confront them in the <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>n city of <a href="Kaunas">Kaunas</a>, he felt the more likely location would be in <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>'s capital, <a href="Riga">Riga</a>. He spoke with Vasilevsky who agreed to change the plans if his theory and intuition proved correct.

As the First Baltic began moving towards Lithuania and into eastern Latvia, it became clear that Army Group North would attempt to outflank Bagramyan's forces near <a href="Daugavpils">Daugavpils</a>, as he had previously predicted. Vasilevsky, keeping his promise, appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so. Vasilevsky in turn, took it upon his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of 4th Shock Army, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised 39th Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to 4th Shock's ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he pressed on with the units he had.

By 9 July, his ground forces had made significant gains in cutting off a vital road that connected Kaunas to Daugavpils. Taking advantage of this, Bagramyan worked with other Front commanders to attack the rear guard of Army Group Center but poor coordination between the units led a stall in the advance. At this time, Bagramyan realized that German forces were most probably not going to easily retreat from the Baltics and so further advances towards Kaunas would be pointless. He proposed to STAVKA to launch a full-scale offensive towards Riga but the former rejected his plans, stating that the armies of Second and Third Baltic Fronts would have already pushed Army Group Center to Prussia by the time of the offensive. He attempted to convince them otherwise, citing the numerically deficient forces in the two Fronts, but was rebuffed and ordered to drive towards a road connecting the Lithuanian city of <a href="%C5%A0iauliai">Šiauliai</a> to Riga, resulting in its capture in late July.

With its capture, he persuaded Vasilevsky to allow his forces to move towards Riga, receiving a formal go-ahead by STAVKA in a directive on 29 July. On 30 July, his forces finally reached the seaside city of <a href="Tukums">Tukums</a>, near the <a href="Bay%20of%20Riga">Bay of Riga</a>, thereby cutting off a total of 38 German infantry and armored divisions in Latvia. For his achievements in this battle, he was given the title of <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. During the month of August, Soviet forces stalled in the Riga offensive, concentrating on halting German attacks. Finally on 14 September 1944, the First, Second and Third Baltic Fronts launched full-scale offensives with the objective of Riga, encountering fierce resistance by its defenders. On 24 September, with his forces only 12 miles (19 km) from Riga, STAVKA ordered Bagramyan's forces to abandon it to the Second and Third Baltic Fronts, regroup, and instead advance against <a href="Klaip%C4%97da">Memel</a>. His forces <a href="Battle%20of%20Memel">attacked Memel</a> on 5 October and on 10 October, reached the city, effectively preventing Army Group North from retreating to Prussia.

In early 1945, Bagramyan's army, under the overall command of Vasilievsky, took part in the advance into <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>. In "<a href="Battle%20of%20K%C3%B6nigsberg">Operation Samland</a>", Bagramyan's First Baltic Front, now known as the <a href="Sambia">Samland</a> Group, captured <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a> (now <a href="Kaliningrad">Kaliningrad</a>) in April. On 9 May 1945, he accepted the surrender of the <a href="Courland%20Pocket">German forces penned up in Latvia</a>, capturing a total of 158 aircraft, 18,000 vehicles, 500 tanks and assault guns among other weaponry.

After the war, Bagramyan remained in command of the <a href="Baltic%20Military%20District">Baltic Military District</a>, commanding operations against <a href="Forest%20Brothers">partisans in Lithuania and Latvia</a>. In 1954, he was appointed Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense. In 1955, he was appointed <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20of%20Soviet%20Union">Deputy Minister of Defense</a> with the rank of <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Marshal of the Soviet Union</a>. He was also head of the Military Academy of General Staff and commander of the reserve forces of the Soviet Armed Forces.

He spent much of his time writing articles in military journals on Soviet strategic operations and most notably, co-authored the six-volume work on Soviet involvement during World War II, "The Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War (1941–1945)". In August 1967, Bagramyan accompanied <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">General Secretary</a> <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> and Premier <a href="Alexei%20Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a> to <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>, where they met with Vietnamese leaders as he, serving in the role of a military expert, helped negotiate the transfer of logistics and arms to the country during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

He retired in 1968. In 1971, Bagramyan completed his first volume of his memoirs in "This is How the War Began" in 1971 and in 1977 the second volume, "Thus We Went to Victory", was published. Among the numerous points he noted in the second book was an analysis of the Red Army's costly offensives in the early stages of the war:

In 1980, another book of Bagramyan entitled "My Memoirs" was published and was based on the first and second volumes. A large portion of the book was dedicated to the Armenian issues including the territories of Western Armenia, massacres of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire and the Armenian Genocide, the Ottoman invasion of Armenia and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sardarapat">Battle of Sardarapat</a>, as well as other topics.

Marshal Bagramyan was awarded with numerous Soviet and foreign orders and medals for his service, including two Orders of the <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>, seven <a href="Orders%20of%20Lenin">Orders of Lenin</a>, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20October%20Revolution">Order of the October Revolution</a>, three <a href="Orders%20of%20the%20Red%20Banner">Orders of the Red Banner</a>, two <a href="Orders%20of%20Suvorov">Orders of Suvorov</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20Kutuzov">Order of Kutuzov</a>. Among the other commendations he received were the Polish "<a href="Virtuti%20Militari">Virtuti Militari</a>", the <a href="Medal%20%26quot%3BFor%20the%20Victory%20over%20Germany%20in%20the%20Great%20Patriotic%20War%201941%E2%80%931945%26quot%3B">Medal For the Victory Over Germany</a> and the <a href="Medal%20%26quot%3BFor%20the%20Victory%20over%20Japan%26quot%3B">Medal "For the Victory over Japan"</a>.

After the death of Marshal <a href="Vasily%20Chuikov">Vasily Chuikov</a> on 18 March 1982, he was the last surviving Soviet Marshal who held a high command in World War II. However, Bagramyan was ill and died a few months later, on 21 September 1982, at the age of 84. He was buried with full military honors at the <a href="Kremlin%20Wall%20Necropolis">Kremlin Wall Necropolis</a> in Moscow. A town in Armenia (), a military firing range, an <a href="Armenian%20Army">Armenian Army</a> training brigade, and a subway station and street in the capital of <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>, are named in his honor. On 11 May 1997, the government of Armenia established the commemorative 100th Anniversary of Marshal Bagramyan medal. It is awarded to service and civilian personnel who participated in the Second World War.

According to the Soviet laws, a monument made out of bronze had to be erected in the birthplace of a recipient of two orders of the Hero of the Soviet Union. The one that was erected in Chardakhlu village for Bagramyan was destroyed by Azerbaijanis after the <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh%20War">Karabakh movement</a> broke out. His brother Aleksey Khristoforovich Bagramyan's grave was also desecrated in Fakhri Khiyaban (The Alley of Honor) cemetery, which is located in present-day Baku, Azerbaijan.


Bagramyan's awards have been deposited in the <a href="Central%20Armed%20Forces%20Museum">Central Armed Forces Museum</a>.

Pilgrim at Tinker Creek

Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is a 1974 <a href="nonfiction">nonfiction</a> narrative book by American author <a href="Annie%20Dillard">Annie Dillard</a>. Told from a first-person point of view, the book details an unnamed narrator's explorations near her home, and various contemplations on nature and life. The title refers to Tinker Creek, which is outside <a href="Roanoke%2C%20Virginia">Roanoke</a> in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>'s <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a>. Dillard began writing "Pilgrim" in the spring of 1973, using her personal journals as inspiration. Separated into four sections that signify each of the seasons, the narrative takes place over the period of one year.

The book records the narrator's thoughts on solitude, writing, and religion, as well as scientific observations on the flora and fauna she encounters. Touching upon themes of faith, nature, and awareness, "Pilgrim" is also noted for its study of <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a> and the inherent cruelty of the natural world. The author has described it as a "book of theology", and she rejects the label of nature writer. Dillard considers the story a "single sustained nonfiction narrative", although several chapters have been anthologized separately in magazines and other publications. The book is analogous in design and genre to <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>'s "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>" (1854), the subject of Dillard's master's thesis at <a href="Hollins%20College">Hollins College</a>. Critics often compare Dillard to authors from the <a href="Transcendentalism">Transcendentalist</a> movement; <a href="Edward%20Abbey">Edward Abbey</a> in particular deemed her Thoreau's "true heir".

"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" was published by Harper's Magazine Press shortly after Dillard's first book, a volume of poetry titled "<a href="Tickets%20for%20a%20Prayer%20Wheel%20%28book%29">Tickets for a Prayer Wheel</a>". Since its initial publication, "Pilgrim" has been lauded by critics. It won the 1975 <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20General%20Non-fiction">Pulitzer Prize for General Non-fiction</a>, and in 1998 it was included in <a href="Modern%20Library">Modern Library</a>'s list of <a href="Modern%20Library%20100%20Best%20Nonfiction">100 Best Nonfiction Books</a>.

Dillard, the daughter of an oil company executive, grew up in an upper middle-class home in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>. She read voraciously; one of her favorite books was Ann Haven Morgan's "The Field Book of Ponds and Streams", which she compared to the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>"; in painstaking detail, it instructed on the study and collection of plants and insects. She attended <a href="Hollins%20University">Hollins College</a> in <a href="Roanoke%20County%2C%20Virginia">Roanoke County, Virginia</a>, receiving both a bachelor's (1967) and a master's degree (1968). At Hollins she came under the tutelage of poet and creative writing professor <a href="R.%20H.%20W.%20Dillard">Richard Henry Wilde Dillard</a>, whom she married in 1965. She would later state that Richard taught her everything she knew about writing. Her master's thesis, "Walden Pond and Thoreau", studied the eponymous pond as a structuring device for Henry David Thoreau's "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>". Dillard's knowledge of Thoreau's works was an obvious inspiration, although critics have pointed to many differences between their two works. However, in a nod to his influence, Dillard mentions within the text that she named her goldfish <a href="William%20Ellery%20Channing%20%28poet%29">Ellery Channing</a>, after one of Thoreau's closest friends.

After graduating in 1968, she continued to live in Virginia, near the Blue Ridge Mountains, where she wrote full-time. At first she concentrated solely on poetry, which she had written and published when she was an undergraduate. She began keeping a journal in 1970, in which she recorded her daily walks around Tinker Creek. Her journals would eventually consist of 20 volumes. In 1971, after suffering from a serious bout of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, she decided to write a full-length book dedicated to her nature writings. Dillard wrote the first half of "Pilgrim" at her home in spring 1973, and the remaining half the following summer in a study carrel "that overlooked a tar-and-gravel roof" at the Hollins College library. She would later explain her choice of writing location as stemming from her wanting to avoid "appealing workplaces . ... One wants a room with no view, so imagination can meet memory in the dark." When she first began writing the book, Dillard would only dedicate one or two hours a day to the task; by the last two months, however, she was writing nearly 15–16 hours a day.

Dillard's primary reader for "Pilgrim" was a Hollins professor called John Rees Moore. After finishing a chapter, she would bring it to Moore to critique. Moore specifically recommended that she expand the book's first chapter "to make clear, and to state boldly, what it was [she] was up to," a suggestion that Dillard at first dismissed, but would later admit was good advice. Previous to publication, chapters of the book appeared in publications including "<a href="Harper%27s%20Magazine">Harper's Magazine</a>", "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>", and "<a href="The%20Living%20Wilderness">The Living Wilderness</a>". "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" was published by Harper's Magazine Press in 1974, and was dedicated to Dillard's husband. Editor in chief Larry Freundlich remarked upon first reading the book: "I never expected to see a manuscript this good in my life . ... The chance to publish a book like this is what publishers are here for."

Written in a series of internal monologues and reflections, the book is told from the perspective of an unnamed narrator who lives next to Tinker Creek, in the <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> near <a href="Roanoke%2C%20Virginia">Roanoke, Virginia</a>. Over the course of a year, the narrator observes and reflects upon the changing of the seasons as well as the flora and fauna near her home. "Pilgrim" is thematically divided into four sections—one for each season—consisting of separate, named chapters: "Heaven and Earth in Jest", "Seeing", "Winter", "The Fixed", "The Knot", "The Present", "Spring", "Intricacy", "Flood", "Fecundity", "Stalking", "Nightwatch", "The Horns of the Altar", "Northing", and "The Waters of Separation".

The first chapter, "Heaven and Earth in Jest", serves as an introduction to the book. The narrator describes the location as well as her connection to it:

I live by a creek, Tinker Creek, in a valley in Virginia's Blue Ridge. An <a href="anchorite">anchorite</a>'s hermitage is called an anchor-hold; some anchor-holds were simple sheds clamped to the side of a church like a barnacle or a rock. I think of this house clamped to the side of Tinker Creek as an anchor-hold. It holds me at anchor to the rock bottom of the creek itself and keeps me steadied in the current, as a sea anchor does, facing the stream of light pouring down. It's a good place to live; there's a lot to think about.

In the <a href="afterword">afterword</a> of the 1999 Harper Perennial Modern Classics edition, Dillard states that the book's other, two-part structure mirrors the two routes to God according to <a href="Neoplatonism%20and%20Christianity">Neoplatonic Christianity</a>: the "via positiva" and the "via negativa". The first half of the book, the "via positiva", beginning with the second chapter, "accumulates the world's goodness and God's." The second half, the "via negativa", ends with the chapter "Northing" which Dillard notes is the counterpart of the second chapter, "Seeing". The first and last chapters of the book serve as the introduction and conclusion, respectively. The narrative is composed of vignettes detailing the narrator's wanderings around the creek. In "The Present" the narrator encounters a puppy at a gas station off the highway, and pats its belly while contemplating the view of the nearby mountain range; the reflective act of "petting the puppy" is referred to in several other chapters. In "Stalking", the narrator pursues a group of <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s in the creek during summer. One of the most famous passages comes from the beginning of the book, when the narrator witnesses a frog being drained and devoured by a water beetle.

"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" is a work of creative nonfiction that uses poetic devices such as <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>, repetition, and <a href="Inversion%20%28prosody%29">inversion</a> to convey the importance of recurrent themes. Although it is often described as a series of essays, Dillard has insisted it is a continuous work, as evidenced by references to events from previous chapters. Although the chapters are separately named—several have also been published separately in magazines and anthologies—she referred to the book in a 1989 interview as a "single sustained nonfiction narrative". Dillard has also resisted the label of "nature writer", especially in regard to "Pilgrim". She stated, "There's usually a bit of nature in what I write, but I don't consider myself a nature writer."

The book often quotes and alludes to "Walden", although Dillard does not explicitly state her interest in Thoreau's work. Critic Donna Mendelson notes that Thoreau's "presence is so potent in her book that Dillard can borrow from [him] both straightforwardly and also humorously." Although the two works are often compared, "Pilgrim" does not comment upon the social world as "Walden" does; rather, it is completely rooted in observations of the natural world. Unlike Thoreau, Dillard does not make connections between the history of social and natural aspects, nor does she believe in an ordered universe. Whereas Thoreau refers to the machine-like universe, in which the creator is akin to a master watchmaker, Dillard recognizes the imperfection of creation, in which "something is everywhere and always amiss".

In her review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Eudora%20Welty">Eudora Welty</a> noted "Pilgrim"'s narrator being "the only person in [Dillard's] book, substantially the only one in her world . ... Speaking of the universe very often, she is yet self-surrounded". Dillard seemingly refers to the idea of an "invisible narrator" in the sixth chapter of "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek"; while referring to the "infinite power" of God, the narrator notes that "invisibility is the all-time great 'cover'". Nancy C. Parrish, author of the 1998 book "Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers", notes that despite its having been written in the first person, "Pilgrim" is not necessarily autobiographical. The narrator, "Annie Dillard", therefore becomes a persona through which the author can experience and describe "thoughts and events that the real Annie Dillard had only heard about or studied or imagined." Critic Suzanne Clark also points to the "peculiar evasiveness" of Dillard-the-author, noting that "when we read Annie Dillard, we don't know who is writing. There is a silence in the place where there might be an image of the social self—of personality, character, or ego". While most critics assume that the narrator is female, mostly due to the autobiographical elements of the book and the assumption that the narrator is Dillard herself, Clark questions whether the narrator is male. Stating that Dillard uses "a variety of male voices, male styles" throughout the book, Clark asks, "When Dillard quit writing "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" in the persona of a fifty year old man, did she then begin to write as a woman?"

"Pilgrim" is often noted for its study of <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a>, or its defense of God's goodness in the face of evil. The narrator attempts to reconcile the harsh natural world, with its "seemingly horrid mortality," with the belief in a benevolent God. Death is repeatedly mentioned as a natural, although cruel progression: "Evolution", the narrator states, "loves death more than it loves you or me." A passage in the second chapter of the book describes a frog being "sucked dry" by a "giant water bug" as the narrator watches; this necessary cruelty shows order in life and death, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. The narrator especially sees inherent cruelty in the insect world: "Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly ... insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or a shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect ... is an assault on all human virtue, all hope of a reasonable god." While she remains drawn to the ultimately repugnant and amoral natural world, she also questions her place in it. The narrator states, "I had thought to live by the side of the creek in order to shape my life to its free flow. But I seem to have reached a point where I must draw the line. It looks as though the creek is not buoying me up but dragging me down."

The title of the book suggests a pilgrimage, and yet the narrator does not stray far from her home near the creek: the journey is metaphysical. Margaret Loewen Reimer, in one of the first critical studies based on the book, noted that Dillard's treatment of the metaphysical is similar to that of <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>. While "Melville's eyes saw mainly the darkness and the horror" of the natural world, possibly stemming from his New England <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> roots, Dillard's "sinister" vision of the world comes "more from a horror at the seeming mindlessness of nature's design than from a deeply pervasive sense of evil." Unlike Melville, however, Dillard does not moralize the natural world or seek to find parallels in human cultural acts; focusing largely on observation as well as scientific analysis, Dillard follows the example of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> and other naturalists.

The "pilgrim" narrator seeks to behold the sacred, which she dedicates herself to finding either by "stalking" or "seeing". At one point, she sees a cedar tree near her house "charged and transfigured, each cell buzzing with flame" as the light hits it; this burning vision, reminiscent of creation's holy "fire", "comes and goes, mostly goes, but I live for it." Critic Jenny Emery Davidson believes that Dillard's act of "stalking" allows her to rewrite the hunting myth, a popular theme in nature writing which mediates the space between nature and humans. Although a long tradition of male nature writers—including <a href="James%20Fenimore%20Cooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a>, <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a> and <a href="Richard%20Nelson%20%28author%29">Richard Nelson</a>—have used this theme as "a symbolic ritual of violence", Dillard "ventures into the terrain of the hunt, employing its rhetoric while also challenging its conventions."

While some critics describe "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" as being more devoted to speculation of the divine and natural world than to self-exploration, others approach the work in terms of Dillard's attention to self-aware analysis. For example, critic Mary Davidson McConahay points to Dillard's Thoreauvian "commitment to awareness".

In the book, the narrator is not only self-aware, but also alert to every detail around her. "Pilgrim"'s second chapter defines two types of seeing: as "verbalization" (active) and as "a letting go" (passive). The narrator refers to the difference between the two methods as "the difference between walking with and without a camera." Whereas the former requires the need to "analyze and pry", the latter only requires rapt attention. The act of seeing is exhaustive and exhausting, as one of the chapters relates: "I look at the water: minnows and <a href="Shiner%20%28fish%29">shiners</a>. If I am thinking minnows, a carp will fill my brain till I scream. I look at the water's surface: skaters, bubbles, and leaves sliding down. Suddenly my own face, reflected, startles me witless. Those snails have been tracking my face! Finally, with a shuddering wrench of the will, I see clouds, cirrus clouds. I'm dizzy. I fall in. This looking business is risky." Sandra Johnson refers to the structure of the book itself leading to an epiphany of self-awareness, or a "mystical experience"; as the narrator watches a falling <a href="Samara%20%28fruit%29">maple key</a>, she feels "lost, sunk ... gazing toward Tinker Mountain and feeling the earth reel down".

The book was a critical and financial success, selling more than 37,000 copies within two months of publication. It went through eight separate printings in the first two years, and the paperback rights were quickly purchased. Dillard was unnerved by the crush of attention; shortly after the book was published, she wrote, "I'm starting to have dreams about Tinker Creek. Lying face down in it, all muddy and dried up and I'm drowning in it." She feared she had "shot my lifetime wad. "Pilgrim" is not only the wisdom of my 28 years but I think it's the wisdom of my whole life."

The initial consensus among reviewers was that it was "an unusual treatise on nature". The book was published soon after her poetry collection "<a href="Tickets%20for%20a%20Prayer%20Wheel%20%28book%29">Tickets for a Prayer Wheel</a>" (1974, University of Missouri Press). Reviewing both volumes for "<a href="America%20%28Jesuit%20magazine%29">America</a>", John Breslin noted the similarities between the two: "Even if her first book of poems had not been published simultaneously, the language she uses in "Pilgrim" would have given her away." The "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>" also praised Dillard's poetic ability in "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek", noting that "the poet in her is everywhere evident in this prose-poem of hers: the reader's attention is caught not only by the freshness of her insights, but by the beauty of her descriptions as well." Melvin Maddocks, a reviewer for "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", noted Dillard's intention of subtle influence: "Reader, beware of this deceptive girl, mouthing her piety about 'the secret of seeing' being 'the pearl of great price,' modestly insisting, 'I am no scientist. I explore the neighborhood.' Here is no gentle romantic twirling a buttercup, no graceful inscriber of 365 inspirational prose poems. As she guides the attention to a muskrat, to a monarch butterfly, a heron or a coot, Miss Dillard is stalking the reader as surely as any predator stalks its game."

Despite being a bestseller, "Pilgrim" received little academic attention until more than five years after its publication. Early reviewers Charles Nicol and J. C. Peirce linked Dillard with the <a href="Transcendentalism">Transcendentalism</a> movement, comparing her to Thoreau and <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a>. Author and environmentalist <a href="Edward%20Abbey">Edward Abbey</a>, known as the "Thoreau of the American West", stated that Dillard was the "true heir of the Master". He wrote, "she alone has been able to compose, successfully, in Thoreau's extravagant and transcendental manner." In his 1992 book critic Scott Slovic wrote that "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" eventually "catapulted [Dillard] to prominence among contemporary American nonfiction writers—particularly among nature writers—and stimulated a wealth of reviews and a steadily accumulating body of criticism." Gary McIlroy believed that Dillard's work is distinctive for its "vibrant rediscovery of the woods. [She] studies the wildest remnants of the Virginia woodlands, stirring all the dark and promising mysteries of the American frontier.

"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20General%20Non-fiction">Pulitzer Prize for General Non-fiction</a> in 1975, when Dillard was 29 years old. The jury noted in its nomination that "Miss Dillard is an expert observer in whom science has not etiolated a sense of awe ... Her book is a blend of observation and introspection, mystery and knowledge. We unanimously recommend it for the prize." Since its initial publication, portions of the book have been anthologized in over thirty collections. Subsequent editions included those published by <a href="Bantam%20Books">Bantam Books</a> (1975) and Harper Colophon (1985; 1988). The Harper Perennial 25th-Anniversary edition, which included an afterword by the author, was released in 1999. The first UK edition was released in 1976. The book has been translated into many languages throughout the years, including Swedish, Japanese, French, and German. In 1998 it was listed in <a href="Modern%20Library">Modern Library</a> <a href="Modern%20Library%20100%20Best%20Nonfiction">100 Best Nonfiction Books</a>, both on the board's and the reader's lists.

Chetro Ketl

Chetro Ketl is an <a href="Ancestral%20Puebloans">Ancestral Puebloan</a> <a href="Great%20house%20%28pueblo%29">great house</a> and archeological site located in <a href="Chaco%20Culture%20National%20Historical%20Park">Chaco Culture National Historical Park</a>, New Mexico, United States. Construction on Chetro Ketl began and was largely complete by 1075, with significant remodeling occurring in the early and mid-1110s. Following the onset of a severe drought, most Chacoans emigrated from the canyon by 1140; by 1250 Chetro Ketl's last inhabitants had vacated the structure.

The great house was rediscovered in 1823 by the <a href="List%20of%20Mexican%20governors%20of%20New%20Mexico">Mexican governor of New Mexico</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Vizcarra">José Antonio Vizcarra</a>, and in 1849 Lieutenant James Simpson of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> documented the major ruins in Chaco Canyon. <a href="Edgar%20Lee%20Hewett">Edgar L. Hewett</a>, the director of the first archeological field school in the canyon, conducted excavations of Chetro Ketl during 1920 and 1921, and again between 1929 and 1935.

Chaco scholars estimate that it required more than 500,000 <a href="man-hour">man-hour</a>s, 26,000 trees, and 50 million <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> blocks to erect Chetro Ketl. The great house is a D-shaped structure; its east wall is 280 feet (85 m) long, and the north wall is more than 450 feet (140 m); the perimeter is , and the diameter of the great <a href="kiva">kiva</a> is . Chetro Ketl contained approximately 400 rooms and was the largest great house by area in Chaco Canyon, covering nearly . Chetro Ketl lies from <a href="Pueblo%20Bonito">Pueblo Bonito</a>, in an area that archeologists call downtown Chaco; they theorize that the area may be an ancestral sacred zone. Chetro Ketl contains architectural elements, such as a <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a> and tower kiva, that appear to reflect a <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n influence.

Chetro Ketl's purpose is widely debated but many archeologists believe the building was a place of large-scale ceremony that held an important position within the larger Chacoan system. It may have been occupied primarily by groups of priests and, during times of ritual, pilgrims from outlying communities. Archeologist Stephen H. Lekson believes Chetro Ketl was a palace inhabited by Chacoan royalty, and the scale of its construction was motivated by what architects call "massing": building imposing structures with the intent to impress onlookers. The building has deteriorated significantly since its rediscovery in the early 19th century, and its usefulness as a source of information about Chacoan culture is slowly diminishing.

During the 10th to 8th millennia <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>, the <a href="San%20Juan%20Basin">San Juan Basin</a> was occupied by <a href="Paleo-Indians">Paleo-Indians</a> known as the <a href="Clovis%20culture">Clovis culture</a> () and the <a href="Folsom%20tradition">Folsom tradition</a> (8,500 to 7,500). Projectile points found in the vicinity of <a href="Chaco%20Culture%20National%20Historical%20Park">Chaco Canyon</a> suggest that hunters may have been active in the region as early as 10,000. By 6,000 the <a href="Picosa%20culture">Picosa culture</a> had developed from within the Paleolithic population, as environmental changes caused the eastward movement of animals and people to the <a href="Great%20Plains">Southern Plains</a>, bringing <a href="Southwestern%20United%20States">Southwestern</a> and northern Mexican cultures into the San Juan Basin. <a href="Cynthia%20Irwin-Williams">Cynthia Irwin-Williams</a> proposed that the first human presence in Chaco Canyon dates to a hunter-gatherer society that she named the <a href="Oshara%20Tradition">Oshara Tradition</a>, which developed within the local <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20North%20America">Archaic</a> () Picosa population. The Oshara occupied portions of northwestern New Mexico, northeastern Arizona, southeastern Utah, and central and southwestern Colorado. They harvested <a href="Black-tailed%20jackrabbit">jackrabbits</a> in the basin as early as 5500. Irwin-Williams divided the Oshara Tradition into six phases, and during the Armijo phase (1800 to 800) the Arroyo Cuervo area east of Chaco Canyon saw the introduction of maize and the use of rock shelters. She hypothesized that this period saw the beginning of seasonal gatherings of people from around the San Juan Basin, who eventually began to aggregate into larger social units.

By 200 BCE, the <a href="Basketmaker%20culture">Basketmaker culture</a> had begun to develop from the Oshara Tradition. At least two groups of transitional <a href="Late%20Basketmaker%20II%20Era">Basketmaker II</a> people inhabited the San Juan Basin during this period, as increased rainfall allowed for sustained agriculture and permanent settlements by 1 CE, when the water table rose and intermittent streams became more reliable. During the first four centuries CE, the Basketmaker II people established <a href="pit-house">pit-house</a>s at elevated locations near sources of water and arable land. <a href="Brian%20M.%20Fagan">Brian M. Fagan</a> notes that the development of pottery in the area during the 4th century permitted the boiling of maize and beans for the first time, and "must have brought a revolution in cooking". This period also marked the introduction of the bow and arrow to the region.

Parts of the San Juan Basin saw plentiful rainfall during the 5th to 8th centuries, leading to significant expansion of pit-house communities. Population increases during the 6th century led to the settlement of the area's lowlands, including Chaco Canyon, as the Basketmaker II people changed from a primarily hunter-gatherer society to one based on farming. This culture is known as <a href="Basketmaker%20III%20Era">Basketmaker III</a>, and by 500 at least two such settlements had been established in Chaco Canyon. An important phase of Basketmaker III people is known as the La Plata. One of the earliest La Plata phase sites, <a href="Shabik%27eshchee%20Village">Shabik'eshchee Village</a>, was continuously occupied until the early 8th century, when the canyon was home to a few hundred people. Several clusters of Basketmaker III sites have been identified in the vicinity of Chetro Ketl.

As the Basketmaker III people improved their farming techniques during the 8th century, the well-watered areas of the San Juan Basin became densely populated. Greater crop yields necessitated the construction of above-ground storage facilities, which were the first large-scale construction projects in the region. Fagan identifies this as the beginning of the first <a href="pueblo">pueblo</a>s, "ushering in a period of profound social tension, population movements, and political change." In his opinion, "by 800, there was no going back. The people of Chaco and elsewhere were locked completely into economies based on maize and bean cultivation." Archeologists refer to the period starting as the <a href="Pueblo%20I%20Period">Pueblo I Period</a>. By the early 10th century the large pit-house settlements had been supplanted by modular construction that later served as the foundation for the <a href="Ancestral%20Puebloans">Ancestral Puebloan</a> <a href="Great%20house%20%28pueblo%29">great houses</a>. This marks the beginning of the <a href="Bonito%20Phase">Bonito Phase</a>. During the 10th century, Chaco's population was swelled by a steady influx of immigrants from the <a href="San%20Juan%20River%20%28Colorado%20River%29">San Juan River</a>, approximately north. Fagan notes, "Within a few centuries, as rainfall became more irregular and life less predictable, the Chacoans embarked on a cultural trajectory that melded ancient traditions with new ideas that were to crystalize into a brilliant and short-lived Southwestern society."

Chaco Canyon lies at the geographic center of the San Juan Basin. It is located in northwestern New Mexico north of <a href="Interstate%2040">Interstate 40</a> and from <a href="Gallup%2C%20New%20Mexico">Gallup</a>, the nearest city. The <a href="continental%20divide">continental divide</a> is east. Chaco Canyon was created by the Chaco River, which cut several hundred feet into <a href="Chacra%20Mesa">Chacra Mesa</a>. The elevation of the <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> canyon and the surrounding high-desert terrain is approximately . Though most of the Chacoan sites are located at the bottom of the canyon, the group also includes some ruins not in the canyon proper, extending from <a href="Kin%20Ya%27a">Kin Ya'a</a> in the south to <a href="Pueblo%20Alto">Pueblo Alto</a> in the north, and from <a href="Pueblo%20Pintado%2C%20New%20Mexico">Pueblo Pintado</a> to the northeast and <a href="Pe%C3%B1asco%20Blanco">Peñasco Blanco</a> in the southwest. In terms of water drainage and cultural affinity, the area is part of the San Juan Basin, which includes <a href="Mesa%20Verde%20National%20Park">Mesa Verde</a> in Colorado and <a href="Kayenta%2C%20Arizona">Kayenta</a>, Arizona.

Chetro Ketl lies east of <a href="Pueblo%20Bonito">Pueblo Bonito</a>, in an area that archeologists call downtown Chaco. Scholars theorize that the area may be an ancestral sacred zone demarcated by a low masonry wall that encloses Chetro Ketl, Pueblo Bonito, and <a href="Pueblo%20del%20Arroyo">Pueblo del Arroyo</a>. Chetro Ketl's position is symmetrical to Pueblo Bonito; the buildings are equidistant from a north-south axis that runs across the canyon. Anna Sofaer proposed that many of the great houses in Chaco Canyon were constructed to emphasize astronomical alignments; during the minor <a href="lunar%20standstill">lunar standstill</a>, the full moon rises along Chetro Ketl's back wall.

Chetro Ketl is located opposite a large opening in the canyon known as South Gap, which helped maximize the building's exposure to the sun while increasing visibility and access to the south. Its rear wall runs parallel to the canyon, and at less than from the cliffs its proximity allowed inhabitants to benefit from passive solar energy emanating from the rocks. Chetro Ketl is not perfectly aligned to the <a href="cardinal%20directions">cardinal directions</a>, but its nominal southerly orientation further enhanced solar exposure to its tiered rooms.

Like other great houses in Chaco Canyon, Chetro Ketl was built over an extended period, during which the Ancestral Puebloans quarried large amounts of sandstone from the surrounding canyon. W. James Judge describes the period from 1030 to 1130 as "Chaco's golden century, a period virtually unmatched elsewhere in the <a href="Pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian</a> Southwest". By 1085, the Chacoans had constructed great houses at Chetro Ketl, Pueblo Alto, and Pueblo del Arroyo, during what Fagan describes as "a time of extraordinary growth and outreach".

In 1983, <a href="dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a> of wood samples from Chetro Ketl provided information on species selected, season of cutting, wood modification and use, as well as an estimate of the number of trees required to build the great house. Trees were harvested for construction at Chetro Ketl annually, which contrasts with the sporadic patterns found at other sites in the canyon. Whereas a late summer and early fall harvesting time has been documented at other Chacoan sites, the tree felling for Chetro Ketl was undertaken primarily during the spring and early summer. This may indicate that enough in-house labor was available during the farming season, or that specialized groups of Chacoans were dedicated to tree felling irrespective of the agriculture cycle, when most others were busy with field preparation and planting. One particularly well sampled room suggests that wood was cut during the relatively short span of a couple of weeks per season.

The most commonly harvested tree species was <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pine</a>; the Chacoans felled approximately 16,000 of them for use at Chetro Ketl, and the species is now absent from the canyon. Archeologists <a href="Florence%20M.%20Hawley">Florence M. Hawley</a> and <a href="Neil%20Judd">Neil Judd</a> proposed that a plentiful forest may have existed in and around the canyon during the 10th and 11th centuries, but was eventually destroyed by over-harvesting. Dean and Warren believe this is unlikely, but the presence of trees in the canyon during the 20th century "suggests that some pines may have been locally available for use in the large towns". In their opinion, "the harvesting of trees for Chacoan construction must have decimated ponderosa pine stands and forests for many miles in every direction from Chaco Canyon." Archeologists believe the trees were processed where they were cut, then carried, not dragged, back to Chaco Canyon.

A 2001 analysis of <a href="strontium">strontium</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s indicates that after 974 the Chacoans harvested architectural timbers primarily from two locations: the <a href="Chuska%20Mountains">Chuska Mountains</a> and <a href="Mount%20Taylor%20%28New%20Mexico%29">Mount Taylor</a>, in the <a href="San%20Mateo%20Mountains%20%28Cibola%20County%2C%20New%20Mexico%29">San Mateo Mountains</a>, both located approximately distant. Despite their equal proximity, they did not harvest from the <a href="Nacimiento%20Mountains">Nacimiento Mountains</a>. The selection of timbers from the Chuska and San Mateo ranges, and the avoidance of those from the Nacimiento Mountains, suggests that "regional socioeconomic ties" factored more heavily into timber procurement than "resource depletion with distance and time".

Nearly 78 percent of the estimated 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were felled for <a href="kiva">kiva</a> (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, and one or two layers of <a href="shake%20%28shingle%29">split shake</a>s, probably of a <a href="juniper">juniper</a> species or <a href="pinyon%20pine">pinyon pine</a>, which were locally available. Most of the primary and secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting <a href="Mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a> and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.

Chetro Ketl's walls were constructed using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone that forms the bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as it was easier to shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but much more difficult to work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.

The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand and water to make mud mortar. They obtained most of the material from canyon deposits, but some of the clays may have been collected from the base of the cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.

Only the most highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried supplies and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called <a href="core-and-veneer">core-and-veneer</a>, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid at the same time as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.

Chacoan wall faces are typically called "veneers", but they were integral load-bearing elements rather than decorative overlays. The veneers are known for their attention to coursing and detail, and various styles have become synonymous with Chacoan building. Depending on the facing style, the joints between the stones would be filled with <a href="spall">spall</a>s or chinks, set in mud mortar; or the coursing could alternate between larger stones and several courses of smaller tablets. Good veneer minimized the amount of exposed mortar, which reduced maintenance, maximized stone contact, and increased the strength of the wall. It also reduced the possibility of structural failure. Aside from structural considerations, some veneers are the result of highly skilled masons working within well-developed craft traditions. Recurring veneer patterns may indicate a widespread style used during a particular period, or they may suggest the work of a specific social group or line of builders.

Doors and vents often had sills of carefully ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from a row of thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered in a rock veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called <a href="McElmo%20Phase">McElmo style</a>, from his typology.

In 1934, Florence Hawley used 143 tree-ring dates and a comparative masonry analysis to assemble a construction history of Chetro Ketl in three major periods: 945–1030, from which no significant elements are observable; 1030–90, when construction and remodeling produced most of the building's extant features; and 1100–16, which saw renovation of existing features. In 1983, comprehensive architectural studies by Lekson and McKenna and dendrochronological reanalysis by Dean and Warren largely verified Hawley's construction phases, with significant additions and clarifications. Lekson, Thomas C. Windes, and Patricia Fournier, authors of "The Changing Faces of Chetro Ketl", date the beginning of construction to 990–1000; they based their estimate on 1,285 dated elements from the great house. In their opinion, Chetro Ketl was largely complete by 1075, with periodic construction occurring there until the mid-1110s, when the great kiva was remodeled.

Hawley's first period (945–1030) was suggested by tree ring dates scattered throughout later parts of Chetro Ketl. Archeologists subsequently discovered that her second period (1030–90) structure was built directly over an earlier (990–1030) one-story-tall, two-room-wide row of rooms. Lekson shortened Hawley's second period to 1030–75, and subdivided it into at least eight different construction events, including the successive additions of upper stories along the main room block, running the length of the building. After 1075, construction consisted of minor additions and alternations, with the exception of a row of three large, Chaco-style second- and third-story round rooms that were added to the plaza-facing center of the main room block during 1075–95. Much of the later construction, including the large Chaco-style kivas, was in McElmo style masonry, using shaped blocks of relatively soft tan colored sandstone instead of the previously preferred harder, denser dark brown sandstone, which may have been quarried out in the central canyon after 1075. Chetro Ketl required an estimated 50 million sandstone blocks and more than 500,000 <a href="man-hour">man-hour</a>s to complete.

The McElmo Phase was a period in the late 11th and early 12th centuries, when major changes in ceramics and masonry techniques appeared in Chaco Canyon. Chacoans started using painted black-on-white pottery, and the masonry and layout of great houses built during the period, which was the last major construction era in the canyon, differs significantly from those built during the Bonito Phase (850 to 1140). Archeologists initially believed that the McElmo style was brought to Chaco Canyon by immigrants from Mesa Verde, but subsequent research suggests the developments were of local origin. McElmo black-on-white pottery was abundant in later contexts at Chetro Ketl, and the problematic McElmo style masonry was used in several later additions to the building, including very characteristic Chaco-style kivas.

Chetro Ketl's Kiva G complex was constructed using McElmo-type masonry, and ceramic evidence uncovered from refuse found in the great house indicates a significant McElmo presence. Much of the masonry in North Block F also appears to be McElmo style. A smaller square building known as the Talus Unit lies just west of Chetro Ketl; it contains some McElmo style features. R. Gwinn Vivian (son of Gordon Vivian) notes, "The jury is still out on this question, a problem that poses intriguing possibilities for future work."

The Ancestral Puebloans relied on regular rainfall to sustain their agricultural society. This proved challenging in Chaco Canyon, even with consistent precipitation. By 1130, the rains had diminished and the maize crops that the Chacoans depended on had begun to fail, as the region increasingly suffered from the effects of a devastating, fifty-year drought. After a continuous occupation of more than six hundred years, the Chacoans began to migrate from the canyon. Fagan states that by 1140 "Chaco was finished". A study of 12th-century burials in the Gallup, New Mexico, area indicates as many as half of the people who lived during the drought died before the age of eighteen, with sixty percent of all deaths occurring before age thirty-five. The study estimated that for every woman, four children were needed to sustain the agriculture workforce.

The turning point for Chacoan culture prior to the widespread crop failures of 1130 to 1180 was the especially dry period from 1090 to 1095. Emigration from Chaco Canyon increased significantly during this period, and Puebloan construction in outlying communities such as Mesa Verde, <a href="Salmon%20Ruins">Salmon</a>, and <a href="Aztec%20Ruins%20National%20Monument">Aztec</a>, began to flourish. Despite rapid depopulation in the canyon, Chetro Ketl's great kiva may have been remodeled and used during the early 13th century. A haphazardly applied layer of rubble veneer to ceremonial areas in the great kiva is thought to have been added during an "organized closure" that probably included a "termination ceremony". Ancient potsherds indicate that the last inhabitants of Chetro Ketl vacated the structure by 1250.

In the years following the Ancestral Puebloan's departure from Chaco Canyon, several migrations to the region occurred. During the 15th century, <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo people</a> emigrated to the area from northwestern Canada, and in the 18th century Spanish explorers and settlers came from the south. The Spanish investigated parts of the San Juan Basin, but there is no record of them ever finding Chaco Canyon. When cartographer <a href="Bernardo%20de%20Miera%20y%20Pacheco">Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco</a> drew a map in 1774 of Spanish land holdings in the region, he labeled Chaco Canyon with the word "Chaca", but it is unlikely he ever visited the area. In 1823 the governor of New Mexico, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Antonio%20Vizcarra">José Antonio Vizcarra</a>, discovered ancient ruins in the canyon during a military campaign against the Navajo. Vizcarra's account is the first historical record of the Chacoan great houses that were "of such antiquity that their inhabitants were not known to Europeans". In 1844, <a href="Josiah%20Gregg">Josiah Gregg</a> made the first published reference to Chaco Canyon in his popular book, "Commerce of the Prairies".

The United States started exploring the region following the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> of 1846–48 and the acquisition of the <a href="New%20Mexico%20Territory">New Mexico Territory</a>. During a military campaign against the Navajo in 1849, Lieutenant James Simpson of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> became interested in the canyon's ruins. A group led by the governor of <a href="Jemez%20Pueblo%2C%20New%20Mexico">Jemez Pueblo</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Hosta">Francisco Hosta</a>, explored the canyon; its members included Simpson and the brothers Richard and Edward Kern, who were respectively an artist and a cartographer. Simpson was impressed by Chetro Ketl's masonry, which he described as "a combination of science and art which can only be referred to a higher stage of civilization and refinement than is discoverable in the works of Mexicans or Pueblos of the present day." Simpson and company documented their findings, noting the location and style of the great houses, taking measurements, and sketching the canyon's major ruins. They described the kivas as "circular apartments sunk in the ground". Simpson briefly explored Chetro Ketl, documenting six of its round rooms and 124 rooms on the ground floor of the four-story building. He noted an especially well preserved room where "the stone walls still have their plaster upon them in a tolerable state of preservation." Vivian credits Simpson's 1850 report detailing their brief exploration of the canyon and Richard H. Kern's lithographs as the beginning of Chacoan archeology. The scientific investigation of Chaco Canyon started when <a href="Richard%20Wetherill">Richard Wetherill</a> began his exploration of the canyon in 1895. Wetherill was well known for his discovery of some of the largest Ancestral Puebloan dwellings in Mesa Verde, and after an invitation from amateur archeologist Sidney Palmer to survey Chaco Canyon, organized a one-month expedition to the region. He secured financial backing for a full season soon afterward, and in 1896 full-scale excavations began at Pueblo Bonito.

The true origin and meaning of "Chetro Ketl" is unknown. Lekson and Peter J. McKenna note that, although most of the names given to Chacoan ruins are either Spanish or Navajo, "Chetro Ketl is neither." A Mexican guide who worked for the first American expedition in 1849 translated it as "rain town". In 1889, Navajo historian Washington Mathews reported that in Navajo mythology the building is referred to as "Kintyél" or "Kintyéli", which means "broad-house". Other Navajo translations include "house in the corner" and "shining house".

The first formal excavation of Chetro Ketl was conducted during 1920 and 1921 by <a href="Edgar%20Lee%20Hewett">Edgar L. Hewett</a>, director of Chaco Canyon's first archeological field school. He visited the canyon in 1902, and in 1916 he arranged for the <a href="School%20for%20Advanced%20Research">School of American Research</a> to participate in excavations at Chetro Ketl with the <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a> and the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>. He made some preliminary studies at the end of 1916, but <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> caused the delay of his plans. When work resumed in 1920, financial considerations forced the Smithsonian to withdraw its support.

Hewett suspended his research during Judd's 1924–27 excavation of Pueblo Bonito, financed by the <a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic Society</a>, but returned to Chetro Ketl in 1929 with <a href="Postgraduate%20education">graduate students</a> from his newly founded Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the <a href="University%20of%20New%20Mexico">University of New Mexico</a>. He studied the canyon until 1935, and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period, including Gordon Vivian (father of R. Gwinn Vivian), Edwin Ferdon, Paul Reiter, and Florence M. Hawley. Hewett's methods have been widely criticized, and his work judged to have been substandard, particularly in comparison to the work done by the National Geographic Project. He spent several years excavating Chetro Ketl, but never published a detailed account of his research there. Despite this, much is known about his studies from the theses and dissertations written by students who worked with him.

Hawley began her studies with Hewett in 1929, focusing primarily on dendrochronology and ceramic dating. She spent two summers excavating Chetro Ketl's <a href="Midden">refuse mound</a>, and demonstrated that charcoal found in it could be used for tree-ring dating. Her 1933 doctoral dissertation showed that the mound's layers represent a <a href="reverse%20stratigraphy">reverse stratigraphy</a>. Material from older refuse mounds was often moved and placed on top of contemporary debris. It was then covered by layers of daily waste before still more older debris was piled on top. This resulted in newer material accumulating at the base of the pile, and older material accruing near the top. Subsequent excavations indicated that the mound was likely created by more than typical household waste; numerous layers of it are composed of refuse from large-scale feasts that included the ritualistic smashing of pottery. Hawley worked at the site through 1933, and in Fagan's opinion her comparison dating of masonry walls and potsherds significantly enhanced the study of Chacoan culture. He credits her with aiding the establishment of one of archeology's most accurate chronologies. In 1983, as the only surviving member of Hewett's 1929–33 group of researchers, Hawley noted the difficulties of excavating Chaco Canyon during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>: "The young archeologists and dendrochronologists of today, struggling to reconstruct Chetro Ketl from the notes, maps, and too scanty publications and incomplete collections of the past, know little of the exigencies which have made their task difficult."

In 1921, Hewett excavated Chetro Ketl's great kiva, where he discovered a more ancient one buried below. He also found several <a href="macaw">macaw</a> feathers, but no copper bells like those found at Pueblo Bonito. Hewett was surprised at the lack of exotic items at the site, where no human burials have been found. In 1931 and 1932, Reiter and Gordon Vivian discovered caches of turquoise beads and pendants while digging in the great kiva. In all, 17,454 beads were recovered from the kiva's buried niches. In 1947, when flood waters from Chaco Wash encroached on Chetro Ketl, Vivian rescued a stash of wooden artifacts from an unexcavated room. Archeologists consider the wooden figures, some of which depict birds, unique in the region. Several black-and-white stone necklaces was also uncovered. Barbara J. Mills, author of "Key Debates in Chacoan Archaeology", believes the items represent "evidence of intense ceremonial activity" at Chetro Ketl. Lekson notes that after "spectacular amounts of material" were recovered at Pueblo Bonito, "expectations for Chetro Ketl were undoubtedly high", and although Hewett and his students were ultimately disappointed, he describes the wooden artifacts as "an extraordinary collection". Despite this, scholars continue to regard Chetro Ketl as a place where relatively few items of archeological interest have been uncovered.

Several minerals used for paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, <a href="shale">shale</a>, <a href="malachite">malachite</a>, iron oxides, <a href="hematite">hematite</a>, <a href="limonite">limonite</a>, gypsum, and <a href="azurite">azurite</a>. Twined sandals, and bones from the <a href="ferruginous%20hawk">ferruginous hawk</a> and the great <a href="horned%20owl">horned owl</a> have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items have been found in abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the University of New Mexico and the School of American Research.

Lekson describes Chetro Ketl as "notoriously sterile", and states that "it is impossible to say how much material was recovered during the many seasons" of excavation there. Field notes indicate that while several major artifacts, including baskets, sandals, painted wood fragments, digging sticks, arrow heads, and crushed pots were found at the great house, the whereabouts of most of these items is "one of the great archaeological mysteries of the Southwest". He ascribes the "almost total disappearance" of the Chetro Ketl artifacts, which were viewed as unimpressive in comparison to those found at Pueblo Bonito, as a consequence of Hewett's flippant treatment of the collection. The <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Mexico">Museum of New Mexico</a> holds several items excavated from Chetro Ketl, including pieces of turquoise, a black-on-white pottery canteen, and a fourteen-foot-long stone and shell necklace.

Chetro Ketl contained approximately 400 rooms and was the largest great house by area in Chaco Canyon; sections of it reached four stories, three of which remain. The building covers nearly , with approximately half of that in the enclosed plaza, which was lined by wings of rooms to the north, east, and west. Chetro Ketl's perimeter is . The great house is a D-shaped structure; its east-facing wall is long, and the north wall is more than long. Rooms were constructed three-deep and three or four stories tall, and terraced so that the ground level that faced the plaza in the center of the building was one-story.

Chetro Ketl had twelve kivas: two large ones in the west wing plaza, one of which is a great kiva, and ten in the central room block, including one known as a tower kiva. The refuse mound was long, wide, and tall; it contained between of debris. Chetro Ketl's plaza is raised above the surrounding land by , a feature that is unique in the canyon, where the plazas of all other great houses are level with the surrounding landscape.

At the front of the building is a mysterious feature consisting of two closely spaced parallel walls that archeologists call "the moat". The long and narrow chamber runs along the outside wall, and appears to have been backfilled around the same time that the plaza was raised, . The original purpose of the feature is unknown, but tunnels between rooms are found in more northerly Puebloan sites, and the moat would have facilitated movement between Chetro Ketl's wings.

A narrow slit along the north wall's outside surface indicates the presence of an ancient balcony. There are several rooms attached to the rear of the structure that lack direct access to the main building; these are believed to have been dedicated to community storage. Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito are the only two great houses in Chaco Canyon with corner doorways.

Great kivas are always much larger and deeper than Chaco-style kivas. Whereas the walls of great kivas always extend above the surrounding landscape, the walls of Chaco-style kivas are flush with the surrounding landscape. Chaco-style kivas are often found incorporated into the central room blocks of great houses, but great kivas are always separate from core structures. Great kivas almost always have a bench that encircles the inner space, but this feature is not found in Chaco-style kivas. Great kivas also tend to include floor vaults, which may have served as foot drums for ceremonial dancers, but Chaco-style kivas do not.

Whereas many of the great kivas in Chaco Canyon are located adjacent to or isolated from their associated great house, Chetro Ketl's, which is in diameter, lies within the pueblo's walls. The earliest and lowest floor lies below the current plaza surface. The present floor of the kiva is on average below. Several peripheral rooms abutted the structure, which is located in the southeast corner of the space; a smaller round room, known as the Court Kiva, lies to the west, in the plaza's south-central area. The Court Kiva began as a Chaco-style kiva, but was later remodeled to include several of the defining features of a great kiva.

The outer walls of the great kiva are to thick, and date to 1062–90. Hawley identified the masonry as Type III, with a crude Type IV veneer covering the bench that postdates the final construction period (1100–16). An by <a href="antechamber">antechamber</a> is attached to the north end of the space; the passageway between them contained a stairway that rose in nine steps from the kiva floor.

Though few remains of it were found, the great kiva's roof was most likely flat rather than domed, as was typical of smaller kivas in the canyon. It was supported by four large posts, upon which four more beams were attached. This formed the roof's main structure, which was covered with a layer of secondary beams, then juniper splints and bark, before being finished with clay. It is not known if the roofs of great kivas were constructed level with the exterior walls or raised above them, but it is believed that the space between the floor and the roof in Chetro Ketl's great kiva was probably not much more than what would be required for average standing height, approximately .

Thirty-nine crypts, measuring approximately in height, wide, and deep, have been uncovered in the great kiva. They are spaced approximately apart and located around the inner circumference of the outer wall. Some artifacts have been recovered from the crypts, but their purpose is unknown; they may have been shelves or specialized altars. A large bench, measuring wide by tall, encircles the inside of the space. A firebox, measuring by and tall, was located south of the center of the kiva, and a fire screen that helped supply draft air was located away from the firebox.

The site contains a <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a> that Lekson, Windes, and Fournier describe as "prominent, even dominating within the plaza", and "possibly the defining form at Chetro Ketl or even at Chaco." It is not only unique to Chaco Canyon, but also to Ancestral Puebloan architecture as a whole. The nearest similar structure is located more than five hundred miles away at <a href="Casas%20Grandes">Casas Grandes</a>, in northwestern Mexico. Constructed sometime after 1105, the plaza-facing columns were among the last additions to Chetro Ketl. The colonnade's placement and orientation to the canyon indicate that it was intended to be viewed from inside the building. It was later filled in with masonry to accommodate additional living space. It was long and contained thirteen columns.

Several scholars have detected a <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n influence in the feature; Ferdon described it as a "column-fronted gallery" that was "wholly untraditional" in Ancestral Puebloan architecture. He proposed that it was inspired by a <a href="Quetzalcoatl">Quetzalcoatl</a> cult whose traditions were brought to the region by "<a href="pochteca">pochteca</a>" traders. In his opinion the influence can also be seen in the site's tower kiva. Lekson, Windes, and Fournier believe the architectural parallels between the colonnade at Chetro Ketl and structures in Mexico "are probably attributable to the adoption of Mesoamerican symbols appropriated by the flow of ideas carried by merchants". In their opinion, the connection "may have been the result of an interaction mechanism of indirect contact between nuclear Mesoamerica and Chaco though northwestern Mexico." They believe the colonnade "is a local architectural interpretation of Mexican models, modified to suit local materials and techniques."

Chaco Canyon is watered by winter storms and localized summer rains that fill the <a href="Arroyo%20%28creek%29">arroyo</a>s. <a href="Chaco%20Wash">Chaco Wash</a> is deep, and it drains to the water table located below the canyon floor. Farming terraces on the mesa wall behind Chetro Ketl may have been used for growing specialized crops such as tobacco, and canals running from Pueblo Bonito to Chetro Ketl probably carried rain water. Chetro Ketl's position in downtown Chaco and its proximity to South Gap further aided agricultural efforts near the great house, as summer storms tended to linger in the opening, funneling moisture to the area.

There is no obvious visual evidence of the linear features usually associated with farm fields in the land surrounding Chetro Ketl, but in 1929 aerial black-and-white images by <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> revealed what appeared to be a rectangular plot. In the early 1970s the National Park Service (NPS) developed a remote sensing program to further investigate the area using color video imagery. When enhanced and viewed in black-and-white, the video revealed a well-defined grid pattern within a larger rectangular section of land near Chetro Ketl. The NPS employed two types of ground level remote sensing devices to search for magnetic and soil anomalies in the <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a> of the canyon floor. A soil density study proved inconclusive, but a <a href="magnetometer">magnetometer</a> identified a rectangular feature , roughly the same size as those seen in Lindbergh's aerial photographs. The NPS researchers proposed that water had deposited iron-bearing clays in the plots, with the center showing the strongest magnetic evidence. Subsequent comparisons with older data reinforced their conclusion. They determined that had the plots been under heavy alluvium they would not have been detected.

In Vivian's opinion, the Chetro Ketl field represents one of the best examples of Chacoan farming. Approximately of land were divided into 42 plots measuring , with parallel irrigation canals that supplied water to individual parcels. Several scholars have disputed this interpretation, suggesting that the area may instead be the location of an unfinished great house, or it could have been used for mixing mortar or raising frogs and freshwater shrimp. Soil analysis indicates that the field received water from both Chaco Wash and side canyons. Twenty-three similar fields have been detected in Chaco Canyon, but Chetro Ketl's is the only one that has been extensively surveyed. Archeologists estimate that between of arable land was available to Chacoan farmers, whose crops could support approximately 4,000 people. Archeomagnetic analysis indicates the Chetro Ketl field was last used in 1250.

Studies of ancient corn cobs found at Pueblo Bonito suggest that large quantities of the foodstuff were imported to the canyon from the Chuska Mountains, west, and the San Juan and <a href="Animas%20River">Animas River</a> areas, north. Archeologists believe the corn was imported to help feed groups of laborers during large-scale construction projects. The corn cobs are longer, with more rows of kernels, than most examples from the region. This may indicate genetic differences, superior growing conditions, or "preferential watering" of crops intended for consumption at Chaco Canyon.

The black-on-white painted pottery found at Chaco Canyon originated from various places throughout the <a href="Four%20Corners">Four Corners</a> region, including the Red Mesa Valley, northeastern Arizona, the San Juan River, and the <a href="Chuska%20Valley">Chuska Valley</a>, forty miles distant. Whereas most of the gray ware, non-decorative or utility, pottery uncovered at Puebloan sites was produced locally, more than half of the vessels found in the canyon were imported from places like the Chuska Valley, which supplied the majority of utility pottery found in the region.

Red wares were imported from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery was fired in the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to a steady supply of firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own.

Lekson believes that Chetro Ketl was most likely not occupied by scores of families, and in that sense was not a pueblo as early archeologists had concluded. He also notes that, while most if not all round rooms in the canyon have traditionally been labeled as kivas, the smaller ones found at Chetro Ketl were most likely not kivas, "but the final and most elaborate form of the pit-house", which had served as the region's primary housing structure during the five hundred years prior to the settlement of Chaco Canyon. He proposed that Chacoan great houses were royal palaces; Chetro Ketl was a residence for the elite, but also a central location for governance, storage, craftworks, ritual, and bureaucracy. Many scholars disagree because they assume "palaces imply states", and "it is generally accepted that no Native state ever existed" north of Mexico. In his opinion, the view that palaces cannot exist outside states is misguided, and societies like Chaco may have achieved comparable political complexity on a smaller than typical scale. He considers the political "glass celling" an "almost racist" remnant of early archeologists who assumed Native American political sophistication was, by definition, limited to "chiefdoms" and not capable of attaining statehood.

The consistent lack of artifacts and features in excavated Chacoan rooms suggests they were used primarily for grain storage, but because their combined areas appear to exceed what would reasonably have been needed for foodstuffs – a large crop of corn from all the arable land near Chaco would fit into two rows of rooms at Chetro Ketl – this interpretation lacks support amongst archeologists. Because so many of these rooms are featureless interior spaces that lie below several stories, the scale of their construction may have been motivated by what architects call "massing"; building structures with the primary intention of impressing onlookers.

The rooms of Chetro Ketl may have served as storage space for ritual objects, and the great house may have been occupied primarily by groups of priests, also housing pilgrims during community events, when the population of the canyon increased dramatically. Judge notes that these pilgrims probably assisted in the construction of Chetro Ketl, thus "confirming their affiliation with the larger ritual alliance". The area between Chetro Ketl and Pueblo Bonito may have served as a central location for ceremonies. Because water was crucial to their survival, Chacoan rituals most likely focused on prayers for rain.

A long-distance communication system that used smoke and mirrors existed in the region, and direct lines of sight have been established between Pueblo Alto, <a href="Hu%C3%A9rfano%20Mountain">Huérfano Mountain</a> in northern New Mexico, and <a href="Chimney%20Rock%20National%20Monument">Chimney Rock Pueblo</a> in southern Colorado. Messages could have been relayed between these three points within minutes. On the mesa behind Chaco Canyon is an ancient road that runs north from Chetro Ketl, then northward along the east side of Pueblo Alto before joining with the <a href="Great%20North%20Road%20%28Ancestral%20Puebloans%29">Great North Road</a>. The Pueblo Alto road network functioned between 1050 and 1140. It facilitated access to watering holes, terraced farming areas, and enabled interaction between Pueblo Alto and great houses like Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl. It also led to a community along <a href="Escavada%20Wash">Escavada Wash</a>. It may have served an important function in the transport of household goods, construction timber, and people throughout the San Juan Basin. Several road segments appear to be related to a row of Chetro Ketl's exterior rooms, which are thought to have been community storage space.

In 1982 Robert Powers theorized that the road network "suggests an intercommunity organization and settlement system of regional extent". Because "Chaco Canyon is the convergence point of all presently documented extra-canyon roads", the area may represent a locus of regional control, or "the apex of the hierarchical system". Powers believes that great houses like Chetro Ketl were involved in civic coordination between the canyon sites and outlying communities. In 1993 David R. Wilcox proposed that a state-level society developed at Chaco, with an administrative center at Pueblo Bonito or Chetro Ketl. In a 2003 study of Chacoan artifacts, Frances Joan Mathien stated that the number of warrior-class individuals that would have been needed to support such a state – Wilcox estimated 500–1,000 – precludes his theory, and Wilcox is assuming a "greater Chacoan organizational complexity than any other scholar to date".

Lekson developed a theory called the <a href="Chaco%20Meridian">Chaco Meridian</a>, which is based on architectural similarities between the Ancestral Puebloan sites at Aztec Ruins and Chaco Canyon, and Paquime at Casas Grandes in northern Mexico. He believes the sites were intentionally located on the same approximate line of longitude (107°57'25"), and this indicates a ceremonial connection between them. The Great North Road roughly follows the Chaco Meridian, and many of the ancient roads in the area appear to follow it towards key sites in the basin.

Judge notes that "virtually all researchers recognize a strong ritual component to Chacoan authority and view the Chacoans as having formed a regional center with a compelling and integrating body of ceremony at its core." Preliminary population estimates for the canyon ranged as high as ten thousand people, but in his opinion a figure closer to two thousand is more likely. He views Chaco as a ceremonial center and a "place of ritual architecture", which pilgrims from throughout the San Juan Basin's two hundred great house communities would visit. These pilgrims brought large quantities of goods and raw materials to the canyon, including exotics such as turquoise and shell beads, and also ceramics, timber, and food.

<a href="Neutron%20activation%20analysis">Neutron activation analysis</a> linked an artifact from Chetro Ketl to the <a href="Cerrillos%20Turquoise%20Mines">Cerrillos Turquoise Mines</a>, located south of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Analysis of chipped stone from Chetro Ketl's trash mound indicates that more than fifty percent of the <a href="chert">chert</a> found there was imported from Washington Pass in the Chuska Mountains, away. The Chacoans enjoyed a bounty of imports from throughout the San Juan Basin, but little evidence of exports from the canyon has been found. This suggests they were consumers, but not producers or distributors of goods.

Scholars continue to debate whether Chacoan organization was based on primarily political or primarily ritual considerations. Archeological evidence suggests that the residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements, which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems. Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society, with an economy driven by its function as the region's ceremonial center. Because there has been little to no modern excavation in the canyon, the question remains largely unanswered. Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided, because the Chacoans were most likely deeply influenced by both.

Lekson believes that by the later period (1075 to 1140) "Pueblo Bonito, Chetro Ketl and Pueblo del Arroyo ... together with the numerous other structures in the central canyon, should be considered a coherent analytical settlement unit." He views the structures near South Gap "as a larger settlement of significant complexity" that "when coupled with Chaco's regional centrality and relatively high population density" should be considered "nearly urban". He notes that by the mid-12th century, "Chaco was much closer to being a city than simply a canyon full of independent agricultural towns and villages." At its peak, the Chacoan system covered an estimated , an area roughly the size of Portugal. The population of the region at the beginning of the 11th century was approximately 55,000 people.

Lekson and McKenna note that following the rediscovery of Chetro Ketl in the early 19th century, the building's "pace of dissolution increased alarmingly ... [it] has deteriorated at a faster rate over the last century and a half than in the previous six." Chetro Ketl's wooden elements have proven especially vulnerable in a region that lacks timber, with soldiers, cattlemen, and transients scavenging them from the structure. The rear balcony was present in 1901, but by 1921 the beams had been removed by people scouring the canyon for wood. The process of uncovering beams during excavation has further hastened their deterioration. Chaco Wash, which deepens and widens during summer rain showers, also threatens the canyon's ruins. The once prominent refuse mound has been all but destroyed by repeated trenching and by diverting arroyos near Chetro Ketl. Treasure hunting, livestock grazing, and early <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> stabilization efforts also contributed to the degradation of the structure, as have deep excavations that left Chaco Wash prone to flooding. Archeology was responsible for the catastrophic effects of a 1947 flood that destroyed the walls of twenty rooms and collapsed of the north wall. It also toppled Chetro Ketl's tallest remnants.

During the late 1980s, a reburial program was undertaken at Chetro Ketl that sought to preserve the structure's original timbers by backfilling portions of the site with soil. Because only a thin layer of overburden was applied, specialized <a href="Geosynthetics">geosynthetic</a> materials were added to help keep the area dry. The program also developed techniques that facilitate the sampling of ancient wood for assessment of deterioration. Lekson and McKenna note, "the visible building is far from pristine. Most walls have undergone generations of structural and cosmetic treatment ... Chetro Ketl is an artifact deteriorating before our eyes. If the reader is inspired to questions that cannot be answered by the present study, be advised that Chetro Ketl's ability to answer in detail is slowly, but surely, disappearing."

William Cragh

William Cragh (born ca. 1262, died some time after 1307), was a medieval Welsh warrior and supporter of <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Maredudd">Rhys ap Maredudd</a>, lord of the lands of <a href="Ystrad%20Tywi">Ystrad Tywi</a>, in his rebellion against King <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a>. Captured in 1290 by the son of <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%201st%20Baron%20Braose">William de Briouze</a>, the <a href="Cambro-Norman">Cambro-Norman</a> Lord of <a href="Lordship%20of%20Gower">Gower</a>, he was tried and found guilty of having killed thirteen men. Cragh was executed just outside Swansea within sight of de Briouze's <a href="Swansea%20Castle">Swansea Castle</a>, twice, as the gallows collapsed during his first hanging. Lady Mary de Briouze decided for reasons unknown to <a href="intercession%20of%20saints">intercede</a> on Cragh's behalf, and prayed to the deceased <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>, <a href="Thomas%20de%20Cantilupe">Thomas de Cantilupe</a>, requesting him to ask God to bring Cragh back from the dead. Cragh began to show signs of life the day after his execution, and over the subsequent few weeks made a full recovery, living for at least another eighteen years.

The main primary source for Cragh's story is the record of the investigation into the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe, which is held in the <a href="Vatican%20Library">Vatican Library</a>. Cragh's resurrection was one of thirty-eight miracles presented to the papal commissioners who in 1307 were charged with examining the evidence for Cantilupe's saintliness. The hanged man himself gave evidence to the commission, after which nothing more is known of him. Cantilupe was formally canonised by <a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a> on 17 April 1320.

William Cragh was born in about 1262 in the Welsh parish of <a href="List%20of%20villages%20in%20Gower%23Llanrhidian">Llanrhidian</a>, <a href="Gower%20Peninsula">Gower</a>, to Rhys ap Gwilym and his wife Swanith. Between 1282 and 1283 King <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a> waged a military campaign in Wales that concluded with his annexation of that country. One of Edward's allies, <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Maredudd">Rhys ap Maredudd</a>, found the post-war settlement unsatisfactory and launched a rebellion against the king in 1287. Edward's vastly superior forces soon crushed the uprising, but Rhys ap Maredudd remained at liberty until his capture and execution in 1292. Cragh probably took part in the rebellion on the Welsh side. He was apprehended in 1290 by the <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Braose">son</a> of <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%201st%20Baron%20Braose">William de Briouze</a>, the <a href="Lordship%20of%20Gower">Lord of Gower</a>, who was defending his father's lands against incursions by the rebels still at large. Cragh was one of 14 prisoners captured by de Briouze, 12 of whom were subsequently released. He was taken to Swansea Castle, where he was held in the dungeons awaiting trial, accused of killing 13 men.

The <a href="Cyfraith%20Hywel">law in Wales at that time</a> permitted condemned men to atone for their crimes by making a payment to their victims. Cragh's friends and family rallied round to offer 100 cows to de Briouze for his release, but the offer was refused. The substantial scale of the proposed compensation indicates that Cragh was an important man, although some witnesses described him as a thief rather than a rebel. Historian Jussi Hanska has suggested that de Briouze's refusal to accept the offer strengthens the case for Cragh being a rebel, as there is no other convincing reason to explain why he should have opted to "decline good income just to hang a thief".

Cragh pleaded innocence of the charges against him, but he was nevertheless found guilty and sentenced to be hanged.

Cragh was hanged on a hill about a quarter of a mile (400 m) outside Swansea, in sight of de Briouze's Swansea Castle, on Monday 27 November 1290. He was executed along with another "malefactor", Trahaern ap Hywel. Although the latter was dealt with by the town executioner, Cragh was hanged by one of his own relatives, Ythel Fachan, who was forced into that service by de Briouze. Trahaern ap Hywel was a large and powerful man who struggled a great deal as he was hauled up from the ground by his neck, causing the crossbeam of the gallows to break. Although the executioner, John of Baggeham, considered both men to be already dead when they fell to the ground they were nevertheless hanged again, "as an insult to their kin", and because it was the usual custom that hanged men could not be removed from the gallows without the lord's permission. The execution took place early in the morning, and the two men were left swinging from the gallows. John of Baggeham reported that he cut down Cragh's body at about 4:00 pm and sent it into the town at the request of William de Briouze's wife, Lady Mary. It is unclear what became of Trahaern ap Hywel, but his body may have been buried by the gallows.

The younger William de Briouze visited the house in Swansea to which Cragh's corpse had been taken that evening, and what he saw convinced him that Cragh was dead. Describing the scene some years later he recalled that:

Witnesses reported that Cragh had voided his bowels and bladder while hanging from the gallows, which was considered at that time to be a sign of death.

Historian <a href="Robert%20Bartlett%20%28historian%29">Robert Bartlett</a> has commented that "one of the largest uncertainties in the whole story of the death and resurrection of William Cragh is why Lady Mary [de Briouze] interceded for him", but intercede she did. John of Baggeham, when questioned about her motivation 18 years after the event, could only reply that "Lady Mary had sought the body of this William, he did not know why". Before the execution she had asked her husband to spare the two condemned men, but he had refused. Then on hearing that Trahaern ap Hywel was dead, and believing that Cragh was still alive, she once again asked that he be handed over to her, but de Briouze delayed until he was convinced that Cragh was also dead. Then "he granted him [Cragh] to the said lady, such as he was, and ordered him to be taken down from the gallows". Lady Mary had "a special devotion" to Thomas de Cantilupe, the deceased Bishop of Hereford, and in her own words, upon hearing of Cragh's death, "on bended knee, she asked Saint Thomas de Cantilupe to ask God to restore life to William Cragh".

Cantilupe had died in Italy on 25 August 1282; his flesh was buried in that country after having been boiled from his bones, which were taken back to England. Cantilupe's tomb at Hereford Cathedral soon became the centre of a "pilgrim cult", and miracles began to be attributed to him. Lady Mary sent one of her ladies-in-waiting to measure Cragh's body with a length of thread, which implied a promise to offer to the saint a candle the length of the person on whose behalf the saint was being asked to intercede should the intercession be successful, a common practice during the medieval period.

Cragh's recovery began the day after his hanging, but it was some time – one witness said 15 days – before he was able to stand unaided. That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle, as miracles were supposed to be immediate, but "partial miracles" could be explained by the "lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow". Once sufficiently recovered, Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The chaplain, William of Codineston, was also present. Cragh explained, "with great fear and apprehension" according to the chaplain, that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him. His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again, and he had good reason to be worried. Although those who survived were usually pardoned, it was not unknown for them to be hanged again. Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe, or he may simply have decided that it would be prudent for him to go along with the story for his own safety. Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop dressed all in white appeared, and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth.

Once he was sufficiently recovered Cragh undertook a pilgrimage to Hereford, accompanied by Lord and Lady Briouze, to thank Cantilupe for restoring his life. He walked barefoot on the three-day trip, wearing the rope he had been hanged with around his neck. The rope was left at Cantilupe's shrine, after which Cragh said that he would make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, although there is some doubt as to whether he subsequently even left Wales. Jussi Hanska has suggested that Cragh may have invented the pilgrimage story to escape from his companions.

<a href="Richard%20Swinefield">Richard Swinefield</a>, Cantilupe's successor as Bishop of Hereford, wrote to <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20IV">Pope Nicholas IV</a> in a letter dated 19 April 1290 proposing the bishop for canonisation, but it was not until 1307 that an investigation into Cantilupe's saintliness was initiated by <a href="Pope%20Clement%20V">Pope Clement V</a>. For the canonisation process to succeed, convincing evidence of miracles that Cantilupe had performed since his death had to be presented, one of which was that William Cragh had been brought back from the dead by the bishop's intercession. Three papal commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry: William de Testa, a papal tax collector in England, <a href="Ralph%20Baldock">Ralph Baldock</a>, Bishop of London, and William Durand the Younger, Bishop of Mende.

The investigation opened in London on 14 July 1307. The first three of the nine witnesses to Cragh's hanging to be heard were Lady Mary de Briouze, William Codineston, and the younger William de Briouze; his father had died in 1291. The commissioners were naturally curious about the details of the execution, because if Cragh had not actually been killed then there could clearly have been no miracle. William de Briouze was in no doubt that the hanging had been properly conducted, and pointed out it was customary that "if any subterfuge or trickery were discovered ... then the executioner himself would be hanged in turn". He added that any deception could be ruled out because of the hatred that he and his father had for Cragh, whom he described as "the worst of malefactors". The same point was made by William of Codineston: "the lord de Briouze and his justices, officials, and servants hated William Cragh very much and rejoiced greatly at his hanging and death".

For the convenience of other witnesses the commission moved to Hereford, where it resumed on 18 August 1307. The other six testifying to Cragh's execution included the hanged man himself, despite William de Briouze's stated belief that he had died of natural causes about two years earlier. The official language of the proceedings was ecclesiastical Latin, but Cragh spoke only Welsh, therefore two Franciscan friars from Hereford – John Young and Maurice of Pencoyd – were recruited as translators. Cragh is identified in the commission's records by his Welsh name, William ap Rhys, "of the parish of Swansea in the diocese of Saint Davids". Of the eight other witnesses called, five testified in French and three in English. In his evidence Cragh stated that he believed himself to have been about 28 at the time of his hanging, and that his last conscious memory as he was dangling at the end of the rope was of the noise made by the crowd when Trahaern was hanged beside him. He denied his earlier story of having seen a vision of a white-clad bishop while he was hanging from the gallows, and instead claimed that the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a> had appeared to him on the morning of his execution, accompanied by "a lordly figure" she introduced as "St Thomas", who she said would save him from the gallows. Under questioning Cragh said that he presumed the figure to be Cantilupe because he had been on pilgrimage to Cantilupe's shrine in Hereford, and because on the day of his imprisonment he had "bent a penny ... to the honour of Saint Thomas so that he should liberate him". After hearing his testimony the commissioners physically examined Cragh, to confirm that he was indeed the man who had been hanged 18 years earlier. Although they found no marks around his neck they did discover some scarring on his tongue, according to Cragh caused by him having bitten it while hanging.

The investigation was conducted in an inquisitorial style; witnesses were not expected to make statements but only to respond to questions asked of them. Bartlett has observed that some of the questions asked by the commissioners were rather leading. During Cragh's interrogation, for instance, he was asked if "in his country after the time of his hanging, it was publicly and commonly ascribed, and still is ascribed, to a miracle performed by the merits of the Lord Saint Thomas that he obtained and recovered life after the hanging". Cragh of course had no motivation other than to answer "yes", which he did.

Nothing more is known of Cragh after his testimony to the papal commission in 1307. Thirty-eight posthumous miracles attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe were examined by the commissioners and submitted for consideration by the pope and his advisors. Twelve were rejected after further analysis, including Cragh's resurrection, but no reasons were recorded. <a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a> formally announced Cantilupe's canonisation on 17 April 1320, thirty-eight years after the new saint's death.

Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes

The conservation-restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel was one of the most significant <a href="Conservation-restoration%20of%20cultural%20heritage">conservation-restorations</a> of the 20th century.

The <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a> was built by <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20IV">Pope Sixtus IV</a> within the <a href="Apostolic%20Palace">Vatican</a> immediately to the north of <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a> and completed in about 1481. Its walls were decorated by a number of <a href="Italian%20Renaissance%20painting">Renaissance painters</a> who were among the most highly regarded artists of late 15th century Italy, including <a href="Domenico%20Ghirlandaio">Ghirlandaio</a>, <a href="Pietro%20Perugino">Perugino</a>, and <a href="Sandro%20Botticelli">Botticelli</a>. The Chapel was further enhanced under <a href="Pope%20Julius%20II">Pope Julius II</a> by the painting of <a href="Sistine%20Chapel%20ceiling">the ceiling</a> by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> between 1508 and 1512 and by the painting of the "<a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Michelangelo%29">Last Judgment</a>", commissioned by <a href="Pope%20Clement%20VII">Pope Clement VII</a> and completed in 1541, again by Michelangelo. The <a href="tapestry">tapestries</a> on the lowest tier, today best known from the <a href="Raphael%20Cartoons">Raphael Cartoons</a> (painted designs) of 1515–16, completed the ensemble.

Together the paintings make up the greatest pictorial scheme of the Renaissance. Individually, some of Michelangelo's paintings on the ceiling are among the most notable works of western art ever created. The <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es of the Sistine Chapel and in particular the ceiling and accompanying <a href="lunette">lunette</a>s by Michelangelo have been subject to a number of restorations, the most recent taking place between 1980 and 1994. This most recent restoration had a profound effect on art lovers and historians, as colours and details that had not been seen for centuries were revealed. It has been claimed that as a result "Every book on Michelangelo will have to be rewritten". Others, such as the art historian <a href="James%20Beck%20%28art%20historian%29">James Beck</a> of <a href="ArtWatch%20International">ArtWatch International</a>, have been extremely critical of the restoration, saying that the restorers have not realised the true intentions of the artist. This is the subject of continuing debate.

The frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel had a number of interventions prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980. Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above. In about 1547 <a href="Paolo%20Giovio">Paolo Giovio</a> wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by <a href="Potassium%20nitrate">saltpetre</a> and cracks. The effect of saltpetre is to leave a white <a href="efflorescence">efflorescence</a>. Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay "Michelangelo's colours rediscovered", that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of <a href="linseed%20oil">linseed</a> or <a href="walnut%20oil">walnut oil</a> which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.

In 1625, a restoration was carried out by Simone Lagi, the "resident gilder", who wiped the ceiling with linen cloths and cleaned it by rubbing it with bread. He occasionally resorted to wetting the bread to remove the more stubborn accretions. His report states that the <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es "were returned to their previous beauty without receiving any harm". Colalucci states that Lagi "almost certainly" applied layers of glue-varnish to revive the colours but does not state this in his report in the interests of "preserving the secrets of their [the restorers'] craft".

Between 1710 and 1713 a further restoration was carried out by the painter <a href="Annibale%20Mazzuoli">Annibale Mazzuoli</a> and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over the ceiling, according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on the ceiling and less attention was paid to the <a href="lunette">lunette</a>s.

The penultimate restoration was undertaken by the Restoration Laboratory of the <a href="Vatican%20Museum">Vatican Museum</a> between 1935 and 1938. The scope of the work was to consolidate some areas of the <a href="intonaco">intonaco</a> at the eastern end of the building and partially remove the soot and dirt.

The preliminary experimentation for the modern restoration began in 1979. The restoration team comprised Gianluigi Colalucci, Maurizio Rossi, Piergiorgio Bonetti, and others, who took as their guidelines the "Rules for restoration of works of art" as established in 1978 by Carlo Pietrangeli, director of the Vatican's Laboratory for the Restoration of Pictures, which govern the procedure and methods employed in restoration. An important part of modern restoration procedure, as established by these rules, is the study and analysis of the artwork. Part of this was the recording of every stage of the restoration process. This was done by the photographer <a href="Takashi%20Okamura%20%28photographer%29">Takashi Okamura</a> for <a href="Nippon%20Television%20Network%20Corporation">Nippon Television Network Corporation</a>.

Between June 1980 and October 1984 the first stage of restoration, the work upon Michelangelo's lunettes, was achieved. The focus of the work then transferred to the ceiling, which was completed in December 1989 and from there to the <a href="The%20Last%20Judgment%20%28Michelangelo%29">Last Judgment</a>. The restoration was unveiled by <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> on 8 April 1994. The final stage was the restoration of the wall frescoes, approved in 1994 and unveiled on 11 December 1999.

The aims of the conservators were as follows:


In 1979 Colalucci undertook a series of experiments to discover the right approach for the restoration of the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, "Conflict over the Body of <a href="Moses">Moses</a>" by <a href="Matteo%20de%20Lecce">Matteo de Lecce</a>, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a small portion of the Eleazar and Matthan lunette.

Because of the height of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the problems that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.

In 1980 the decision to undertake a total restoration was taken. <a href="Nippon%20Television%20Network%20Corporation">Nippon Television Network Corporation</a> of Japan provided major funding of US$4.2 million in exchange for the filming rights.

The team of restorers completed the first stage of the restoration, on the vertical surfaces and curved <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a>s around the upper sections of the windows, from <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> <a href="scaffolding">scaffolding</a> projecting from just below the lunettes and using the same holes in the wall that had been made for Michelangelo's scaffold. When they moved to the ceiling, they likewise employed a system similar to Michelangelo's, which involved <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ing a shelf outwards from the scaffolding to support a stepped and arched platform. The advantages of modern lightweight materials meant that the platform could be wheeled, facilitating easy movement along the length of the building rather than dismantling and replacement, as Michelangelo had done in 1506.

The findings of the investigation of 1979 were that the entire interior of the chapel, but particularly the ceiling, was covered with a grime of candle smoke comprising <a href="wax">wax</a> and <a href="soot">soot</a> (<a href="amorphous%20carbon">amorphous carbon</a>). Above the windows (the main source of ventilation), the lunettes were particularly stained from the smoke and exhaust fumes of the city, being "much dirtier than the ceiling proper".
The building was a little unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo's work of 1508, causing cracking of the ceiling, the crack in the "Judith" <a href="pendentive">pendentive</a> being so large that it had to be filled with bricks and mortar before painting. The upper part of the ceiling provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage.

Continued ingress of water from the roof and from unroofed exterior walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.

Earlier restorations had all left their marks on the frescoes. To counteract the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small <a href="putti">putti</a> which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was <a href="Potassium%20nitrate">saltpetre</a> seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly the case for the lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.

Close examination revealed that apart from smoky deposits, seepage deposits and structural cracks, the thin "pictorial skin" of Michelangelo's frescoes was in excellent condition. Colalucci describes Michelangelo as having employed the best possible fresco techniques, as described by <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a>. Most of the paint was well adhered and required little retouching. The plaster, or <a href="intonaco">intonaco</a>, on which the paintings were executed was found, for the most part, to be secure, as previous restorers had fixed it in places with <a href="bronze">bronze</a> pins.

Prior to the restoration the team spent six months investigating the composition and condition of the frescoes, questioning members of the team that had restored the frescoes in the 1930s and making a detailed scientific study to ascertain which solvents and methods were best employed upon particular painted surfaces.

The first stage of the physical restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5 mm thick) that were in danger of separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a <a href="polyvinylacetate">polyvinylacetate</a> <a href="resin">resin</a>. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed in those places where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.

The restorers washed the surfaces using a variety of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> were treated by the application of a solution of <a href="dimethylformamide">dimethylformamide</a>. The final step was the application of a weak solution of <a href="acryl%20group">acrylic</a> <a href="polymer">polymer</a> to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.

Where necessary some areas were retouched in <a href="watercolor%20painting">watercolour</a>, to integrate the pictorial material. These areas are distinctively textured with vertical brushstrokes, not visible from a distance but easily discernible as restoration work when viewed close up.

Certain small areas were left unrestored, in order to maintain a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with overpainting and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract salination with oil.

Once the many layers of candle wax, varnish, and animal glue were removed from the surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, they became subject to dangers that could not have been predicted by previous restorers.

One of the major dangers to the frescoes is <a href="exhaust%20fumes">automotive exhaust</a>, and they are also vulnerable to the effects of the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> (the latter of which can biodegrade paints and pigments). The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered with a layer of smoky wax.

Previously, the Sistine Chapel's only <a href="ventilation%20%28architecture%29">ventilation</a> was from its windows in the upper level of the walls. To prevent exhaust fumes and wind-blown <a href="Air%20pollution">pollutants</a> from entering, the windows are now permanently closed and an <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a> system has been installed. The installation is by Carrier of the <a href="United%20Technologies%20Corporation">United Technologies Corporation</a> and was developed with the cooperation of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Vatican</a>'s Office of Technical Services. It has been designed to counteract the various problems specific to the Chapel, in particular the rapid changes of heat and <a href="humidity">humidity</a> that occur with the admission of the first crowds of tourists each morning and the departure of the last visitors each afternoon. The air conditioning varies not only the heat but also the relative humidity between the summer and winter months so that changes to the atmospheric environment occur gradually. The air near the ceiling is kept at a temperate level, while the air in the lower section of the building is cooler and circulates more rapidly, with the effect that dirt particles fall towards the floor rather than being streamed upwards. <a href="Bacteria">Bacteria</a> and chemical <a href="pollutant">pollutant</a>s are filtered out.

When the restoration of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was <a href="James%20Beck%20%28art%20historian%29">James Beck</a>, of <a href="ArtWatch%20International">ArtWatch International</a>, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in "Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal."

While James Beck became "embroiled in a public debate" with Gianluigi Colalucci, Ronald Feldman, a New York art dealer, started a petition supported by 15 well-known artists including <a href="Robert%20Motherwell">Robert Motherwell</a>, <a href="George%20Segal%20%28artist%29">George Segal</a>, <a href="Robert%20Rauschenberg">Robert Rauschenberg</a>, <a href="Christo">Christo</a> and <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> asking Pope John Paul II to call a halt to the procedure and also the restoration of <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Supper%20%28Leonardo%29">Last Supper</a>".

An undertaking of the restoration team was that everything would be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, <a href="Nippon%20Television%20Network%20Corporation">Nippon Television Network Corporation</a>, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of the restoration of the ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.

According to Kimmelman, the reason for their reluctance to produce the detailed photos, which could have put to rest the worst fears of many of the interested parties, was the intention of the company to produce a large limited-edition two-volume coffee-table book ("as large as a coffee table"). This book, when produced retailed for US$1,000. Kimmelman refers to the fact that these photos were only made available to the few who could afford the exorbitant price as "ungenerous" and "immoral".

As the work was progressively completed, there were those who were delighted; <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> spoke an inaugural <a href="homily">homily</a> after each stage. In December 1999, after the completion of the wall frescoes, he said:

Cardinal <a href="Edmund%20Szoka">Edmund Szoka</a>, governor of <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican City</a>, said: "This restoration and the expertise of the restorers allows us to contemplate the paintings as if we had been given the chance of being present when they were first shown."

Other writers were less flattering. Andrew Wordsworth of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", London, expressed the major point of concern:

This crucial matter was also emphasised by Beck and defined in very clearly expressed terms on the website of the artist, Peter Layne Arguimbau.

That part of the restoration in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>. The emergence of the brightly coloured <a href="Ancestors%20of%20Christ">Ancestors of Christ</a> from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, the work on the ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.

The cause for dissent lies in the analysis and understanding of the techniques utilised by Michelangelo, and the technical response of the restorers to their understanding of those techniques. A close examination of the frescoes of the lunettes convinced the restorers that Michelangelo worked exclusively in "<a href="buon%20fresco">buon fresco</a>"; that is, the artist worked only on freshly laid plaster and each section of work was completed while the plaster was still in its fresh state. In other words, Michelangelo did not work "a secco"; he did not come back later and add details onto the dry plaster.

The restorers, by assuming that the artist took a universal approach to the painting, took a universal approach to the restoration. A decision was made that all of the shadowy layer of animal glue and "lamp black", all of the wax, and all of the overpainted areas were contamination of one sort or another: smoke deposits, earlier restoration attempts and painted definition by later restorers in attempt to enliven the appearance of the work. Based on this decision, according to Arguimbau's critical reading of the restoration data that has been provided, the chemists of the restoration team decided upon a solvent that would effectively strip the ceiling down to its paint-impregnated plaster. After treatment, only that which was painted "buon fresco" would remain.

According to critics, the inherent problem with this approach is that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted "buon fresco", that he was always satisfied with the result at the end of the day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.

A summary of the relevant statements of Colalucci, in the order that they occur in the Appendix entitled "Michelangelo's colours uncovered" is as follows:

The ongoing criticism has been that the restorers presumed to know what end result the master was seeking to achieve in every separate case across the ceiling, and by what method he sought to achieve it. The disagreements about this have been vociferous and are unresolved.

The restorers took for granted that all of the layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and numerous artists have suggested that Michelangelo used <a href="carbon%20black">carbon black</a> in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, "a secco". If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.

On some of the figures, however, there still remains clear evidence of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation for this is that over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular "giornata" include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference is, a difference in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.

There are still intense areas of shadow which throw the <a href="Cumaean%20Sibyl">Cumaean Sibyl</a> into relief. But it is more than relief; it is the three-dimensionality which art-lovers expect to see in the work of the man who sculpted Moses. Critics of the restoration claim that this was Michelangelo's aim and that many frescoes had brightly contrasting colours laid side-by-side that were then worked over "a secco" to achieve this effect and that this is what has been lost by a too-scrupulous cleaning.

Consistently missing from the restored ceiling is the crisp "a secco" detailing of the architecture: the <a href="scallop">scallop</a> shells, <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s and "bead and reel" ornament which Michelangelo possibly would have left for completion by an assistant, when he moved on to the next panel. The treatment of these details varied considerably. In a few places, around the Ezekias spandrel, for example, the architectural detailing was painted "buon fresco" and remains intact.
A comparison of two spandrels reveals different post-restoration states. The one on the left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the <a href="fictive%20architecture">fictive architecture</a> each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.

On the corner pendentives, each of which depicts a violent subject, the removal of the carbon black has diminished the dramatic intensity of all four scenes. This is particularly noticeable in the loss of depth in the "Punishment of <a href="Haman%20%28Bible%29">Haman</a>". Where once the figure projected starkly against the darkly shadowed interior, now foreshortening, definition and drama is lost in the pastel monotone that remains.

The curator, Fabrizio Mancinelli, quotes the 18th-century French traveller <a href="J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me%20Lalande">De Lalande</a> in saying that the colouring of the ceiling was, by that time, monotonous, "tend[ing] towards dull red and grey". Mancinelli writes that the restoration reveals "a new Michelangelo" as a colourist and that this "new character makes much better sense of his historical position". He goes on to say that perceptive viewers of the Sistine Chapel ceiling have always been aware that the range of colours used was very different from that which could be seen, and included the same pinks, apple greens, oranges, yellows and pale blues that were employed by Michelangelo's teacher, <a href="Domenico%20Ghirlandaio">Domenico Ghirlandaio</a>, one of the most competent fresco painters of the Renaissance.

The brilliant palette ought to have been expected by the restorers as the same range of colours appears in the works of <a href="Giotto">Giotto</a>, <a href="Masaccio">Masaccio</a> and <a href="Masolino">Masolino</a>, <a href="Fra%20Angelico">Fra Angelico</a> and <a href="Piero%20della%20Francesca">Piero della Francesca</a>, as well as Ghirlandaio himself and later fresco painters such as <a href="Annibale%20Carracci">Annibale Carracci</a> and <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Tiepolo">Tiepolo</a>. The reason for employing this range of colours is that many other pigments are not usable in fresco as they have chemical properties that react badly in interaction with wet plaster. The colour that is noticeably missing from Michelangelo's ceiling, but not "The Last Judgment", is the intense blue of <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>. This colour, achieved by grinding semi-precious stone, was always applied as a secondary, "a secco" stage, along with the gold leaf applied as haloes and decoration to robes.

The aspect of the colouring which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the <a href="Libyan%20Sibyl">Libyan Sibyl</a> and the <a href="Prophet%20Daniel">Prophet Daniel</a>, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, there is no such gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the "Mathan" lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.

In some instances, the colour combinations look garish: this is particularly the case with the <a href="Prophet%20Daniel">Prophet Daniel</a>. A comparison of the "restored" and "unrestored" figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in a wash of carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned. The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as they still are on the <a href="Cumaean%20Sibyl">Cumaean Sibyl</a>. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> and <a href="tempera">tempera</a>. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.

There is absolutely no doubt that before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau, still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.

The painter and biographer <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a>, in his "<a href="Lives%20of%20the%20Artists">Lives of the Artists</a>", describes the figure of <a href="Jonah">Jonah</a> as it appeared in the mid-16th century:
The large figure of Jonah is of great significance to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The <a href="foreshortening">foreshortening</a> described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme left side of the painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the <a href="Genius%20%28mythology%29">genii</a> behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.

The missing depth is not the only factor that the critics deplore. An important feature of Michelangelo's work which, in many places, has disappeared forever is the painting of the eyeballs. Eyes appear in many instances to have been painted "buon fresco". Wherever they have not been painted <a href="buon%20fresco">buon fresco</a> but added "a secco", they have been removed by the restorers.

They are an essential part of the most impressive and famous of the frescoes, the "Creation of Adam". Adam gazes at God. God looks directly at Adam. And under God's protective arm, Eve turns her eyes sideways in a look of admiration for her husband-to-be. Again and again, Michelangelo painted telling gazes into the faces of his characters. The eye sockets of the family in the Zorobabel lunette are empty as are the eyes of the man in the Aminadab lunette, but the removal that has caused the most distress to the critics are the eyes of the little figure in green and white who once looked out of the gloom above the lunette of Jesse.

Arguimbau says:

Richard Serrin, in an essay entitled "Lies and Misdemeanors: Gianluigi Colalucci's Sistine Chapel Revisited" says:

Carlo Pietrangeli, former Director General of the Vatican Museums, writes of the restoration: "It is like opening a window in a dark room and seeing it flooded with light." His words resonate with those of Giorgio Vasari who, in the 16th century, said of the Sistine Chapel ceiling:

Pietrangeli, in his foreword to "The Sistine Chapel", written after the restoration of the lunettes, but prior to the restoration of the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those who visited the restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.

Four Times of the Day

Four Times of the Day is a series of four oil paintings by English artist <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>. Completed in 1736, they were reproduced as a series of four <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s published in 1738. They are humorous depictions of life in the streets of London, the vagaries of fashion, and the interactions between the rich and poor. Unlike many of Hogarth's other series, such as "<a href="A%20Harlot%27s%20Progress">A Harlot's Progress</a>", "<a href="A%20Rake%27s%20Progress">A Rake's Progress</a>", "<a href="Industry%20and%20Idleness">Industry and Idleness</a>", and "<a href="The%20Four%20Stages%20of%20Cruelty">The Four Stages of Cruelty</a>", it does not depict the story of an individual, but instead focuses on the society of the city. Hogarth intended the series to be humorous rather than instructional; the pictures do not offer a judgment on whether the rich or poor are more deserving of the viewer's sympathies: while the upper and middle classes tend to provide the focus for each scene, there are fewer of the moral comparisons seen in some of his other works. Their dimensions are about by each.

The four pictures depict scenes of daily life in various locations in London as the day progresses. "Morning" shows a prudish spinster making her way to church in <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a> past the revellers of the previous night; "Noon" shows two cultures on opposite sides of the street in <a href="St%20Giles%2C%20London">St Giles</a>; "Evening" depicts a <a href="dye">dye</a>r's family returning hot and bothered from a trip to <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells">Sadler's Wells</a>; and "Night" shows disreputable goings-on around a drunken <a href="freemason">freemason</a> staggering home near <a href="Charing%20Cross">Charing Cross</a>.

"Four Times of the Day" was the first set of prints that Hogarth published after his two great successes, "A Harlot's Progress" (1732) and "A Rake's Progress" (1735). It was among the first of his prints to be published after the <a href="Engraving%20Copyright%20Act%201734">Engraving Copyright Act 1734</a> (which Hogarth had helped push through <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>); "A Rake's Progress" had taken early advantage of the protection afforded by the new law. Unlike "Harlot" and "Rake", the four prints in "Times of the Day" do not form a consecutive narrative, and none of the characters appears in more than one scene. Hogarth conceived of the series as "representing in a humorous manner, morning, noon, evening and night".

Hogarth took his inspiration for the series from the classical satires of <a href="Horace">Horace</a> and <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a>, via their <a href="Augustan%20literature">Augustan</a> counterparts, particularly <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a>'s "<a href="Trivia%20%28poem%29">Trivia</a>" and <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>'s "<a href="A%20Description%20of%20a%20City%20Shower">A Description of a City Shower</a>" and "<a href="A%20Description%20of%20the%20Morning">A Description of the Morning</a>". He took his artistic models from other series of the "Times of Day", "The Seasons" and "Ages of Man", such as those by <a href="Nicolas%20Poussin">Nicolas Poussin</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20Lancret">Nicholas Lancret</a>, and from <a href="pastoral">pastoral</a> scenes, but executed them with a twist by transferring them to the city. He also drew on the Flemish "Times of Day" style known as "<a href="points%20du%20jour">points du jour</a>", in which the gods floated above pastoral scenes of idealised shepherds and shepherdesses, but in Hogarth's works the gods were recast as his central characters: the churchgoing lady, a frosty <a href="Aurora%20%28mythology%29">Aurora</a> in "Morning"; the pie-girl, a pretty London <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a> in "Noon"; the pregnant woman, a sweaty <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a> in "Evening"; and the <a href="freemason">freemason</a>, a drunken <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a> in "Night".

Hogarth designed the series for an original commission by <a href="Jonathan%20Tyers">Jonathan Tyers</a> in 1736 in which he requested a number of paintings to decorate supper boxes at <a href="Vauxhall%20Gardens">Vauxhall Gardens</a>. Hogarth is believed to have suggested to Tyers that the supper boxes at Gardens be decorated with paintings as part of their refurbishment; among the works featured when the renovation was completed was Hogarth's picture of <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a> and <a href="Anne%20Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>. The originals of "Four Times of the Day" were sold to other collectors, but the scenes were reproduced at Vauxhall by <a href="Francis%20Hayman">Francis Hayman</a>, and two of them, "Evening" and "Night", hung at the pleasure gardens until at least 1782.

The engravings are mirror images of the paintings (since the engraved plates are copied from the paintings the image is reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks in some of the scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often the theme is one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also move through the seasons: "Morning" is set in winter, "Noon" in spring, and "Evening" in summer. However, "Night"—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on <a href="Oak%20Apple%20Day">Oak Apple Day</a> in May rather than in the autumn.

"Evening" was engraved by <a href="Bernard%20Baron">Bernard Baron</a>, a French engraver who was living in London, and, although the designs are Hogarth's it is not known whether he engraved any of the four plates himself. The prints, along with a fifth picture, "<a href="Strolling%20Actresses%20Dressing%20in%20a%20Barn">Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn</a>" from 1738, were sold by subscription for one <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guinea</a> (£ in 2019), half payable on ordering and half on delivery. After subscription the price rose to five <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s per print (£ in 2019), making the five print set four shillings dearer overall. Although "Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn" was not directly connected to the other prints, it seems that Hogarth always envisaged selling the five prints together, adding the "Strolling Actresses" as a complementary theme just as he had added "<a href="Southwark%20Fair">Southwark Fair</a>" to the subscription for "The Rake's Progress". Whereas the characters in "Four Times" play their roles without being conscious of acting, the company of "Strolling Actresses" are fully aware of the differences between the reality of their lives and the roles they are set to play. Representations of Aurora and Diana also appear in both.

Hogarth advertised the prints for sale in May 1737, again in January 1738, and finally announced the plates were ready on 26 April 1738. The paintings were sold individually at an auction on 25 January 1745, along with the original paintings for "A Harlot's Progress", "A Rake's Progress" and "Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn". <a href="Sir%20William%20Heathcote%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir William Heathcote</a> purchased "Morning" and "Night" for 20 guineas and "£"20 6"s" respectively (£ and £ in 2019), and the <a href="Peregrine%20Bertie%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Ancaster%20and%20Kesteven">Duke of Ancaster</a> bought "Noon" for "£"38 17"s" (£ in 2019) and "Evening" for "£"39 18"s" (£ in 2019). A further preliminary sketch for "Morning" with some differences to the final painting was sold in a later auction for "£"21 (£ in 2019).

In "Morning", a lady makes her way to church, shielding herself with her fan from the shocking view of two men pawing at the market girls. The scene is the west side of the <a href="piazza">piazza</a> at <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>, indicated by a part of the <a href="Palladian%20architecture">Palladian</a> <a href="portico">portico</a> of <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a>'s <a href="St%20Paul%27s%2C%20Covent%20Garden">Church of St Paul</a> visible behind "<a href="Tom%20King%27s%20Coffee%20House">Tom King's Coffee House</a>", a notorious venue celebrated in pamphlets of the time. <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a> mentions the coffee house in both "<a href="The%20Covent%20Garden%20Tragedy">The Covent Garden Tragedy</a>" and "Pasquin". At the time Hogarth produced this picture, the coffee house was being run by Tom's widow, <a href="Elizabeth%20Adkins">Moll King</a>, but its reputation had not diminished. Moll opened the doors once those of the taverns had shut, allowing the revellers to continue enjoying themselves from midnight until dawn. The mansion with columned portico visible in the centre of the picture, No. 43 <a href="Queen%20Street%2C%20London">King Street</a>, is attributed to architect <a href="Thomas%20Archer">Thomas Archer</a> (later 1st <a href="Baron%20Archer">Baron Archer</a>) and occupied by him at the date of Hogarth's works. It was situated on the north side of the piazza, while the coffee house was on the south side, as depicted in Hogarth's original painting. In the picture, it is early morning and some revellers are ending their evening: a fight has broken out in the coffee house and, in the melée, a wig flies out of the door. Meanwhile, stallholders set out their fruit and vegetables for the day's market. Two children who should be making their way to school have stopped, entranced by the activity of the market, in a direct reference to Swift's "A Description of the Morning" in which children "lag with satchels in their hands". Above the clock is <a href="Father%20Time">Father Time</a> and below it the inscription "<a href="Sic%20transit%20gloria%20mundi">Sic transit gloria mundi</a>". The smoke rising from the chimney of the coffee house connects these portents to the scene below.

Hogarth replicates all the features of the pastoral scene in an urban landscape. The shepherds and shepherdesses become the beggars and whores, the sun overhead is replaced by the clock on the church, the snow-capped mountains become the snowy rooftops. Even the setting of Covent Garden with piles of fruit and vegetables echoes the country scene. In the centre of the picture the icy goddess of the dawn in the form of the <a href="prude">prim</a> churchgoer is followed by her shivering red-nosed pageboy, mirroring <a href="Hesperus">Hesperus</a>, the dawn bearer. The woman is the only one who seems unaffected by the cold, suggesting it may be her element. Although outwardly shocked, the dress of the woman, which is too fashionable for a woman of her age and in the painting is shown to be a striking acid yellow, may suggest she has other thoughts on her mind. She is commonly described as a spinster, and considered to be a <a href="hypocrite">hypocrite</a>, ostentatiously attending church and carrying a fashionable <a href="ermine">ermine</a> <a href="muff%20%28handwarmer%29">muff</a> while displaying no <a href="Charity%20%28virtue%29">charity</a> to her freezing footboy or the half-seen beggar before her. The figure of the spinster is said to be based on a relative of Hogarth, who, recognising herself in the picture, cut him out of her will. Fielding later used the woman as the model for his character of Bridget Allworthy in "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Tom%20Jones%2C%20a%20Foundling">Tom Jones</a>".

A trail of peculiar footprints shows the path trodden by the woman on her <a href="patten%20%28shoe%29">pattens</a> to avoid putting her good shoes in the snow and filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors in the form of a skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his <a href="cureall">cureall</a> medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, <a href="Richard%20Rock">Dr. Rock</a>'s name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of "<a href="A%20Harlot%27s%20Progress">A Harlot's Progress</a>" where he is seen arguing over treatments with <a href="John%20Misaubin">Dr Misaubin</a> while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.

Hogarth revisited "Morning" in his bidding ticket, "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Pictures">Battle of the Pictures</a>", for the auction of his works, held in 1745. In this, his own paintings are pictured being attacked by ranks of <a href="Old%20Master">Old Master</a>s; "Morning" is stabbed by a work featuring <a href="Francis%20of%20Assisi">St. Francis</a> as Hogarth contrasts the false piety of the prudish spinster with the genuine piety of the Catholic saint.

The scene takes place in <a href="Hog%20Lane">Hog Lane</a>, part of the slum district of <a href="St%20Giles%20Circus">St Giles</a> with the church of <a href="St%20Giles%20in%20the%20Fields">St Giles in the Fields</a> in the background. Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of "<a href="Gin%20Lane">Gin Lane</a>" and "<a href="The%20Four%20Stages%20of%20Cruelty">First Stage of Cruelty</a>". The picture shows <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s leaving the French Church in what is now <a href="Soho">Soho</a>. The Huguenot refugees had arrived in the 1680s and established themselves as tradesmen and artisans, particularly in the silk trade; and the French Church was their first place of worship. Hogarth contrasts their fussiness and high fashion with the slovenliness of the group on the other side of the road; the rotting corpse of a cat that has been stoned to death lying in the gutter that divides the street is the only thing the two sides have in common. The older members of the congregation wear traditional dress, while the younger members wear the fashions of the day. The children are dressed up as adults: the boy in the foreground struts around in his finery while the boy with his back to the viewer has his hair in a net, bagged up in the "French" style.

At the far right, a black man fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her pie-dish "tottering like her virtue". Confusion over whether the law permitted slavery in England, and pressure from abolitionists, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners; but the status of this man is not clear. The black man, the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a>, Venus and <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a> which would have appeared in the pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping. In front of the couple, a boy has set down his pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin. The boy's features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin's first version of "<a href="The%20Rape%20of%20the%20Sabine%20Women%23Nicolas%20Poussin">The Abduction of the Sabine Women</a>" (now held in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>), but the boy crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved.

The composition of the scene juxtaposes the prim and proper Huguenot man and his immaculately dressed wife and son with these three, as they form their own "family group" across the other side of the gutter. The head of <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> on a platter is the advertisement for the pie shop, proclaiming "Good eating". Below this sign are the embracing couple, extending the metaphor of good eating beyond a mere plate of food, and still further down the street girl greedily scoops up the pie, carrying the theme to the foot of the picture. I. R. F. Gordon sees the vertical line of toppling plates from the top window downwards as a symbol of the disorder on this side of the street. The man reduced to a head on the sign, in what is assumed to be the woman's fantasy, is mirrored by the "Good Woman" pictured on the board behind who has only a body, her nagging head removed to create the man's ideal of a "good woman". In the top window of the "Good Woman", a woman throws a plate with a leg of meat into the street as she argues, providing a stark contrast to the "good" woman pictured on the sign below. Ronald Paulson sees the <a href="kite">kite</a> hanging from the church as part of a trinity of signs; the kite indicating the purpose of the church, ascent into heaven, just as the other signs for "Good Eating" and the "Good Woman" indicate the predilections of those on that side of the street. However, he also notes it as another nod to the pastoral tradition: here instead of soaring above the fields it hangs impotently on the church wall.

The time is unclear. Allan Cunningham states it is half past eleven, and suggests that Hogarth uses the early hour to highlight the debauchery occurring opposite the church, yet the print shows the hands at a time that could equally be half past twelve, and the painting shows a thin golden hand pointing to ten past twelve.

In this scene more than any of the others, Hogarth's sympathies seem to be with the lower classes and more specifically with the English. Although there is disorder on the English side of the street, there is an abundance of "good eating" and the characters are rosy-cheeked and well-nourished. Even the street girl can eat her fill. The pinch-faced Huguenots, on the other hand, have their customs and dress treated as mercilessly as any characters in the series. A national enmity towards the French, even French refugees, may explain why the English are depicted somewhat more flatteringly here than they are by figures in the accompanying scenes. Hogarth mocked continental fashions again in "<a href="Marriage%20%C3%A0-la-mode%20%28Hogarth%29">Marriage à-la-mode</a>" (1743–1745) and made a more direct attack on the French in "<a href="The%20Gate%20of%20Calais">The Gate of Calais</a>" which he painted immediately upon returning to England in 1748 after he was arrested as a spy while sketching in Calais.

Unlike the other three images, "Evening" takes place slightly outside the built-up area of the city, with views of rolling hills and wide evening skies. The cow being milked in the background indicates it is around 5 o'clock. While in "Morning" winter cold pervades the scene, "Evening" is oppressed by the heat of the summer. A pregnant woman and her husband attempt to escape from the claustrophobic city by journeying out to the fashionable <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells">Sadler's Wells</a> (the stone entrance to <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells Theatre</a> is shown to the left). By the time Hogarth produced this series the theatre had lost any vestiges of fashionability and was satirised as having an audience consisting of tradesmen and their pretentious wives. <a href="Ned%20Ward">Ned Ward</a> described the clientele in 1699 as:

The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a <a href="dye">dye</a>r by trade, looks harried as he carries his exhausted youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), his hands are blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a <a href="cuckold">cuckold</a> and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a <a href="Hobby%20horse%20%28toy%29">hobby horse</a>, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his <a href="gingerbread">gingerbread</a>. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.

The heat is made tangible by the flustered appearance of the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a> and <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a>); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing on the side of the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the <a href="New%20River%20%28England%29">New River</a> and a tavern with a sign showing Sir <a href="Hugh%20Myddleton">Hugh Myddleton</a>, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.

The final picture in the series, "Night", shows disorderly activities under cover of night in the <a href="Charing%20Cross">Charing Cross</a> Road, identified by <a href="Hubert%20Le%20Sueur">Hubert Le Sueur</a>'s equestrian statue of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I of England</a> and the two pubs; this part of the road is now known as Whitehall. In the background the passing cartload of furniture suggests tenants escaping from their landlord in a "moonlight flit". In the painting the moon is <a href="full%20moon">full</a>, but in the print it appears as a crescent.

Traditional scholarship has held that the night is 29 May, <a href="Oak%20Apple%20Day">Oak Apple Day</a>, a public holiday which celebrated the <a href="The%20Restoration">Restoration of the monarchy</a> (demonstrated by the oak boughs above the barber's sign and on some of the subjects' hats, which recall the royal oak tree in which <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> hid after losing the <a href="Battle%20of%20Worcester">Battle of Worcester</a> in 1651). Alternatively, Sean Shesgreen has suggested that the date is 3 September, commemorating the battle of Worcester itself, a dating that preserves the seasonal progression from winter to spring to summer to autumn.

Charing Cross was a central staging post for coaches, but the congested narrow road was a frequent scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach to overturn. Festive bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights the sky in the distance. A <a href="link-boy">link-boy</a> blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.

On one side of the road is a <a href="barber%20surgeon">barber surgeon</a> whose sign advertises "Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn with a touch. Ecce signum!" Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The surgeons and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Company of Surgeons</a>. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.

Underneath the windowshelf, a homeless family have made a bed for themselves.

In the foreground, a drunken <a href="Freemasonry">freemason</a>, identified by his apron and <a href="set%20square">set square</a> medallion as the <a href="Worshipful%20Master">Worshipful Master</a> of a <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">lodge</a>, is being helped home by his <a href="Tyler%20%28Masonic%29">Tyler</a>, as the contents of a <a href="chamber%20pot">chamber pot</a> are emptied onto his head from a window. In some of the prints, a woman standing back from the window looks down on him, suggesting that his soaking is not accidental. The freemason is traditionally identified as Sir <a href="Thomas%20de%20Veil">Thomas de Veil</a>, who was a member of Hogarth's first Lodge, <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>'s predecessor as the <a href="Bow%20Street">Bow Street</a> magistrate, and the model for Fielding's character Justice Squeezum in "<a href="Rape%20upon%20Rape">The Coffee-House Politician</a>" (1730). He was unpopular for his stiff sentencing of gin-sellers, which was deemed to be hypocritical as he was known to be an enthusiastic drinker. He is supported by his Tyler, a servant equipped with <a href="Tyler%27s%20sword">sword</a> and candle-snuffer, who may be Brother Montgomerie, the Grand Tyler.

All around are pubs and brothels. The "Earl of Cardigan" tavern is on one side of the street, and opposite is the "Rummer", whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) with a bunch of grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the "Rummer and Grapes" in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge. The publican is <a href="Wine%20fraud">adulterating</a> a <a href="hogshead">hogshead</a> of wine, a practice recalled in the poetry of <a href="Matthew%20Prior">Matthew Prior</a> who lived with his uncle Samuel Prior, the Landlord successively of both the "Rummer and Grapes" and the "Rummer".
My uncle, rest his soul, when living,
Might have contriv'd me ways of thriving;
Taught me with cider to replenish
My vats, or ebbing tide of Rhenish.
On either side of the street are signs for "The Bagnio" and "The New Bagnio". Ostensibly a <a href="Turkish%20bath">Turkish bath</a>, <a href="bagnio">bagnio</a> had come to mean a disorderly house.

The 6th <a href="Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Earl of Salisbury</a> scandalised society by driving and upsetting a stagecoach. John Ireland suggests that the overturned "Salisbury Flying Coach" below the "Earl of Cardigan" sign was a gentle mockery of the Grand Master <a href="George%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Montagu">4th Earl of Cardigan, George Brudenell</a>, later <a href="Duke%20of%20Montagu">Duke of Montagu</a>, who was also renowned for his reckless carriage driving; and it also mirrors the ending of Gay's "Trivia" in which the coach is overturned and wrecked at night.

"Four Times of the Day" was the first series of prints that Hogarth had issued since the success of the "Harlot" and "Rake" (and would be the only set he would issue until "Marriage à-la-mode" in 1745), so it was eagerly anticipated. On hearing of its imminent issue, <a href="George%20Faulkner">George Faulkner</a> wrote from Dublin that he would take 50 sets. The series lacks the moral lessons that are found in the earlier series and revisited in "Marriage à-la-mode", and its lack of teeth meant it failed to achieve the same success, though it has found an enduring niche as a snapshot of the society of Hogarth's time. At the auction of 1745, the paintings of "Four Times of the Day" raised more than those of the "Rake"; and "Night", which is generally regarded as the worst of the series, fetched the highest single total. Cunningham commented sarcastically: "Such was the reward then, to which the patrons of genius thought these works entitled". While <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a> praised the accompanying print, "Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn", as being the finest of Hogarth's works, he had little to say of "Four Times of the Day" other than that it did not find itself wanting in comparison with Hogarth's other works.

"Morning" and "Night" are now in the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> Bearsted Collection at <a href="Upton%20House%2C%20Warwickshire">Upton House, Warwickshire</a>. The collection was assembled by <a href="Walter%20Samuel%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Bearsted">Walter Samuel, 2nd Viscount Bearsted</a> and gifted to the Trust, along with the house, in 1948. "Noon" and "Evening" remain in the Ancaster Collection at <a href="Grimsthorpe%20Castle">Grimsthorpe Castle</a>, Lincolnshire.

a. Ireland and Paulson both put the clock at 6.55 am, though the original painting shows 7.05 am. The difference is due to the reversal of the image.

In 1708, E. Hatton recorded the inscription below the clock as "Ex hoc Momento pendat Eternitas" in his "New View of London" and did not mention a figure above it. The date 1715 is shown on the clock-case in the 1717 volume of "Vitruvius Britannicus", so perhaps indicates the clock had been replaced and the inscription changed to "Sic transit gloria mundi" as shown here.

b. "Battle of the Paintings" is Hogarth's take on Swift's "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20the%20Books">The Battle of the Books</a>".

c. Hogarth's works indicate that cats were not common pets in London during his lifetime. They are often depicted suffering the consequences of the life of a vagabond on the streets, in contrast to dogs which are normally shown reflecting the feelings of their masters or good-naturedly testing the limits of society (one notable exception is the first plate of "The Four Stages of Cruelty" in which the cruelty of society is reflected by the torture of the faithful dog).

Sky Blue Sky

Sky Blue Sky is the sixth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Wilco">Wilco</a>, released on May 15, 2007 by <a href="Nonesuch%20Records">Nonesuch Records</a>. Originally announced on January 17, 2007 at a show in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>, <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, it was the band's first studio album with <a href="guitarist">guitarist</a> <a href="Nels%20Cline">Nels Cline</a> and <a href="multi-instrumentalist">multi-instrumentalist</a> <a href="Pat%20Sansone">Pat Sansone</a>. Before its release, the band streamed the entire album on its official website and offered a free download of "What Light".

"Sky Blue Sky" was Wilco's highest debuting album on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> at number four. The self-produced album received mostly favorable reviews by critics. Publications such as <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> and "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" praised its maturity, while <a href="Playlouder">Playlouder</a> and <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a> criticized its "<a href="dad%20rock">dad-rock</a>" sound. While some critics praised the direct lyrical approach, others criticized it when compared to previous Wilco albums. The band licensed six songs from the "Sky Blue Sky" sessions to a <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> advertisement campaign, a move that generated criticism from fans and the media.

In April 2006, Wilco was still touring in support of their most recent studio album, "<a href="A%20Ghost%20Is%20Born">A Ghost Is Born</a>" which was released in 2004. The band performed a few new songs during this leg of the tour, including "Walken", "Either Way", and "On and On and On". The following month, <a href="drummer">drummer</a> <a href="Glenn%20Kotche">Glenn Kotche</a> mentioned to <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a> that those new songs were going to be recorded as demos for a new album release. During a January 17, 2007 solo concert, <a href="frontman">frontman</a> <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a> announced that the band would release their sixth studio album on May 15, 2007 through <a href="Nonesuch%20Records">Nonesuch Records</a>. The album was named "Sky Blue Sky", a reference to a childhood memory of Tweedy's, of a <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> <a href="parade">parade</a> in <a href="Belleville%2C%20Illinois">Belleville, Illinois</a>. He had come home from <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> with his family, but could not reach his house because the parade blocked the main street. This led Tweedy to reflect upon his future in the town: he knew that he would have to leave when he grew up because it was too small.

The album was recorded by TJ Doherty at The Loft in <a href="Irving%20Park%2C%20Chicago">Irving Park, Chicago</a>, where Tweedy had recorded Loose Fur's "<a href="Born%20Again%20in%20the%20USA">Born Again in the USA</a>" and most of Wilco's "<a href="Yankee%20Hotel%20Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a>". In an interview with "Billboard", the band revealed that the album would be less experimental than the two previous albums and more influenced by <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a>, and <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>. Also, unlike the previous albums, the album was made with only minimal involvement of <a href="Jim%20O%27Rourke%20%28musician%29">Jim O'Rourke</a>; the album which was produced with very few overdubs.

The band sought to be more direct with this record than the previous two, resulting in a more mellow album. Tweedy attributes the lyrical directness to his listening to material by <a href="The%20Byrds">The Byrds</a> and <a href="Fairport%20Convention">Fairport Convention</a> while recording the album. He disliked the reliance on studio effects on previous albums:

I got nervous about the technology on "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot". If you need a certain amp or pedal to make a song what it is, it isn't a song.

Many of the album's songs were recorded in a single day, with the band reaching a consensus on how each song should sound. Eighteen songs were recorded for the album and twelve were selected for the album's track listing. The outtake "Let's Not Get Carried Away" was included with <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> <a href="Music%20download">digital downloads</a>, and a full-band version of "The Thanks I Get" was released on the band's Myspace page. Some albums that were shipped to independent record stores included an <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> featuring the outtake "One True Vine" and a live version of "Theologians" recorded at <a href="The%20Vic%20Theater">The Vic Theater</a> in Chicago. A deluxe edition of "Sky Blue Sky" was also released, which included a DVD with eight live performances from the Wilco Loft.

Unlike previous Wilco albums, "Sky Blue Sky" features more songwriting collaboration between Tweedy and the other members of the band. As a result, a variety of lyrical themes appear on "Sky Blue Sky" (Tweedy was the only designer of the songs on "A Ghost Is Born", using <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a>, before presenting them to the band). The title track references the worries Tweedy had as a child in a small town while "On and On and On" is an ode to Tweedy's father's experience after the death of Tweedy's mother. "Hate It Here" describes a man who tries to fill his free time with chores after breaking up with his lover.

"Sky Blue Sky" was the band's first studio record to feature the expanded lineup that premiered on "". <a href="Guitar">Guitar</a>ist Jeff Tweedy provided the lead vocals for the album and <a href="John%20Stirratt">John Stirratt</a>, the only other original member of the band, played <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> and added background vocals. Glenn Kotche played <a href="Drum%20kit">drums</a> and <a href="Mikael%20Jorgensen">Mikael Jorgensen</a> performed on a variety of <a href="Keyboard%20instrument">keyboards</a>. New to the band since the previous studio album were lead guitarist <a href="Nels%20Cline">Nels Cline</a> and multi-instrumentalist <a href="Pat%20Sansone">Pat Sansone</a>. Additional instrumentation was provided by violist Karen Waltuch and multi-instrumentalist Jim O'Rourke. The album was mixed by <a href="Jim%20Scott%20%28producer%29">Jim Scott</a> at PLYRZ Studios in <a href="Santa%20Clarita%2C%20California">Santa Clarita</a>, <a href="California">California</a>.

The cover artwork of "Sky Blue Sky" is a photograph by Manuel Presti titled "Sky Chase." The photograph was taken in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, Italy, and helped Presti win the 2005 <a href="Wildlife%20Photographer%20of%20the%20Year">Wildlife Photographer of the Year</a> competition. The same photograph is featured in the July 2007 issue of "<a href="National%20Geographic%20Magazine">National Geographic</a>". Nathaniel Murphy provided several <a href="illustrations">illustrations</a> for the liner booklet, which include a tree on a hill, a hand, and a flock of birds. The booklet also contains photographs of the band members by <a href="Frank%20W.%20Ockenfels%20III">Frank Ockenfels</a>. <a href="Graphic%20design">Graphic design</a> was provided by Jeff Tweedy and Lawrence Azerrad.

On March 3, 2007, Wilco's official website hosted a "Sky Blue Sky" "listening party", which <a href="Stream%20%28computing%29">streamed</a> the new album in its entirety. Two days later, the track "What Light" was made available for download on the band's website and was streamed on its <a href="MySpace">MySpace</a> page. On March 11, 2007, the official website streamed the album in its entirety again. "The Thanks I Get", a song recorded during the "Sky Blue Sky" sessions but not included on the album, was made available as a free download to purchasers of the album. During the European segment of the promotional tour, Wilco included a five-song extended play with purchase of the album. The EP contained the songs "The Thanks I Get", "One True Vine", "Let's Not Get Carried Away", and live versions of "Impossible Germany" and "Hate It Here". Wilco made the EP available online for free to previous purchasers of "Sky Blue Sky".

Frustrated by the lack of radio airplay received by previous Wilco albums, the band decided to branch out into television advertising. Wilco had previously licensed songs for <a href="Telef%C3%B3nica">Telefónica Moviles</a>, and Jeff Tweedy appeared in a series of advertisements for <a href="Apple%20Computer">Apple Computer</a>. In May 2007, <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> began running a pair of commercials with "You Are My Face" and bonus track "The Thanks I Get" playing in the background. The band commented on their website that "we feel okay about VWs. Several of us even drive them." The band licensed six songs for the campaign, which was created by advertising agency Crispin Porter and Bogusky. The move was met with criticism from both fans and popular media.

A promotional tour followed the release of the album. The band performed "Sky Blue Sky" and "You Are My Face" on "<a href="Later...%20with%20Jools%20Holland">Later... with Jools Holland</a>" on May 25, 2007 and was interviewed on "The <a href="Dermot%20O%27Leary">Dermot O'Leary</a> Show" the next day. Beginning June 13, 2007, Wilco played fourteen shows in North America with <a href="Low%20%28band%29">Low</a> as its opening act. Following this, the band made plans to tour <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, the United Kingdom, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, Italy, and Spain before playing a few more North American shows, including a performance on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show">The Tonight Show</a>".

Nonesuch released the album on May 15, 2007; the following week became Wilco's best-ever sales week. The album debuted at number four on the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, selling 87,000 copies domestically in its first week. "Sky Blue Sky" was also an international success, peaking at number 7 in Norway, number 21 in Belgium, number 23 in Australia and Ireland, number 26 in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, number 32 in New Zealand, number 36 in Germany, and number 39 in the United Kingdom.

The album maintains a score of 73 out of 100 from <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> based on "generally favorable reviews" upon its release. <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" pondered in his review whether Wilco had ever made a song as good as "Impossible Germany," praising how the song builds into a "twin guitar epic" in the mold of <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a> and <a href="Peter%20Green%20%28musician%29">Peter Green</a>-era <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>. Michael Metivier of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> commented that while the album took a while to understand, it was full of "exquisitely beautiful melodies and performances". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> writer Mark Deming called the album "Wilco's strongest album as an ensemble to date," and found the return to <a href="roots%20rock">roots rock</a> music a fresh new method for the band. "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that the album "often feels like the [Grateful] Dead's "American Beauty" if Jerry Garcia had taken <a href="Paxil">Paxil</a> instead of acid."

Colin Stutz of "<a href="Filter%20%28magazine%29">Filter</a>" gave the album a score of 91% and stated: "Wilco has constructed their most straightforward release in recent memory, which relies heavily on the inspired intricacies of a full-hearted band." Richard Cromelin of "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it "The most musically direct and down to earth of the band's six-album career." Andrew C. Bradick of "Prefix Magazine" gave the album a favorable review and called it "Wilco's first step toward aging well, but it transcends transition and is an album that sounds right in its place and time." Alan Shulman of "No Ripcord" gave it a score of eight stars out of ten and said, "Wilco has come up with 50% of a classic album and 50% of a merely decent one. Buy it for the moments you simply won’t hear anywhere else." <a href="Will%20Hermes">Will Hermes</a> of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" gave it a score of eight out of ten and called it "A near-perfect album by a band that seems, finally, to have found their identity." "<a href="Alternative%20Press%20%28music%20magazine%29">Alternative Press</a>" gave it four stars out of five and said, "It's apparent it takes deft skill to sound this simple." <a href="Tiny%20Mix%20Tapes">Tiny Mix Tapes</a> also gave it four stars out of five and stated: "While the elders will rejoice [in] this sober, satisfied, and craftily subdued effort, the younglings of the bunch, with their abbreviated attention spans, iPod shuffles, and demand for instant gratification, will declare the album a boring and lethargic affair." Jonathan Keefe of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that "Though it may not fit comfortably alongside any other albums in Wilco's catalogue, "Sky Blue Sky" is further confirmation that, even at their most retro, they're among contemporary pop music's most vital acts." Likewise, Graeme Thomson of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" gave it four stars and said, "The closer you listen to the jazzy guitars, Beatles touches and easy, shuffling rhythms ... the more it transpires that Tweedy is simply allowing the songs sufficient room to speak up for themselves."

John Pareles of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" gave the album a positive review and said, "The production is straightforward, but the song structures aren’t; that’s where Wilco’s idiosyncrasies still hide out." Joan Anderman of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" also gave it a positive review and said the band "hasn't forsaken its experimental streak, and the group uses it in the service of darkness -- or rather the threat of darkness."

However, not all publications praised the new style of "Sky Blue Sky". "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>" editor Ian Cohen criticized the album's disregard for the "<a href="fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a>", and expressed concern about its dissimilarities to "Kicking Television: Live in Chicago". Dorian Lynskey of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" gave the album three stars out of five and said, "On its own terms, "Sky Blue Sky" succeeds: it's tender, poignant and sumptuously textured, occasionally jolted into fiery life by flaring guitar passages redolent of Neil Young or Television." "<a href="Now%20%28newspaper%29">Now</a>" gave it a positive review and stated: "All those self-consciously avant bits of the two previous albums have been ditched along with Jeff Tweedy's laughable lyrical abstractions in favour of tuneful, direct songs that at least seem to carry some emotional weight." Ted Grant of <a href="Playlouder">Playlouder</a> gave the album two stars out of five and called it the "blandest and most creatively uninspired record of their career", finding that the album was leading to tame "dad-rock". "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" writer Rob Mitchum also used the "dad-rock" colloquialism, dismissing its straightforwardness and arguing "Tweedy merely ended up with the wrong personnel to articulate his mood here." "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" also gave the album three stars out of five, stating that "Many longtime listeners... are sure to be disappointed with the radio-friendly production and sheer innocuousness of [the] lyrics." Andy Gill of "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" gave the album three stars out of five and called it "a slight disappointment". "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" gave it an average review and stated: "On first listen, it might seem too derivative, even dull, but Jeff Tweedy's intricate vocal melodies and Nels Cline's ferocious guitar work keep things interesting." "<a href="Under%20the%20Radar%20%28magazine%29">Under the Radar</a>" gave it five stars out of ten and called it "a very professional but almost inconsequential set... flat and ultimately uninspired." John Walshe of "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" gave it a mixed review and said the album was "just too 'nice'."

The lyrical content was considered by critics to be somewhat experimental, but more straightforward than previous Wilco albums. Michael Metevier of PopMatters found the lyrics to be "some of the most affecting and least clumsy" of the band's career, though he worried that they might strike some Wilco fans as dull. Rob Sheffield said that while he was unimpressed with the lyrics of other Wilco albums, he liked the songwriting on "Sky Blue Sky". However, Brandon Kreitler of "Dusted Magazine" felt that the lyrics seem like an insular Tweedy confessional, and Doug Freeman of "<a href="The%20Austin%20Chronicle">The Austin Chronicle</a>" described the collaborative songwriting as yielding "fatalistic ambivalence" while giving the album two stars out of five.

The album received a nomination at the 50th Annual <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> for <a href="Best%20Rock%20Album">Best Rock Album</a>. It placed 12th in the 2008 <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> Poll. This album was #42 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007, and the song "Impossible Germany" was #71 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. <a href="WXPN">WXPN</a> named "Impossible Germany" as the #1 song of 2007 and named the album as a whole the #1 album of 2007. "Sky Blue Sky" was named one of the ten best albums of the year by "Billboard", "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>", "Uncut", and "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>". The album was placed at #97 on the Rolling Stone 100 Best Albums Of The 2000s list.

IK Pegasi

IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> <a href="star%20system">system</a> in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Pegasus%20%28constellation%29">Pegasus</a>. It is just luminous enough to be seen with the unaided eye, at a distance of about 150 <a href="light%20year">light year</a>s from the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>.

The primary (IK Pegasi A) is an <a href="A-type%20main-sequence%20star">A-type main-sequence star</a> that displays minor pulsations in <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a>. It is categorized as a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a> star and it has a periodic cycle of luminosity variation that repeats itself about 22.9 times per day. Its companion (IK Pegasi B) is a massive <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>—a star that has evolved past the main sequence and is no longer generating energy through <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>. They orbit each other every 21.7 days with an average separation of about 31 million kilometres, or 19 million miles, or 0.21 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (AU). This is smaller than the orbit of <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> around the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>.

IK Pegasi B is the <a href="Near-Earth%20supernova">nearest known</a> <a href="supernova">supernova</a> progenitor candidate. When the primary begins to evolve into a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>, it is expected to grow to a radius where the white dwarf can <a href="Accretion%20%28astrophysics%29">accrete</a> matter from the expanded gaseous envelope. When the white dwarf approaches the <a href="Chandrasekhar%20limit">Chandrasekhar limit</a> of 1.4 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es (), it may explode as a <a href="Type%20Ia%20supernova">Type Ia supernova</a>.

This star system was catalogued in the 1862 "<a href="Durchmusterung">Bonner Durchmusterung</a>" ("Bonn astrometric Survey") as BD +18°4794B. It later appeared in <a href="Edward%20Charles%20Pickering">Pickering's</a> 1908 "<a href="Bright%20Star%20Catalogue">Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue</a>" as HR 8210. The designation "IK Pegasi" follows the expanded form of the <a href="variable%20star%20designation">variable star nomenclature</a> introduced by <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Argelander">Friedrich W. Argelander</a>.

Examination of the <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a>ic features of this star showed the characteristic <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a> shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a <a href="doppler%20effect">doppler shift</a> in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity of at least one of the stars even though they are unable to resolve the individual components.

In 1927, the Canadian astronomer <a href="William%20Edmund%20Harper">William E. Harper</a> used this technique to measure the period of this single-line spectroscopic binary and determined it to be 21.724 days. He also initially estimated the <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a> as 0.027. (Later estimates gave an eccentricity of essentially zero, which is the value for a circular orbit.) The velocity amplitude was measured as 41.5 km/s, which is the maximum velocity of the primary component along the line of sight to the Solar System.

The distance to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny <a href="parallax">parallax</a> shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the <a href="Earth">Earth</a> orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 <a href="light%20year">light year</a>s (with an accuracy of ±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.

The combination of the distance and proper motion of this system can be used to compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a>, can be measured by the average <a href="red-shift">red-shift</a> (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The "General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities" lists a radial velocity of −11.4 km/s for this system. The combination of these two motions gives a <a href="space%20velocity%20%28astronomy%29">space velocity</a> of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.

An attempt was made to photograph the individual components of this binary using the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, but the stars proved too close to resolve. Recent measurements with the <a href="Extreme%20Ultraviolet%20Explorer">Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer</a> <a href="space%20telescope">space telescope</a> gave a more accurate orbital period of . The <a href="inclination">inclination</a> of this system's <a href="Orbital%20plane%20%28astronomy%29">orbital plane</a> is believed to be nearly edge-on (90°) as seen from the Earth. If so it may be possible to observe an <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>.

The <a href="Hertzsprung-Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung-Russell diagram</a> (HR diagram) is a plot of <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> versus a <a href="color%20index">color index</a> for a set of stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star—a term that is used to describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the <a href="instability%20strip">instability strip</a>. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.

The pulsations result from a process called the <a href="%CE%BA-mechanism">κ-mechanism</a>. A part of the star's outer <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> becomes <a href="Optical%20density">optically thick</a> due to partial <a href="ionization">ionization</a> of certain elements. When these atoms lose an <a href="electron">electron</a>, the likelihood that they will absorb energy increases. This results in an increase in temperature that causes the atmosphere to expand. The inflated atmosphere becomes less ionized and loses energy, causing it to cool and shrink back down again. The result of this cycle is a periodic pulsation of the atmosphere and a matching variation of the luminosity.
Stars within the portion of the instability strip that crosses the main sequence are called <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>s. These are named after the prototypical star for such variables: <a href="Delta%20Scuti">Delta Scuti</a>. Delta Scuti variables typically range from <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a> A2 to F8, and a stellar luminosity class of III (<a href="subgiant">subgiant</a>s) to V (<a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> stars). They are short-period variables that have a regular pulsation rate between 0.025 and 0.25 days. Delta Scuti stars have an abundance of elements similar to the Sun's (see <a href="Population%20I">Population I</a> stars) and between 1.5 and . The pulsation rate of IK Pegasi A has been measured at 22.9 cycles per day, or once every 0.044 days.

Astronomers define the <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a> of a star as the abundance of <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s that have a higher <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> than helium. This is measured by a <a href="spectroscopic">spectroscopic</a> analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is [M/H] = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a> of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun. However the margin of error for this result is relatively large.

The spectrum of A-class stars such as IK Pegasi A show strong <a href="Balmer%20line">Balmer line</a>s of hydrogen along with absorption lines of ionized metals, including the K line of ionized <a href="calcium">calcium</a> (Ca II) at a wavelength of 393.3 <a href="nanometre">nm</a>. The spectrum of IK Pegasi A is classified as marginal Am (or "Am:"), which means it displays the characteristics of a spectral class A but is marginally metallic-lined. That is, this star's atmosphere displays slightly (but anomalously) higher than normal absorption line strengths for metallic isotopes. Stars of spectral type Am are often members of close binaries with a companion of about the same mass, as is the case for IK Pegasi.

Spectral class-A stars are hotter and more massive than the Sun. But, in consequence, their life span on the main sequence is correspondingly shorter. For a star with a mass similar to IK Pegasi A (1.65 ), the expected lifetime on the main sequence is 2–3, which is about half the current age of the Sun.

In terms of mass, the relatively young <a href="Altair">Altair</a> is the nearest star to the Sun that is a stellar analogue of component A—it has an estimated 1.7 . The binary system as a whole has some similarities to the nearby system of <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, which has a class-A primary and a white dwarf companion. However, Sirius A is more massive than IK Pegasi A and the orbit of its companion is much larger, with a semimajor axis of 20 AU.

The companion star is a dense <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> star. This category of stellar object has reached the end of its evolutionary life span and is no longer generating energy through <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>. Instead, under normal circumstances, a white dwarf will steadily radiate away its excess energy, mainly stored heat, growing cooler and dimmer over the course of many billions of years.

Nearly all small and intermediate-mass stars (below about 9 ) will end up as white dwarfs once they have exhausted their supply of <a href="thermonuclear">thermonuclear</a> fuel. Such stars spend most of their energy-producing life span as a <a href="main%20sequence">main-sequence</a> star. The time that a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on its mass, with the lifespan decreasing with increasing mass. Thus, for IK Pegasi B to have become a white dwarf before component A, it must once have been more massive than component A. In fact, the progenitor of IK Pegasi B is thought to have had a mass between 5 and .

As the hydrogen fuel at the core of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a>. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a <a href="horizontal%20branch">horizontal branch</a> star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium was exhausted in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to the hydrogen-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a>, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time <a href="Carbon%20burning%20process">carbon fusion</a> could begin in the core, producing <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="neon">neon</a> and <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>.

The outer envelope of a red giant or AGB star can expand to several hundred times the radius of the Sun, occupying a radius of about (3 AU) in the case of the pulsating AGB star <a href="Mira">Mira</a>. This is well beyond the current average separation between the two stars in IK Pegasi, so during this time period the two stars shared a common envelope. As a result, the outer atmosphere of IK Pegasi A may have received an isotope enhancement.
Some time after an inert oxygen-carbon (or oxygen-magnesium-neon) core formed, thermonuclear fusion began to occur along two shells concentric with the core region; hydrogen was burned along the outermost shell, while helium fusion took place around the inert core. However, this double-shell phase is unstable, so it produced thermal pulses that caused large-scale mass ejections from the star's outer envelope. This ejected material formed an immense cloud of material called a <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>. All but a small fraction of the hydrogen envelope was driven away from the star, leaving behind a white dwarf remnant composed primarily of the inert core.

The interior of IK Pegasi B may be composed wholly of carbon and oxygen; alternatively, if its progenitor underwent <a href="carbon%20burning">carbon burning</a>, it may have a core of oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen. In either case, the exterior of IK Pegasi B is covered by an atmosphere of almost pure hydrogen, which gives this star its <a href="stellar%20classification">stellar classification</a> of DA. Due to higher <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a>, any helium in the envelope will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer. The entire mass of the star is supported by <a href="electron%20degeneracy%20pressure">electron degeneracy pressure</a>—a <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> effect that limits the amount of matter that can be squeezed into a given volume.
At an estimated , IK Pegasi B is considered to be a high-mass white dwarf. Although its radius has not been observed directly, it can be estimated from known theoretical relationships between the mass and radius of white dwarfs, giving a value of about 0.60% of the <a href="solar%20radius">Sun's radius</a>. (A different source gives a value of 0.72%, so there remains some uncertainty in this result.) Thus this star packs a mass greater than the Sun into a volume roughly the size of the Earth, giving an indication of this object's extreme <a href="density">density</a>.

The massive, compact nature of a white dwarf produces a strong <a href="surface%20gravity">surface gravity</a>. Astronomers denote this value by the decimal <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a> of the <a href="gravitational%20force">gravitational force</a> in <a href="Centimeter%20gram%20second%20system%20of%20units">cgs units</a>, or log "g". For IK Pegasi B, log "g" is 8.95. By comparison, log "g" for the Earth is 2.99. Thus the surface gravity on IK Pegasi is over 900,000 times the gravitational force on the Earth.

The effective surface temperature of IK Pegasi B is estimated to be about , making it a strong source of <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> radiation. Under normal conditions this white dwarf would continue to cool for more than a billion years, while its radius would remain essentially unchanged.

In a 1993 paper, David Wonnacott, Barry J. Kellett and David J. Stickland identified this system as a candidate to evolve into a <a href="Type%20Ia%20supernova">Type Ia supernova</a> or a <a href="Cataclysmic%20variable%20star">cataclysmic variable</a>. At a distance of 150 light years, this makes it the nearest known candidate supernova progenitor to the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. However, in the time it will take for the system to evolve to a state where a supernova could occur, it will have moved a considerable distance from Earth but may yet pose a threat.

At some point in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the hydrogen fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a red giant. The envelope of a red giant can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the <a href="Roche%20lobe">Roche lobe</a> of its companion, a gaseous <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a> will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.

On the surface of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become compressed and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a <a href="thermal%20runaway">runaway</a> reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) <a href="nova">nova</a> explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf would rapidly increase by several <a href="Apparent%20magnitude">magnitudes</a> for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is <a href="RS%20Ophiuchi">RS Ophiuchi</a>, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.

It is possible that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern. In order to accumulate mass, however, only a portion of the accreted gas can be ejected, so that with each cycle the white dwarf would steadily increase in mass. Thus, even should it behave as a recurring nova, IK Pegasus B could continue to accumulate a growing envelope.

An alternate model that allows the white dwarf to steadily accumulate mass without erupting as a nova is called the close-binary <a href="supersoft%20x-ray%20source">supersoft x-ray source</a> (CBSS). In this scenario, the mass transfer rate to the close white dwarf binary is such that a steady fusion burn can be maintained on the surface as the arriving hydrogen is consumed in thermonuclear fusion to produce helium. This category of super-soft sources consist of high-mass white dwarfs with very high surface temperatures ( to ).

Should the white dwarf's mass approach the <a href="Chandrasekhar%20limit">Chandrasekhar limit</a> of 1.4 it will no longer be supported by <a href="electron%20degeneracy%20pressure">electron degeneracy pressure</a> and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.

Such a supernova event may pose some threat to life on the Earth. It is thought that the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4 km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700 years. After 5 million years, for example, this star will be separated from the Sun by more than 500 light years. A Type Ia supernova within a thousand parsecs (3300 light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.

Following a supernova explosion, the remnant of the donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed when it was a member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200 km/s, which would place it among the <a href="High-velocity%20star">high-velocity members</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">galaxy</a>. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a <a href="Supernova%20remnant">remnant</a> of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>.

Golden-crowned sifaka

The golden-crowned sifaka or Tattersall's sifaka ("Propithecus tattersalli") is a medium-sized <a href="lemur">lemur</a> characterized by mostly white fur, prominent furry ears, and a golden-orange <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a>. It is one of the smallest <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s (<a href="genus">genus</a> "Propithecus"), weighing around and measuring approximately from head to tail. Like all sifakas, it is a <a href="Vertical%20clinging%20and%20leaping">vertical clinger and leaper</a>, and its diet includes mostly seeds and leaves. The golden-crowned sifaka is named after its discoverer, <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a>, who first spotted the species in 1974. However, it was not formally described until 1988, after a research team led by <a href="Elwyn%20L.%20Simons">Elwyn L. Simons</a> observed and captured some specimens for <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a>. The golden-crowned sifaka most closely resembles the western forest sifakas of the "P. verreauxi" group, yet its <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> suggests a closer relationship with the "P. diadema" group of eastern forest sifakas. Despite the similarities with both groups, more recent studies of its karyotype support its classification as a distinct species.

Found in <a href="Gallery%20forest">gallery</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">deciduous</a>, and semi-evergreen forest, its restricted range includes 44 forest fragments, totaling an area of , centered on the town of <a href="Daraina">Daraina</a> in northeast <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Its estimated population is 18,000 individuals. It is primarily active during the day, although it also tends to be active at dawn and dusk during the rainy season. It sleeps in tall <a href="Rainforest%23Emergent%20layer">emergent</a> trees and is preyed upon by the <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a>. The golden-crowned sifaka lives in groups of around five to six individuals, containing a balanced number of adult males and females. Scent is used to <a href="mark%20territories">mark territories</a>, which are defended by growling, chasing, and ritualistic leaping displays. Reproduction is <a href="Seasonal%20breeder">seasonal</a>, with <a href="gestation">gestation</a> lasting six months and <a href="lactation">lactation</a> lasting five months. Infants are <a href="Weaning">weaned</a> during the wet season to ensure the best chances of survival.

The small range and fragmented populations of this species weigh heavily on its survival. <a href="Forest%20fragmentation">Forest fragmentation</a>, <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, <a href="Slash%20and%20burn">slash-and-burn agriculture</a>, and other human factors threaten its existence. The golden-crowned sifaka is listed by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> as "Critically Endangered". Its range was originally not covered by any <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">national parks</a> or <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s in Madagascar, but a new protected area was established in 2005 to include a portion. Attempts have been made to keep the golden-crowned sifaka in captivity at the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a> in <a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a>. The small colony was maintained from 1988 to 2008. In Madagascar, lawlessness resulting from the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">2009 political coup</a> led to increased poaching of this species, and many were sold to local restaurants as a delicacy.

The golden-crowned or Tattersall's sifaka ("Propithecus tattersalli"), known locally as "ankomba malandy" (or "akomba malandy", meaning "white lemur"), was discovered in 1974 north of <a href="Vohemar">Vohemar</a> in northeast Madagascar by <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a>, who observed but did not capture the animal. Unsure of its classification, Tattersall provisionally considered it a variant of the <a href="silky%20sifaka">silky sifaka</a> in his 1982 book, "<a href="The%20Primates%20of%20Madagascar%20%28book%29">The Primates of Madagascar</a>", citing its mostly off-white to yellowish fur, but also noting its uncharacteristic orange crown patch and tufted ears. Driven by a report in 1986 that the forest where Tattersall had observed this unique sifaka was contracted to be <a href="Clearcutting">clear-cut</a> for <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> production, a research team from the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a>, led by <a href="Elwyn%20L.%20Simons">Elwyn L. Simons</a>, obtained permits to capture specimens for a <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a> program. Simons and his team were the first to capture and observe the golden-crowned sifaka, formally describing it as a new species in 1988 and naming it in honor of Tattersall. The specimens were found northeast of <a href="Daraina">Daraina</a>, a village in the northeast corner of Madagascar.

There have been conflicting studies regarding the taxonomic status of the golden-crowned sifaka. When described by Simons in 1988, size, <a href="animal%20communication">vocalizations</a>, and <a href="karyology">karyotypes</a> (the number and appearance of <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s) were compared with the other sifakas. In terms of size, general morphology, and vocalizations, the golden-crowned sifaka is more comparable to the western forest sifakas (known as the "P. verreauxi" group) in that it is smaller in length and weight. Its karyotype, however, is more similar to that of the eastern forest sifakas (known as the "P. diadema" group). The golden-crowned sifaka has 42 chromosomes (2n=42), 16 of which are <a href="Autosome">autosomal pairs</a> (not <a href="sex%20chromosomes">sex chromosomes</a>) that are <a href="Centromere">meta- or submetacentric</a> (where chromosome arms are equal or unequal in length, respectively). The remaining autosomal pairs are smaller and <a href="Centromere">acrocentric</a> (with the shorter chromosome arm difficult to observe). Its <a href="X%20chromosome">X chromosome</a> is metacentric, which is comparable to that of the "P. diadema" group, not the "P. verreauxi" group. Given the conflicting information, its geographic isolation, as well as the unique long fur tufts on the ears—a trait not shared by any other sifaka—the golden-crowned sifaka was recognized as a distinct species.

In 1997, comparisons of repeated DNA sequences within the family <a href="Indriidae">Indriidae</a> supported Simon's classification, placing the golden-crowned sifaka as a sister group to the other sifakas. In 2001, a study involving <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> suggested a very recent divergence between it and the <a href="Coquerel%27s%20sifaka">Coquerel's sifaka</a>, then considered a subspecies of the "P. verreauxi" group. If this were true, the golden-crowned sifaka would not merit species status and would form a subclade with the Coquerel's sifaka within the "P. verreauxi" group. In 2004, a comparative study of the karyotypes of the three traditional species of sifakas provided insight into the chromosomal arrangements of all three groups. This study found that the golden-crowned sifaka differs from "P. verreauxi" group and "P. diadema" group by 9 and 17 chromosomal rearrangements respectively, and conversely argued that the golden-crowned sifaka is indeed a separate species and is more closely related to the "P. verreauxi" group. More recently, in 2007 a craniodental (<a href="skull">skull</a> and <a href="Tooth%20%28animal%29">tooth</a>) study provided evidence for 9 or 10 distinct sifaka species, including the golden-crowned sifaka. It also placed the golden-crowned sifaka within the "P. verreauxi" group.

The golden-crowned sifaka is one of the smallest sifaka species with a weight of , a head-body length of , a tail length of , and total length of . It is comparable in size to the sifakas inhabiting the southern and western dry forests, such as Coquerel's sifaka, the <a href="crowned%20sifaka">crowned sifaka</a>, <a href="Von%20der%20Decken%27s%20sifaka">Von der Decken's sifaka</a>, and Verreaux's sifaka. It has a coat of moderately long, creamy-white fur with a golden tint, dark black or chocolate-brown fur on its neck and throat, pale orange <a href="fur">fur</a> on the tops of its legs and <a href="forelimb">forelimb</a>s, a white tail and <a href="hindlimb">hindlimb</a>s, and a characteristic bright orange-gold <a href="Crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a>. It is the only sifaka with prominent tufts of white fur protruding from its ears, making its head appear somewhat triangular and distinctive in appearance. Its eyes are orange, and its face is black and mostly hairless, with dark gray-black fur with white hairs stretching from beneath the eyes to the cheeks. Its <a href="snout">snout</a> is blunt and rounded, and its broad nose helps to distinguish it from other sifakas. Occasionally the bridge of the nose will have a patch of white fur. Similar to other sifakas, this <a href="Arboreal%20locomotion">arboreal</a> animal has long, strong legs that enable it to <a href="Vertical%20clinging%20and%20leaping">cling and leap</a> between tree trunks and branches.

The golden-crowned sifaka lives in dry <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">deciduous</a>, <a href="gallery%20forest">gallery</a>, and semi-evergreen forests and is found at altitudes up to , though it seems to prefer lower elevations. Surveys have shown it to be limited to highly fragmented forests surrounding the town of Daraina in an area encircled by the Loky and Manambato rivers in northeastern Madagascar. The golden-crowned sifaka has one of the smallest geographic ranges of all <a href="Indriidae">indriid</a> lemur species. Out of 75 forest fragments studied by researchers, its presence could be definitively reported in only 44, totaling . This study, published in 2002, also estimated the total species population and observed population densities. <a href="Home%20range">Home range</a> size varied between per group. With an average <a href="Group%20size%20measures">group size</a> of five individuals, the population density ranged between 17 and 28 individuals per km. Another home range size estimate of has also been suggested with a population density range of 10 and 23 individuals per km. The forested area available to the species within its desired elevation range was estimated at , yielding an estimated population of 6,120–10,080 and a breeding population between 2,520 and 3,960 individuals. However, a study published in 2010 using <a href="Line-intercept%20sampling">line transect</a> data from 2006 and 2008 in five major forest fragments yielded an estimated population of 18,000 individuals.

The species is <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> (coexists) with two other medium-sized lemurs: the <a href="Sanford%27s%20brown%20lemur">Sanford's brown lemur</a> ("Eulemur sanfordii") and the <a href="crowned%20lemur">crowned lemur</a> ("Eulemur coronatus").

The golden-crowned sifaka is primarily active during the day (<a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>), but researchers have witnessed activity in the early morning and evening (<a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>) during the rainy season (November through April). In captivity, it has been observed feeding at night, unlike captive Verreaux's sifakas. It travels between per day, an intermediate range compared to other sifakas of the eastern forests. The golden-crowned sifaka can be observed feeding and resting higher in the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> during the dry season (May through October). It sleeps in the taller trees (the <a href="emergent%20layer">emergent layer</a>) of the forest at night.

When stressed, the golden-crowned sifaka emits grunting vocalizations as well as repeated ""churrs"" that escalate into a high-<a href="amplitude">amplitude</a> ""whinney"." Its ground predator <a href="Alarm%20signal">alarm call</a>, which sounds like ""shē-fäk"", closely resembles that of Verreaux's sifaka. It also emits <a href="Animal%20mobbing%20behavior">mobbing</a> alarm calls in response to <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>.

The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka consists of a wide variety of plants—as many as 80 species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a <a href="Seed%20predation">seed predator</a>, making <a href="seed">seed</a>s a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats unripe <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s, <a href="flower">flower</a>s, and <a href="leaves">leaves</a>. One study showed a diet composition of 37% unripe fruit and seeds, 22% immature leaves, 17% mature leaves, 13% flowers, and 9% fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet consists of unripe fruits and seed, mainly from <a href="Fabaceae">leguminous</a> pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree ("<a href="Poupartia">Poupartia caffra</a>") and on <a href="mango">mango</a> trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.

A study in 1993 showed variability and flexibility in feeding preferences between three research sites around Daraina. Plant species preferences (measured in feeding time) changed between wetter, intermediate, and drier forests:

The social structure of the golden-crowned sifaka is very similar to that of Verreaux's sifaka, both averaging between five and six individuals per group, with a range between three and ten. Unlike the Verreaux's sifaka, group <a href="sex%20ratio">sex ratio</a>s are more evenly balanced, consisting of two or more members of both sexes. Females are dominant within the group, and only one female breeds successfully each season. Males will roam between groups during the mating season.

Because of their smaller home ranges relative to other sifakas, group encounters are slightly more common, occurring a few times a month. It has been noted that the temperament of the golden-crowned sifaka is more volatile than that of other sifaka species and, in the case of a dispute, this animal frequently emits a grunt-like vocalization that seems to signal annoyance. Aggressive interactions between groups are generally non-physical but include loud growling, territorial marking, chasing, and ritualistic leaping displays. Same-sexed individuals act most aggressively towards each other during such encounters. <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">Scent marking</a> is the most common form of territorial defense, with scent marks acting as "signposts" to demarcate territorial boundaries. Females use glands in the <a href="Sex%20organ">genital</a> regions ("anogenital") while males use both anogenital and chest glands.

The golden-crowned sifaka is a <a href="seasonal%20breeder">seasonal breeder</a>, often <a href="mating">mating</a> during the last week of January. Its <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period is a little less than six months, and its <a href="lactation">lactation</a> period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. <a href="Childbirth">Parturition</a> occurs in the middle of the dry season (late June or July). <a href="Weaning">Weaning</a> occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.

Females reproduce once every two years. Infants are born with little hair and initially cling to their mother's belly. As they mature, they begin to ride on her back. Following weaning, riding on the back is only tolerated for short durations, particularly when the group is alerted to the presence of a predator. By one year of age, the juveniles are 70% of their full adult body weight. <a href="Infant%20mortality">Infant mortality</a> is high in this species. Upon reaching <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a>, males leave their natal group and transfer to neighboring social groups. Observations by researchers and reports from local people indicate that this species will jump to the ground and cross more than of grassland to reach nearby forest patches. This suggests that forest fragmentation may not completely isolate separated populations.

The only predator known to target this species is the <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a>, although the golden-crowned sifaka reacts to the presence of <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> with alarm calls. A <a href="hematology">hematology</a> and <a href="blood%20serum">serum chemistry</a> study published in 1995 revealed that 59% of the wild golden-crowned sifakas sampled were infected with a <a href="microfilaria">microfilaria</a>l parasite, a potentially unknown species of <a href="nematode">nematode</a> in the genus "<a href="Mansonella%20perstans">Mansonella</a>". Healthy, infected individuals did not appear to be adversely affected by the infestation, but the overall effect on the dwindling population is unknown. Also, no <a href="malaria">malaria</a>l or <a href="intestinal%20parasite">intestinal parasite</a>s were found, although 48% of the golden-crowned sifakas examined had external <a href="ear%20mite">ear mite</a>s.

While the golden-crowned sifaka faces few biological threats, such as predation, it faces many significant human-caused (<a href="human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic</a>) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands. By 1985 it was estimated that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020. <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">Illegal logging</a> practices, <a href="slash-and-burn%20agriculture">slash-and-burn agriculture</a> (known as "tavy"), uncontrolled <a href="Wildfire">grass fires</a>, <a href="gold%20mining">gold mining</a>, <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.

Malagasy farmers continue to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration. The fires sometimes burn out of control and destroy forest edges along with the natural <a href="flora">flora</a>, increasing the damage even further than intended. Due to the nature of Madagascar's geology and soil, "tavy" also depletes the fertility of the soil, accelerating the <a href="crop%20rotation">crop rotation</a> rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests.

Although <a href="coal">coal</a> is the preferred cooking fuel of the Malagasy people, the most affordable and prominent source of energy is timber, known as "kitay". Wood is also used as a primary building material, only adding further incentive to remove trees from the forest. With the depletion of dead wood from the forest patches, the people have begun to remove young, healthy trees. This is seen most commonly in areas closest to villages. Although the shapes and sizes of forest fragments around the Daraina region have been mostly stable for 50 years prior to a study in 2002, the six years preceding the study had seen 5% of the small- to medium-sized forest fragments disappear due to increased human encroachment.

A newly emergent threat facing the golden-crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners moving into the region's forests. Although mining operations are small scale, the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because deep mining pits are often dug near or underneath large trees, disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing the trees in the area. The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure. Although the species is protected from hunting by local "<a href="Fady%20%28taboo%29">fady</a>" (taboo) around Daraina, due to their likeness to humans, and by Malagasy law, the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden-crowned sifaka as a source of <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>. In 1993, David M. Meyers, a researcher who has studied the golden-crowned sifaka, speculated that if bushmeat hunting were to escalate, the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans. Indeed, bushmeat hunting by people from nearby <a href="Ambilobe">Ambilobe</a> has already <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> at least one isolated population.

Because studies have shown that the golden-crowned sifaka are most likely to be found in large forest fragments (greater than ), the species is thought to be sensitive to <a href="forest%20fragmentation">forest fragmentation</a> and degradation. However, since it has been found around gold mining camps and degraded forests, it is not restricted to undisturbed forests and appears to tolerate human activity. Regardless, with its low population, highly restricted range, and badly fragmented habitat, the prospect for survival for the golden-crowned sifaka is considered bleak. For these reasons, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) added it to its list of the 25 most endangered primates in 2000. Previously, in 1992, the IUCN's <a href="IUCN%20Species%20Survival%20Commission">Species Survival Commission</a> (IUCN/SSC) Primate Specialist Group also assigned the species its highest priority rating. As of its 2014 assessment, the golden-crowned sifaka is once again "<a href="Critically%20endangered">Critically Endangered</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. This was an upgrade from 2008 when it was listed as "<a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a>". In previous assessments it was listed as "Critically Endangered" (1996 and 2000) and "Endangered" (1990 and 1994).

The area inhabited by the golden-crowned sifaka is also an important agricultural and economical resource for the human population. Suggested conservation action aimed at protecting this species and its habitat has focused on offering varying degrees of protection to forest fragments in the region, allowing human activity and resource extraction in areas that have less conservation potential while strictly protecting areas critical to the species' survival. In 2002, none of the forested areas that the golden-crowned sifaka inhabits were part of a formally protected <a href="national%20park">national park</a> or <a href="nature%20reserve">reserve</a>. A conservation study from 1989 called for the creation of a national park that includes the forest of <a href="Binara">Binara</a> as well as the dry forests to the north of Daraina. A more recent study from 2002 proposed a network of protected forest areas including areas outside of the village of Daraina, forests north of the Monambato River, and the northern forests that constitute the species' northern reservoir. In 2005, Fanamby, a Malagasy <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a> (NGO), teamed up with <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a> to create a protected area that both Association Fanamby and the Ministry of Water and Forests manage. As of 2008, only ten forest patches that could support viable populations remained, according to the IUCN.
Only one <a href="Captivity%20%28animal%29">captive</a> population of golden-crowned sifakas has been represented in a zoological collection. Building on a successful record of maintaining a viable captive Verreaux's sifaka population, the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a> (DLC) in <a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a>, requested and obtained permission from the <a href="Politics%20of%20Madagascar">government of Madagascar</a> to capture and export this (then) unknown species for <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a>. Plans were also made to establish a captive breeding program at the Ivoloina Forestry Station, now known as <a href="Parc%20Ivoloina">Parc Ivoloina</a>. In November 1987, during the same expedition that resulted in the formal description of the species, two males and two females were caught and measured. Five others were also caught, but were released because they were juvenile males. In July 1988, a golden-crowned sifaka was born in captivity at the DLC. However, the captive population was small and not viable for long-term breeding, and captive sifakas have proven difficult to maintain due to their specialized dietary needs. The last captive individual died in 2008. Despite the loss of its small colony after 20 years, DLC believes that establishment of a captive population for conservation-oriented captive breeding purposes could provide an important second level of protection, particularly if habitat protection measures are unsuccessful.

As a result of the political crisis that began in 2009 and the resulting breakdown of law and order in Madagascar, poachers have hunted lemurs in the Daraina area and sold them to local restaurants as a delicacy. Pictures of dead lemurs that had been smoked for transport were taken by Fanamby and released by Conservation International in August 2009. The lemurs in the photographs included the endangered golden-crowned sifaka, as well as crowned lemurs. Around the time the photographs were released, 15 people were arrested for selling smoked lemurs, which were bought from hunters for 1,000 <a href="Malagasy%20ariary">ariary</a>, or around US$0.53, and then sold in restaurants for 8,000 ariary (US$4.20). <a href="Russell%20Mittermeier">Russell Mittermeier</a>, president of Conservation International, said that the arrests would not end the poaching since the poachers would "just get slaps on the wrist".
