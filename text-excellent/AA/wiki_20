Casey Stengel

Charles Dillon "Casey" Stengel (; July 30, 1890 – September 29, 1975), was an <a href="Americans">American</a> <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> <a href="right%20fielder">right fielder</a>, and <a href="Manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a>, best known as the manager of both the championship <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> of the 1950s and later, of the expansion <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>. He was elected to the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in .

Stengel was born in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, in 1890. In 1910, he began a professional baseball career that would span over half a century. After almost three seasons in the <a href="minor%20league">minor league</a>s, Stengel reached the major leagues late in 1912, as an <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a>, for the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>. His six seasons there saw some success, among them playing for Brooklyn's 1916 <a href="National%20League">National League</a> championship team; but he also developed a reputation as a clown. After repeated clashes over pay with the Dodgers owner, <a href="Charlie%20Ebbets">Charlie Ebbets</a>, Stengel was traded to the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in 1918; however, he enlisted in the Navy that summer, for the remainder of World War I. After returning to baseball, he continued his pay disputes, resulting in trades to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> (in 1919) and to the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> (in 1921). There, he learned much about baseball from the manager, <a href="John%20McGraw">John McGraw</a>, and had some of the glorious moments in his career, such as hitting an <a href="inside-the-park%20home%20run">inside-the-park home run</a> in Game 1 of the <a href="1923%20World%20Series">1923 World Series</a> to defeat the Yankees. His major league playing career ended with the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Boston Braves</a> in 1925, but he then began a career as a manager.

The first twenty years of Stengel's second career brought mostly poor finishes, especially during his MLB managerial stints with the Dodgers (1934–1936) and Braves (1938–1943). He thereafter enjoyed some success on the minor league level, and Yankee <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> <a href="George%20Weiss%20%28baseball%29">George Weiss</a> hired him as manager in October 1948. Stengel's Yankees won the World Series five consecutive times (1949–1953), the only time that has been achieved. Although the team won ten <a href="pennant%20%28sports%29">pennants</a> in his twelve seasons, and won seven World Series, his final two years brought less success, with a third-place finish in 1959, and a loss in the <a href="1960%20World%20Series">1960 World Series</a>. By then aged 70, he was dismissed by the Yankees shortly after the defeat.

Stengel had become famous for his humorous and sometimes disjointed way of speech while with the Yankees, and these skills of showmanship served the expansion Mets well when they hired him in late 1961. He promoted the team tirelessly, as well as managing it to a 40–120 win–loss record, the most losses of any 20th century MLB team. The team finished last all four years he managed it, but was boosted by considerable support from fans. Stengel retired in 1965, and became a fixture at baseball events for the rest of his life. Although Stengel is sometimes described as one of the great managers in major league history, others have contrasted his success during the Yankee years with his lack of success at other times, and concluded he was only a good manager when given good players. Stengel is remembered as one of the great characters in baseball history.

Charles Dillon Stengel was born on July 30, 1890, in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. His ancestry involves German and Irish; his parents—Louis Stengel and Jennie (Wolff) Stengel—were from the <a href="Quad%20Cities">Quad Cities</a> area of Illinois and Iowa, and had moved to Kansas City soon after their 1886 wedding so Louis could take an insurance job. "Charlie" was the youngest of three children, and the second son. Charlie Stengel played <a href="sandlot%20baseball">sandlot baseball</a> as a child, and also played baseball, football and basketball at Kansas City's <a href="Central%20Academy%20of%20Excellence">Central High School</a>. His basketball team won the city championship, while the baseball team won the state championship.

As a teenager, Stengel played on a number of <a href="Semi-professional">semipro</a> baseball teams. He played on the traveling team called the Kansas City Red Sox during the summers of 1908 and 1909, going as far west as Wyoming and earning a dollar a day. He was offered a contract by the <a href="minor%20league">minor league</a> <a href="Kansas%20City%20Blues%20%28American%20Association%29">Kansas City Blues</a> for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, "So I put down my paper and signed. You could never change that boy's mind anyway".

Before reporting to <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> for the Blues in early 1910 at <a href="Excelsior%20Springs%2C%20Missouri">Excelsior Springs, Missouri</a>, Stengel was approached by his neighbor, <a href="Kid%20Nichols">Kid Nichols</a>, a former star pitcher, who advised him to listen to his manager and to the older players, and if he was minded to reject their advice, at least think it over for a month or so first. Stengel failed to make the ball club, which was part of the <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29">American Association</a>, considered one of the top <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor leagues</a>.

Kansas City <a href="option%20%28baseball%29">optioned</a> Stengel to the Kankakee Kays of the Class D <a href="Northern%20Association">Northern Association</a>, a lower-level minor league, to gain experience as an outfielder. He had a .251 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> with Kankakee when the league folded in July. He found a place with the Shelbyville Grays, who moved mid-season and became the Maysville Rivermen, of the Class D <a href="Blue%20Grass%20League">Blue Grass League</a>, batting .221. He returned to the Blues for the final week of the season, with his combined batting average for 1910 at .237.
Uncertain of whether he would be successful as a baseball player, Stengel attended <a href="Western%20Dental%20College">Western Dental College</a> in the 1910–1911 offseason. He would later tell stories of his woes as a left-handed would-be dentist using right-handed equipment. The Blues sold Stengel to the Aurora Blues of the Class C <a href="Wisconsin%E2%80%93Illinois%20League">Wisconsin–Illinois League</a>. He led the league with a .352 batting average. <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> <a href="scout%20%28sport%29">scout</a> Larry Sutton took a trip from Chicago to nearby Aurora, noticed Stengel, and the Dodgers purchased his contract on September 1, 1911. Brooklyn outfielder <a href="Zach%20Wheat">Zach Wheat</a> later claimed credit for tipping off Sutton that Stengel was worth signing. Stengel finished the season with Aurora and returned to dental school for the offseason.

The Dodgers assigned Stengel to the <a href="Montgomery%20Rebels">Montgomery Rebels</a> of the Class A <a href="Southern%20Association">Southern Association</a> for the 1912 season. Playing for manager <a href="Kid%20Elberfeld">Kid Elberfeld</a>, Stengel batted .290 and led the league in <a href="assist%20%28baseball%29">outfield assists</a>. He also developed a reputation as an eccentric player. Scout <a href="Mike%20Kahoe">Mike Kahoe</a> referred to Stengel as a "dandy ballplayer, but it's all from the neck down". After reporting to Brooklyn in September and getting a taste of the big leagues, he spent a third offseason at dental school in 1912–1913. He did not graduate, though whenever his baseball career hit a bad patch in the years to follow, his wife Edna would urge him to get his degree.

In later years, Casey Stengel told stories of his coming to Brooklyn to play for the Dodgers; most focused on his naïveté and were, at least, exaggerated. Wheat was from the Kansas City area and watched over Stengel, getting the young player a locker next to his and working with him on outfield technique. Stengel made his MLB debut at Brooklyn's <a href="Washington%20Park%20%28baseball%29">Washington Park</a> on September 17, 1912, as the starting <a href="center%20fielder">center fielder</a>, and went 4–4 with a walk, two stolen bases and two tie-breaking RBI, leading seventh-place Brooklyn to a stunning 7-3 win over the streaking Pirates and 24-game winner <a href="Claude%20Hendrix">Claude Hendrix</a>. Stengel continued to play well, finishing the season with a .316 batting average, though hitting .351 when right handers started against Brooklyn and only .250 when left handers started.

After holding out for better pay, Stengel signed with the Dodgers for 1913. He won the starting center fielder job. The Dodgers had a new ballpark, <a href="Ebbets%20Field">Ebbets Field</a>, and Stengel became the first person to hit a home run there, first an <a href="inside-the-park%20home%20run">inside-the-park home run</a> against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> in an exhibition game to open the stadium, and then in the regular season. During the 1913 season, Stengel acquired the nickname "Casey"; there are varying stories of how this came to be, though his home town of Kansas City likely played a prominent role—sportswriter <a href="Fred%20Lieb">Fred Lieb</a> stated that the ballplayer had "Charles Stengel—K.C." stenciled on his bags. Although he missed 25 games with injuries, he hit .272 with 7 official home runs in his first full season as a major leaguer. Prior to 1914 spring training, Stengel coached baseball at the <a href="University%20of%20Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a>. Though the position was unpaid, he was designated an <a href="assistant%20professor">assistant professor</a> for the time he was there, something that may have been the source of Stengel's nickname, "The Ol' Perfessor".
The Dodgers were an improving team in Stengel's first years with them, and he was greatly influenced by the manager who joined the team in 1914, <a href="Wilbert%20Robinson">Wilbert Robinson</a>. Stengel also avoided a holdout in 1914; Dodgers owner <a href="Charlie%20Ebbets">Charlie Ebbets</a> was anxious to put his players under contract lest they jump to the new <a href="Federal%20League">Federal League</a>, and nearly doubled Stengel's salary to $4,000 per year. During spring training, the Dodgers faced the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%28minor%20league%29">minor league Baltimore Orioles</a> and their rookie, <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, who pitched. Ruth hit a triple over Stengel's head but gave up two doubles to him, and Stengel chased down a long Ruth fly ball to right in the Dodgers' loss. Both Brooklyn and Stengel started the season slowly, but both recovered with a hot streak that left the Dodgers only 4 games under .500, their best record since 1903, and Stengel finished with a .316 batting average, fifth best in the league. His <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> led the league at .404, though this was not yet an official statistic. With the Federal League still active, Stengel was rewarded with a two-year contract at $6,000 per year.

Stengel reported to spring training ill and thin; he was unable to work out for much of the time the Dodgers spent in Florida. Although the team stated that he had <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, still common in 1915, Lieb wrote after Stengel's death in 1975 that the ballplayer had <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>. Stengel may have been involved in a well-known incident during spring training when Robinson agreed to catch a baseball dropped from an airplane piloted by <a href="Ruth%20Law">Ruth Law</a>—except that it proved not to be a baseball, but a small grapefruit, much to the manager's shock, as he assumed the liquid on him was blood. Law stated that she dropped the grapefruit as she had forgotten the baseball, but Stengel retold the story, imitating Robinson, many times in his later years, with himself as grapefruit dropper, and is often given the credit for the stunt. Stengel's batting average dipped as low as the .150s for part of the season; though he eventually recovered to .237, this was still the worst full season percentage of his major league career.
Soon after the 1916 season started, it became clear that the Dodgers were one of the better teams in the league. Robinson managed to squeeze one more year of productivity out of some older veterans such as <a href="Chief%20Meyers">Chief Meyers</a>, who said of Stengel, "It was Casey who kept us on our toes. He was the life of the party and just kept all us old-timers pepped up all season." Stengel, mostly playing right field, hit .279 with eight home runs, one less than the team leader in that category, Wheat. Stengel's home run off <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> pitcher <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20Alexander">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a>, who won 33 games that year, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 30, provided the margin of victory as the Dodgers went into first place to stay, qualifying for their first World Series, against the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>. Despite getting two hits in a Game 1 loss at Boston, Stengel was benched for Game 2 because the Red Sox were pitching a left hander, Babe Ruth, and Stengel hit better against right handers. Stengel, back in the lineup for Game 3, got a hit in Brooklyn's only victory of the series. He was benched again in Game 4 against left hander <a href="Dutch%20Leonard%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Dutch Leonard</a>, though he was inserted as a <a href="pinch%20runner">pinch runner</a>, and got another hit in the Game 5 loss, finishing 4 for 11, .364, the best Dodger batting average of the Series.

Despite the successful season, Ebbets was determined to cut his players' salaries, including Stengel, whom he considered overpaid. By then, the Federal League was defunct, and the <a href="reserve%20clause">reserve clause</a> prevented players from jumping to other major league clubs. The owner sent Stengel a contract for $4,600, and when that was rejected, cut it by another $400. A holdout ensured, together with a war of words waged in the press. With little leverage, Stengel became willing to sign for the original contract, and did on March 27, 1917, but missed most of spring training. Stengel's batting average dropped from .279 to .257 as the defending league champion Dodgers finished seventh in the eight-team league, but he led the team in games, hits, doubles, triples, home runs and runs batted in. After the season, Ebbets sent Stengel a contract for $4,100, and the outfielder eventually signed for that amount, but on January 9, 1918, Ebbets traded him along with <a href="George%20Cutshaw">George Cutshaw</a> to the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> for <a href="Burleigh%20Grimes">Burleigh Grimes</a>, <a href="Al%20Mamaux">Al Mamaux</a> and <a href="Chuck%20Ward">Chuck Ward</a>.

The Pirates had been the only National League team to do worse than the Dodgers in 1917, finishing last. Stengel met with the Pirates owner <a href="Barney%20Dreyfuss">Barney Dreyfuss</a> to seek a salary increase, but found Dreyfuss reluctant to deal until Stengel proved himself as a Pirate. On June 3, 1918, Stengel was ejected for arguing with the umpire, and was fined by the league office for taking off his shirt on the field. The U.S. had been fighting in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> for a year, and Stengel enlisted in the Navy. His wartime service was playing for and managing the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a>'s baseball team, driving in the only run to beat Army, 1–0, before 5,000 spectators at the <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a>. He also occasionally helped paint a ship—he later stated he had guarded the <a href="Gowanus%20Canal">Gowanus Canal</a>, and not a single submarine got into it.
The Armistice renewed the war between Stengel and Dreyfuss, and the outfielder held out again to begin the 1919 season. Both wanted to see Stengel traded, but no deal was immediately made. By then, Stengel's position as regular right fielder had been taken by <a href="Billy%20Southworth">Billy Southworth</a>, and he had difficulty breaking back into the lineup. Stengel played better than he had before he enlisted, and by the time Dreyfuss traded him to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> for <a href="Possum%20Whitted">Possum Whitted</a> on August 9, he was batting .293 with four home runs. But before being traded, Stengel pulled one of his most famous stunts, on May 25 at Ebbets Field, as a member of the visiting Pirates. It was not unusual at Ebbets Field for right fielders of either team, rather than go to the dugout after three were out, to go to the Dodgers' bullpen, in foul territory down the right field line, if they were not likely to bat in the upcoming inning. Stengel did so to visit old friends, and discovered that pitcher <a href="Leon%20Cadore">Leon Cadore</a> had captured a sparrow. Stengel took it, and, called to bat in the sixth inning, quietly placed it under his cap. He received mixed boos and cheers from the Brooklyn crowd as a former Dodger, took a deep bow at the plate, and doffed his cap, whereupon the bird flew away to great laughter from the crowd.

The trade to the Phillies ended Stengel's major league season for 1919, as he refused to report unless he got a raise, and when one was not forthcoming, returned to Kansas City to raise a barnstorming team. In the offseason, he came to terms with <a href="William%20Baker%20%28baseball%29">William Baker</a>, the owner of the Phillies, and hit .292 in 1920 with nine home runs. However, racked by injuries and no longer young for a ballplayer, he did not play much in the early part of the 1921 season. On June 30, 1921, the Phillies traded Stengel, <a href="Red%20Causey">Red Causey</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Rawlings">Johnny Rawlings</a> to the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> for <a href="Lee%20King%20%28outfielder%2C%20born%201892%29">Lee King</a>, <a href="Goldie%20Rapp">Goldie Rapp</a> and <a href="Lance%20Richbourg">Lance Richbourg</a>. The Giants were one of the dominant teams in the National League and Stengel, who had feared being sent to the minor leagues, quietly placed a <a href="long%20distance%20call">long distance call</a> once informed to ensure he was not the victim of a practical joke.

When Stengel reported to the Giants on July 1, 1921, they were managed, as they had been for almost 20 years, by <a href="John%20McGraw">John McGraw</a>. Stengel biographer Robert W. Creamer said of McGraw, "his Giants were the most feared, the most respected, the most admired team in baseball". Stengel biographer <a href="Marty%20Appel">Marty Appel</a> noted, "McGraw and Stengel. Teacher and student. Casey was about to learn a lot about managing". Stengel had time to learn, playing in only 18 games for the Giants in 1921, mostly as a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a>, and watched from his place on the bench as McGraw led the Giants from a 7 game deficit on August 24 to the National League <a href="pennant%20%28sports%29">pennant</a>. Although he was on the 25-player postseason roster, Stengel did not appear in the <a href="1921%20World%20Series">1921 World Series</a> against the Yankees, as McGraw used only 13 players (4 of them pitchers) in beating the Yankees, five games to three. The only contribution Stengel made to the box score was being ejected from Game 5 for arguing.

McGraw brought several outfielders into spring training with the Giants. When Stengel was not included with the starters when the manager split the squad, some sportswriters assumed he would not be with the team when the regular season began. Stengel, at McGraw's request, acted as a coach to the young players on the "B" squad, and worked hard, getting key hits in spring training games, and making the Giants as a reserve outfielder. McGraw and Stengel sometimes stayed up all night, discussing baseball strategy. With two Giant outfielders injured by June, Stengel was put in center field, and hit .368 in 84 games, as McGraw <a href="platoon%20%28baseball%29">platooned</a> him against right handers. If Stengel had enough <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>s to qualify for the league batting championship, he would have finished second to <a href="Rogers%20Hornsby">Rogers Hornsby</a> of the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, who hit .401. The Giants played the Yankees again in the <a href="1922%20World%20Series">1922 World Series</a>; Stengel went 1–4 in Game 1, nursing an injured right leg muscle, which he aggravated running out an infield single in his first at bat in Game 2. Stengel was obviously limping when he was advanced to second base on another single, and McGraw sent in a pinch runner. He did not use Stengel again in the Series, which the Giants won, four games to zero, with one tie. After the Series, Stengel and other major leaguers went on a barnstorming tour of Japan and the Far East.
The year 1923 started much the same as the year before, with Stengel detailed to the "B" squad as player and coach in spring training, making the team as a reserve, and then inserted as center fielder when righties pitched. Similar also were Stengel's hot batting streaks, helping the Giants as they contended for their third straight pennant. Stengel was ejected several times for brawling or arguing with the umpire, and the league suspended him for ten games in one incident. McGraw continued to use him as a means of exerting some control over the younger players. During that summer, Stengel fell in love with Edna Lawson, a Californian who was running part of her father's building contracting business; they were married the following year. Near the end of the season, he sustained a mild foot injury, causing McGraw to rest him for a week, but he played the final two games of the regular season to finish at .339 as the Giants and Yankees each won their leagues.

Until 1923, the Yankees had been tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds, but had opened <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> that year, and this was the site for Game 1 of the <a href="1923%20World%20Series">1923 World Series</a> on October 10. Casey Stengel's at bat in the ninth inning with the score tied 4–4 was "the stuff of legend", as Appel put it in his history of the Yankees. Before the largest crowd he had ever played before, Stengel lined a <a href="changeup">changeup</a> from <a href="Bullet%20Joe%20Bush">Joe Bush</a> for a hit that went between the outfielders deep to left center. Hobbled by his injury and even more as a sponge inside his shoe flew out as he rounded second base, Stengel slowly circled the bases, and evaded the tag from catcher <a href="Wally%20Schang">Wally Schang</a> for an inside-the-park home run, providing the winning margin. Thus, the first World Series home run in old Yankee Stadium's history did not go to Babe Ruth, "that honor, with great irony, would fall to the aging reserve outfielder Casey Stengel".

After the Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds, the Series returned to Yankee Stadium for Game 3. Stengel won it, 1–0, on a home run into the right field <a href="bleachers">bleachers</a>. As the Yankee fans booed Stengel, he thumbed his nose at the crowd and blew a kiss toward the Yankee players, outraging the team's principal owner, <a href="Jacob%20Ruppert">Jacob Ruppert</a>, who demanded that <a href="Baseball%20Commissioner">Baseball Commissioner</a> <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> fine or suspend Stengel. Judge Landis declined, saying "a man who wins two games with home runs may feel a little playful, especially if he's a Stengel". The Yankees won the next three games to take the Series; Stengel batted .417 in the six games, completing his World Series career as a player with a .393 batting average.

On November 13, 1923, twenty-nine days after the World Series ended, Stengel was traded to the perennial second-division-dwelling <a href="History%20of%20the%20Boston%20Braves">Boston Braves</a> with <a href="Dave%20Bancroft">Dave Bancroft</a> and <a href="Bill%20Cunningham%20%28outfielder%29">Bill Cunningham</a> for <a href="Joe%20Oeschger">Joe Oeschger</a> and <a href="Billy%20Southworth">Billy Southworth</a>. Stengel had enjoyed his time in New York and was initially unhappy at the trade, especially since he had become close to McGraw. He soon cooled down, and later praised McGraw as "the greatest manager I ever played for". Despite nagging pains in his legs, Stengel played in 134 games during the 1924 season, the most since his days with the Dodgers, and hit .280 with a team-leading 13 <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s, but the Braves finished last. After the season, Stengel joined a baseball tour of Europe organized by McGraw and <a href="Charles%20Comiskey">Charles Comiskey</a>, with Edna Stengel accompanying the team. Casey Stengel met King <a href="George%20V">George V</a> and the <a href="George%20VI">Duke of York</a>, later to become King George VI; Edna sipped tea with <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a>, an experience that strained her nerves. That winter, the Stengels moved into a house built by Edna's father in <a href="Glendale%2C%20California">Glendale, California</a>, where they would live the rest of their lives. The marriage produced no children.

Stengel started 1925 on the active roster of the Braves, but was used as a pinch hitter and only started once, in right field against the Pirates on May 14, a game in which he got his only MLB hit of 1925, the final one of his major league career, a single. His average sank to .077. The owner of the Braves, <a href="Emil%20Fuchs%20%28baseball%29">Emil Fuchs</a> purchased the <a href="Worcester%20Panthers">Worcester Panthers</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20League%20%28baseball%2C%201916%E2%80%9332%29">Eastern League</a>, and hired Stengel as <a href="player-manager">player-manager</a> and team president. Appel noted that in joining the Panthers, Stengel was "starting out on a managing career that would eventually take him to <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Cooperstown</a>". With fans enjoying Stengel's on-field antics and his World Series heroics still recent, he was the Eastern League's biggest attendance draw. Between run-ins with the umpires, Stengel hit .302 in 100 games as the Panthers finished third.

The Panthers were not a box office success, and Fuchs planned to move the team to <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a> for the 1926 season, with Stengel to remain in his roles. However, McGraw, with whom Stengel had remained close, wanted him to take over as manager of the Giants' top affiliate, the <a href="Toledo%20Mud%20Hens">Toledo Mud Hens</a> of the <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29">American Association</a>, at an increase in salary. He was still under contract, and Fuchs refused to release him. So Manager Stengel resigned, which President Stengel accepted, and the president then released Stengel as a player and resigned. Fuchs was outraged, and went to Judge Landis, who advised him to let the matter go.
Stengel's six years in Toledo would be as long as he would spend anywhere as manager, except his time with the Yankees of the 1950s. McGraw sent talented players down to Toledo, and the Mud Hens threatened for the pennant in Stengel's first year before falling back to third. In 1927, the team won its first pennant and defeated the <a href="Buffalo%20Bisons">Buffalo Bisons</a>, five games to one, in the <a href="Junior%20World%20Series">Little World Series</a>. Stengel missed part of the 1927 campaign, as he was suspended by the league for inciting the fans to attack the umpire after a close play during the first game of the <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> doubleheader. Stengel continued as an occasional player as late as 1931 in addition to his managerial role, hitting a game-winning home run (the last of his professional career) in 1927 for the Mud Hens. Since minor league clubs suffer large turnovers in their rosters, the team's success did not carry over to 1928, when it finished sixth, and then eighth in the eight-team league in 1929. The team recovered for third in 1930, but by then both Stengel and the team (in which he had invested) were having financial problems due to the start of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. The team finished last again in 1931, and, after Landis was convinced no money had been skimmed off to benefit Stengel and other insiders, the team went into receivership, and Stengel was fired.

Stengel had approached the new manager of the Dodgers, <a href="Max%20Carey">Max Carey</a>, an old teammate from his time with the Pirates, seeking a job, and was hired as <a href="first%20base%20coach">first base coach</a>. Stengel thus ended an exile of seven years from the major leagues: Appel suggested that Stengel's reputation as a clown inhibited owners from hiring him although he was known as knowledgeable and able to manage the press. Sportswriter <a href="Dan%20Daniel%20%28sportswriter%29">Dan Daniel</a> described Stengel's hiring as "the return of an ancient <a href="Flatbush%2C%20Brooklyn">Flatbush</a> landmark", which might satisfy old Dodger fans upset at Robinson's dismissal at the end of 1931. Brooklyn finished third and then sixth with Stengel in the first base coaching box. Among the players was <a href="catcher">catcher</a> <a href="Al%20Lopez">Al Lopez</a>; the two became close friends and would be managing rivals in the 1950s <a href="American%20League">American League</a>.
During the winter following the 1933 season, the manager of the world champion Giants, <a href="Bill%20Terry">Bill Terry</a> was interviewed by the press about the other teams in the National League. When asked about the Dodgers, Terry responded, "Brooklyn? Gee, I haven't heard a peep out of there. Is Brooklyn still in the league?" This angered Brooklyn's management, and they expected Carey to make a full-throated response. When he remained silent, he was fired. One sportswriter regarded the hiring of Stengel as too logical a thing to happen in Brooklyn, but on February 24, 1934, Stengel faced the press for the first time as the manager of a major league team. McGraw, Stengel's mentor, was too ill to issue a statement on seeing him become a major league manager; he died the following day.

Stengel, hired only days before spring training, had but a limited opportunity to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, where they would end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's <a href="Baker%20Bowl">Baker Bowl</a>: with Dodger pitcher <a href="Boom-Boom%20Beck">Boom-Boom Beck</a> ineffective, Stengel went out to the mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, <a href="Hack%20Wilson">Hack Wilson</a>, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.

The Dodgers finished fifth in 1935 and seventh in 1936. Dodger management felt Stengel had not done enough with the talent he had been given, and he was fired during the <a href="1936%20World%20Series">1936 World Series</a> between the Yankees and Giants. Stengel was paid for one year left on his contract, and he was not involved in baseball during the 1937 season. Stengel had invested in oil properties, as advised by one of his players, <a href="Randy%20Moore">Randy Moore</a>, a Texan; the investment helped make the Stengels well to do, and they put the profits in California real estate. Stengel considered going in the oil business full-time, but Braves president <a href="Bob%20Quinn%20%28baseball%29">Bob Quinn</a> offered him the Boston managerial job in late 1937, and he accepted.

Stengel was both manager and an investor in the Braves. In his six years there, 1938 to 1943, his team never finished in the top half of the league standings, and the Boston club finished seventh four straight years between 1939 and 1942, saved from last place by the fact that the Phillies were even worse. The entry of the United States in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> meant that many top players went into the service, but for the Braves, the changeover made little difference in the standings. Among the young players to join the Braves was pitcher <a href="Warren%20Spahn">Warren Spahn</a>, who was sent down to the minor leagues by the manager for having "no heart". Spahn, who would go on to a Hall of Fame career, much of it with the Braves, would play again for Stengel on the woeful <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> in 1965, and joke that he was the only person to play for Stengel both before and after he was a genius.

A few days before the opening of the 1943 season, Stengel was hit by a vehicle while crossing <a href="Commonwealth%20Avenue%20%28Boston%29">Commonwealth Avenue</a> in Boston, and he severely fractured a leg. He missed the first two months of the season, receiving many well-wishers, and reading get-well cards jokingly misaddressed to the hospital's psychiatric ward. For the rest of his life, Stengel walked with a limp. At the end of the season, Braves management, tired of minimal progress, fired Stengel, and he received no immediate job offers. Stengel testified about this part of his career before a Senate subcommittee fifteen years later, "I became a major league manager in several cities and was discharged. We call it discharged because there is no question I had to leave".

Stengel thought the 1943 season would be his last in baseball; Edna urged him to look after the family business interests full-time, and Casey, who had always been an athlete, was reluctant to show himself at a baseball stadium with the imperfectly-healed injury. But early in the 1944 season, the minor-league <a href="Milwaukee%20Brewers%20%28minor%20league%20baseball%20team%29">Milwaukee Brewers</a> had a managing vacancy to fill, as the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> had hired away the Brewer manager, <a href="Charlie%20Grimm">Charlie Grimm</a>, who had played with Stengel on the 1919 Pirates. Grimm told the Cubs he was obliged to see the Brewers had a competent replacement, and urged the Brewers to hire Stengel. The team owner, <a href="Bill%20Veeck">Bill Veeck</a>, stationed with the Marines on <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a>, thought ill of Stengel as a manager, and was very reluctant in his consent when reached by cable. Stengel was adept at fostering good relations with reporters, and the very talented team continued to win; by the end of May, Veeck had withdrawn his objections. The team won the American Association pennant, but lost in the playoffs to <a href="Louisville%20Redbirds">Louisville</a>. Veeck, having returned to the United States, offered to rehire Stengel for 1945, but Stengel preferred another offer he received. This was from <a href="George%20Weiss%20%28baseball%29">George Weiss</a> of the New York Yankees, to manage the team Stengel had begun with, the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Blues%20%28American%20Association%29">Kansas City Blues</a>, by then a Yankee farm club. Kansas City had finished last in the American Association as Milwaukee won the pennant, making it something of a comedown for Stengel, who hoped to return to the major leagues. Nevertheless, it was in his old home town, allowing him to see friends and relations, and he took the job. The Blues finished seventh in the eight-team league in 1945.
Although there was no major league managing vacancy Stengel could aspire to, the <a href="Oakland%20Oaks%20%28PCL%29">Oakland Oaks</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>
had fired their manager, and approached Stengel. The baseball played in the PCL was close to major league level, and the league featured many aging big leaguers finishing their careers. Also attractive to Stengel was that the league had three teams in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>, allowing him to spend more time at his home in Glendale. To that time, the club had won only one pennant, and was something of a weak sister to its crossbay rivals, the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Seals%20%28baseball%29">San Francisco Seals</a>, but owner Brick Laws believed Stengel could mold the players into a winning team.

The Oaks finished second in the league behind the Seals in 1946, winning the first round of the playoffs against <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20%28PCL%29">Los Angeles</a> before losing to San Francisco in the finals. They finished fourth in 1947, beating San Francisco in the first round before losing to Los Angeles. Stengel managed the Oaks for a third year in 1948, with the roster heavy with former major leaguers. Among the younger players on the team was 20-year-old <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a>. Stengel was impressed by Martin's fielding, baseball acuity, and, when there were brawls on the field, fighting ability. The Oaks clinched the pennant on September 26, and defeated Los Angeles and the <a href="Seattle%20Rainiers">Seattle Rainiers</a> to win the <a href="Governors%27%20Cup">Governors' Cup</a>. "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>" named Stengel the Minor League Manager of the Year.

Stengel had been talked about as a possible Yankee manager in the early 1940s, but longtime team boss <a href="Ed%20Barrow">Ed Barrow</a> (who retired in 1945) refused to consider it. Yankee manager <a href="Joe%20McCarthy%20%28manager%29">Joe McCarthy</a> retired during the 1946 season, and after the interim appointment of catcher <a href="Bill%20Dickey">Bill Dickey</a> as player-manager, <a href="Bucky%20Harris">Bucky Harris</a> was given the job in 1947. Stengel's name was mentioned for the job before Harris got it; he was backed by Weiss, but <a href="Larry%20MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a>, then in charge of the franchise, was opposed. Harris and the Yankees won <a href="1947%20World%20Series">the World Series that year</a>, but finished third in 1948, though they were not eliminated until the penultimate day. Harris was fired, allegedly because he would not give Weiss his home telephone number. MacPhail could no longer block Stengel's hiring, as he had sold his interest in the Yankees after the 1947 season. Weiss, who became <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> after MacPhail's departure, urged his partners in the Yankees to allow the appointment of Stengel, who aided his own cause by winning the championship with Oakland during the time the Yankee job stood open. <a href="Del%20Webb">Del Webb</a>, who owned part of the Yankees, had initial concerns but went along. Yankee scouts on the West Coast recommended Stengel, and Webb's support helped bring around co-owner <a href="Dan%20Topping">Dan Topping</a>.

Stengel was introduced as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th anniversary of his second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> attended the press conference as a sign of team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in the top half of the standings. Stengel's MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.

Stengel tried to keep a low profile during the 1949 Yankee spring training at <a href="St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida">St. Petersburg, Florida</a>, but there was considerable media attention as Stengel shuttled rookies from one position on the field to another, and endlessly shuffled his lineup. He had the advantage of diminished expectations, as DiMaggio, the Yankee superstar, was injured with a bone spur in his heel, and few picked New York to win the pennant. There were other injuries once the season began, and Stengel, who had initially planned a conservative, stable lineup in his first American League season, was forced to improvise. Although <a href="platoon%20%28baseball%29">platooning</a>, playing right handed batters against left handed pitchers and the reverse, against whom they are on average more able to hit, had been known for some years, Stengel popularized it, and his use gave the practice its name, coined by a sportswriter and borrowed from football. For example, in the early part of the 1949 season, Stengel might against right handers play <a href="Bobby%20Brown%20%28third%20baseman%29">Bobby Brown</a> at third base and <a href="Cliff%20Mapes">Cliff Mapes</a> and <a href="Gene%20Woodling">Gene Woodling</a> in the outfield. Against left handers, Stengel might play <a href="Billy%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29">Billy Johnson</a> at third with <a href="Johnny%20Lindell">Johnny Lindell</a> and <a href="Hank%20Bauer">Hank Bauer</a> in the outfield.

After the team blew leads and lost both ends of a doubleheader <a href="History%20of%20the%20Philadelphia%20Athletics">in Philadelphia</a> on May 15, Stengel called a team meeting in which he criticized the players responsible for the two losses, but also predicted greatness for them, and told the team it was going to win. The team then won 13 of its next 14 games. Yankee sportscaster <a href="Curt%20Gowdy">Curt Gowdy</a>, who was present, later stated, "that speech in Philadelphia was the turning point of the season".

DiMaggio returned from injury on June 28 after missing 65 games. He hit four home runs in three games to help sweep Boston and extend the Yankees' league lead. Despite DiMaggio's return, the lineup remained plagued with injuries. After consulting with Stengel, Weiss obtained <a href="Johnny%20Mize">Johnny Mize</a> from the Giants, but he was soon sidelined with a separated shoulder. Twelve games behind on the Fourth of July, the Red Sox steadily gained ground on the Yankees, and tied them by sweeping a two-game set at Fenway September 24 and 25, the first time the Yankees had not been in sole possession of first place since the third game of the season. The Red Sox took the lead the following day with a comeback win in a makeup game, as Stengel lost his temper at the umpire for the first time in Yankee uniform; although he was not ejected, he was fined by the league.

The season came down to a two-game set with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, with the home team one game behind and needing to win both. Stengel, during the 1949 season, had shown himself more apt than his peers to bring in a relief pitcher, and when during the first game, starter <a href="Allie%20Reynolds">Allie Reynolds</a> gave up the first two runs in the third inning, the manager brought in <a href="Joe%20Page">Joe Page</a>. Though Page walked in two more runs, he shut out the Red Sox the rest of the way as the Yankees came back to win, 5–4. This set up a winner-take-all game for the league title. The Yankees took a 5–0 lead before Boston scored three in the ninth, but <a href="Vic%20Raschi">Vic Raschi</a> was able to prevent further damage, giving the Yankees the pennant, Stengel's first as a major league manager.

In the <a href="1949%20World%20Series">1949 World Series</a>, Stengel's first as a participant since 1923, the Yankees faced the Brooklyn Dodgers, who were assembling the team that would challenge the Yankees through much of his time in New York. The teams split the first two games, at Yankee Stadium. Before Game 3 at Ebbets Field, Stengel was called upon to introduce his surviving teammates from the 1916 pennant-winning Brooklyn club, which he did emotionally. The Yankees won Game 3, and during Game 4, a Yankee victory, Stengel left the dugout to shout to catcher <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a> to throw the ball to second base, which Berra did to catch <a href="Pee%20Wee%20Reese">Pee Wee Reese</a> trying to take an extra base. For this breach of baseball's rules, Stengel was reprimanded after the game by Commissioner <a href="Happy%20Chandler">Happy Chandler</a>. The Yankees won Game 5 as well to take the Series, and during the celebration after the game, Del Webb said of Stengel to the press, "I knew he would win, whether we got some more players for him or not".

During the 1949 season, Stengel had been more subdued than he usually was, but being the manager of the defending world champions and the <a href="Sporting%20News%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Major League Manager of the Year</a> relieved his inhibitions, and he was thereafter his talkative self. He also was more forceful in running the team, not always to the liking of veteran players such as DiMaggio and <a href="Phil%20Rizzuto">Phil Rizzuto</a>. As part of his incessant shuffling of the lineup, Stengel had DiMaggio play first base, a position to which he was unaccustomed and refused to play after the first game. Stengel considered DiMaggio's decline in play as he neared the end of his stellar career more important than his resentment. In August, with the slugger in the middle of a batting slump, Stengel benched him, stating he needed a rest. DiMaggio returned after six games, and hit .370 for the rest of the season, winning the <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> title. Other young players on the 1950 team were Billy Martin and <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a>. The ascendence of these rookies meant more of the Yankees accepted Stengel's techniques, and diminished the number of those from the McCarthy era who resented their new manager. The <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> were the Yankees' main competition, leading for much of the summer, but the Yankees passed them in the middle of September to win the pennant by three games. In the <a href="1950%20World%20Series">1950 World Series</a>, the Yankees played the Phillies, another of Stengel's old teams. The Yankees won in four games.
Before spring training in 1950, the Yankees had pioneered the idea of an <a href="Florida%20Instructional%20League">instructional school</a> for rookies and other young players. This was the brainchild of Stengel and Weiss. Complaints from other teams that the Yankees were violating time limits on spring training and were using their money for competitive advantage led to modifications, but the concept survived and was eventually broadly adopted. Among those invited to the 1951 early camp was 19-year-old <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>, whose speed and talent awed Stengel, and who had spent the previous year in the minor leagues. Stengel moved Mantle from shortstop to the outfield, reasoning that Rizzuto, the shortstop, was likely to play several more years. Both Mantle and the Yankees started the 1951 season slowly, and on July 14, Mantle was sent to Kansas City to regain his confidence at the plate. He was soon recalled to the Yankees; although he hit only .267 for the season, this was four points better than DiMaggio, in his final season. Much of the burden of winning a third consecutive pennant fell on Berra, who put together an MVP season. The <a href="White%20Sox">White Sox</a> and then the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Indians</a> led the league for much of the summer, but the Yankees, never far behind, put together a torrid final month of the season to win the pennant by five games.
The Yankee opponent in the <a href="1951%20World%20Series">1951 World Series</a> was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the <a href="Miracle%20of%20Coogan%27s%20Bluff">Miracle of Coogan's Bluff</a>. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had <a href="Johnny%20Sain">Johnny Sain</a> pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in <a href="Bob%20Kuzava">Bob Kuzava</a>, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers <a href="Monte%20Irvin">Monte Irvin</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Thomson">Bobby Thomson</a> were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.

DiMaggio's retirement after the 1951 season gave Stengel greater control over the players, as the relationship between superstar and manager had sometimes been fraught. Stengel moved Mantle from right to center field in DiMaggio's place. The Yankees were not the favorites to win the pennant again in 1952, with DiMaggio retired, Mantle still recovering from his injury and several Yankees in military service, deployed in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. Sportswriters favored the Indians. Younger players, some of whom Stengel had developed, came to the fore, with Martin the regular second baseman for the first time. Mantle proved slow to develop, but hit well towards the end of the season to finish at .311. The Yankee season was also slow to get on track; the team had a record of 18–17 on May 30, but they improved thereafter. Stengel prepared nearly 100 different lineup cards for the 1952 season. The race was still tight in early September, and on September 5, Stengel lectured the team for excessive levity on the train after the Yankees lost two of three to Philadelphia. Embarrassed by the episode, which made its way into print, the Yankees responded by winning 15 of their next 19, clinching the pennant on September 27.

The <a href="1952%20World%20Series">1952 World Series</a> was against the Brooklyn Dodgers, who by then had their stars of the 1950s such as <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>, <a href="Gil%20Hodges">Gil Hodges</a> and <a href="Duke%20Snider">Duke Snider</a>, with the team later nicknamed "The Boys of Summer". The teams split the first four games. With his pitching staff tired, Stengel gave the start to late-season acquisition <a href="Ewell%20Blackwell">Ewell Blackwell</a>, who surrendered four runs in five innings, and the Yankees lost the game in 11 innings to the Dodgers behind <a href="Carl%20Erskine">Carl Erskine</a>'s complete game. Needing to win two in a row at Ebbets Field, Stengel pitched Raschi in Game 6, who won it with a save from Reynolds. With no tomorrow in Game 7, Stengel sent four pitchers to the mound. Mantle hit a home run to break a 2–2 tie, Martin preserved the lead by making a difficult catch off a Robinson popup, and Kuzava again secured the final outs for a Series victory, as the Yankees won 4–2 for their fourth straight World Series victory, matching the record set in 1936–1939, also by the Yankees.

The sportswriters had picked other teams to win the pennant in Stengel's first four years as Yankee manager; in 1953 they picked the Yankees, and this time they were proven correct. An 18-game winning streak in June placed them well in front, and they coasted to their fifth consecutive league championship, the first time a team had won five straight pennants. The Yankees played the Dodgers again in the <a href="1953%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, which was less dramatic than the previous year's, as the Yankees won in six games, with Mantle, Martin, Berra and <a href="Gil%20McDougald">Gil McDougald</a>—players developed under Stengel—taking the fore. The Yankees and Stengel won the World Series for the fifth consecutive year, the only team to accomplish that feat. Stengel, having taken the managerial record for consecutive pennants from McGraw (1921–1924) and McCarthy (1936–1939) and for consecutive titles from the latter, would say, "You know, John McGraw was a great man in New York and he won a lot of pennants. But Stengel is in town now, and he's won a lot of pennants too".

The Yankees started the defense of their title in 1954 with an opening day loss to the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> in the presence of President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>. Even though the Yankees won 103 games, the most regular season victories they would have under Stengel, they lost by 8 games to the Indians, managed by Stengel's old friend Al Lopez. In spite of the defeat, Stengel was given a new two-year contract at $75,000 per year.

By the mid-1950s, Stengel was becoming a national figure, familiar from television broadcasts of the Yankees on NBC's <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Game%20of%20the%20Week">"Game of the Week"</a>, and from managing in most World Series and <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Games</a> during his tenure. National magazines such as <a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">"Look"</a> and "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" did feature stories about Stengel, and his turn of phrase became known as "Stengelese". The magazines not only told stories about the manager's one-liners and jokes, but recounted the pranks from his playing days, such as the grapefruit dropped from the plane and the sparrow under the cap. According to Richard Bak in his biography of Stengel, "people across the country grew enamored of the grandfatherly fellow whose funny looks and fractured speech were so at odds with the Yankees' bloodless corporate image".
The Yankees won the pennant again in 1955, breaking open a close pennant race in September to take the American League. They played the Dodgers again in <a href="1955%20World%20Series">the World Series</a>, which the Dodgers won in seven games. The Dodgers won Game 7, 2–0, behind the pitching of <a href="Johnny%20Podres">Johnny Podres</a> and Stengel, after losing his first World Series as a manager, blamed himself for not instructing his hitters to bat more aggressively against Podres. Billy Martin stated, "It's a shame for a great manager like that to have to lose".

There was not much of a pennant race in the American League in 1956, with the Yankees leading from the second week of the season onwards. With little suspense as to the team's standing, much attention turned to Mantle's batting, as he made a serious run at Babe Ruth's record at the time of 60 home runs in a season, finishing with 52, and won the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Triple%20Crown">Triple Crown</a>. On August 25, <a href="Old-Timers%27%20Day">Old-Timers' Day</a>, Stengel and Weiss met with the little-used Rizzuto, the last of the "McCarthy Yankees" and released him from the team so they could acquire <a href="Enos%20Slaughter">Enos Slaughter</a>. Never a Stengel fan, the process left Rizzuto bitter.

<a href="1956%20World%20Series">The World Series</a> that year was again against the Dodgers, who won the first two games at Ebbets Field. Stengel lectured the team before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium and the team responded with a victory then and in Game 4. For Game 5, Stengel pitched <a href="Don%20Larsen">Don Larsen</a>, who had been knocked out of Game 2, and who responded with a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a>, the only one in major league postseason history. The Dodgers won Game 6 as the Series returned to Ebbets Field. Many expected Whitey Ford to start Game 7, but Stengel chose <a href="Johnny%20Kucks">Johnny Kucks</a>, an 18-game winner that season who had been used twice in relief in the Series. Kucks threw a three-hit shutout as the Yankees won the championship, 9–0, Stengel's sixth as their manager.

New York got off to a slow start in the 1957 season, and by early June was six games out. By then, the team was making headlines off the field. Some of the Yankees were known for partying late into the night, something Stengel turned a blind eye to as long as the team performed well. The May 16 brawl at the <a href="Copacabana%20%28nightclub%29">Copacabana nightclub</a> in New York involved Martin, Berra, Mantle, Ford, <a href="Hank%20Bauer">Hank Bauer</a> and other Yankees, resulted in the arrest of Bauer (the charge of assault was later dropped) and exhausted Yankee management's patience with Martin. Stengel was close to Martin, who took great pride in being a Yankee, and Topping and Weiss did not involve the manager in the trade talks that ensued. On June 15, Martin was traded to the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Athletics">Kansas City Athletics</a>. Martin wrote in his autobiography that Stengel could not look him in the eye as the manager told him of the trade. The two, once close friends, rarely spoke in the years to come.

The Yankees recovered from their slow start, winning the American League pennant by eight games. They faced the <a href="Milwaukee%20Braves">Milwaukee Braves</a> in the <a href="1957%20World%20Series">1957 World Series</a>. The Braves (Stengel had managed them when they played in Boston) defeated the Yankees in seven games, with <a href="Lew%20Burdette">Lew Burdette</a>, who had been a Yankee until traded in 1950, beating New York three times. Stengel stated in an interview, "We're going to have Burditis on our minds next year".
What was seen as a failure to keep discipline on the team hurt Stengel's standing with the Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67, had several times fallen asleep in the dugout, and players complained that he was growing more irritable with the years. Former Yankee catcher <a href="Ralph%20Houk">Ralph Houk</a>, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel's first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel's contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the <a href="1958%20World%20Series">1958 World Series</a>. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of <a href="Bob%20Turley">Bob Turley</a> (who got two wins and a <a href="save%20%28baseball%29">save</a> in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.

The Yankees finished 79–75 in 1959, in third place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won the pennant. There was considerable criticism of Stengel, who was viewed as too old and out of touch with the players.

After the 1959 season, Weiss made a trade with Kansas City to bring <a href="Roger%20Maris">Roger Maris</a> to the Yankees. Stengel was delighted with the acquisition and batted Maris third in the lineup, just in front of Mantle, and the new Yankee responded with an MVP season in 1960. Stengel had health issues during the season, spending ten days in the hospital in late May and early June, with the illness variously reported as a bladder infection, a virus or influenza. The Yankees were challenged by the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> for most of the year but won the pennant by eight games, Stengel's tenth as manager, tying the major league record held by McGraw. The Yankees played the Pittsburgh Pirates, again a team Stengel had played for, in the <a href="1960%20World%20Series">1960 World Series</a>, and Stengel picked <a href="Art%20Ditmar">Art Ditmar</a>, who had won the most games, 15, for the Yankees, rather than the established star, Whitey Ford. The Pirates knocked Ditmar out of the box in the first inning, and won Game 1. Ditmar was also knocked out of Game 5; Ford won Games 3 and 6 of the seven-game series with shutouts, but could not pitch Game 7, as he might have if Stengel had used him in Games 1 and 5. The Pirates defeated the Yankees in Game 7, 10–9, on a ninth-inning <a href="Bill%20Mazeroski">Bill Mazeroski</a> home run.
Shortly after the Yankees returned to New York, Stengel was informed by the team owners that he would not be given a new contract. His request, that the termination be announced at a press conference, was granted and on October 18, 1960, Topping and Stengel appeared before the microphones. After Topping evaded questions from the press about whether Stengel had been fired, Stengel took the microphone, and when asked if he had been fired, stated, "Quit, fired, whatever you please, I don't care". Topping stated that Stengel was being terminated because of his age, 70, and alleged that this would have happened even had the Yankees won the World Series.

Two days after dismissing Stengel, the Yankees announced the hiring of Houk as his replacement—part of the reason for Stengel's firing was so that New York would not lose Houk to another team. Stengel returned to Glendale, and had no job in baseball during the 1961 season, the first time that had occurred since 1937. He turned down several job offers, to manage the Tigers, <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> and the expansion <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Angels">Los Angeles Angels</a>. He spent the summer of 1961 as vice president of the Glendale Valley National Bank, which was owned by members of Edna Stengel's family.

As part of baseball's expansion in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, to play in the National League beginning in 1962, and to be known as the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a>. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the <a href="1961%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20expansion%20draft">expansion draft</a>, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, <a href="Joan%20Whitney%20Payson">Joan Whitney Payson</a> and <a href="M.%20Donald%20Grant">M. Donald Grant</a>, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. <a href="Leonard%20Koppett">Leonard Koppett</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" suggested that Stengel took the job to give something back to the game that had been his life for half a century.
Weiss was convinced his scouting staff would make the Mets a respectable team in five to six years, but in the interim New York would most likely do poorly. He hoped to overcome the challenge of attracting supporters to a losing team in the "City of Winners" by drafting well-known players who would draw fans to the Polo Grounds, where the Mets would initially play. Thus, the Mets selected a number of over-the-hill National Leaguers, some of whom had played for the Dodgers or Giants, including <a href="Gil%20Hodges">Gil Hodges</a>, <a href="Roger%20Craig%20%28baseball%29">Roger Craig</a>, <a href="Don%20Zimmer">Don Zimmer</a> and <a href="Frank%20Thomas%20%28outfielder%29">Frank Thomas</a>. Selected before them all was journeyman catcher <a href="Hobie%20Landrith">Hobie Landrith</a>; as Stengel explained, "You have to have a catcher or you'll have a lot of <a href="passed%20ball">passed ball</a>s".

The return of Casey Stengel to spring training received considerable publicity, and when the Mets played the Yankees in an exhibition game, Stengel played his best pitchers while the Yankees treated it as a meaningless game, and the Mets won, 4–3. The team won nearly as many games as it lost in spring training, but Stengel warned, "I ain't fooled. They play different when the other side is trying too". The Mets lost their first nine games of the regular season; in the meantime the Pirates were 10–0, meaning the Mets were already 9 games out of first place. Some light appeared in May, when the Mets won 11 of 18 games to reach eighth place in the ten-team league. They then lost 17 in a row, returning to last place, where they would spend the remainder of the season.

According to sportswriter Joseph Durso, "on days when [Stengel's] amazing Mets were, for some reason, amazing, he simply sat back and let the writers swarm over the heroes of the diamond. On days when the Mets were less than amazing—and there were many more days like that—he stepped into the vacuum and diverted the writers' attention, and typewriters, to his own flamboyance ... the perfect link with the public was formed, and it grew stronger as the team grew zanier". The Mets became an alternative to the stuffy Yankees that appealed to the younger generation of fans. As the losing continued, a particular fan favorite was "Marvelous" <a href="Marv%20Throneberry">Marv Throneberry</a>, who was a "lightning-rod for disaster" in the 1962 season, striking out to kill rallies, or dropping pop flies and routine throws to first base. During one game, Throneberry hit a massive shot to right, winding up on third base, only to be called out for missing first. Stengel came from the dugout to argue, only to be told that Throneberry had missed second base as well.
Stengel tried incessantly to promote the Mets, talking to reporters or anyone else who would listen. He often used the word "amazin' " (as he put it) and soon this became the "Amazin' Mets", a nickname that stuck. Stengel urged the fans, "Come out and see my amazin' Mets. I been in this game a hundred years but I see new ways to lose I never knew existed before". Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing with a record of 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.

The 1963 season unfolded for the Mets much like the previous year's, though they lost only eight games to begin the season, rather than nine, but they still finished 51–111, in last place. One highlight, though it did not count in the standings, was the <a href="Mayor%27s%20Trophy%20Game">Mayor's Trophy Game</a> on June 20 at Yankee Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 6–2.
In 1964, the Mets moved into the new <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a>; Stengel commented that "the park is lovelier than my team". The Mets finished 53–109, again in last place. By this time, the fans were starting to be impatient with the losing, and a number of people, including sportscaster <a href="Howard%20Cosell">Howard Cosell</a> and former Dodger Jackie Robinson, criticized Stengel as ineffective and prone to fall asleep on the bench. Stengel was given a contract for 1965, though Creamer suggested that Weiss, Grant and Payson would have preferred that the 74-year-old Stengel retire.
The early part of the 1965 season saw similar futility. On July 25, the Mets had a party at <a href="Toots%20Shor%27s">Toots Shor's</a> for the invitees to the following day's Old-Timers' Game. Sometime during that evening, Stengel fell and broke his hip. The circumstances of his fall are not known with certainty, as he did not realize he had been severely injured until the following day. Stengel spent his 75th birthday in the hospital. Recognizing that considerable rehabilitation would be required, he retired as manager of the Mets on August 30, replaced by <a href="Wes%20Westrum">Wes Westrum</a>, one of his coaches. The Mets would again finish in last place.

The Mets retired Stengel's uniform number, 37, on September 2, 1965, after which he returned to his home in California. He was kept on the team payroll as a vice president, but for all intents and purposes he was out of baseball. His life settled into a routine of attending the World Series (especially when in California), the All-Star Game, Mets spring training, and the baseball writers' dinner in New York. The writers, who elect members of baseball's Hall of Fame, considered it unjust that Stengel should have to wait the usual five years after retirement for election, and waived that rule. On March 8, 1966, at a surprise ceremony at the Mets spring training site in St. Petersburg, Stengel was told of his election; he was inducted in July along with <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a>. Thereafter, he added the annual Hall of Fame induction ceremony to his schedule. In 1969, the "Amazin' Mets" justified their nickname by unexpectedly winning <a href="1969%20World%20Series">the World Series</a> over the favored Orioles. Stengel attended the Series, threw out the first ball for Game 3 at Shea, and visited the clubhouse after the Mets triumphed in Game 5 to win the Series. The Mets presented him with a championship ring.
Stengel also participated in Old-Timers' Day at a number of ballparks, including, regularly, Shea Stadium. In 1970, the Yankees invited him to Old-Timers' Day, at which his number, 37, was to be retired. By this time, the Yankee ownership had changed, and the people responsible for his dismissal were no longer with the team. He accepted and attended, and Stengel became the fifth Yankee to have his number retired. He thereafter became a regular at the Yankees' Old-Timers' Day.

By 1971, Edna Stengel was showing signs of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, and in 1973, following a stroke, she was moved into a nursing home. Casey Stengel continued to live in his Glendale home with the help of his housekeeper June Bowdin. Stengel himself showed signs of senility in his last years, and during the final year of his life, these increased. In his last year, Stengel cut back on his travel schedule, and was too ill to attend the Yankees' Old-Timers Day game in August 1975, at which it was announced that Billy Martin would be the new team manager. A diagnosis of cancer of the lymph glands had been made, and Stengel realized he was dying. In mid-September, he was admitted to Glendale Memorial Hospital, but the cancer was inoperable. He died there on September 29, 1975. Stengel was interred in the <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%20%28Glendale%29">Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery</a> in Glendale. 

The tributes to Stengel upon his death were many. <a href="Maury%20Allen">Maury Allen</a> wrote, "He is gone and I am supposed to cry, but I laugh. Every time I saw the man, every time I heard his voice, every time his name was mentioned, the creases in my mouth would give way and a smile would come to my face". <a href="Richie%20Ashburn">Richie Ashburn</a>, a member of the 1962 Mets, stated, "Don't shed any tears for Casey. He wouldn't want you to ... He was the happiest man I've ever seen". <a href="Jim%20Murray%20%28sportswriter%29">Jim Murray</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a> " wrote, "God is certainly getting an earful tonight".

Edna Stengel died in 1978, and was interred next to her husband. In addition to the marker at their graves in Forest Lawn Cemetery, there is a plaque nearby in tribute to Casey Stengel, which besides biographical information contains a bit of Stengelese, "There comes a time in every man's life, and I've had plenty of them".

As part of professional baseball's centennial celebrations in 1969, Stengel was voted its "Greatest Living Manager". He had his uniform number, 37, retired by both the Yankees and the Mets. He is the first man in MLB history to have had his number retired by more than one team based solely upon his managerial accomplishments, and was joined in that feat by the late <a href="Sparky%20Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a> in 2011, who had called Stengel "the greatest man" in the history of baseball. The Yankees dedicated a plaque in Yankee Stadium's <a href="Monument%20Park%20%28Yankee%20Stadium%29">Monument Park</a> in Stengel's memory on July 30, 1976, reading: "Brightened baseball for over 50 years; with spirit of eternal youth; Yankee manager 1949–1960 winning 10 pennants and 7 world championships including a record 5 consecutive, 1949–1953". He was inducted into the <a href="New%20York%20Mets%20Hall%20of%20Fame">New York Mets Hall of Fame</a> in 1981.
Stengel is the only man to have worn the uniform (as player or manager) of all four Major League Baseball teams in New York City in the 20th century: the Dodgers, Giants, Yankees and Mets. He is the only person to have played or managed for the home team in five New York City major league venues: <a href="Washington%20Park%20%28baseball%29">Washington Park</a>, <a href="Ebbets%20Field">Ebbets Field</a>, the <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a>, <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a> and the original <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a>. In 2009, in an awards segment on the <a href="MLB%20Network">MLB Network</a> titled "The Prime 9", he was named "The Greatest Character of The Game", beating out Yogi Berra.

Stengel re-invigorated platooning in baseball. Most of Stengel's playing days were after offensive platooning, choosing left-handed batters against a right-handed pitcher and the converse, was used successfully by the World Series champion <a href="1914%20Boston%20Braves%20season">1914 Boston "Miracle" Braves</a>. This set off widespread use of platooning: Stengel himself was several times during his playing career platooned against right-handers, but the practice fell into disuse around 1930. Stengel reintroduced it to the Yankees, and its prominent use amid the team's success caused it to be imitated by other teams. <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> deemed Stengel and <a href="Earl%20Weaver">Earl Weaver</a> the most successful platoon managers.

This strategic selection also applied to the pitchers, as Stengel leveraged his staff, starting his best pitchers against the best opponents. Although Stengel is best known for doing this with the Yankees, he also did it in his days managing Brooklyn and Boston, and to a very limited extent with the Mets. Rather than have a regular pitching rotation to maximize the number of starts a pitcher will have, Stengel often rested pitchers longer to take advantage of situational advantages which he perceived. For example, Stengel started <a href="Eddie%20Lopat">Eddie Lopat</a> against Cleveland whenever possible, because he regularly beat them. Stengel's 1954 Yankees had the highest <a href="sabermetrics">sabermetrics</a> measurement of Leverage Points Average of any 20th century baseball team. Leveraging became unpopular after choices of starting pitchers based on it backfired on Lopez in the 1959 World Series and on Stengel in the following year's—he waited until Game 3 to start Whitey Ford because he felt Ford would be more effective at Yankee Stadium rather than at the small <a href="Forbes%20Field">Forbes Field</a>. Ford pitched two shutouts, including Game 6 at Forbes Field, but could not pitch in the Yankees' Game 7 loss. Stengel's philosophy took another blow in 1961 when Houk used Ford in a regular rotation and the pitcher went 25–4 and won the <a href="Cy%20Young%20Award">Cy Young Award</a>—he had never won 20 games under Stengel. Today, teams prefer, for the most part, a regular rotation.

James noted that Stengel was not only the most successful manager of the 1950s, he was the most dominant manager of any single decade in baseball history. Stengel used his entire squad as Yankee manager, in contrast to other teams when he began his tenure, on which substitutes tended to get little playing time. Stengel's use of platooning meant more players saw more use, and he was generally more prone to put in a pinch hitter or replace his pitcher than other managers. Although only once in Stengel's time (1954) did the Yankees lead the league in number of pinch hitters, Stengel was known for using them in odd situations, once pinch-hitting for <a href="Moose%20Skowron">Moose Skowron</a> in the first inning after a change of pitcher. Additionally, according to James, Stengel "rotated lineups with mad abandon, using perhaps 70 to 100 different lineups in a 154 game season". Although Stengel was not the first Yankee manager to use a regular relief pitcher—Harris had seen success with <a href="Joe%20Page">Joe Page</a> in 1947—his adoption of the concept did much to promote it.

Stengel often rotated infielders between positions, with the Yankees having no real regular second baseman or shortstop between 1954 and 1958. Despite this, the Yankees had a strong defensive infield throughout. Stengel gave great attention to the <a href="double%20play">double play</a>, both defensively and in planning his lineup, and the Yankees responded by being first in the league in double plays as a defense six times in his twelve-year tenure, and the batters hit into the fewest double plays as a team eight times in that era. Having had few players he could rely upon while managing Brooklyn and Boston, Stengel treated his Yankee roster with little sentimentality, trading players quickly when their performance seemed to decline, regardless of past accomplishments. Assured of quality replacements secured by the Yankee front office, the technique worked well, but was not a success with the Mets, where no quality replacements were available, and the technique caused confusion and apathy among the players.

Appel wrote of Stengel, "He was not a man for all seasons; he was a man for baseball seasons". Stengel remains the only manager to lead his club to victory in five consecutive World Series. How much credit he is due for that accomplishment is controversial, due to the talent on the Yankee teams he managed—"<a href="Total%20Baseball">Total Baseball</a>" deemed that the Yankees won only six games more than expected during the Stengel years, given the number of runs scored and allowed. According to Bak, "the argument—even among some Yankees—was that the team was so good "anybody" could manage it to a title". Rizzuto stated, "You or I could have managed and gone away for the summer and still won those pennants". Appel noted, "There was no doubt, by taking on the Mets job, he hurt his reputation as a manager. Once again, it was clear that with good players he was a good manager, and with bad players, not. Still, his Yankee years had put him so high on the list of games won, championships won, etc., that he will always be included in conversations about the greatest managers".
<a href="Bill%20Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> said of Stengel in 1966, soon after the manager's retirement, "He was never necessarily the greatest of managers, but any time he had a ball club that had a chance to win, he'd win". Stengel's American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him "I swear I don't understand some of the things he does when he manages". Though platooning survives, Stengel's intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of <a href="instant%20replay">instant replay</a> makes obsolete Stengel's tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.

Stengel has been praised for his role in successfully launching the Mets. Appel deemed the Mets' beginnings unique, as later expansion teams have been given better players to begin with, "few expansion teams in any sport have tried the formula—a quotable, fan-popular man who would charm the press and deflect attention away from ineptness on the field". <a href="Arthur%20Daley%20%28sportswriter%29">Arthur Daley</a> of "The New York Times" wrote, "he gave the Mets the momentum they needed when they needed it most. He was the booster that got them off the ground and on their journey. The smoke screen he generated to accompany the blast-off obscured the flaws and gave the Mets an acceptance and a following they could not have obtained without him". James wrote, "Stengel became such a giant character that you really can't talk about him in the past. He became an enduring part of the game". Commissioner <a href="William%20Eckert">William Eckert</a> said of Stengel, "he's probably done more for baseball than anyone".

A child of the <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> era, and from a <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border state</a> (Missouri) with southern characteristics, Stengel has sometimes been accused of being a racist, for example by Roy Campanella Jr., who stated that Stengel made racist remarks from the dugout during the World Series towards his father <a href="Roy%20Campanella">Roy Campanella</a>, Jackie Robinson and other black stars of the Dodgers. Bak noted, though, that Stengel was a "vicious and inventive" <a href="bench%20jockey">bench jockey</a>, hazing the other team with whatever might throw off their performance. Stengel had poor relations with Robinson; each disliked the other and was a vocal critic. One widely quoted Stengel comment was about catcher <a href="Elston%20Howard">Elston Howard</a>, who became the first black Yankee in 1955, eight years after Robinson had broken the color barrier, "they finally get me a nigger, I get the only one who can't run". Howard, though, denied that Stengel had shouted racial epithets at the Dodgers, and said "I never felt any prejudice around Casey". <a href="Al%20Jackson">Al Jackson</a>, a black pitcher with the Mets under Stengel, concurred, "He never treated me with anything but respect". According to Bill Bishop in his account of Stengel, "Casey did use language that would certainly be considered offensive today, but was quite common vernacular in the fifties. He was effusive in his praise of black players like <a href="Satchel%20Paige">Satchel Paige</a>, <a href="Larry%20Doby">Larry Doby</a> and Howard". Conscious of changing times, Stengel was more careful in his choice of words while with the Mets.
Stengel was sometimes considered thoughtless or even cruel towards his players. Examples of this include his playing Joe DiMaggio at first base, and sometimes batting Phil Rizzuto ninth, behind the pitcher, as well as his dismissal of the shortshop on Old-Timers' Day in 1956. In spite of their falling out over the 1957 trade, Billy Martin, by then manager of the Yankees, wore a black armband in remembrance of Stengel during the 1976 season, the sole Yankee to do so. According to Creamer, "It doesn't seem to be stretching the point too far to say that <a href="Ned%20Hanlon%20%28baseball%29">Ned Hanlon</a> begat John McGraw who begat Casey Stengel who begat Billy Martin".

Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia

Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia (; – July 17, 1918) was the youngest daughter of <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar Nicholas II</a>, the last sovereign of <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Imperial Russia</a>, and his wife, <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna</a>.

Anastasia was the younger sister of Grand Duchesses <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia">Olga</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Tatiana%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia">Tatiana</a>, and <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Maria%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia%20%281899%E2%80%931918%29">Maria</a>, and was the elder sister of <a href="Alexei%20Nikolaevich%2C%20Tsarevich%20of%20Russia">Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia</a>. She was <a href="Execution%20of%20the%20Romanov%20family">murdered with her family</a> by members of the <a href="Cheka">Cheka</a>, the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> <a href="secret%20police">secret police</a>, in <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> on July 17, 1918.

Persistent rumors of her possible escape circulated after her death, fueled by the fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist</a> rule. The mass grave near <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> which held the remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991, and the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter—either Anastasia or her older sister Maria—were discovered in 2007. Her possible survival has been conclusively disproved. Scientific analysis including <a href="DNA%20testing">DNA testing</a> confirmed that the remains are those of the <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">imperial family</a>, showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918.

Several women falsely claimed to have been Anastasia; the best known impostor is <a href="Anna%20Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>. Anderson's body was cremated upon her death in 1984, but DNA testing in 1994 on available pieces of Anderson's tissue and hair showed no relation to the Romanov family.

When Anastasia was born, her parents and <a href="extended%20family">extended family</a> were disappointed that she was a girl. They hoped for a son who would be heir apparent to the throne. Tsar Nicholas II went for a long walk to compose himself before going to visit <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Tsarina Alexandra</a> and the newborn Anastasia for the first time. The fourth grand duchess was named for the fourth-century martyr <a href="Anastasia%20of%20Sirmium">St. Anastasia</a>, known as "the breaker of chains" because, in honor of her birth, her father pardoned and reinstated students who had been imprisoned for participating in riots in St. Petersburg and <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> the previous winter. "Anastasia" is a Greek name (Αναστασία), meaning "of the resurrection", a fact often alluded to later in stories about her rumored survival. Anastasia's title is most precisely translated as "Grand Princess". "Grand Duchess" became the most widely used translation of the title into English from Russian.

The Tsar's children were raised as simply as possible. They slept on hard camp cots without pillows, except when they were ill, took cold baths in the morning, and were expected to tidy their rooms and do needlework to be sold at various charity events when they were not otherwise occupied. Most in the household, including the servants, generally called the Grand Duchess by her first name and <a href="patronym">patronym</a>, Anastasia Nikolaevna, and did not use her title or style. She was occasionally called by the French version of her name, "Anastasie", or by the Russian nicknames "Nastya", "Nastas", or "Nastenka". Other family nicknames for Anastasia were "Malenkaya", meaning "little (one)" in Russian, or "schwipsig", meaning "merry little one" or "little mischief" in German.

Young Anastasia was a vivacious and energetic child, described as short and inclined to be chubby, with blue eyes and strawberry-blonde hair. <a href="Margaretta%20Eagar">Margaretta Eagar</a>, a governess to the four grand duchesses, said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child she had ever seen.

While often described as gifted and bright, she was never interested in the restrictions of the school room, according to her tutors <a href="Pierre%20Gilliard">Pierre Gilliard</a> and <a href="Charles%20Sydney%20Gibbes">Sydney Gibbes</a>. Gibbes, Gilliard, and <a href="Lady-in-waiting">ladies-in-waiting</a> <a href="Lili%20Dehn">Lili Dehn</a> and <a href="Anna%20Vyrubova">Anna Vyrubova</a> described Anastasia as lively, mischievous, and a gifted actress. Her sharp, witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots.

Anastasia's daring occasionally exceeded the limits of acceptable behavior. "She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius", said <a href="Gleb%20Botkin">Gleb Botkin</a>, son of the court physician <a href="Eugene%20Botkin">Yevgeny Botkin</a>, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a <a href="snowball%20fight">snowball fight</a> at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, <a href="Princess%20Nina%20Georgievna%20of%20Russia">Princess Nina Georgievna</a>, recalled that "Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. <a href="Hallie%20Erminie%20Rives">Hallie Erminie Rives</a>, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.

Anastasia and her older sister Maria were known within the family as "The Little Pair". The two girls shared a room, often wore variations of the same dress, and spent much of their time together. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as "The Big Pair". The four girls sometimes signed letters using the nickname <a href="OTMA">OTMA</a>, which was derived from the first letters of their first names.

Despite her energy, Anastasia's physical health was sometimes poor. The Grand Duchess suffered from painful <a href="bunion">bunion</a>s, which affected both of her big toes. Anastasia had a weak muscle in her back and was prescribed twice-weekly massage. She hid under the bed or in a cupboard to put off the massage. Anastasia's older sister, Maria, reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria's mother. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the <a href="hemophilia">hemophilia</a> gene, like their mother.

Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal <a href="Coagulation">blood clotting</a> factor that can lead to heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from <a href="Hemophilia%20B">Hemophilia B</a>, a rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they might have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.

Her mother relied on the counsel of <a href="Grigori%20Rasputin">Grigori Rasputin</a>, a Russian peasant and wandering "<a href="starets">starets</a>" or "holy man," and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Anastasia and her siblings were taught to view Rasputin as "Our Friend" and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Anastasia's aunt <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia</a> was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Anastasia, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. "All the children seemed to like him," Olga Alexandrovna recalled. "They were completely at ease with him." Rasputin's friendship with the imperial children was evident in some of the messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework."

However, one of the girls' governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred. Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future. The children were aware of the tension and feared that their mother would be angered by Tyutcheva's actions. "I am so afr(aid) that S.I. (governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva) can speak ... about our friend something bad," Anastasia's twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to their mother on March 8, 1910. "I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now."
Tyutcheva was eventually fired. She took her story to other members of the family. While Rasputin's visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on March 15, 1910, that she couldn't understand "...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a "<a href="khlysts">khlyst</a>"!)"

In the spring of 1910, Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, a royal governess, claimed that Rasputin had raped her. Vishnyakova said the empress refused to believe her account of the assault, and insisted that "everything Rasputin does is holy." Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova's claim had been immediately investigated, but instead "they caught the young woman in bed with a <a href="Cossack">Cossack</a> of the Imperial Guard." Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she made her accusation and was eventually dismissed from her post in 1913.

However, rumors persisted and it was later whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all accounts innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. "My dear, precious, only friend," wrote Anastasia. "How much I should like to see you again. You appeared to me today in a dream. I am always asking Mama when you will come ... I think of you always, my dear, because you are so good to me ..."

This was followed by circulation of <a href="Cartoon%20pornography">pornographic cartoons</a>, which depicted Rasputin having relations with the Empress, her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova. After the scandal, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until his murder on December 17, 1916. "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916.

In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared "cold and visibly terribly upset" by Rasputin's death, and sat "huddled up closely together" on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov recalled that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse by Anastasia, her mother and her sisters. She attended his funeral on December 21, 1916, and her family planned to build a church over the site of Rasputin's grave. After they were killed by the Bolsheviks, it was discovered Anastasia and her sisters were all wearing amulets bearing Rasputin's picture and a prayer.

During World War I, Anastasia, along with her sister Maria, visited wounded soldiers at a <a href="private%20hospital">private hospital</a> in the grounds at <a href="Tsarskoye%20Selo">Tsarskoye Selo</a>. The two teenagers, too young to become <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> nurses like their mother and elder sisters, played games of <a href="checkers">checkers</a> and <a href="billiards">billiards</a> with the soldiers and tried to lift their spirits. Felix Dassel, who was treated at the hospital and knew Anastasia, recalled that the grand duchess had a "laugh like a squirrel", and walked rapidly "as though she "tripped" along."

In February 1917, Anastasia and her family were placed under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> at the <a href="Alexander%20Palace">Alexander Palace</a> in Tsarskoye Selo during the <a href="February%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. Nicholas II abdicated on March 2/15, 1917. As the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s approached, <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a> of the <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a> had them moved to <a href="Tobolsk">Tobolsk</a>, <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. After the Bolsheviks seized majority control of Russia, Anastasia and her family were moved to the <a href="Ipatiev%20House">Ipatiev House</a>, or House of Special Purpose, at <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>.

The stress and uncertainty of captivity took their toll on Anastasia as well as her family. "Goodby ", she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. "Don't forget us." At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about "Evelyn Hope", a poem by <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a> about a girl: "When she died she was only sixteen years old ... Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she he(a)rd of him also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [their] next life whenever it will be that ...", she wrote.

At Tobolsk, she and her sisters sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from their captors, since Alexandra had written to warn them that she, Nicholas and Maria had been searched upon arriving in Yekaterinburg, and had items confiscated. Their mother used predetermined <a href="code%20word">code word</a>s "medicines" and "Sednev's belongings" for the jewels. Letters from Demidova to Tegleva gave the instructions. Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children at Yekaterinburg:
"The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ..."

<a href="Baroness%20Sophie%20Buxhoeveden">Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden</a> told of her sad last glimpse of Anastasia: "Once, standing on some steps at the door of a house close by, I saw a hand and a pink-sleeved arm opening the topmost pane. According to the blouse the hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia. They could not see me through their windows, and this was to be the last glimpse that I was to have of any of them!"

However, even in the last months of her life, she found ways to enjoy herself. She and other members of the household performed plays for the enjoyment of their parents and others in the spring of 1918. Anastasia's performance made everyone howl with laughter, according to her tutor Sydney Gibbes.

In a May 7, 1918, letter from <a href="Tobolsk">Tobolsk</a> to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia described a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: "We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times ... What weather we've had! One could simply shout with joy." In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as "very friendly and full of fun", while another guard said Anastasia was "a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus." Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess "offensive and a terrorist" and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.

In the summer, the privations of the captivity, including their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. According to some accounts, at one point Anastasia became so upset about the locked, painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air. A sentry reportedly saw her and fired, narrowly missing her. She did not try again. On July 14, 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, "Something has happened to them in there." But the next day, on July 15, 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards were not watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at <a href="Yakov%20Yurovsky">Yakov Yurovsky</a>, the head of the detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.

After the <a href="October%20Revolution">Bolshevik revolution</a> in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>. Negotiations for the release of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped <a href="White%20movement">White Army</a>. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at <a href="Ganina%20Yama">Ganina Yama</a>.

The "Yurovsky Note", an account of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik superiors following the killings, was found in 1989 and detailed in <a href="Edvard%20Radzinsky">Edvard Radzinsky</a>'s 1992 book, "The Last Tsar". According to the note, on the night of the deaths the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. Once dressed, the family and the small circle of servants who had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house's sub-basement and told to wait. Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress's request. After several minutes, the guards entered the room, led by Yurovsky, who quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed. The Tsar had time to say only "What?" and turn to his family before he was killed by several bullets to the chest (not, as is commonly stated, to the head; his skull, recovered in 1991, bears no bullet wounds). The Tsarina and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross, but were killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners. The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra's maid. Demidova survived the initial onslaught, but was quickly stabbed to death against the back wall of the basement, while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub-basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels.

The "Yurovsky Note" further reported that once the thick smoke that had filled the room from so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared, it was discovered that the executioners' bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses. The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family's crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside the linings of the corsets to hide them from their captors. The corsets thus served as a form of "armor" against the bullets. Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall, covering their heads in terror, until they were shot down by bullets, recalled Yurovsky. However, another guard, Peter Ermakov, told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets. As the bodies were carried out, one or more of the girls cried out, and were clubbed on the back of the head, wrote Yurovsky.

Anastasia's supposed escape and possible survival was one of the most popular historical mysteries of the 20th century, provoking many books and films. At least ten women claimed to be her, offering varying stories as to how she had survived. <a href="Anna%20Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>, the best known Anastasia <a href="Romanov%20impostors">impostor</a>, first surfaced publicly between 1920 and 1922. She contended that she had feigned death among the bodies of her family and servants, and was able to make her escape with the help of a compassionate guard who noticed she was still breathing and took sympathy upon her. Her legal battle for recognition from 1938 to 1970 continued a lifelong controversy and was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts, where it was officially filed. The final decision of the court was that Anderson had not provided sufficient proof to claim the identity of the grand duchess.

Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated. DNA tests were conducted in 1994 on a tissue sample from Anderson located in a hospital and the blood of <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, a great-nephew of <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Empress Alexandra</a>. According to Dr Gill who conducted the tests, "If you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could not be related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra." Anderson's <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> was a match with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker. Some supporters of Anderson's claim acknowledged that the DNA tests proving she could not have been the Grand Duchess had "won the day".

Other lesser known claimants were <a href="Nadezhda%20Ivanovna%20Vasilyeva">Nadezhda Ivanovna Vasilyeva</a> and <a href="Eugenia%20Smith">Eugenia Smith</a>. Two young women claiming to be Anastasia and her sister Maria were taken in by a priest in the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a> in 1919 where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964. They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna.
Rumors of Anastasia's survival were embellished with various contemporary reports of trains and houses being searched for "Anastasia Romanov" by Bolshevik soldiers and secret police. When she was briefly imprisoned at <a href="Perm">Perm</a> in 1918, <a href="Princess%20Helen%20of%20Serbia">Princess Helena Petrovna</a>, the wife of Anastasia's distant cousin, <a href="Prince%20John%20Constantinovich%20of%20Russia">Prince John Constantinovich of Russia</a>, reported that a guard brought a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked if the girl was the daughter of the Tsar. Helena Petrovna said she did not recognize the girl and the guard took her away. Although other witnesses in Perm later reported that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after the murders, this story is now widely discredited. Rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed to hide the fact that the family was dead. A few days after they had been murdered, the German government sent several telegrams to Russia demanding "the safety of the princesses of German blood". Russia had recently signed a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk%20%28Russia%E2%80%93Central%20Powers%29">peace treaty</a> with the Germans, and did not want to upset them by letting them know the women were dead, so they told them they had been moved to a safer location.

In another incident, eight witnesses reported the recapture of a young woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37, northwest of Perm. These witnesses were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova (and her son Fyodor Sitnikov), Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr Pavel Utkin, a physician who treated the girl after the incident. Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by <a href="White%20movement">White Russian</a> Army investigators. Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl, whom he treated at <a href="Cheka">Cheka</a> headquarters in Perm, told him, "I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia." Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named "N" at the orders of the secret police. White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription. During the same time period in mid-1918, there were several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees. <a href="Boris%20Soloviev">Boris Soloviev</a>, the husband of Rasputin's daughter <a href="Maria%20Rasputin">Maria</a>, defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses to assist in deceiving the families he had defrauded.

Some biographers' accounts speculated that the opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a survivor existed. <a href="Yakov%20Yurovsky">Yakov Yurovsky</a> demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies.

In 1991, the presumed burial site of the imperial family and their servants was excavated in the woods outside <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who were still ruling Russia at the time. The grave only held nine of the expected eleven sets of remains. DNA and skeletal analysis matched these remains to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of the four grand duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and presumably Maria). The other remains, with unrelated DNA, correspond to the family's doctor (<a href="Eugene%20Botkin">Yevgeny Botkin</a>), their valet (<a href="Alexei%20Trupp">Alexei Trupp</a>), their cook (<a href="Ivan%20Kharitonov">Ivan Kharitonov</a>), and Alexandra's maid (<a href="Anna%20Demidova">Anna Demidova</a>). Forensic expert <a href="William%20R.%20Maples">William R. Maples</a> decided that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia's bodies were missing from the family's grave. Russian scientists contested this conclusion, however, claiming it was the body of Maria that was missing. The Russians identified the body as that of Anastasia by using a <a href="computer%20program">computer program</a> to compare photos of the youngest grand duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact.

American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended <a href="wisdom%20teeth">wisdom teeth</a>, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in a seventeen-year-old. In 1998, when the remains of the imperial family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5'7" (1.70 m) was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of her standing beside her three sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Anastasia was several inches shorter than all of them.

The account of the "Yurovsky Note" indicated that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area in order to further disguise the burials of the Tsar and his retinue, if the remains were discovered by the Whites, since the body count would not be correct. Searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children.

However, on August 23, 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones were from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three years old. Anastasia was seventeen years and one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Anastasia's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old respectively at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found "shards of a container of <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber". The site was initially found with <a href="metal%20detector">metal detector</a>s and by using metal rods as probes.

DNA testing by multiple international laboratories such as the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20DNA%20Identification%20Laboratory">Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory</a> and <a href="Innsbruck%20Medical%20University">Innsbruck Medical University</a> confirmed that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, proving conclusively that all family members, including Anastasia, died in 1918. The parents and all five children are now accounted for, and each has his or her own unique DNA profile. While the tests have confirmed that all the Romanov bodies have been found, one of the studies was still unsure as to sorting out which body from the two graves was specifically Maria’s and which was Anastasia’s:
It should be mentioned that a well publicized debate over which daughter, Maria (according to Russian experts) or Anastasia (according to US experts), has been recovered from the second grave cannot be settled based upon the DNA results reported here. In the absence of a DNA reference from each sister, we can only conclusively identify Alexei – the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra.

In 2000, Anastasia and her family were <a href="Canonization">canonized</a> as <a href="passion%20bearer">passion bearer</a>s by the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>. The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church%20Abroad">Russian Orthodox Church Abroad</a> as <a href="martyr">holy martyrs</a>. The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred in the St. Catherine Chapel at <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20Cathedral">Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, St Petersburg</a> on July 17, 1998, eighty years after they were murdered.

The purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of <a href="Film">cinema</a>, <a href="Television%20movie">made-for-television</a> films, and a <a href="Anastasia%20%28musical%29">Broadway musical</a>. The earliest, made in 1928, was called "<a href="Clothes%20Make%20the%20Woman">Clothes Make the Woman</a>". The story followed a woman who turns up to play the part of a rescued Anastasia for a Hollywood film, and ends up being recognized by the Russian soldier who originally rescued her from her would-be assassins.

His best-known orchestral compositions—"<a href="Capriccio%20Espagnol">Capriccio Espagnol</a>", the "<a href="Russian%20Easter%20Festival%20Overture">Russian Easter Festival Overture</a>", and the symphonic <a href="suite%20%28music%29">suite</a> "<a href="Scheherazade%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Scheherazade</a>"—are staples of the <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a> repertoire, along with suites and excerpts from some of his 15 operas. "Scheherazade" is an example of his frequent use of <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a> and <a href="folklore">folk subjects</a>.

Rimsky-Korsakov believed, as did fellow composer <a href="Mily%20Balakirev">Mily Balakirev</a> and critic <a href="Vladimir%20Stasov">Vladimir Stasov</a>, in developing a <a href="musical%20nationalism">nationalistic</a> style of <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a>. This style employed <a href="Russian%20traditional%20music">Russian folk song</a> and <a href="Folklore%20of%20Russia">lore</a> along with exotic harmonic, <a href="melody">melodic</a> and <a href="Rhythm%23Terminology">rhythmic</a> elements in a practice known as musical <a href="orientalism">orientalism</a>, and eschewed traditional Western compositional methods. Rimsky-Korsakov appreciated Western musical techniques after he became a professor of musical composition, <a href="harmony">harmony</a> and orchestration at the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Conservatory">Saint Petersburg Conservatory</a> in 1871. He undertook a rigorous three-year program of self-education and became a master of Western methods, incorporating them alongside the influences of <a href="Mikhail%20Glinka">Mikhail Glinka</a> and fellow members of <a href="The%20Mighty%20Handful">The Five</a>. His techniques of composition and orchestration were further enriched by his exposure to the works of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>.

For much of his life, Rimsky-Korsakov combined his composition and teaching with a career in the Russian military—at first as an officer in the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother's exploits in the navy. This love of the sea may have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau "<a href="Sadko%20%28musical%20tableau%29">Sadko</a>" (not to be confused with his later <a href="Sadko%20%28opera%29">opera of the same name</a>) and "Scheherazade". Through his service as Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwind</a> and <a href="brass%20instrument">brass</a> playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law, <a href="Maximilian%20Steinberg">Maximilian Steinberg</a>.

Rimsky-Korsakov left a considerable body of original <a href="Russian%20nationalism%23Imperial%20Russian%20nationalism">Russian nationalist</a> compositions. He prepared works by The Five for performance, which brought them into the active classical repertoire (although there is controversy over his editing of the works of <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Modest Mussorgsky</a>), and shaped a generation of younger composers and musicians during his decades as an educator. Rimsky-Korsakov is therefore considered "the main architect" of what the classical music public considers the Russian style of composition. His influence on younger composers was especially important, as he served as a transitional figure between the <a href="autodidacticism">autodidactism</a> which exemplified Glinka and The Five and professionally trained composers which would become the norm in Russia by the closing years of the 19th century. While Rimsky-Korsakov's style was based on those of Glinka, Balakirev, <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> and, for a brief period, Richard Wagner, he "transmitted this style directly to two generations of Russian composers" and influenced non-Russian composers including <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>, <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>, <a href="Paul%20Dukas">Paul Dukas</a> and <a href="Ottorino%20Respighi">Ottorino Respighi</a>.

Rimsky-Korsakov was born in <a href="Tikhvin">Tikhvin</a>, east of <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, into a <a href="Russian%20nobility">Russian noble</a> family. The Rimsky-Korsakov dynasty traced their roots to Zhigimunt Korsak, a <a href="Czechs">Czech</a> who arrived in <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> from the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and founded the Polish-Lithuanian <a href="Korsak%20coat%20of%20arms">Korsak coat of arms</a>. In 1390 his sons Vyacheslav (originally Vaclav) and Miloslav escorted <a href="Sophia%20of%20Lithuania">Sophia of Lithuania</a>, then a wife of <a href="Vasily%20I%20of%20Moscow">Vasily I Dmitriyevich</a>, to Moscow and took Russian citizenship under the Korsakov and Miloslavsky surnames, respectively. Some of Vyacheslav's descendants were granted permission to add "Rimsky" to their surnames in 1677 to celebrate their so-called <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> roots.

Throughout history, members of the family served in Russian government and took various positions as governors and war generals. <a href="Ivan%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov</a> was famously a lover of <a href="Catherine%20the%20Great">Catherine the Great</a>.

The father of the composer, Andrei Petrovich Rimsky-Korsakov (1784–1862), was one of the six illegitimate sons of Avdotya Yakovlevna, daughter of a simple <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox priest</a> from <a href="Pskov">Pskov</a>, and <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a> Peter Voinovich Rimsky-Korsakov who had to officially adopt his own children as he couldn't marry their mother because of her lower social status. Using his friendship with <a href="Aleksey%20Arakcheyev">Aleksey Arakcheyev</a>, he managed to grant them all the privileges of the noble family. Andrei went on to serve in the Interior Ministry of the Russian Empire, then as the vice-governor of <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>, and then in the <a href="Volhynian%20Governorate">Volhynian Governorate</a>. The composer's mother, Sofya Vasilievna Rimskaya-Korsakova (1802–1890), was also born as an illegitimate daughter of a <a href="serfdom%20in%20Russia">peasant serf</a> and Vasily Fedorovich Skaryatin, a wealthy landlord who belonged to the noble Russian family that originated during the 16th century.

She was raised by her father in full comfort, yet under an improvised surname Vasilieva and with no legal status. By the time Andrei Petrovich met her, he was already a widower: his first wife, <a href="knyaz">knyaz</a>na Ekaterina <a href="Meshchersky">Meshcherskaya</a>, died just nine months after their marriage. Nevertheless, they fell in love with each other at first sight. Since Skaryatin found him unsuitable for his daughter, Andrei secretly "stole" his bride from the father's house and brought her to Saint Petersburg where they got married.

The Rimsky-Korsakov family had a long line of military and naval service. Nikolai's older brother <a href="Voin%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Voin</a>, 22 years his senior, became a well-known navigator and explorer and had a powerful influence on Nikolai's life. He later recalled that his mother played the piano a little, and his father could play a few songs on the piano by ear. Beginning at six, he took piano lessons from local teachers and showed a talent for aural skills, but he showed a lack of interest, playing, as he later wrote, "badly, carelessly, ... poor at keeping time".

Although he started composing by age 10, Rimsky-Korsakov preferred literature over music. He later wrote that from his reading, and tales of his brother's exploits, he developed a poetic love for the sea "without ever having seen it". This love, and prompting from Voin, encouraged the 12-year-old to join the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>. He studied at the School for Mathematical and Navigational Sciences in Saint Petersburg and, at 18, took his final examination in April 1862.
While at school, Rimsky-Korsakov took piano lessons from a man named Ulikh. These lessons were sanctioned by Voin, who now served as director of the school, because he hoped they would help the youth to develop social skills and overcome his shyness. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that, while "indifferent" to lessons, he developed a love for music, fostered by visits to the opera and, later, orchestral concerts.

Ulikh perceived Rimsky-Korsakov's musical talent and recommended another teacher, Feodor A. Kanille (Théodore Canillé). Beginning in late 1859, Rimsky-Korsakov took lessons in piano and composition from Kanille, whom he later credited as the inspiration for devoting his life to musical composition. Through Kanille, he was exposed to a great deal of new music, including <a href="Mikhail%20Glinka">Mikhail Glinka</a> and <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>. Voin cancelled his younger brother's musical lessons when the latter reached the age of 17, feeling they no longer served a practical purpose.

Kanille told Rimsky-Korsakov to continue coming to him every Sunday, not for formal lessons but to play duets and discuss music. In November 1861, Kanille introduced the 18-year-old Nikolai to <a href="Mily%20Balakirev">Mily Balakirev</a>. Balakirev in turn introduced him to <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Cui">César Cui</a> and <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Modest Mussorgsky</a>; all three were known as composers, despite only being in their 20s. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, "With what delight I listened to "real business" discussions [Rimsky-Korsakov's emphasis] of instrumentation, <a href="part%20%28music%29">part</a> writing, etc! And besides, how much talking there was about current musical matters! All at once I had been plunged into a new world, unknown to me, formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends. That was truly a strong impression."

Balakirev encouraged Rimsky-Korsakov to compose and taught him the rudiments when he was not at sea. Balakirev prompted him to enrich himself in history, literature and criticism. When he showed Balakirev the beginning of a <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">symphony in E-flat minor</a> that he had written, Balakirev insisted he continue working on it despite his lack of formal musical training.

By the time Rimsky-Korsakov sailed on a two-year-and-eight-month cruise aboard the <a href="clipper">clipper</a> "Almaz" in late 1862, he had completed and orchestrated three <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a> of the symphony. He composed the slow movement during a stop in England and mailed the score to Balakirev before going back to sea.

At first, his work on the symphony kept Rimsky-Korsakov occupied during his cruise. He purchased scores at every port of call, along with a piano on which to play them, and filled his idle hours studying <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>'s <a href="Treatise%20on%20Instrumentation">Treatise on Instrumentation</a>. He found time to read the works of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a> and <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>; he saw London, <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, and <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> during his stops in port. Eventually, the lack of outside musical stimuli dulled the young midshipman's hunger to learn. He wrote to Balakirev that after two years at sea he had neglected his musical lessons for months.

"Thoughts of becoming a musician and composer gradually left me altogether", he later recalled; "distant lands began to allure me, somehow, although, properly speaking, naval service never pleased me much and hardly suited my character at all."

Once back in Saint Petersburg in May 1865, Rimsky-Korsakov's onshore duties consisted of a couple of hours of clerical duty each day, but he recalled that his desire to compose "had been stifled ... I did not concern myself with music at all." He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him "to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it". At Balakirev's suggestion, he wrote a trio to the <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a> of the E-flat minor symphony, which it had lacked up to that point, and reorchestrated the entire symphony. Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev's direction in Saint Petersburg. A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov (father of composer <a href="Anatoly%20Lyadov">Anatoly Lyadov</a>).

Correspondence between Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev clearly shows that some ideas for the symphony originated with Balakirev. Balakirev seldom stopped at merely correcting a piece of music, and would often recompose it at the piano. Rimsky-Korsakov recalled,

A pupil like myself had to submit to Balakirev a proposed composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try hard to make the author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over a long period of time under the cold control of self-criticism.
Rimsky-Korsakov recalled that "Balakirev had no difficulty in getting along with me. At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed by me and brought them to completion with the help of his advice and improvisations". Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev's influence stifling, and broke free from it, this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer's talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev's mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth Symphony</a> and abandoned it. He completed an <a href="Overture%20on%20Three%20Russian%20Themes">Overture on Three Russian Themes</a>, based on Balakirev's folksong overtures, as well as a <a href="Fantasy%20on%20Serbian%20Themes">Fantasia on Serbian Themes</a> that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the <a href="Pan-Slavism">Slavonic Congress</a> in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic <a href="Vladimir%20Stasov">Vladimir Stasov</a> coined the phrase "Moguchaya kuchka" for the Balakirev circle ("Moguchaya kuchka" is usually translated as "The Mighty Handful" or "The Five"). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of "Sadko" and "<a href="Antar%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Antar</a>", which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.

Rimsky-Korsakov socialized and discussed music with the other members of The Five; they critiqued one another's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with <a href="Alexander%20Borodin">Alexander Borodin</a>, whose music "astonished" him. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers' works, with preferred tastes running "toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven's late quartets". <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a> was not thought of highly, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a> "were considered out of date and naïve", and <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">J.S. Bach</a> merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz "was highly esteemed", Liszt "crippled and perverted from a musical point of view ... even a caricature", and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov "listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination". Often, the musical works in question "were played before me only in fragments, and I had no idea of the whole work". This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them "as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth".

Rimsky-Korsakov became especially appreciated within The Five, and among those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera "<a href="William%20Ratcliff%20%28Cui%29">William Ratcliff</a>" and by <a href="Alexander%20Dargomyzhsky">Alexander Dargomyzhsky</a>, whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera "<a href="The%20Stone%20Guest%20%28Dargomyzhsky%29">The Stone Guest</a>".

In late 1871, Rimsky-Korsakov moved into Voin's former apartment, and invited Mussorgsky to be his roommate. The working arrangement they agreed upon was that Mussorgsky used the piano in the mornings while Rimsky-Korsakov worked on copying or orchestration. When Mussorgsky left for his civil service job at noon, Rimsky-Korsakov then used the piano. Time in the evenings was allotted by mutual agreement. "That autumn and winter the two of us accomplished a good deal", Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, "with constant exchange of ideas and plans. Mussorgsky composed and orchestrated the Polish act of "<a href="Boris%20Godunov%20%28opera%29">Boris Godunov</a>" and the folk scene 'Near Kromy.' I orchestrated and finished my "<a href="The%20Maid%20of%20Pskov">Maid of Pskov</a>"."

In 1871, the 27-year-old Rimsky-Korsakov became Professor of Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration) at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, as well as leader of the Orchestra Class. He retained his position in active naval service, and taught his classes in uniform (military officers in Russia were required to wear their uniforms every day, as they were considered to be always on duty).
Rimsky-Korsakov explained in his memoirs that <a href="Mikha%C3%ADl%20Azanchevsky">Mikhaíl Azanchevsky</a> had taken over that year as director of the Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.

Rimsky-Korsakov's reputation at this time was as a master of orchestration, based on "Sadko" and "Antar". He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, could not harmonize a simple <a href="chorale">chorale</a>, nor knew the names or <a href="interval%20%28music%29">intervals</a> of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a>, with whom he and the others in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of <a href="music%20theory">Music Theory</a> at the <a href="Moscow%20Conservatory">Moscow Conservatory</a>. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.

Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that while teaching at the Conservatory he soon became "possibly its very best "pupil" [Rimsky-Korsakov's emphasis], judging by the quantity and value of the information it gave me!" To prepare himself, and to stay at least one step ahead of his students, he took a three-year sabbatical from composing original works, and assiduously studied at home while he lectured at the Conservatory. He taught himself from textbooks, and followed a strict regimen of composing contrapuntal exercises, <a href="fugue">fugue</a>s, chorales and "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" choruses.
Rimsky-Korsakov eventually became an excellent teacher and a fervent believer in academic training. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as "Sadko" and "Antar", in a search for perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he mastered the art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Third Symphony</a>, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra.

Professorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov financial security, which encouraged him to settle down and to start a family. In December 1871 he proposed to <a href="Nadezhda%20Rimskaya-Korsakova">Nadezhda Purgold</a>, with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household. They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children. One of their sons, <a href="Andrey%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Andrei</a>, became a musicologist, married the composer Yuliya Veysberg and wrote a multi-volume study of his father's life and work.

Nadezhda became a musical as well as domestic partner with her husband, much as <a href="Clara%20Schumann">Clara Schumann</a> had been with her own husband <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert</a>. She was beautiful, capable, strong-willed, and far better trained musically than her husband at the time they married—she had attended the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in the mid-1860s, studying piano with <a href="Anton%20Gerke">Anton Gerke</a> (one of whose private students was Mussorgsky) and music theory with <a href="Nikolai%20Zaremba">Nikolai Zaremba</a>, who also taught Tchaikovsky. Nadezhda proved a fine and most demanding critic of her husband's work; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences. Musicologist Lyle Neff wrote that while Nadezhda gave up her own compositional career when she married Rimsky-Korsakov, she "had a considerable influence on the creation of [Rimsky-Korsakov's] first three operas. She travelled with her husband, attended rehearsals and arranged compositions by him and others" for piano four hands, which she played with her husband. "Her last years were dedicated to issuing her husband's posthumous literary and musical legacy, maintaining standards for performance of his works ... and preparing material for a museum in his name."
In early 1873, the navy created the civilian post of Inspector of Naval Bands, with a rank of Collegiate Assessor, and appointed Rimsky-Korsakov. This kept him on the navy payroll and listed on the roster of the Chancellery of the Navy Department but allowed him to resign his commission. The composer commented, "I parted with delight with both my military status and my officer's uniform", he later wrote. "Henceforth I was a musician officially and incontestably." As Inspector, Rimsky-Korsakov applied himself with zeal to his duties. He visited naval bands throughout Russia, supervised the bandmasters and their appointments, reviewed the bands' repertoire, and inspected the quality of their instruments. He wrote a study program for a complement of music students who held navy fellowships at the Conservatory, and acted as an intermediary between the Conservatory and the navy. He also indulged in a long-standing desire to familiarize himself with the construction and playing technique of orchestral instruments. These studies prompted him to write a textbook on orchestration. He used the privileges of rank to exercise and expand upon his knowledge. He discussed arrangements of musical works for military band with bandmasters, encouraged and reviewed their efforts, held concerts at which he could hear these pieces, and orchestrated original works, and works by other composers, for military bands.

In March 1884, an Imperial Order abolished the navy office of Inspector of Bands, and Rimsky-Korsakov was relieved of his duties. He worked under Balakirev in the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Court%20Capella">Court Chapel</a> as a deputy until 1894, which allowed him to study Russian Orthodox church music. He also taught classes at the Chapel, and wrote his textbook on <a href="harmony%20%28music%29">harmony</a> for use there and at the Conservatory.

Rimsky-Korsakov's studies and his change in attitude regarding music education brought him the scorn of his fellow nationalists, who thought he was throwing away his Russian heritage to compose <a href="fugue">fugue</a>s and <a href="sonata">sonata</a>s. After he strove "to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible" into his Third Symphony, he wrote <a href="chamber%20music">chamber</a> works adhering strictly to classical models, including a <a href="String%20Sextet%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">string sextet</a>, a <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%201%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">string quartet in F minor</a> and a <a href="Piano%20Quintet%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano</a>. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, <a href="Nadezhda%20von%20Meck">Nadezhda von Meck</a>, that they "were filled with a host of clever things but ... [were] imbued with a dryly pedantic character". Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept "feeling that this is the work of a German "Herr Professor" who has put on his glasses and is about to write "Eine grosse Symphonie in C"".

According to Rimsky-Korsakov, the other members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the orchestra in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that "they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a>, a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov "might amount to something" as a composer. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, "Apparently [Rimsky-Korsakov] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master will come out of him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks".
Two projects helped Rimsky-Korsakov focus on less academic music-making. The first was the creation of two folk song collections in 1874. Rimsky-Korsakov transcribed 40 Russian songs for voice and piano from performances by folk singer Tvorty Filippov, who approached him at Balakirev's suggestion. This collection was followed by a second containing 100 songs, supplied by friends and servants, or taken from rare and out-of-print collections. Rimsky-Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer; it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects, either by direct quotation or as models for composing <a href="fakelore">fakeloric</a> passages. The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857) in collaboration with Balakirev and <a href="Anatoly%20Lyadov">Anatoly Lyadov</a>. Glinka's sister, Lyudmila Ivanovna Shestakova, wanted to preserve her brother's musical legacy in print, and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket. No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music, and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed. While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka's music to "correct" what he saw as compositional flaws, Rimsky-Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach. Eventually, Rimsky-Korsakov prevailed. "Work on Glinka's scores was an unexpected schooling for me", he later wrote. "Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka's style and instrumentation to their last little note ... And this was a beneficent discipline for me, leading me as it did to the path of modern music, after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style".

In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought increasingly about the short story "<a href="May%20Night%20or%20the%20Drowned%20Maiden">May Night</a>" by <a href="Nikolai%20Gogol">Nikolai Gogol</a>. The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.

Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that "<a href="May%20Night">May Night</a>" was of great importance because, despite the opera's containing a good deal of contrapuntal music, he nevertheless ""cast off the shackles of counterpoint" [emphasis Rimsky-Korsakov]". He wrote the opera in a folk-like melodic idiom, and scored it in a transparent manner much in the style of Glinka. Nevertheless, despite the ease of writing this opera and the next, "<a href="The%20Snow%20Maiden">The Snow Maiden</a>", from time to time he suffered from creative paralysis between 1881 and 1888. He kept busy during this time by editing Mussorgsky's works and completing Borodin's "<a href="Prince%20Igor">Prince Igor</a>" (Mussorgsky died in 1881, Borodin in 1887).

Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that he became acquainted with budding music patron <a href="Mitrofan%20Belyayev">Mitrofan Belyayev</a> (M. P. Belaieff) in Moscow in 1882. Belyayev was one of a growing coterie of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included railway magnate <a href="Savva%20Mamontov">Savva Mamontov</a> and textile manufacturer <a href="Pavel%20Tretyakov">Pavel Tretyakov</a>. Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov "wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life". They had worked their way into wealth, and being Slavophiles in their national outlook believed in the greater glory of Russia. Because of this belief, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones. This preference paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and Russophilia that became prevalent in mainstream Russian art and society.

By 1883 Rimsky-Korsakov had become a regular visitor to the weekly "quartet Fridays" ("Les Vendredis") held at Belyayev's home in Saint Petersburg. Belyayev, who had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage <a href="Alexander%20Glazunov">Alexander Glazunov</a>, rented a hall and hired an orchestra in 1884 to play Glazunov's First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed. This concert and a rehearsal the previous year gave Rimsky-Korsakov the idea of offering concerts featuring Russian compositions, a prospect to which Belyayev was amenable. The <a href="Russian%20Symphony%20Concerts">Russian Symphony Concerts</a> were inaugurated during the 1886–87 season, with Rimsky-Korsakov sharing conducting duties with Anatoly Lyadov. He finished his revision of Mussorgsky's "<a href="Night%20on%20Bald%20Mountain">Night on Bald Mountain</a>" and conducted it at the opening concert. The concerts also coaxed him out of his creative drought; he wrote "<a href="Scheherazade%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Scheherazade</a>", "<a href="Capriccio%20Espagnol">Capriccio Espagnol</a>" and the "<a href="Russian%20Easter%20Overture">Russian Easter Overture</a>" specifically for them. He noted that these three works "show a considerable falling off in the use of contrapuntal devices ... [replaced] by a strong and virtuoso development of every kind of figuration which sustains the technical interest of my compositions".

Rimsky-Korsakov was asked for advice and guidance not just on the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. "By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle", he wrote. "As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief". In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual <a href="Glinka%20prize">Glinka prize</a>, and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.

The group of composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov became known as the <a href="Belyayev%20circle">Belyayev circle</a>, named after their financial benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them had been. Like The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition—which Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Compared to the "revolutionary" composers in Balakirev's circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be "progressive ... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but ... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily ..."

In November 1887, Tchaikovsky arrived in Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts. One of them included the first complete performance of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Tchaikovsky%29">First Symphony</a>, subtitled "Winter Daydreams", in its final version. Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony in its revised version. Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky corresponded considerably before the visit and spent a lot of time together, along with Glazunov and Lyadov. Though Tchaikovsky had been a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home since 1876, and had at one point offered to arrange Rimsky-Korsakov's appointment as director of the Moscow Conservatory, this was the beginning of closer relations between the two. Within a couple of years, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, Tchaikovsky's visits became more frequent.

During these visits and especially in public, Rimsky-Korsakov wore a mask of geniality. Privately, he found the situation emotionally complex, and confessed his fears to his friend, the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov. Memories persisted of the tension between Tchaikovsky and The Five over the differences in their musical philosophies—tension acute enough for Tchaikovsky's brother Modest to liken their relations at that time to "those between two friendly neighboring states ... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground, but jealously guarding their separate interests". Rimsky-Korsakov observed, not without annoyance, how Tchaikovsky became increasingly popular among Rimsky-Korsakov's followers. This personal jealousy was compounded by a professional one, as Tchaikovsky's music became increasingly popular among the composers of the Belyayev circle, and remained on the whole more famous than his own. Even so, when Tchaikovsky attended Rimsky-Korsakov's <a href="Name%20day">nameday</a> party in May 1893, Rimsky-Korsakov asked Tchaikovsky personally if he would conduct four concerts of the <a href="Russian%20Musical%20Society">Russian Musical Society</a> in Saint Petersburg the following season. After hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed. While his sudden death in late 1893 prevented him from fulfilling this commitment in its entirety, the list of works he had planned to conduct included Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony.

In March 1889, Angelo Neumann's traveling "<a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> Theater" visited Saint Petersburg, giving four cycles of "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a>" there under the direction of <a href="Karl%20Muck">Karl Muck</a>. The Five had ignored Wagner's music, but "The Ring" impressed Rimsky-Korsakov: he was astonished with Wagner's mastery of orchestration. He attended the rehearsals with Glazunov, and followed the score. After hearing these performances, Rimsky-Korsakov devoted himself almost exclusively to composing operas for the rest of his creative life. Wagner's use of the orchestra influenced Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration, beginning with the arrangement of the <a href="polonaise">polonaise</a> from Mussorgsky's "<a href="Boris%20Godunov%20%28opera%29">Boris Godunov</a>" that he made for concert use in 1889.

Toward music more adventurous than Wagner's, especially that of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> and later <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards when he heard pianist <a href="Felix%20Blumenfeld">Felix Blumenfeld</a> play Debussy's "<a href="Estampes">Estampes</a>" and write in his diary about them, "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." This was part of an increasing musical conservatism on his part (his "musical conscience," as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's "<a href="Boris%20Godunov%20%28opera%29">Boris Godunov</a>", in 1895 he would tell his <a href="amanuensis">amanuensis</a>, Vasily Yastrebtsev, "It's incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time." By 1901 he would write of growing "indignant at all [of Wagner's] blunders of the ear"—this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.

In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov suffered a second creative drought, brought on by bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of <a href="neurasthenia">neurasthenia</a>. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household may have been a factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Court%20Capella">Court Chapel</a> and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau "Sadko" and the opera "The Maid of Pskov", he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before "May Night" in their original form.

Another death brought about a creative renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on <a href="Nikolai%20Gogol">Nikolai Gogol</a>'s short story "<a href="Christmas%20Eve%20%28Gogol%29">Christmas Eve</a>", a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera "<a href="Vakula%20the%20Smith">Vakula the Smith</a>". The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's "<a href="Christmas%20Eve%20%28opera%29">Christmas Eve</a>" encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it in the last four years of his life. (His son-in-law <a href="Maximilian%20Steinberg">Maximilian Steinberg</a> completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.

In 1905, demonstrations took place in the St. Petersburg Conservatory as part of the <a href="Revolution%20of%201905">1905 Revolution</a>; these, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, were triggered by similar disturbances at <a href="St.%20Petersburg%20State%20University">St. Petersburg State University</a>, in which students demanded political reforms and the establishment of a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> in Russia. "I was chosen a member of the committee for adjusting differences with agitated pupils", he recalled; almost as soon as the committee had been formed, "[a]ll sorts of measures were recommended to expel the ringleaders, to quarter the police in the Conservatory, to close the Conservatory entirely".
A lifelong liberal politically, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that he felt someone had to protect the rights of the students to demonstrate, especially as disputes and wrangling between students and authorities were becoming increasingly violent. In an open letter, he sided with the students against what he saw as unwarranted interference by Conservatory leadership and the Russian Musical Society. A second letter, this time signed by a number of faculty including Rimsky-Korsakov, demanded the resignation of the head of the Conservatory. Partly as a result of these two letters he wrote, approximately 100 Conservatory students were expelled and he was removed from his professorship. Just before the dismissal was enacted, Rimsky-Korsakov received a letter from one of the members of the school directorate, suggesting that he take up the directorship in the interest of calming student unrest. "Probably the member of the Directorate held a minority opinion, but signed the resolution nevertheless," he wrote. "I sent a negative reply." Partly in defiance of his dismissal, Rimsky-Korsakov continued teaching his students from his home.

Not long after Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student production of his opera "<a href="Kashchey%20the%20Deathless">Kashchey the Deathless</a>" was followed not with the scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, which led to a police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events, an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence with letters of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov. Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera "<a href="The%20Golden%20Cockerel">The Golden Cockerel</a>". Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.
In April 1907, Rimsky-Korsakov conducted a pair of concerts in Paris, hosted by impresario <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a>, which featured music of the Russian nationalist school. The concerts were hugely successful in popularizing Russian classical music of this kind in Europe, Rimsky-Korsakov's in particular. The following year, his opera "Sadko" was produced at the <a href="Paris%20Op%C3%A9ra">Paris Opéra</a> and "The Snow Maiden" at the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>. He also had the opportunity to hear more recent music by European composers. He hissed unabashedly when he heard <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s opera "<a href="Salome%20%28opera%29">Salome</a>", and told Diaghilev after hearing <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>'s opera "<a href="Pell%C3%A9as%20et%20M%C3%A9lisande%20%28opera%29">Pelléas et Mélisande</a>", "Don't make me listen to all these horrors or I shall end up liking them!" Hearing these works led him to appreciate his place in the world of classical music. He admitted that he was a "convinced kuchkist" (after "kuchka", the shortened Russian term for The Five) and that his works belonged to an era that musical trends had left behind.

Beginning around 1890, Rimsky-Korsakov suffered from <a href="Angina%20pectoris">angina</a>. While this ailment initially wore him down gradually, the stresses concurrent with the 1905 Revolution and its aftermath greatly accelerated its progress. After December 1907, his illness became severe, and he could not work. In 1908, he died at his Lubensk estate near <a href="Luga%2C%20Leningrad%20Oblast">Luga</a> (modern day <a href="Plyussky%20District">Plyussky District</a> of <a href="Pskov%20Oblast">Pskov Oblast</a>), and was interred in <a href="Tikhvin%20Cemetery">Tikhvin Cemetery</a> at the <a href="Alexander%20Nevsky%20Monastery">Alexander Nevsky Monastery</a> in Saint Petersburg, next to Borodin, Glinka, Mussorgsky and Stasov.

Rimsky-Korsakov followed the musical ideals espoused by The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical themes in the "<a href="Russian%20Easter%20Festival%20Overture">Russian Easter Festival Overture</a>", folk song in "<a href="Capriccio%20Espagnol">Capriccio Espagnol</a>" and orientalism in "<a href="Scheherazade%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Scheherazade</a>", possibly his best known work. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work up to and including his Third Symphony—some, like "<a href="Antar%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Antar</a>" and "<a href="Sadko%20%28musical%20tableau%29">Sadko</a>", more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale <a href="transposition%20%28music%29">transposition</a> and complete recomposition.

Rimsky-Korsakov was open about the influences in his music, telling Vasily Yastrebtsev, "Study Liszt and Balakirev more closely, and you'll see that a great deal in me is not mine". He followed Balakirev in his use of the whole tone scale, treatment of folk songs and musical <a href="orientalism">orientalism</a> and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness. (The violin melody used to portray <a href="Scheherazade">Scheherazade</a> is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev's symphonic poem "<a href="Tamara%20%28Balakirev%29">Tamara</a>", while the "Russian Easter Overtures" follows the design and plan of Balakirev's <a href="Second%20Overture%20on%20Russian%20Themes">Second Overture on Russian Themes</a>.) Nevertheless, while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models, his use of <a href="whole%20tone%20scale">whole tone</a> and <a href="octatonic%20scale">octatonic scale</a>s do demonstrate his originality. He developed both these compositional devices for the "fantastic" sections of his operas, which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events.

Rimsky-Korsakov maintained an interest in harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, the more he attempted to control them with strict rules—applying his "musical conscience", as he called it. In this sense, he was both a progressive and a conservative composer. The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition, and Rimsky-Korsakov's use of them made his harmonies seem radical. Conversely, his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made him seem conservative compared with later composers like <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>, though they were often building on Rimsky-Korsakov's work.

While Rimsky-Korsakov is best known in the West for his orchestral works, his operas are more complex, offering a wider variety of orchestral effects than in his instrumental works and fine vocal writing. Excerpts and suites from them have proved as popular in the West as the purely orchestral works. The best-known of these excerpts is probably "<a href="Flight%20of%20the%20Bumblebee">Flight of the Bumblebee</a>" from "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Tsar%20Saltan%20%28opera%29">The Tale of Tsar Saltan</a>," which has often been heard by itself in orchestral programs, and in countless arrangements and transcriptions, most famously in a piano version made by Russian composer <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>. Other selections familiar to listeners in the West are "Dance of the Tumblers" from "The Snow Maiden", "Procession of the Nobles" from "<a href="Mlada%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Mlada</a>", and "Song of the Indian Guest" (or, less accurately, "Song of India") from "<a href="Sadko%20%28opera%29">Sadko</a>", as well as suites from "<a href="The%20Golden%20Cockerel">The Golden Cockerel</a>" and "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20the%20Invisible%20City%20of%20Kitezh%20and%20the%20Maiden%20Fevroniya">The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya</a>".

The Operas fall into three categories:


Of this range Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in 1902, "In every new work of mine I am trying to do something that is new for me. On the one hand, I am pushed on by the thought that in this way, [my music] will retain freshness and interest, but at the same time I am prompted by my pride to think that many facets, devices, moods and styles, if not all, should be within my reach."

American music critic and journalist <a href="Harold%20C.%20Schonberg">Harold C. Schonberg</a> wrote that the operas "open up a delightful new world, the world of the Russian East, the world of supernaturalism and the exotic, the world of Slavic pantheism and vanished races. Genuine poetry suffuses them, and they are scored with brilliance and resource." According to some critics Rimsky-Korsakov's music in these works lacks dramatic power, a seemingly fatal flaw in an operatic composer. This may have been conscious, as he repeatedly stated in his writing that he felt operas were first and foremost musical works rather than mainly dramatic ones. Ironically, the operas succeed dramatically in most cases by being deliberately non-theatrical.

The purely orchestral works fall into two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly programmatic in nature—in other words, the musical content and how it is handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works are more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.
Program music came naturally to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, "even a folk theme has a program of sorts." He composed the majority of his orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career—at the beginning, with "Sadko" and "Antar" (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with "Scheherezade", "Capriccio Espagnol" and the "Russian Easter Overture". Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer's overall approach and the way he used his musical themes remained consistent. Both "Antar" and "Scheherezade" use a robust "Russian" theme to portray the male protagonists (the title character in "Antar"; the sultan in "Scheherezade") and a more sinuous "Eastern" theme for the female ones (the <a href="peri">peri</a> Gul-Nazar in "Antar" and the title character in "Scheherezade").

Where Rimsky-Korsakov changed between these two sets of works was in orchestration. While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of instrumental forces, the sparser textures of "<a href="Sadko%20%28musical%20tableau%29">Sadko</a>" and "<a href="Antar%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Antar</a>" pale compared to the luxuriance of the more popular works of the 1880s. While a principle of highlighting "primary hues" of instrumental color remained in place, it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects, some gleaned from other composers including Wagner, but many invented by himself. As a result, these works resemble brightly colored mosaics, striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups. The final "tutti" of "<a href="Scheherazade%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Scheherazade</a>" is a prime example of this scoring. The theme is assigned to <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s playing in unison, and is accompanied by a combination of <a href="string%20instrument">string</a> patterns. Meanwhile, another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the <a href="woodwind%20instruments">woodwinds</a> and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion.

Rimsky-Korsakov's non-program music, though well-crafted, does not rise to the same level of inspiration as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to bring out the best in him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann's Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.

Rimsky-Korsakov composed dozens of <a href="art%20song">art song</a>s, arrangements of folk songs, <a href="chamber%20music">chamber</a> and piano music. While the piano music is relatively unimportant, many of the art songs possess a delicate beauty. While they yield in overt lyricism to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, otherwise they reserve their place in the standard repertory of Russian singers.

Rimsky-Korsakov also wrote a body of choral works, both secular and for <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> service. The latter include settings of portions of the "Liturgy of St. <a href="John%20Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>" (despite his own <a href="atheist">atheism</a>).

Critic <a href="Vladimir%20Stasov">Vladimir Stasov</a>, who along with Balakirev had founded The Five, wrote in 1882, "Beginning with Glinka, all the best Russian musicians have been very skeptical of book learning and have never approached it with the servility and the superstitious reverence with which it is approached to this day in many parts of Europe." This statement was not true for Glinka, who studied Western music theory assiduously with <a href="Siegfried%20Dehn">Siegfried Dehn</a> in Berlin before he composed his opera "<a href="A%20Life%20for%20the%20Tsar">A Life for the Tsar</a>". It was true for Balakirev, who "opposed academicism with tremendous vigor," and it was true initially for Rimsky-Korsakov, who had been imbued by Balakirev and Stasov with the same attitude.
One point Stasov omitted purposely, which would have disproved his statement completely, was that at the time he wrote it, Rimsky-Korsakov had been pouring his "book learning" into students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory for over a decade. Beginning with his three years of self-imposed study, Rimsky-Korsakov had drawn closer to Tchaikovsky and further away from the rest of The Five, while the rest of The Five had drawn back from him and Stasov had branded him a "renegade". Taruskin writes, "The older he became, the greater was the irony with which Rimsky-Korsakov looked back on his kuchkist days." When the young Semyon Kruglikov was considering a future in composition, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the future critic,

About a talent for composition ... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little ... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study ... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and especially Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.

Taruskin points out this statement, which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote while Borodin and Mussorgsky were still alive, as proof of his estrangement from the rest of The Five and an indication of the kind of teacher he eventually became. By the time he instructed Liadov and Glazunov, "their training hardly differed from [Tchaikovsky's]. An ideal of the strictest professionalism was instilled in them from the beginning." By the time Borodin died in 1887, the era of autodidactism for Russian composers had effectively ended. Every Russian who aspired to write classical music attended a conservatory and received the same formal education. "There was no more 'Moscow', no 'St. Petersburg'." Taruskin writes; "at last all Russia was one. Moreover, by century's end, the theory and composition faculties of Rubinstein's Conservatory were entirely in the hands of representatives of the New Russian School. Viewed against the background of Stasov's predictions, there could scarcely be any greater irony."

Rimsky-Korsakov taught theory and composition to 250 students over his 35-year tenure at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, "enough to people a whole 'school' of composers". This does not include pupils at the two other schools where he taught, including Glazunov, or those he taught privately at his home, such as <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>. Apart from Glazunov and Stravinsky, students who later found fame included <a href="Anatoly%20Lyadov">Anatoly Lyadov</a>, <a href="Mikhail%20Ippolitov-Ivanov">Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Spendiaryan">Alexander Spendiaryan</a>, <a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Sergei Prokofiev</a>, <a href="Ottorino%20Respighi">Ottorino Respighi</a>, <a href="Witold%20Maliszewski">Witold Maliszewski</a>, <a href="Mykola%20Lysenko">Mykola Lysenko</a>, <a href="Artur%20Kapp">Artur Kapp</a>, and <a href="Konstanty%20Gorski">Konstanty Gorski</a>. Other students included the music critic and <a href="musicologist">musicologist</a> <a href="Alexander%20Ossovsky">Alexander Ossovsky</a>, and the composer <a href="Lazare%20Saminsky">Lazare Saminsky</a>.

Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented students needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them in understanding the forms of composition; give them a year or two of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor <a href="Nikolai%20Malko">Nikolai Malko</a> remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well."

Rimsky-Korsakov's editing of works by The Five is significant. It was a practical extension of the collaborative atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s, when they heard each other's compositions in progress and worked on them together, and was an effort to save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely. This work included the completion of <a href="Alexander%20Borodin">Alexander Borodin</a>'s opera "<a href="Prince%20Igor">Prince Igor</a>", which Rimsky-Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin's death, and the orchestration of passages from <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Cui">César Cui</a>'s "<a href="William%20Ratcliff%20%28Cui%29">William Ratcliff</a>" for its first production in 1869. He also completely orchestrated the opera "<a href="The%20Stone%20Guest%20%28Dargomyzhsky%29">The Stone Guest</a> by "<a href="Alexander%20Dargomyzhsky">Alexander Dargomyzhsky</a> three times—in 1869–70, 1892 and 1902. While not a member of The Five himself, Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared their musical philosophy.

Musicologist Francis Maes wrote that while Rimsky-Korsakov's efforts are laudable, they are also controversial. It was generally assumed that with "Prince Igor", Rimsky-Korsakov edited and orchestrated the existing fragments of the opera while Glazunov composed and added missing parts, including most of the third act and the overture. This was exactly what Rimsky-Korsakov stated in his memoirs. Both Maes and <a href="Richard%20Taruskin">Richard Taruskin</a> cite an analysis of Borodin's manuscripts by musicologist Pavel Lamm, which showed that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov discarded nearly 20 percent of Borodin's score. According to Maes, the result is more a collaborative effort by all three composers than a true representation of Borodin's intent. Lamm stated that because of the extremely chaotic state of Borodin's manuscripts, a modern alternative to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov's edition would be extremely difficult to complete.

More debatable, according to Maes, is Rimsky-Korsakov's editing of Mussorgsky's works. After Mussorgsky's death in 1881, Rimsky-Korsakov revised and completed several of Mussorgsky's works for publication and performance, helping to spread Mussorgsky's works throughout Russia and to the West. Maes, in reviewing Mussorgsky's scores, wrote that Rimsky-Korsakov allowed his "musical conscience" to dictate his editing, and he changed or removed what he considered musical over-experimentation or poor form. Because of this, Rimsky-Korsakov has been accused of pedantry in "correcting", among other things, matters of harmony. Rimsky-Korsakov may have foreseen questions over his efforts when he wrote,

If Mussorgsky's compositions are destined to live unfaded for fifty years after their author's death (when all his works will become the property of any and every publisher), such an archeologically accurate edition will always be possible, as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving me. For the present, though, there was need of an edition for performances, for practical artistic purposes, for making his colossal talent known, and not for the mere studying of his personality and artistic sins.

Maes stated that time proved Rimsky-Korsakov correct when it came to posterity's re-evaluation of Mussorgsky's work. Mussorgsky's musical style, once considered unpolished, is now admired for its originality. While Rimsky-Korsakov's arrangement of "<a href="Night%20on%20Bald%20Mountain">Night on Bald Mountain</a>" is still the version generally performed, Rimsky-Korsakov's other revisions, like his version of "<a href="Boris%20Godunov%20%28opera%29">Boris Godunov</a>", have been replaced by Mussorgsky's original.

Rimsky-Korsakov may have saved the most personal side of his creativity for his approach to Russian folklore. Folklorism as practiced by Balakirev and the other members of The Five had been based largely on the "protyazhnaya" dance song. "Protyazhnaya" literally meant "drawn-out song", or <a href="melisma">melisma</a>tically elaborated lyric song. The characteristics of this song exhibit extreme rhythmic flexibility, an <a href="Symmetry%23In%20music">asymmetrical</a> phrase structure and tonal ambiguity. After composing "May Night", Rimsky-Korsakov was increasingly drawn to "<a href="calendar%20song">calendar song</a>s", which were written for specific ritual occasions. The ties to folk culture was what interested him most in folk music, even in his days with The Five; these songs formed a part of rural customs, echoed old Slavic paganism and the <a href="pantheism">pantheistic</a> world of folk rites. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that his interest in these songs was heightened by his study of them while compiling his folk song collections. He wrote that he "was captivated by the poetic side of the cult of sun-worship, and sought its survivals and echoes in both the tunes and the words of the songs. The pictures of the ancient pagan period and spirit loomed before me, as it then seemed, with great clarity, luring me on with the charm of antiquity. These occupations subsequently had a great influence in the direction of my own activity as a composer".

Rimsky-Korsakov's interest in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of <a href="Alexander%20Afanasyev">Alexander Afanasyev</a>. That author's standard work, "The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs", became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev's ideas in "May Night", in which he helped fill out Gogol's story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He went further down this path in "The Snow Maiden", where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and "khorovodi" (ceremonial dances) in the folk tradition.

Musicologists and Slavicists have long recognized that Rimsky-Korsakov was an ecumenical artist whose folklore-inspired operas take up such issues as the relationship between paganism and Christianity and the seventeenth-century schism in the Orthodox Church.

Rimsky-Korsakov's autobiography and his books on harmony and orchestration have been translated into English and published. Two books he started in 1892 but left unfinished were a comprehensive text on Russian music and a manuscript, now lost, on an unknown subject.

Felix Mendelssohn

Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy (3 February 18094 November 1847), born and widely known as Felix Mendelssohn, was a German composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early <a href="Romantic%20music">Romantic</a> period. Mendelssohn's compositions include <a href="symphony">symphonies</a>, <a href="concerto">concerto</a>s, <a href="piano">piano</a> music and <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a>. His best-known works include his <a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Overture and incidental music</a> for "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%20%28Mendelssohn%29">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>", the "<a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Italian Symphony</a>", the "<a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Scottish Symphony</a>", the <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> "<a href="Elijah%20%28oratorio%29">Elijah</a>", the <a href="overture">overture</a> "<a href="The%20Hebrides%20%28overture%29">The Hebrides</a>", his mature <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Violin Concerto</a>, and his <a href="Octet%20%28Mendelssohn%29">String Octet</a>. The melody for the Christmas carol "<a href="Hark%21%20The%20Herald%20Angels%20Sing">Hark! The Herald Angels Sing</a>" is also his. Mendelssohn's "<a href="Songs%20Without%20Words">Songs Without Words</a>" are his most famous solo piano compositions. 

A grandson of the philosopher <a href="Moses%20Mendelssohn">Moses Mendelssohn</a>, Felix Mendelssohn was born into a prominent <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish <a href="Mendelssohn%20family">family</a>. He was brought up without religion until the age of seven, when he was baptised as a <a href="Calvinism">Reformed Christian</a>. Felix was recognised early as a <a href="child%20prodigy">musical prodigy</a>, but his parents were cautious and did not seek to capitalise on his talent.

Mendelssohn enjoyed early success in Germany, and revived interest in the music of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>, notably with his performance of the "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>" in 1829. He became well received in his travels throughout Europe as a composer, conductor and soloist; his ten visits to Britain – during which many of his major works were premiered – form an important part of his adult career. His essentially conservative musical tastes set him apart from more adventurous musical contemporaries such as <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, <a href="Charles-Valentin%20Alkan">Charles-Valentin Alkan</a> and <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>. The <a href="University%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre%20Leipzig">Leipzig Conservatory</a>, which he founded, became a bastion of this anti-radical outlook. After a long period of relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality has been re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.

Felix Mendelssohn was born on 3 February 1809, in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, at the time an independent city-state, in the same house where, a year later, the dedicatee and first performer of his Violin Concerto, <a href="Ferdinand%20David%20%28musician%29">Ferdinand David</a>, would be born. Mendelssohn's father, the banker <a href="Abraham%20Mendelssohn%20Bartholdy">Abraham Mendelssohn</a>, was the son of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Germany%23In%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Empire">German Jewish</a> philosopher <a href="Moses%20Mendelssohn">Moses Mendelssohn</a>, whose family was prominent in the German Jewish community. Until his baptism at age seven, Mendelssohn was brought up largely without religion. His mother, Lea Salomon, was a member of the <a href="Itzig%20family">Itzig family</a> and a sister of <a href="Jakob%20Salomon%20Bartholdy">Jakob Salomon Bartholdy</a>. Mendelssohn was the second of four children; his older sister <a href="Fanny%20Mendelssohn">Fanny</a> also displayed exceptional and precocious musical talent.

The family moved to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 1811, leaving Hamburg in disguise in fear of French reprisal for the <a href="Mendelssohn%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Mendelssohn bank</a>'s role in breaking <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="Continental%20System">Continental System</a> blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children – Fanny, Felix, Paul and <a href="Rebecka%20Mendelssohn">Rebecka</a> – the best education possible. Fanny became a pianist well known in Berlin musical circles as a composer; originally Abraham had thought that she, rather than Felix, would be the more musical. But it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, for a woman to pursue a career in music, so she remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was initially disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he was seriously dedicated.

Mendelssohn grew up in an intellectual environment. Frequent visitors to the <a href="Salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a> organised by his parents at their home in Berlin included artists, musicians and scientists, among them <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Humboldt">Wilhelm</a> and <a href="Alexander%20von%20Humboldt">Alexander von Humboldt</a>, and the mathematician <a href="Peter%20Gustav%20Lejeune%20Dirichlet">Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet</a> (whom Mendelssohn's sister Rebecka would later marry). The musician Sarah Rothenburg has written of the household that "Europe came to their living room".

Abraham Mendelssohn renounced the Jewish religion prior to Felix's birth; he and his wife decided not to have Felix <a href="circumcision">circumcised</a>, in contravention of the Jewish tradition. Felix and his siblings were first brought up without religious education, and were <a href="Baptism">baptised</a> by a <a href="Reformed%20Church">Reformed Church</a> minister in 1816, at which time Felix was given the additional names Jakob Ludwig. Abraham and his wife Lea were baptised in 1822, and formally adopted the surname Mendelssohn Bartholdy (which they had used since 1812) for themselves and for their children. The name Bartholdy was added at the suggestion of Lea's brother, Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, who had inherited a property of this name in <a href="Luisenstadt">Luisenstadt</a> and adopted it as his own surname. In an 1829 letter to Felix, Abraham explained that adopting the Bartholdy name was meant to demonstrate a decisive break with the traditions of his father Moses: "There can no more be a Christian Mendelssohn than there can be a Jewish <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a>". (Letter to Felix of 8 July 1829). On embarking on his musical career, Felix did not entirely drop the name Mendelssohn as Abraham had requested, but in deference to his father signed his letters and had his visiting cards printed using the form 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy'. In 1829, his sister Fanny wrote to him of "Bartholdy [...] this name that we all dislike".

Mendelssohn began taking piano lessons from his mother when he was six, and at seven was tutored by <a href="Marie%20Bigot">Marie Bigot</a> in Paris. Later in Berlin, all four Mendelssohn children studied piano with <a href="Ludwig%20Berger%20%28composer%29">Ludwig Berger</a>, who was himself a former student of <a href="Muzio%20Clementi">Muzio Clementi</a>. From at least May 1819 Mendelssohn (initially with his sister Fanny) studied <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and composition with <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Zelter">Carl Friedrich Zelter</a> in Berlin. This was an important influence on his future career. Zelter had almost certainly been recommended as a teacher by his aunt <a href="Itzig%20family%23Sarah%20Itzig%20%281761%E2%80%931854%29">Sarah Levy</a>, who had been a pupil of <a href="W.%20F.%20Bach">W. F. Bach</a> and a patron of <a href="C.%20P.%20E.%20Bach">C. P. E. Bach</a>. Sarah Levy displayed some talent as a keyboard player, and often played with Zelter's orchestra at the <a href="Sing-Akademie%20zu%20Berlin">Berliner Singakademie</a>; she and the Mendelssohn family were among its leading patrons. Sarah had formed an important collection of Bach family manuscripts which she bequeathed to the Singakademie; Zelter, whose tastes in music were conservative, was also an admirer of the Bach tradition. This undoubtedly played a significant part in forming Felix Mendelssohn's musical tastes, as his works reflect this study of <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> and early classical music. His <a href="Fugue%20%28music%29">fugue</a>s and <a href="chorale">chorale</a>s especially reflect a tonal clarity and use of counterpoint reminiscent of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>, whose music influenced him deeply.

Mendelssohn probably made his first public concert appearance at the age of nine, when he participated in a <a href="chamber%20music">chamber music</a> concert accompanying a <a href="French%20horn">horn</a> duo. He was a prolific composer from an early age. As an adolescent, his works were often performed at home with a private orchestra for the associates of his wealthy parents amongst the intellectual elite of Berlin. Between the ages of 12 and 14, Mendelssohn wrote 12 <a href="String%20symphonies%20%28Mendelssohn%29">string symphonies</a> for such concerts, and a number of chamber works. His first work, a piano quartet, was published when he was 13. It was probably Abraham Mendelssohn who procured the publication of this quartet by the house of <a href="Adolf%20Martin%20Schlesinger">Schlesinger</a>. In 1824 the 15-year-old wrote his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Mendelssohn%29">first symphony</a> for full orchestra (in C minor, Op. 11).

At age 16 Mendelssohn wrote his <a href="Octet%20%28Mendelssohn%29">String Octet in E-flat major</a>, a work which has been regarded as "mark[ing] the beginning of his maturity as a composer." This Octet and his <a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%20%28Mendelssohn%29%23Overture">Overture</a> to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>", which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1843, he also wrote <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> for the play, including the famous "<a href="Wedding%20March%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Wedding March</a>".) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a <a href="concert%20overture">concert overture</a> – that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance but to evoke a literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in <a href="Romantic%20music">musical Romanticism</a>.

In 1824 Mendelssohn studied under the composer and piano virtuoso <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Ignaz Moscheles</a>, who confessed in his diaries that he had little to teach him. Moscheles and Mendelssohn became close colleagues and lifelong friends. The year 1827 saw the premiere – and sole performance in his lifetime – of Mendelssohn's opera "<a href="Die%20Hochzeit%20des%20Camacho">Die Hochzeit des Camacho</a>". The failure of this production left him disinclined to venture into the genre again.

Besides music, Mendelssohn's education included art, literature, languages, and philosophy. He had a particular interest in <a href="classical%20literature">classical literature</a> and translated <a href="Terence">Terence</a>'s "<a href="Andria%20%28comedy%29">Andria</a>" for his tutor Heyse in 1825; Heyse was impressed and had it published in 1826 as a work of "his pupil, F****" [i.e. "Felix" (asterisks as provided in original text)]. This translation also qualified Mendelssohn to study at the <a href="Humboldt%20University%20of%20Berlin">Humboldt University of Berlin</a>, where from 1826 to 1829 he attended lectures on aesthetics by <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel</a>, on history by <a href="Eduard%20Gans">Eduard Gans</a>, and on geography by <a href="Carl%20Ritter">Carl Ritter</a>.

In 1821 Zelter introduced Mendelssohn to his friend and correspondent <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> (then in his seventies), who was greatly impressed by the child, leading to perhaps the earliest confirmed comparison with <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> in the following conversation between Goethe and Zelter:

Mendelssohn was invited to meet Goethe on several later occasions, and set a number of Goethe's poems to music. His other compositions inspired by Goethe include the overture "<a href="Calm%20Sea%20and%20Prosperous%20Voyage%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage</a>" (Op. 27, 1828), and the cantata "<a href="Die%20erste%20Walpurgisnacht">Die erste Walpurgisnacht</a>" ("The First Walpurgis Night", Op. 60, 1832).

In 1829, with the backing of Zelter and the assistance of the actor <a href="Eduard%20Devrient">Eduard Devrient</a>, Mendelssohn arranged and conducted a performance in Berlin of Bach's "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>". Four years previously his grandmother, <a href="Itzig%20family%23Bella%20Itzig%20%281749%E2%80%931824%29">Bella Salomon</a>, had given him a copy of the manuscript of this (by then all-but-forgotten) masterpiece. The orchestra and choir for the performance were provided by the Berlin Singakademie. The success of this performance, one of the very few since Bach's death and the first ever outside of <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, was the central event in the revival of Bach's music in Germany and, eventually, throughout Europe. It earned Mendelssohn widespread acclaim at the age of 20. It also led to one of the few explicit references which Mendelssohn made to his origins: "To think that it took an actor and a Jew's son to revive the greatest Christian music for the world!"

Over the next few years Mendelssohn travelled widely. His first visit to England was in 1829; other places visited during the 1830s included Vienna, Florence, Milan, Rome and Naples, in all of which he met with local and visiting musicians and artists. These years proved to be the germination for some of his most famous works, including the "<a href="The%20Hebrides%20%28overture%29">Hebrides Overture</a>" and the "<a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Scottish</a>" and "<a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Italian</a>" symphonies.

On Zelter's death in 1832, Mendelssohn had hopes of succeeding him as conductor of the Singakademie; but at a vote in January 1833 he was defeated for the post by <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Rungenhagen">Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen</a>. This may have been because of Mendelssohn's youth, and fear of possible innovations; it was also suspected by some to be attributable to his Jewish ancestry. Following this rebuff, Mendelssohn divided most of his professional time over the next few years between Britain and <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, where he was appointed musical director (his first paid post as a musician) in 1833.

In the spring of that year Mendelssohn directed the <a href="Lower%20Rhenish%20Music%20Festival">Lower Rhenish Music Festival</a> in Düsseldorf, beginning with a performance of <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s oratorio "<a href="Israel%20in%20Egypt">Israel in Egypt</a>" prepared from the original score, which he had found in London. This precipitated a Handel revival in Germany, similar to the reawakened interest in J. S. Bach following his performance of the "St. Matthew Passion". Mendelssohn worked with the dramatist <a href="Karl%20Leberecht%20Immermann">Karl Immermann</a> to improve local theatre standards, and made his first appearance as an opera conductor in Immermann's production of Mozart's "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>" at the end of 1833, where he took umbrage at the audience's protests about the cost of tickets. His frustration at his everyday duties in Düsseldorf, and the city's provincialism, led him to resign his position at the end of 1834. He had offers from both Munich and Leipzig for important musical posts, namely, direction of the <a href="Munich%20Opera">Munich Opera</a>, the editorship of the prestigious Leipzig music journal the "<a href="Allgemeine%20musikalische%20Zeitung">Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung</a>", and direction of the <a href="Leipzig%20Gewandhaus%20Orchestra">Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra</a>; he accepted the latter in 1835.

In Leipzig, Mendelssohn concentrated on developing the town's musical life by working with the orchestra, the opera house, the <a href="Thomanerchor">Thomanerchor</a> (of which Bach had been a director), and the city's other choral and musical institutions. Mendelssohn's concerts included, in addition to many of his own works, three series of "historical concerts" featuring music of the eighteenth century, and a number of works by his contemporaries. He was deluged by offers of music from rising and would-be composers; among these was <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, who submitted his <a href="Symphony%20in%20C%20major%20%28Wagner%29">early Symphony</a>, the score of which, to Wagner's disgust, Mendelssohn lost or mislaid. Mendelssohn also revived interest in the music of <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>. <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a> discovered the manuscript of Schubert's <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Schubert%29">Ninth Symphony</a> and sent it to Mendelssohn, who promptly premiered it in Leipzig on 21 March 1839, more than a decade after Schubert's death.

A landmark event during Mendelssohn's Leipzig years was the premiere of his oratorio "<a href="St.%20Paul%20%28oratorio%29">Paulus</a>", (the English version of this is known as "St. Paul"), given at the <a href="Lower%20Rhenish%20Music%20Festival">Lower Rhenish Festival</a> in Düsseldorf in 1836, shortly after the death of the composer's father, which affected him greatly; Felix wrote that he would "never cease to endeavour to gain his approval [...] although I can no longer enjoy it". "St. Paul" seemed to many of Mendelssohn's contemporaries to be his finest work, and sealed his European reputation.

When <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20IV">Friedrich Wilhelm IV</a> came to the Prussian throne in 1840 with ambitions to develop Berlin as a cultural centre (including the establishment of a music school, and reform of music for the church), the obvious choice to head these reforms was Mendelssohn. He was reluctant to undertake the task, especially in the light of his existing strong position in Leipzig. Mendelssohn nonetheless spent some time in Berlin, writing some church music, and, at the King's request, music for productions of <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>'s "<a href="Antigone%20%28Sophocles%29">Antigone</a>" (1841 – <a href="Antigone%20%28Mendelssohn%29">an overture and seven pieces</a>) and "<a href="Oedipus%20at%20Colonus">Oedipus at Colonus</a>" (1845), "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (1843) and <a href="Jean%20Racine">Racine</a>'s "<a href="Athalie">Athalie</a>" (1845). But the funds for the school never materialised, and many of the court's promises to Mendelssohn regarding finances, title, and concert programming were broken. He was therefore not displeased to have the excuse to return to Leipzig.

In 1843 Mendelssohn founded a major music school – the Leipzig Conservatory, now the <a href="University%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre%20Leipzig">Hochschule für Musik und Theater "Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy"</a>. where he persuaded Ignaz Moscheles and Robert Schumann to join him. Other prominent musicians, including the string players Ferdinand David and <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a> and the music theorist <a href="Moritz%20Hauptmann">Moritz Hauptmann</a>, also became staff members. After Mendelssohn's death in 1847, his musically conservative tradition was carried on when Moscheles succeeded him as head of the Conservatory.

Mendelssohn first visited Britain in 1829, where Moscheles, who had already settled in London, introduced him to influential musical circles. In the summer he visited <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, where he met among others the composer <a href="John%20Thomson%20%28composer%29">John Thomson</a>, whom he later recommended for the post of Professor of Music at <a href="Edinburgh%20University">Edinburgh University</a>. He made ten visits to Britain, lasting about 20 months; he won a strong following, which enabled him to make a good impression on British musical life. He composed and performed, and also edited for British publishers the first critical editions of <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s of Handel and of the organ music of J. S. Bach. Scotland inspired two of his most famous works: the overture "The Hebrides" (also known as "Fingal's Cave"); and the "Scottish Symphony" (Symphony No. 3). An <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> commemorating Mendelssohn's residence in London was placed at 4 Hobart Place in <a href="Belgravia">Belgravia</a>, London, in 2013.

His protégé, the British composer and pianist <a href="William%20Sterndale%20Bennett">William Sterndale Bennett</a>, worked closely with Mendelssohn during this period, both in London and Leipzig. He first heard Bennett perform in London in 1833 aged 17. Bennett appeared with Mendelssohn in concerts in Leipzig throughout the 1836/1837 season.

On Mendelssohn's eighth British visit in the summer of 1844, he conducted five of the Philharmonic concerts in London, and wrote: "[N]ever before was anything like this season – we never went to bed before half-past one, every hour of every day was filled with engagements three weeks beforehand, and I got through more music in two months than in all the rest of the year." (Letter to Rebecka Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Soden, 22 July 1844). On subsequent visits Mendelssohn met <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and her husband <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, himself a composer, who both greatly admired his music.

Mendelssohn's oratorio "<a href="Elijah%20%28oratorio%29">Elijah</a>" was commissioned by the <a href="Birmingham%20Triennial%20Music%20Festival">Birmingham Triennial Music Festival</a> and premiered on 26 August 1846, at the <a href="Birmingham%20Town%20Hall">Town Hall, Birmingham</a>. It was composed to a German text translated into English by <a href="William%20Bartholomew%20%28writer%29">William Bartholomew</a>, who authored and translated many of Mendelssohn's works during his time in England.
On his last visit to Britain in 1847, Mendelssohn was the soloist in <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%204%20%28Beethoven%29">Piano Concerto No. 4</a> and conducted his own "Scottish Symphony" with the Philharmonic Orchestra before the Queen and Prince Albert.

Mendelssohn suffered from poor health in the final years of his life, probably aggravated by nervous problems and overwork. A final tour of England left him exhausted and ill, and the death of his sister, Fanny, on 14 May 1847, caused him further distress. Less than six months later, on 4 November, aged 38, Mendelssohn died in Leipzig after a series of strokes. His grandfather Moses, Fanny, and both his parents had all died from similar <a href="Apoplexy">apoplexies</a>. Felix's funeral was held at the <a href="Paulinerkirche%2C%20Leipzig">Paulinerkirche</a>, Leipzig, and he was buried at the <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%20%28Berlin%29%23Cemeteries">Dreifaltigkeitsfriedhof I</a> in Berlin-<a href="Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a>. The <a href="pallbearer">pallbearer</a>s included Moscheles, Schumann and <a href="Niels%20Gade">Niels Gade</a>. Mendelssohn had once described death, in a letter to a stranger, as a place "where it is to be hoped there is still music, but no more sorrow or partings."

While Mendelssohn was often presented as equable, happy, and placid in temperament, particularly in the detailed family memoirs published by his nephew Sebastian Hensel after the composer's death, this was misleading. The music historian R. Larry Todd notes "the remarkable process of idealization" of Mendelssohn's character "that crystallized in the memoirs of the composer's circle", including Hensel's. The nickname "discontented Polish count" was given to Mendelssohn on account of his aloofness, and he referred to the epithet in his letters. He was frequently given to fits of temper which occasionally led to collapse. Devrient mentions that on one occasion in the 1830s, when his wishes had been crossed, "his excitement was increased so fearfully ... that when the family was assembled ... he began to talk incoherently in English. The stern voice of his father at last checked the wild torrent of words; they took him to bed, and a profound sleep of twelve hours restored him to his normal state". Such fits may be related to his early death.

Mendelssohn was an enthusiastic visual artist who worked in pencil and <a href="watercolour">watercolour</a>, a skill which he enjoyed throughout his life. His correspondences indicate that he could write with considerable wit in German and English – these letters are sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons.

On 21 March 1816, at the age of seven years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home ceremony by Johann Jakob Stegemann, minister of the <a href="Prussian%20Union%20of%20Churches%23Royal%20attempts%20to%20merge%20Lutherans%20and%20Calvinists">Evangelical</a> congregation of Berlin's <a href="Jerusalem%20Church%20%28Berlin%29">Jerusalem Church</a> and <a href="New%20Church%20%28Berlin%29">New Church</a>. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian as a member of the Reformed Church, he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather, Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses's works, which continued with the support of his uncle, <a href="Joseph%20Mendelssohn">Joseph Mendelssohn</a>. Felix was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that "[his] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions". Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: "What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke [...] It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family, isn't it?" Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors' Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.

 Throughout his life Mendelssohn was wary of the more radical musical developments undertaken by some of his contemporaries. He was generally on friendly, if sometimes somewhat cool, terms with <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>, <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, and <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a>, but in his letters expresses his frank disapproval of their works, for example writing of Liszt that his compositions were "inferior to his playing, and […] only calculated for virtuosos"; of Berlioz's overture "<a href="Les%20francs-juges">Les francs-juges</a>" "[T]he orchestration is such a frightful muddle [...] that one ought to wash one's hands after handling one of his scores"; and of Meyerbeer's opera "<a href="Robert%20le%20diable">Robert le diable</a>" "I consider it ignoble", calling its villain Bertram "a poor devil". When his friend the composer <a href="Ferdinand%20Hiller">Ferdinand Hiller</a> suggested in conversation to Mendelssohn that he looked rather like Meyerbeer – they were actually distant cousins, both descendants of Rabbi <a href="Moses%20Isserles">Moses Isserles</a> – Mendelssohn was so upset that he immediately went to get a haircut to differentiate himself.

In particular, Mendelssohn seems to have regarded Paris and its music with the greatest of suspicion and an almost puritanical distaste. Attempts made during his visit there to interest him in <a href="Saint-Simonianism">Saint-Simonianism</a> ended in embarrassing scenes. It is significant that the only musician with whom Mendelssohn remained a close personal friend, Ignaz Moscheles, was of an older generation and equally conservative in outlook. Moscheles preserved this conservative attitude at the Leipzig Conservatory until his own death in 1870.

Mendelssohn married Cécile Charlotte Sophie Jeanrenaud (10 October 1817 – 25 September 1853), the daughter of a French Reformed Church clergyman, on 28 March 1837. The couple had five children: Carl, Marie, Paul, Lili and Felix August. The second youngest child, Felix August, contracted <a href="measles">measles</a> in 1844 and was left with impaired health; he died in 1851. The eldest, Carl Mendelssohn Bartholdy (7 February 1838 – 23 February 1897), became a historian, and Professor of History at <a href="Heidelberg%20University">Heidelberg</a> and <a href="Freiburg%20University">Freiburg</a> universities; he died in a psychiatric institution in Freiburg aged 59. <a href="Paul%20Mendelssohn%20Bartholdy">Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy</a> (1841–1880) was a noted chemist and pioneered the manufacture of <a href="aniline">aniline</a> dye. Marie married Victor Benecke and lived in London. Lili married <a href="Adolf%20Wach">Adolf Wach</a>, later Professor of Law at <a href="Leipzig%20University">Leipzig University</a>.

The family papers inherited by Marie's and Lili's children form the basis of the extensive collection of Mendelssohn manuscripts, including the so-called "Green Books" of his correspondence, now in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> at Oxford University. Cécile Mendelssohn Bartholdy died less than six years after her husband, on 25 September 1853.

Mendelssohn became close to the Swedish soprano <a href="Jenny%20Lind">Jenny Lind</a>, whom he met in October 1844. Papers confirming their relationship had not been made public. In 2013, George Biddlecombe confirmed in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20Royal%20Musical%20Association">Journal of the Royal Musical Association</a>" that "The Committee of the <a href="Mendelssohn%20Scholarship">Mendelssohn Scholarship</a> Foundation possesses material indicating that Mendelssohn wrote passionate love letters to Jenny Lind entreating her to join him in an adulterous relationship and threatening suicide as a means of exerting pressure upon her, and that these letters were destroyed on being discovered after her death."

Mendelssohn met and worked with Lind many times, and started an opera, "Lorelei", for her, based on the legend of the <a href="Lorelei">Lorelei</a> Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He is said to have tailored the aria "Hear Ye Israel", in his oratorio "<a href="Elijah%20%28oratorio%29">Elijah</a>", to Lind's voice, although she did not sing the part until after his death, at a concert in December 1848. In 1847, Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's "Robert le diable" – an opera that musically he despised – in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic <a href="Henry%20Chorley">Henry Chorley</a>, who was with him, wrote: "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at me, as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mdlle. Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success."

Upon Mendelssohn's death, Lind wrote: "[He was] the only person who brought fulfillment to my spirit, and almost as soon as I found him I lost him again." In 1849, she established the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation, which makes an award to a young resident British composer every two years in Mendelssohn's memory. The first winner of the scholarship, in 1856, was <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a>, then aged 14. In 1869, Lind erected a plaque in Mendelssohn's memory at his birthplace in Hamburg.

 Something of Mendelssohn's intense attachment to his personal vision of music is conveyed in his comments to a correspondent who suggested converting some of the "<a href="Songs%20Without%20Words">Songs Without Words</a>" into <a href="lied">lied</a>er by adding texts: "What [the] music I love expresses to me, are not thoughts that are too "indefinite" for me to put into words, but on the contrary, too "definite"."

Schumann wrote of Mendelssohn that he was "the Mozart of the nineteenth century, the most brilliant musician, the one who most clearly sees through the contradictions of the age and for the first time reconciles them." This appreciation brings to the fore two features that characterized Mendelssohn's compositions and his compositional process. First, that his inspiration for musical style was rooted in his technical mastery and his interpretation of the style of previous masters, although he certainly recognized and developed the strains of early <a href="Romanticism%20%28music%29">Romanticism</a> in the music of Beethoven and Weber. The historian James Garratt writes that from his early career, "the view emerged that Mendelssohn's engagement with early music was a defining aspect of his creativity." This approach was recognized by Mendelssohn himself, who wrote that, in his meetings with Goethe, he gave the poet "historical exhibitions" at the keyboard; "every morning, for about an hour, I have to play a variety of works by great composers in chronological order, and must explain to him how they contributed to the advance of music." Secondly, it highlights that Mendelssohn was more concerned to reinvigorate the musical legacy which he inherited, rather than to replace it with new forms and styles, or with the use of more exotic <a href="orchestration">orchestration</a>. In these ways he differed significantly from many of his contemporaries in the early Romantic period, such as Wagner, Berlioz and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>. Whilst Mendelssohn admired Liszt's virtuosity at the keyboard, he found his music jejune. Berlioz said of Mendelssohn that he had "perhaps studied the music of the dead too closely."

The musicologist Greg Vitercik considers that, while "Mendelssohn's music only rarely aspires to provoke", the stylistic innovations evident from his earliest works solve some of the contradictions between classical forms and the sentiments of Romanticism. The expressiveness of Romantic music presented a problem in adherence to <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a>; the final (<a href="recapitulation%20%28music%29">recapitulation</a>) section of a movement could seem, in the context of Romantic style, a bland element without passion or soul. Furthermore, it could be seen as a pedantic delay before reaching the emotional climax of a movement, which in the classical tradition had tended to be at the transition from the <a href="Sonata%20form%23Development">development</a> section of the movement to the recapitulation; whereas Berlioz and other "modernists" sought to have the emotional climax at the end of a movement, if necessary by adding an extended <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> to follow the recapitulation proper. Mendelssohn's solution to this problem was less sensational than Berlioz's approach, but was rooted in changing the structural balance of the formal components of the movement. Thus typically in a Mendelssohnian movement, the development-recapitulation transition might not be strongly marked, and the recapitulation section would be harmonically or melodically varied so as not to be a direct copy of the opening, <a href="exposition%20%28music%29">exposition</a>, section; this allowed a logical movement towards a final climax. Vitercik summarizes the effect as "to assimilate the dynamic trajectory of 'external form' to the 'logical' unfolding of the story of the theme".

<a href="Richard%20Taruskin">Richard Taruskin</a> writes that, although Mendelssohn produced works of extraordinary mastery at a very early age,
he never outgrew his precocious youthful style. [...] He remained stylistically conservative [...] feeling no need to attract attention with a display of "revolutionary" novelty. Throughout his short career he remained comfortably faithful to the musical status quo – that is, the "classical" forms, as they were already thought of by his time. His version of romanticism, already evident in his earliest works, consisted in musical "pictorialism" of a fairly conventional, objective nature (though exquisitely wrought).

The young Mendelssohn was greatly influenced in his childhood by the music of both J. S. Bach and <a href="Carl%20Philipp%20Emmanuel%20Bach">C. P. E. Bach</a>, and of Beethoven, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a> and Mozart; traces of these composers can be seen in the 12 early <a href="String%20symphonies%20%28Mendelssohn%29">string symphonies</a>. These were written from 1821 to 1823, when he was between the ages of 12 and 14, principally for performance in the Mendelssohn household, and not published or publicly performed until long after his death.

His first published works were his three <a href="piano%20quartet">piano quartet</a>s (1822–1825; <a href="Piano%20Quartet%20No.%201%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Op. 1</a> in C minor, <a href="Piano%20Quartet%20No.%202%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Op. 2</a> in F minor and <a href="Piano%20Quartet%20No.%203%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Op. 3</a> in B minor); but his capacities are especially revealed in a group of works of his early maturity: the <a href="Octet%20%28Mendelssohn%29">String Octet</a> (1825), the Overture "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (1826), which in its <a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream%20%28Mendelssohn%29%23Overture">finished form</a> also owes much to the influence of <a href="Adolf%20Bernhard%20Marx">Adolf Bernhard Marx</a>, at the time a close friend of Mendelssohn, and the two early <a href="string%20quartets">string quartets</a>: <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%201%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Op. 12</a> (1829) and <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%202%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Op. 13</a> (1827), which both show a remarkable grasp of the techniques and ideas of <a href="Late%20String%20Quartets%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's last quartets</a> that Mendelssohn had been closely studying. These four works show an intuitive command of form, harmony, <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>, colour, and compositional technique, which in the opinion of R. Larry Todd justifies claims frequently made that Mendelssohn's precocity exceeded even that of Mozart in its intellectual grasp.

A 2009 survey by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> of 16 music critics opined that Mendelssohn was the greatest composing prodigy in the history of Western classical music.

Mendelssohn's mature symphonies are numbered approximately in the order of publication, rather than the order in which they were composed. The order of composition is: 1, 5, 4, 2, 3. The placement of No. 3 in this sequence is problematic because he worked on it for over a decade, starting the sketches soon after he began work on No. 5 but completing it after both Nos. 5 and 4.

The <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Symphony No. 1 in C minor</a> for full orchestra was written in 1824, when Mendelssohn was aged 15. This work is experimental, showing the influences of Beethoven and <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Carl Maria von Weber</a>. Mendelssohn conducted the symphony on his first visit to London in 1829, with the orchestra of the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Philharmonic Society</a>. For the third movement he substituted an orchestration of the Scherzo from his Octet. In this form the piece was a success, and laid the foundations of his British reputation.

During 1829 and 1830 Mendelssohn wrote his <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Symphony No. 5</a>, known as the "Reformation". It celebrated the 300th anniversary of the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a>. Mendelssohn remained dissatisfied with the work and did not allow publication of the score. The "Scottish Symphony" (<a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Symphony No. 3 in A minor</a>) was written and revised intermittently between 1829 (when Mendelssohn noted down the opening theme during a visit to <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Holyrood Palace</a>) and 1842, when it was given its premiere in Leipzig, the last of his symphonies to be premiered in public. This piece evokes Scotland's atmosphere in the ethos of Romanticism, but does not employ any identified Scottish folk melodies.

Mendelssohn's travels in Italy inspired him to compose the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Symphony No. 4 in A major</a>, known as the "Italian Symphony". He conducted the premiere in 1833, but did not allow the score to be published during his lifetime, as he continually sought to rewrite it. He wrote the <a href="choral%20symphony">symphony-cantata</a> "<a href="Lobgesang">Lobgesang</a>" ("Hymn of Praise") in B-flat major, posthumously named Symphony No. 2, to mark the celebrations in Leipzig of the supposed 400th anniversary of the <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a> by <a href="Johannes%20Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a>; the first performance took place on 25 June 1840.

Mendelssohn wrote the <a href="Overture%23Concert%20overture">concert overture</a> "<a href="The%20Hebrides%20%28overture%29">The Hebrides</a>" ("Fingal's Cave") in 1830, inspired by visits to Scotland around the end of the 1820s. He visited <a href="Fingal%27s%20Cave">Fingal's Cave</a>, on the <a href="Hebrides">Hebridean</a> isle of <a href="Staffa">Staffa</a>, as part of his <a href="Grand%20Tour%20of%20Europe">Grand Tour of Europe</a>, and was so impressed that he scribbled the opening theme of the overture on the spot, including it in a letter he wrote home the same evening. He wrote other concert overtures, notably "<a href="Calm%20Sea%20and%20Prosperous%20Voyage%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage</a>" ("Meeresstille und glückliche Fahrt", 1828), inspired by a pair of poems by Goethe and "<a href="Die%20sch%C3%B6ne%20Melusine">The Fair Melusine</a> (Die schöne Melusine)" (1830). A contemporary writer considered these works as "perhaps the most beautiful overtures that, so far, we Germans possess".

Mendelssohn also wrote in 1839 an overture to "<a href="Ruy%20Blas">Ruy Blas</a>", commissioned for a charity performance of <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>'s drama (which the composer hated). His incidental music to "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (Op. 61), including the well-known Wedding March, was written in 1843, seventeen years after the Overture.

The <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Violin Concerto in E minor</a>, Op. 64 (1844), was written for <a href="Ferdinand%20David%20%28musician%29">Ferdinand David</a>. David, who had worked closely with Mendelssohn during the piece's preparation, gave the premiere of the concerto on his <a href="Guarneri">Guarneri</a> violin. <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a> called it one of the four great violin concertos along with those of <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Brahms%29">Brahms</a>, and <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Bruch%29">Bruch</a>.

Mendelssohn also wrote a lesser-known, early <a href="Concerto%20for%20Violin%20and%20Strings%20%28Mendelssohn%29">concerto for violin and strings</a> in D minor (1822); four piano concertos ("no. 0" in A minor, 1822; <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%201%20%28Mendelssohn%29">1 in G minor</a>, 1831; <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%202%20%28Mendelssohn%29">2 in D minor</a>, 1837; and 3 in E minor, a posthumously published fragment from 1844); two concertos for two pianos and orchestra (<a href="Concerto%20for%20Two%20Pianos%20and%20Orchestra%20in%20E%20major%20%28Mendelssohn%29">E major</a>, which he wrote at 15, and <a href="Concerto%20for%20Two%20Pianos%20and%20Orchestra%20in%20A-flat%20major%20%28Mendelssohn%29">A-flat major</a>, at 17); and another double concerto, for violin and piano (1823). In addition, there are several single-movement works for soloist and orchestra. Those for piano are the "Rondo Brillante" of 1834, the "Capriccio Brillante" of 1832, and the "Serenade and Allegro Giocoso" of 1838. He also wrote two <a href="Concertino%20%28composition%29">concertinos</a> ("Konzertstücke"), Op. 113 and 114, originally for <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>, <a href="basset%20horn">basset horn</a> and piano; Op. 113 was <a href="orchestration">orchestrated</a> by the composer.

Mendelssohn's mature output contains numerous <a href="chamber%20music">chamber works</a>, many of which display an emotional intensity lacking in some of his larger works. In particular, his <a href="String%20Quartet%20No.%206%20%28Mendelssohn%29">String Quartet No. 6</a>, the last of his <a href="String%20Quartets%20%28Mendelssohn%29">string quartets</a> and his last major work – written following the death of his sister Fanny – is, in the opinion of the historian Peter Mercer-Taylor, exceptionally powerful and eloquent. Other mature works include two <a href="string%20quintet">string quintet</a>s; sonatas for the <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>, cello, <a href="Viola%20Sonata%20%28Mendelssohn%29">viola</a> and violin; and two <a href="piano%20trio">piano trio</a>s. For the <a href="Piano%20Trio%20No.%201%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Piano Trio No. 1 in D minor</a>, Mendelssohn uncharacteristically took the advice of his fellow composer, Ferdinand Hiller, and rewrote the piano part in a more Romantic, "<a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumannesque</a>" style, considerably heightening its effect.

The musicologist Glenn Stanley observes that "[u]nlike <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>, unlike his contemporaries Schumann, Chopin and Liszt, and unlike [his] revered past masters...Mendelssohn did not regard the piano as a preferred medium for his most significant artistic statements". Mendelssohn's "Songs Without Words" ("Lieder ohne Worte"), eight cycles each containing six lyric pieces (two published posthumously), remain his most famous solo piano compositions. They became standard parlour recital items even during the composer's lifetime, and their overwhelming popularity, according to Todd, has itself caused many critics to underrate their musical value. As example, <a href="Charles%20Rosen">Charles Rosen</a> equivocally commented, despite noting "how much beautiful music they contain", that "[i]t is not true that they are insipid, but they might as well be." During the 19th century, composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own included <a href="Charles-Valentin%20Alkan">Charles-Valentin Alkan</a> (his five sets of "Chants", each ending with a <a href="barcarole">barcarole</a>) and <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a>.

Other notable piano works by Mendelssohn include his "<a href="Variations%20s%C3%A9rieuses">Variations sérieuses</a>", Op. 54 (1841), the "Rondo Capriccioso", the set of six "Preludes and Fugues", Op. 35 (written between 1832 and 1837), and the "Seven Characteristic Pieces", Op. 7 (1827).

Mendelssohn played and composed for organ from the age of 11 until his death. His primary organ works are the "Three Preludes and Fugues", Op. 37 (1837), and the "<a href="Organ%20sonatas%20op.%2065%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Six Sonatas</a>", Op. 65 (1845), of which Eric Werner wrote "next to Bach's works, Mendelssohn's Organ Sonatas belong to the required repertory of all organists".

Mendelssohn wrote some <a href="Singspiel">Singspiel</a>e for family performance in his youth. His opera "<a href="Die%20beiden%20Neffen">Die beiden Neffen</a>" ("The Two Nephews") was rehearsed for him on his 15th birthday. 1829 saw "<a href="Die%20Heimkehr%20aus%20der%20Fremde">Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde</a>" ("Son and Stranger" or "Return of the Roamer"), a comedy of mistaken identity written in honour of his parents' silver anniversary and unpublished during his lifetime. In 1825 he wrote a more sophisticated work, "<a href="Die%20Hochzeit%20des%20Camacho">Die Hochzeit des Camacho</a>" ("Camacho's Wedding"), based on an episode in "<a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>", for public consumption. It was produced in Berlin in 1827, but coolly received. Mendelssohn left the theatre before the conclusion of the first performance, and subsequent performances were cancelled.

Although he never abandoned the idea of composing a full opera, and considered many subjects – including that of the <a href="Nibelungenlied">Nibelung saga</a> later adapted by Wagner, about which he corresponded with his sister Fanny – he never wrote more than a few pages of sketches for any project. In Mendelssohn's last years the opera manager <a href="Benjamin%20Lumley">Benjamin Lumley</a> tried to contract him to write an opera from Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>" on a libretto by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Scribe">Eugène Scribe</a>, and even announced it as forthcoming in 1847, the year of Mendelssohn's death. The libretto was eventually set by <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a>. At his death Mendelssohn left some sketches for an opera on the story of the <a href="Lorelei">Lorelei</a>.

Mendelssohn's two large biblical oratorios, "<a href="St.%20Paul%20%28oratorio%29">St Paul</a>" in 1836 and "<a href="Elijah%20%28oratorio%29">Elijah</a>" in 1846, are greatly influenced by J. S. Bach. The surviving fragments of an unfinished oratorio, "<a href="Christus%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Christus</a>", consist of a <a href="recitative">recitative</a>, a chorus "There Shall a Star Come out of Jacob", and a male voice trio.

Strikingly different is the more overtly Romantic "<a href="Die%20erste%20Walpurgisnacht">Die erste Walpurgisnacht</a>" ("The First Walpurgis Night"), a setting for chorus and orchestra of a ballad by Goethe describing <a href="Paganism">pagan</a> rituals of the <a href="Druid">Druid</a>s in the <a href="Harz">Harz</a> mountains in the early days of Christianity. This score has been seen by the scholar <a href="Heinz-Klaus%20Metzger">Heinz-Klaus Metzger</a> as a "Jewish protest against the domination of Christianity".

Mendelssohn wrote five settings from "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Psalms">The Book of Psalms</a>" for chorus and orchestra. Schumann opined in 1837 that <a href="Psalm%2042%20%28Mendelssohn%29">his version</a> of <a href="Psalm%2042">Psalm 42</a> was the "highest point that he [Mendelssohn] reached as a composer for the church. Indeed the highest point recent church music has reached at all."

Mendelssohn also wrote many smaller-scale sacred works for unaccompanied choir, such as a setting of <a href="Psalm%20100">Psalm 100</a>, "<a href="Jauchzet%20dem%20Herrn%2C%20alle%20Welt%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt</a>", and for choir with organ. Most are written in or translated into English. Among the most famous is "<a href="Hear%20My%20Prayer">Hear My Prayer</a>", whose second half contains "O for the Wings of a Dove", which became often performed as a separate item. The piece is written for full choir, organ, and a <a href="boy%20soprano">treble</a> or <a href="soprano">soprano</a> soloist. Mendelssohn's biographer Todd comments, "The very popularity of the anthem in England [...] later exposed it to charges of superficiality from those contemptuous of Victorian <a href="mores">mores</a>."

A hymn tune "Mendelssohn" – an adaptation by <a href="William%20Hayman%20Cummings">William Hayman Cummings</a> of a melody from Mendelssohn's cantata "<a href="Festgesang">Festgesang</a>" ("Festive Hymn"), a secular 1840s composition, which Mendelssohn felt unsuited to sacred music – has become the standard tune for <a href="Charles%20Wesley">Charles Wesley</a>'s popular Christmas hymn "<a href="Hark%21%20The%20Herald%20Angels%20Sing">Hark! The Herald Angels Sing</a>".

Mendelssohn wrote many songs, both for solo voice and for duet, with piano. It has been asserted that from 1819 (when he was 10) until his death there was "scarcely a single month in which he was not occupied with song composition". Many of these songs are simple, or slightly modified, <a href="strophic%20form">strophic</a> settings. Some, such as his best-known song "<a href="On%20Wings%20of%20Song%20%28poem%20and%20song%29">Auf Flügeln des Gesanges</a>" ("On Wings of Song"), became popular. The scholar Susan Youens comments "If [Mendelssohn]'s emotional range in lied was narrower than Schubert's, that is hardly surprising: Schubert composed many more songs than Mendelssohn across a wider spectrum", and whilst Schubert had a declared intent to modernize the song style of his day, "[t]his was not Mendelssohn's mission."

A number of songs written by Mendelssohn's sister Fanny originally appeared under her brother's name; this may have been partly due to the prejudice of the family, and partly to her own retiring nature.

During his lifetime, Mendelssohn became renowned as a keyboard performer, both on the piano and organ. One of his obituarists noted: "First and chiefest we esteem his pianoforte-playing, with its amazing elasticity of touch, rapidity, and power; next his scientific and vigorous organ playing [...] his triumphs on these instruments are fresh in public recollection. In his concerts and recitals Mendelssohn performed works by some of his German predecessors, notably <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Carl Maria von Weber</a>, Beethoven and J.S. Bach, whose organ music he brought back into the repertoire "virtually alone".

In private and public performances, Mendelssohn was celebrated for his <a href="improvisation%20%28music%29">improvisations</a>. On one occasion in London, when asked by the soprano <a href="Maria%20Malibran">Maria Malibran</a> after a recital to extemporise, he improvised a piece which included the melodies of all the songs she had sung. The music publisher Victor Novello, who was present, remarked "He has done some things that seem to me impossible, even after I have heard them done." At another recital in 1837, where Mendelssohn played the piano for a singer, Robert Schumann ignored the soprano and wrote "Mendelssohn accompanied like a God."

Mendelssohn was a noted conductor, both of his own works and of those by other composers. At his London debut in 1829, he was noted for his innovatory use of a <a href="baton%20%28music%29">baton</a> (then a great novelty). But his novelty also extended to taking great care over <a href="tempo">tempo</a>, <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a> and the orchestral players themselves – both rebuking them when they were recalcitrant and praising them when they satisfied him. It was his success while conducting at the Lower Rhine music festival of 1836 that led to him taking his first paid professional position as director at Düsseldorf. Among those appreciating Mendelssohn's conducting was Hector Berlioz, who in 1843, invited to Leipzig, exchanged batons with Mendelssohn, writing "When the <a href="Great%20Spirit">Great Spirit</a> sends us to hunt in the land of souls, may our warriors hang our <a href="tomahawk%20%28axe%29">tomahawk</a>s side by side at the door of the council chamber". At Leipzig, Mendelssohn led the <a href="Gewandhaus%20Orchestra">Gewandhaus Orchestra</a> to great heights; although concentrating on the great composers of the past (already becoming canonised as the "classics") he also included new music by Schumann, Berlioz, Gade and many others, as well as his own music. One critic who was not impressed was Richard Wagner; he accused Mendelssohn of using tempos in his performances of Beethoven symphonies that were far too fast.

Mendelssohn's interest in baroque music was not limited to the Bach "St Matthew Passion" which he had revived in 1829. He was concerned in preparing and editing such music, whether for performance or for publication, to be as close as possible to the original intentions of the composers, including wherever possible a close study of early editions and manuscripts. This could lead him into conflict with publishers; for instance, his edition of Handel's oratorio "<a href="Israel%20in%20Egypt">Israel in Egypt</a>" for the London Handel Society (1845) evoked an often contentious correspondence, with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a> where not given by Handel, or to add parts for <a href="trombone">trombone</a>s. Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach's works for organ, and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition.

Although Mendelssohn attributed great importance to musical education, and made a substantial commitment to the Conservatoire he founded in Leipzig, he did not greatly enjoy teaching and took only a very few private pupils who he believed had notable qualities. Such students included the composer William Sterndale Bennett, the pianist <a href="Camille-Marie%20Stamaty">Camille-Marie Stamaty</a>, the violinist and composer <a href="Julius%20Eichberg">Julius Eichberg</a>, and <a href="Walther%20von%20Goethe">Walther von Goethe</a> (grandson of the poet). At the Leipzig Conservatoire Mendelssohn taught classes in composition and ensemble playing.

In the immediate wake of Mendelssohn's death, he was mourned both in Germany and England. However, the conservative strain in Mendelssohn, which set him apart from some of his more flamboyant contemporaries, bred a corollary condescension amongst some of them toward his music. Mendelssohn's relations with Berlioz, Liszt and others had been uneasy and equivocal. Listeners who had raised questions about Mendelssohn's talent included <a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heinrich Heine</a>, who wrote in 1836 after hearing the oratorio "St. Paul" that his work was

characterized by a great, strict, very serious seriousness, a determined, almost importunate tendency to follow classical models, the finest, cleverest calculation, sharp intelligence and, finally, complete lack of naïveté. But is there in art any originality of genius without naïveté?

Such criticism of Mendelssohn for his very ability – which could be characterised negatively as facility – was taken to further lengths by Richard Wagner. Mendelssohn's success, his popularity and his Jewish origins irked Wagner sufficiently to damn Mendelssohn with faint praise, three years after his death, in an anti-Jewish pamphlet "<a href="Das%20Judenthum%20in%20der%20Musik">Das Judenthum in der Musik</a>":

[Mendelssohn] has shown us that a Jew may have the amplest store of specific talents, may own the finest and most varied culture, the highest and tenderest sense of honour – yet without all these pre-eminences helping him, were it but one single time, to call forth in us that deep, that heart-searching effect which we await from art [...] The washiness and the whimsicality of our present musical style has been [...] pushed to its utmost pitch by Mendelssohn's endeavour to speak out a vague, an almost nugatory Content as interestingly and spiritedly as possible.

The philosopher <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> expressed consistent admiration for Mendelssohn's music, in contrast to his general scorn for "Teutonic" Romanticism:

At any rate, the whole music of romanticism [e.g. Schumann and Wagner] ... was second-rate music from the very start, and real musicians took little notice of it. Things were different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon master who, thanks to his easier, purer, happier soul, was quickly honoured and just as quickly forgotten, as a lovely "incident" in German music.

Some readers, however, have interpreted Nietzsche's characterization of Mendelssohn as a 'lovely incident' as condescending.

In the 20th century the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi regime</a> and its "<a href="Reichsmusikkammer">Reichsmusikkammer</a>" cited Mendelssohn's Jewish origin in banning performance and publication of his works, even asking Nazi-approved composers to rewrite incidental music for "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (<a href="Carl%20Orff">Carl Orff</a> obliged). Under the Nazis, "Mendelssohn was presented as a dangerous 'accident' of music history, who played a decisive role in rendering German music in the 19th century 'degenerate'." The <a href="Mendelssohn%20Scholarship%23Mendelssohn%20Scholarship%20in%20Germany">German Mendelssohn Scholarship</a> for students at the Leipzig Conservatoire was discontinued in 1934 (and not revived until 1963). The monument dedicated to Mendelssohn erected in Leipzig in 1892 was removed by the Nazis in 1936. A replacement was erected in 2008. The bronze statue of Mendelssohn by Clemens Buscher (1855–1916) outside the Düsseldorf Opera House was also removed and destroyed by the Nazis in 1936. A replacement was erected in 2012. Mendelssohn's grave remained unmolested during the National Socialist years.

Mendelssohn's reputation in Britain remained high throughout the 19th century. Prince Albert inscribed (in German) a libretto for the oratorio "Elijah" in 1847: "To the noble artist who, surrounded by the <a href="Baal">Baal</a>-worship of false art, has been able, like a second Elijah, through genius and study, to remain true to the service of true art." In 1851 an adulatory novel by the teenaged <a href="Elizabeth%20Sara%20Sheppard">Elizabeth Sara Sheppard</a> was published, "<a href="Charles%20Auchester">Charles Auchester</a>". The book features as its leading character the "Chevalier Seraphel", an idealized portrait of Mendelssohn, and remained in print for nearly 80 years. In 1854 Queen Victoria requested that <a href="the%20Crystal%20Palace">the Crystal Palace</a> include a statue of Mendelssohn when it was rebuilt. Mendelssohn's "Wedding March" from "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was played at the wedding of Queen Victoria's daughter, <a href="Empress%20Frederick">Princess Victoria, The Princess Royal</a>, to <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia</a> in 1858, and it remains popular at marriage ceremonies. Mendelssohn's pupil Sterndale Bennett was a major force in British musical education until his death in 1875, and a great upholder of his master's traditions; he numbered among his pupils many of the next generation of English composers, including Sullivan, <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a> and <a href="Francis%20Edward%20Bache">Francis Edward Bache</a>.

By the early twentieth century, many critics, including <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>, began to condemn Mendelssohn's music for its association with Victorian cultural insularity; Shaw in particular complained of the composer's "<a href="wikt%3Akid%20gloves">kid-glove</a> gentility, his conventional sentimentality, and his despicable oratorio-mongering". In the 1950s the scholar <a href="Wilfrid%20Mellers">Wilfrid Mellers</a> complained of Mendelssohn's "spurious religiosity which reflected the element of unconscious <a href="hypocrisy">humbug</a> in our morality". A contrasting opinion came from the pianist and composer <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a>, who considered Mendelssohn "a master of undisputed greatness" and "an heir of Mozart". Busoni, like earlier virtuosi such as Anton Rubinstein and Charles-Valentin Alkan, regularly included Mendelssohn's piano works in his recitals.

Appreciation of Mendelssohn's work has developed over the last 50 years, together with the publication of a number of biographies placing his achievements in context. Mercer-Taylor comments on the irony that "this broad-based reevaluation of Mendelssohn's music is made possible, in part, by a general disintegration of the idea of a musical canon", an idea which Mendelssohn "as a conductor, pianist and scholar" had done so much to establish. The critic <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a> concluded that, if Mendelssohn indeed missed true greatness, he missed it "by a hair".

Charles Rosen, in a chapter on Mendelssohn in his 1995 book "The Romantic Generation", both praises and criticizes the composer. He calls him "the greatest child prodigy the history of Western music has ever known", whose command at age 16 surpassed that of Mozart or Chopin at 19, the possessor at an early age of a "control of large-scale structure unsurpassed by any composer of his generation", and a "genius" with a "profound" comprehension of Beethoven. Rosen believes that in the composer's later years, without losing his craft or genius, he "renounced ... his daring"; but he calls Mendelssohn's relatively late Violin Concerto in E minor "the most successful synthesis of the Classical concerto tradition and the Romantic virtuoso form". Rosen considers the "Fugue in E minor" (later included in Mendelssohn's Op. 35 for piano) a "masterpiece"; but in the same paragraph calls Mendelssohn "the inventor of religious <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a> in music". Nevertheless, he points out how the dramatic power of "the juncture of religion and music" in Mendelssohn's oratorios is reflected throughout the music of the next fifty years in the operas of Meyerbeer and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a> and in Wagner's "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>".

A large portion of Mendelssohn's 750 works still remained unpublished in the 1960s, but most of them have now been made available. A scholarly edition of Mendelssohn's complete works and correspondence is in preparation but is expected to take many years to complete, and will be in excess of 150 volumes. This includes a modern and fully researched catalogue of his works, the <a href="Mendelssohn-Werkverzeichnis">Mendelssohn-Werkverzeichnis</a> (MWV). Mendelssohn's oeuvre has been explored more deeply. Recordings of virtually all of Mendelssohn's published works are now available, and his works are frequently heard in the concert hall and on broadcasts. R. Larry Todd noted in 2007, in the context of the impending bicentenary of Mendelssohn's birth, "the intensifying revival of the composer's music over the past few decades", and that "his image has been largely rehabilitated, as musicians and scholars have returned to this paradoxically familiar but unfamiliar European classical composer, and have begun viewing him from new perspectives."

Patrick Henry

Patrick Henry (May 29, 1736June 6, 1799) was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> attorney, planter, and orator best known for his declaration to the <a href="Second%20Virginia%20Convention">Second Virginia Convention</a> (1775): "<a href="Give%20me%20liberty%2C%20or%20give%20me%20death%21">Give me liberty, or give me death!</a>" A <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Father</a>, he served as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Virginia">first and sixth</a> post-colonial <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Governor of Virginia</a>, from 1776 to 1779 and from 1784 to 1786.

Henry was born in <a href="Hanover%20County%2C%20Virginia">Hanover County, Virginia</a>, and was for the most part educated at home. After an unsuccessful venture running a store, and assisting his father-in-law at <a href="Hanover%20Tavern">Hanover Tavern</a>, Henry became a lawyer through self-study. Beginning his practice in 1760, he soon became prominent through his victory in the <a href="Parson%27s%20Cause">Parson's Cause</a> against the Anglican clergy. Henry was elected to the Virginia <a href="House%20of%20Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a>, where he quickly became notable for his inflammatory rhetoric against the <a href="Stamp%20Act%20of%201765">Stamp Act of 1765</a>.

In 1774 and 1775, Henry served as a delegate to the <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a>es, but did not prove particularly influential. He gained further popularity among the people of Virginia, both through his oratory at the convention and by marching troops towards the colonial capital of <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a> after the <a href="Gunpowder%20Incident">Gunpowder Incident</a> until the munitions seized by the royal government were paid for. Henry urged independence, and when the <a href="Fifth%20Virginia%20Convention">Fifth Virginia Convention</a> endorsed this in 1776, served on the committee charged with drafting the <a href="Virginia%20Declaration%20of%20Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a> and the original <a href="Virginia%20Constitution">Virginia Constitution</a>. Henry was promptly elected governor under the new charter, and served a total of five one-year terms.

After leaving the governorship in 1779, Henry served in the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> until he began his last two terms as governor in 1784. The actions of the national government under the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> made Henry fear a strong federal government and he declined appointment as a delegate to the <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28United%20States%29">1787 Constitutional Convention</a>. He actively opposed the ratification of the Constitution, a fight which has marred his historical image. He returned to the practice of law in his final years, declining several offices under the federal government. A slaveholder throughout his adult life, he hoped to see the institution end, but had no plan for that beyond ending the importation of slaves. Henry is remembered for his oratory, and as an enthusiastic promoter of the fight for independence.

Henry was born on the family farm, <a href="Birthplace%20of%20Patrick%20Henry">Studley</a>, in <a href="Hanover%20County%2C%20Virginia">Hanover County</a> in the <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Colony of Virginia</a>, on May 29, 1736. His father was John Henry, an immigrant from <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>, Scotland, who had attended <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Aberdeen">King's College</a>, University of Aberdeen, there before emigrating to Virginia in the 1720s. Settling in Hanover County in about 1732, John Henry married Sarah Winston Syme, a wealthy widow from a prominent local family of English ancestry.

Patrick Henry shared his name with his uncle, an Anglican minister, and until the elder Patrick's death in 1777 often went as Patrick Henry Jr. Henry attended a local school until about the age of 10. There was then no academy in Hanover County, and he was tutored at home by his father. The young Henry engaged in the typical recreations of the times, such as music and dancing, and was particularly fond of hunting. Since the family's lands and slaves would for the most part pass to his older half-brother John Syme Jr., Henry needed to make his own way in the world. At the age of 15, he became a clerk for a local merchant, and a year later opened a store with his older brother William. The store was not successful.

The religious revival known as the <a href="Great%20Awakening">Great Awakening</a> reached Virginia when Henry was a child. His father was staunchly Anglican, but his mother often took him to hear Presbyterian preachers. Although Henry remained a lifelong Anglican communicant, ministers such as <a href="Samuel%20Davies%20%28clergyman%29">Samuel Davies</a> taught him that it is not enough to save one's own soul, but one should help to save society. He also learned that oratory should reach the heart, not just persuade based on reason. His oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers, seeking to reach the people by speaking to them in their own language.

Religion would play a key part in Henry's life; his father and namesake uncle were both devout and were both major influences in his life. Nevertheless, he was uncomfortable with the role of the Anglican Church as the established religion in Virginia, and fought for religious liberty throughout his career. Henry wrote to a group of Baptists who had sent a letter of congratulations following Henry's 1776 election as governor, "My earnest wish is, that Christian charity, forbearance and love may unite all different persuasions as brethren." He criticized his state of Virginia, feeling that slavery and lack of religious toleration had retarded its development. He told the <a href="Virginia%20Ratifying%20Convention">Virginia Ratifying Convention</a> in 1788, "That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men have an equal, natural and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, and that no particular religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference to others."
In 1754, Henry married Sarah Shelton, reportedly in the parlor of her family house, <a href="Rural%20Plains">Rural Plains</a>. (It also became known as Shelton House.) As a wedding gift, her father gave the couple six slaves and the <a href="Pine%20Slash">Pine Slash Farm</a> near <a href="Mechanicsville%2C%20Virginia">Mechanicsville</a>. Pine Slash was exhausted from earlier cultivations, and Henry worked with the slaves to clear fresh fields. The latter half of the 1750s were years of drought in Virginia, and after the main house burned down, Henry gave up and moved to the <a href="Hanover%20Tavern">Hanover Tavern</a>, owned by Sarah's father.

Henry often served as host at Hanover Tavern as part of his duties, and entertained the guests by playing the fiddle. Among those who stayed there during this time was the young <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, aged 17, en route to his studies at the <a href="College%20of%20William%20and%20Mary">College of William and Mary</a>, and who later wrote that he became well acquainted with Henry then, despite their age difference of six years. Jefferson in 1824 told <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, "Patrick Henry was originally a bar-keeper", a characterization that Henry's biographers have found to be unfair; that his position was more general than that, and that the main business of Hanover Tavern was serving travelers, not alcohol. <a href="William%20Wirt%20%28Attorney%20General%29">William Wirt</a>, Henry's earliest biographer, rejected Jefferson's suggestion that Henry's profession then was a bartender, but noted it would have been "very natural in Mr. Henry's situation" to do what was necessary to ensure that guests were properly seen to.

While at Hanover Tavern, Henry found time to study the law. How long he did so is unclear; he later stated that it was as little as a month. On the advice of a local lawyer, Henry in 1760 applied for a lawyer's license, appearing before the examiners—prominent attorneys in the colonial capital of <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a>. The examiners were impressed by Henry's mind even though his knowledge of legal procedures was scant. He passed in April 1760, and he thereafter opened a practice, appearing in the courts of Hanover and nearby counties.

The droughts of the 1750s had led to a rise in the price of tobacco. Hard currency was scarce in Virginia, and salaries in the colony were often expressed in terms of pounds of tobacco. Prior to the drought, the price of tobacco had long been twopence per pound (0.45 kilograms) and in 1755 and 1758, the Virginia <a href="House%20of%20Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a>, the elected lower house of the colonial legislature, passed <a href="Two%20Penny%20Act">Two Penny Act</a>s, allowing debts expressed in tobacco to be paid at the rate of twopence per pound for a limited period. These payees included public officials, including Anglican clergy—Anglicanism was then Virginia's <a href="established%20church">established church</a>, and several ministers petitioned the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> in London to overrule the Burgesses, which it did. Five clergymen then brought suit for back pay, cases known as the <a href="Parson%27s%20Cause">Parson's Cause</a>; of them, only the Reverend <a href="James%20Maury">James Maury</a> was successful, and a jury was to be empaneled in Hanover County on December 1, 1763 to fix damages. Henry was engaged as counsel by Maury's parish <a href="vestry">vestry</a> for this hearing. Patrick Henry's father, Colonel John Henry, was the presiding judge.
After the evidence was presented proving the facts at issue, Maury's counsel gave a speech in praise of the clergy, many of whom were in attendance. Henry responded with a one-hour speech, ignoring the question of damages, but which focused on the unconstitutionality of the veto of the Two Penny Act by the king's government. Henry deemed any king who annulled good laws, such as the Two Penny Act, as a "tyrant" who "forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience", and the clergy, by challenging an impartial law designed to bring economic relief, had shown themselves to be "enemies of the community". The opposing counsel accused Henry of treason, and some took up that cry, but Henry continued, and the judge did nothing to stop him. Henry urged the jury to make an example of Maury, for the benefit of any who might seek to imitate him, and suggested the jury return damages of <a href="History%20of%20the%20British%20farthing">one farthing</a>. The jury was out for only moments, and fixed damages at one penny. Henry was hailed as a hero. According to biographer Henry Mayer, Henry had "defined the prerogatives of the local elite by the unorthodox means of mobilizing the emotions of the lower ranks of religious and political outsiders." Henry's popularity greatly increased, and he added 164 new clients in the year after the Parson's Cause.

In the wake of the Parson's Cause, Henry began to gain a following in backwoods Virginia, because of his oratory defending the liberties of the common people, and thanks to his friendly manner. He boosted his standing further in 1764 by representing Nathaniel West Dandridge, elected for Hanover County, in an election contest before the Burgesses. Dandridge was alleged to have bribed voters with drink, a practice common but illegal. Henry is said to have made a brilliant speech in defense of the rights of voters, but the text does not survive. Henry lost the case, but met influential members on the Committee of Privileges and Elections, such as <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Lee">Richard Henry Lee</a>, <a href="Peyton%20Randolph">Peyton Randolph</a> and <a href="George%20Wythe">George Wythe</a>. In 1765, William Johnson, the brother of Thomas Johnson (who had been one of Henry's clients in the Parson's Cause), resigned as burgess for <a href="Louisa%20County%2C%20Virginia">Louisa County</a>. As Henry owned land in the county (acquired from his father to settle a loan), he was eligible to be a candidate, and he won the seat in May 1765. He left immediately for Williamsburg as the session had already begun.

The expense of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> (1756–1763) had nearly doubled Britain's national debt, and as much of the war had taken place in and around North America, the British government looked for ways of directly taxing the American colonies. The 1765 <a href="Stamp%20Act">Stamp Act</a> was both a means of raising revenue and one of asserting authority over the colonies. The Burgesses instructed their agent in London, Edward Montague, to oppose the measure, and other colonial legislatures similarly instructed their representatives. Considerable debate began over the proposed measure, and in Virginia pamphleteers developed arguments Henry had made in the Parson's Cause.

Patrick Henry was sworn into a sleepy session of the legislature on May 20; many of the members had left town. On about May 28, a ship arrived with an urgent letter from Montague: the Stamp Act had passed. On May 29, Henry introduced the <a href="Virginia%20Resolves">Virginia Stamp Act Resolves</a>. The first two resolutions affirmed that the colonists had the same rights and privileges as Britons; the next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one's representatives. The fifth was the most provocative, as it named the Virginia legislature, the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly,</a> as the representatives of Virginia empowered to tax. Two other resolutions were offered, though their authorship is uncertain. Edmund and Helen Morgan, in their account of the Stamp Act crisis, suggested that Henry acted as he saw the Stamp Act as both a threat to Virginians' rights, and an opportunity to advance himself politically.

There are no verbatim transcriptions of Henry's speech in opposition to the Stamp Act. Texts are reconstructions, for the most part based on recollections decades later by which time both the speech and Henry had become famous. For example, Jefferson, still in his studies at the nearby College of William and Mary, recalled the splendor of Henry's oratory. No attempt was made to reconstruct Henry's words until 1790, when <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> wrote to former burgess <a href="Edmund%20Pendleton">Edmund Pendleton</a>, but Madison learned that Pendleton had not been present; a second attempt did not occur until Wirt began work on his biography of Henry in 1805. A French traveler, whose name is not known, and whose journal was discovered in 1921, recorded at the time of Henry's speech that "one of the members stood up and said that he had read that in former times <a href="Tarquin%20the%20Elder">Tarquin</a> and <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius</a> had their <a href="Brutus">Brutus</a>, <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles</a> had his <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Cromwell</a>, and he did not doubt but some good American would stand up, in favour of his country". As Henry had seemingly called for the killing of <a href="King%20George%20III">King George III</a>, there were cries of "Treason!" in the chamber, including by the Speaker, <a href="John%20Robinson%20%28Virginia%29">John Robinson</a>. <a href="John%20Tyler%20Sr.">John Tyler Sr.</a> (father of the future president), who was standing with Jefferson as they watched the session, called this one of "the trying moments which is decisive of character", and both recalled that Henry did not waver: "If this be treason, make the most of it!".

The Burgesses adopted the first five resolutions—the two others, which denied the right of any other body but the General Assembly to tax Virginians, and which branded anyone who stated that Parliament had that right an enemy of the colony, were not passed. According to the Morgans, the passed resolutions differed little from language in petitions sent by the Burgesses to London in 1764, and the opposition to Henry may have been in part because he was an upstart in Virginia politics. On May 31, with Henry absent and likely returning home, the Burgesses expunged the fifth resolution, and the Royal Governor, <a href="Francis%20Fauquier">Francis Fauquier</a>, refused to allow any of them to be printed in the official newspaper, the "<a href="The%20Virginia%20Gazette%23Historical%20papers">Virginia Gazette</a>". With the official texts of the passed resolutions denied them, newspapers in the colonies and in Britain printed all seven resolutions, all of them presented as the resolves of the influential Colony of Virginia. The resolutions, more radical as a group than what was actually passed, reached Britain by mid-August, the first American reaction to the passage of the Stamp Act. In North America, they galvanized opposition to the Stamp Act, and made Virginia the leader in opposition to Parliament's action. According to Thad Tate in Henry's "American National Biography" article, "Not only in Virginia but across the mainland British colonies, Henry quickly established his reputation as an uncompromising opponent of imperial policy." The Morgans noted, "In Virginia the Stamp Act provided the opportunity for Patrick Henry's spectacular entry into politics".

Fauquier dissolved the Burgesses on June 1, 1765, hoping new elections would purge the radicals, but this proved not to be the case, as conservative leaders were instead voted out. The governor did not call the Burgesses into session until November 1766, by which time the Stamp Act had been repealed by Parliament, preventing Virginia from sending delegates to the <a href="Stamp%20Act%20Congress">Stamp Act Congress</a> in New York. Henry's role in the active resistance that took place in Virginia against the Stamp Act is uncertain. Although the lack of a legislative session sidelined Henry during the crisis, it also undermined the established leaders of the chamber, who remained scattered through the colony with little opportunity to confer, as the public rage for change grew hotter.

When the Burgesses eventually convened, Henry sometimes opposed the colonial leaders, but united with them against British policies. In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Henry spent more time concentrating on his personal affairs, though he advanced in standing within the Burgesses, serving on powerful committees. The Henry family moved to a new house on his Louisa County property, probably in late 1765, and lived there until 1769, when he returned to Hanover County. His law practice remained strong until the courts under royal authority closed in 1774. Jefferson later complained that Henry was lazy and ignorant in the practice of the law, his sole talent trying cases before juries, and accused Henry of charging criminal defendants high fees to get them acquitted. Norine Dickson Campbell, in her biography of Henry, found Jefferson's comments unfounded; that Henry's rates were moderate for the time, and cited earlier historians as to Henry's competence. Jefferson's comments came years after the two, once friends, quarreled. In 1769, Henry was admitted to practice before the <a href="General%20Court%20of%20Virginia">General Court of Virginia</a> in Williamsburg, a venue more prestigious than the county courts.

Henry invested some of his earnings in frontier lands, in what is now the western part of Virginia, as well as in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. He claimed ownership though many of them were controlled by the Native Americans, and sought to get the colonial (and, later, state) government to recognize his claims. This was common among Virginia's leading citizens, such as <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. Henry foresaw the potential of the <a href="Ohio%20Valley">Ohio Valley</a> and was involved in schemes to found settlements. Income from land deals in 1771 enabled him to buy <a href="Scotchtown%20%28plantation%29">Scotchtown</a>, a large plantation in Hanover County, which he purchased from John Payne, the father of <a href="Dolley%20Madison">Dolley Madison</a>—she lived there for a brief time as a child. Scotchtown, with 16 rooms, was one of the largest mansions in Virginia.

Owning estates such as Henry's meant owning slaves; Henry was a slaveholder from the time of his marriage at the age of 18. Despite this, Henry believed that slavery was wrong, and hoped for its abolition, but had no plan for doing so, nor for the multiracial society that would result, for he did not believe schemes to settle freed slaves in Africa were realistic, "to re-export them is now impracticable, and sorry I am for it." He wrote in 1773, "I am the master of slaves of my own purchase. I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without them. I will not, I cannot justify it." But the number of slaves he owned increased over time, and as a result of his second marriage in 1777, so that at his death in 1799, he owned 67 slaves. Henry and others sought to end their importation to Virginia, and succeeded in 1778. They assumed that in so doing, they were fighting slavery, but in the generation after independence, slave births greatly exceeded deaths, and Virginia became a source of slaves sold south in the <a href="coastwise%20slave%20trade">coastwise slave trade</a>.

In 1773, Henry came into conflict with the royal governor, <a href="John%20Murray%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Dunmore">John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore</a>. The governor, appointed in 1771, had sent British soldiers to <a href="Pittsylvania%20County%2C%20Virginia">Pittsylvania County</a> to aid in apprehending a gang of counterfeiters. Once captured, they were immediately taken to Williamsburg for trial before the General Court, ignoring precedent that judicial proceedings should begin in the county where the offense took place, or where the suspect was captured. This was a sensitive matter especially because of the recent <a href="Gaspee%20affair">"Gaspee" affair</a> in Rhode Island, in which the British sought to capture and transport overseas for trial those who had burned a British ship. The Burgesses wanted to rebuke Dunmore for his actions, and Henry was part of a committee of eight members, that drafted a resolution thanking the governor for the capture of the gang, but affirming that using the "usual mode" of criminal procedure protected both the guilty and the innocent. They also penned a plan, adopted by the Burgesses, for <a href="Committees%20of%20correspondence">a committee of correspondence</a> to communicate with leaders in other colonies, to inform and coordinate with each other. The members included Henry.

Although Henry had by this time come to believe that conflict with Great Britain, and independence, was inevitable, he had no strategy for advancing this. The Burgesses were sitting when in 1774, word came that Parliament had voted to <a href="Boston%20Port%20Act">close the port of Boston</a> in retaliation for the <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">Boston Tea Party</a>, and several burgesses, including Henry, convened at the <a href="Raleigh%20Tavern">Raleigh Tavern</a> to formulate a response. According to <a href="George%20Mason">George Mason</a>, a former burgess from <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax County</a>, who joined the committee in the work, Henry took the lead. Mason and Henry would form a close political relationship that would last until Mason's death in 1792. The resolution that Henry's committee produced set June 1, 1774, the date upon which the Port of Boston was to be closed, as a day of fasting and prayer. It passed the Burgesses, but Dunmore dissolved the body. Undeterred, the former legislators met at the Raleigh Tavern, and reconstituted themselves as <a href="First%20Virginia%20Convention">a convention</a>, to meet again in August, after there was time for county meetings to show local sentiment. They also called for a boycott of tea and other products.

The five <a href="Virginia%20Conventions">Virginia Conventions</a> (1774–1776) would guide the <a href="Colony%20of%20Virginia">Old Dominion</a> to independence as royal authority came to an end. Their work was advanced by many resolutions of county meetings, denying the authority of Parliament over the colonies, and calling for a boycott of imports. The first convention met in Williamsburg in the chamber of the Burgesses beginning on August 1; Dunmore was absent from the capital <a href="Lord%20Dunmore%27s%20War">fighting the Native Americans</a> and could not interfere. Divided between those who wanted separation from Britain and those who still hoped for some accommodation, it met for a week; one major decision was the election of delegates to <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">a Continental Congress</a> in Philadelphia. Henry was chosen as one of seven delegates, tying for second place with Washington, burgess for Fairfax County, both receiving three votes less than Randolph.
As Washington's estate, <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>, lay on the way from Scotchtown to Philadelphia, he invited Henry to stop there and to ride to Philadelphia with him, and Henry did, also accompanied by Pendleton, another Virginia delegate to the Congress and a political rival of Henry's. Delegates and prominent Philadelphians took an intense interest in the Virginians, who had taken the lead in resistance to Britain, but whom few in the other colonies had met. This was Henry's first stay in the North, excepting a brief business trip to New York in 1770 but he found that his actions were well known. The sessions began on September 5, 1774, at <a href="Carpenter%27s%20Hall">Carpenter's Hall</a>. <a href="Silas%20Deane">Silas Deane</a> of Connecticut described Henry as "the compleatest speaker I ever heard ... but in a Letter I can give You no Idea of the Music of his Voice, or the highwrought, yet Natural elegance of his Stile, or Manner". The secretary of the Congress, <a href="Charles%20Thomson">Charles Thomson</a>, wrote that when Henry rose, he had expected little from a man dressed as plainly as a rural minister. "But as he proceeded, [he] evinced such [an] unusual force of argument, and such novel and impassioned eloquence as soon electrified the whole house. Then the excited inquiry passed from man to man ... 'Who is it? Who is it?' The answer from the few who knew him was, it is "Patrick Henry"."

Henry was involved in the first dispute within the Congress, on whether each colony should have an equal vote, taking the position that there should be proportionate representation, with the larger colonies to have a greater voice. He argued that colonial borders must be swept away in the need for Americans to unify and create a government to fill the void left with the end of British authority, "Fleets and armies and the present state of things shew that Government is dissolved. Where are your landmarks? your boundaries of colonies? The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American." Henry lost the argument, and his theatrics made Congress's leaders afraid he would be unpredictable if placed on the lead committee, that charged with composing a statement regarding colonial rights. Instead, he was put on the next most important committee, one inquiring into commercial regulation. In the end, though, neither committee produced much of importance. Henry believed the purpose of the Congress should be to mobilize public opinion towards war. In this, he found common cause with <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a> of Massachusetts, but not all were of that opinion. According to Tate, Henry "turned out not to be an especially influential member of the body". The Congress decided on a petition to the King; Henry prepared two drafts but neither proved satisfactory. When Congress on October 26 approved a draft prepared by <a href="John%20Dickinson">John Dickinson</a> of Pennsylvania, who had consulted with Henry and also Richard Henry Lee, Henry had already departed for home, and Lee signed on his behalf. The petition was rejected in London.

After the birth of their sixth child in 1771, Patrick's wife <a href="Sarah%20Shelton%20Henry">Sarah Shelton Henry</a> began to exhibit symptoms of mental illness, and one reason for the move from Louisa County to Scotchtown was so they could be near family members. Henry's biographer, <a href="Jon%20Kukla">Jon Kukla</a> believed her to be the victim of <a href="postpartum%20psychosis">postpartum psychosis</a>, for which there was then no treatment. At times, she was restrained in a form of <a href="straitjacket">straitjacket</a>. Although Virginia had opened the first public mental facility in North America in 1773, Henry decided that she was better off at Scotchtown, and prepared a large apartment for her there. She died in 1775, after which Henry avoided all objects that reminded him of her, and sold Scotchtown in 1777.

Hanover County elected Henry as a delegate to the <a href="Second%20Virginia%20Convention">Second Virginia Convention</a>, which convened at <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Richmond%2C%20Virginia%29">St. John's Episcopal Church</a> in the town of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> on March 20, 1775. Richmond was selected as better protected from royal authority. The convention debated whether Virginia should adopt language from a petition by the planters of the <a href="Colony%20of%20Jamaica">Colony of Jamaica</a>. This document contained complaints about British actions, but admitted the King could veto colonial legislation, and it urged reconciliation. Henry offered amendments to raise a militia independent of royal authority in terms that recognized that conflict with Britain was inevitable, sparking the opposition of moderates. He defended his amendments, concluding with the statement he is well known for:

As he concluded, Henry plunged an ivory letter opener towards his chest in imitation of the Roman patriot <a href="Cato%20the%20Younger">Cato the Younger</a>. Henry's speech carried the day, and the convention adopted his amendments. Still, they passed only narrowly, as many delegates were uncertain where the resistance urged by Henry and other radicals would lead, and few counties formed independent militia companies at the urging of the convention.

The text of Henry's speech first appeared in print in Wirt's 1817 biography, published 18 years after Patrick Henry's death. Wirt corresponded with men who had heard the speech and others who were acquainted with people who were there at the time. All agreed that the speech had produced a profound effect, but it seems that only one person attempted to render an actual text. Judge <a href="St.%20George%20Tucker">St. George Tucker</a>, who had been present for the speech, gave Wirt his recollections and Wirt wrote back stating that "I have taken almost entirely Mr. Henry's speech in the Convention of '75 from you, as well as your description of its effect on your verbatim." The original letter with Tucker's remembrances has been lost.

For 160 years Wirt's account was taken at face value. In the 1970s, historians began to question the authenticity of Wirt's reconstruction. Contemporary historians observe that Henry was known to have used fear of Indian and slave revolts in promoting military action against the British and that, according to the only written first-hand account of the speech, Henry used some graphic name-calling that Wirt did not include in his heroic rendition. Tucker's account was based upon recollections and not notes several decades after the speech; he wrote, "In vain should I attempt to give any idea of his speech". Scholars have argued to what extent the speech we know is the work of Wirt or Tucker.

On April 21, 1775, Governor Dunmore had the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> under his command <a href="Gunpowder%20Incident">seize gunpowder from the magazine</a> in Williamsburg and take it to a naval ship. The gunpowder belonged to the government, to be issued in case of need, such as a slave uprising. Dunmore's actions outraged many Virginians. Henry had departed for Philadelphia, having been elected a delegate to the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a>, but a messenger caught up with him before he left Hanover County, and he returned to take command of the local militia. Seeking the restoration of the powder, or that the colonists be compensated for it, on May 2, Henry led his troops towards Williamsburg with, as Dunmore wrote, "all the Appearances of actual War". By this time, word of the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> had arrived, and many Virginians believed that war with Britain had begun. With his troops reinforced by eager volunteers from nearby counties, Henry likely had force enough to take Williamsburg and deal Dunmore a humiliating defeat, but increasingly prominent messengers urging caution slowed his advance, and in <a href="New%20Kent%20County%2C%20Virginia">New Kent County</a>, still some from Williamsburg, three of Henry's fellow delegates to Congress helped persuade him to leave off his march. As Henry insisted the colonists be compensated, a member of the Governor's Council agreed to pay the value of the powder by <a href="bill%20of%20exchange">bill of exchange</a>.

Although Dunmore issued a proclamation against "a certain "Patrick Henry", of the County of "Hanover", and a Number of his deluded Followers", 15 county committees quickly approved Henry's action, and when he finally departed for Philadelphia, he was escorted to the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac</a> by militia who lined the shore, cheering, as his ferry pulled away. Not all approved; Henry's march appalled some moderates, who feared he might provoke a conflict in which Virginia stood alone against Britain's might. They also saw him as a threat to the sanctity of property, for anyone's might be taken by Henry and his troops. As popular support for independence grew, opponents either joined in the movement, or decided it was wiser to remain silent.

Henry belatedly arrived at the Congress on May 18, 1775. Jefferson later stated that Henry played only a supporting role, and though there is not a complete record, the fact that he was not written of as having an impact appears to confirm that. The Congress appointed Washington as head of American forces, an appointment that Henry supported. At the end of the session, in August, Henry left Philadelphia for Virginia and would never again hold office outside its borders.

While Henry was returning, the <a href="Third%20Virginia%20Convention">Third Virginia Convention</a> in August commissioned him as colonel of the <a href="1st%20Virginia%20Regiment">1st Virginia Regiment</a>, and he took up the appointment later that month. Although Henry had little military experience, this was not considered a major drawback at the time, and he was held to have distinguished himself in the march on Williamsburg. General Washington, though, felt that the convention had "made a Capital mistake when they took Henry out of the Senate to place him in the Field". In September, Virginia's <a href="Committees%20of%20safety%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Committee of Safety</a> placed Henry in charge of all of Virginia's forces. Despite the high title, Henry was placed under tight civilian control, and to an extent the willingness of moderates to go along with the appointment reflected a view that in that position, the volatile Henry would be contained.

Henry moved to organize his regiment, and had no difficulty recruiting men. As commander, he organized <a href="Virginia%20State%20Navy%23American%20Revolutionary%20War">a navy</a>. In November 1775, Dunmore, who though he had abandoned Williamsburg still held Norfolk, issued a proclamation offering freedom to any black slave or <a href="indentured%20servant">indentured servant</a> willing and able to serve in his forces, which already included several hundred former slaves. Henry wrote to all <a href="Virginia%20militia%2317th%20century">county lieutenants</a>, stating that the proclamation "is fatal to the publick Safety" and urging an "unremitting Attention to the Government of the SLAVES may, I hope, counteract this dangerous Attempt. Constant, and well directed Patrols, seem indispensably necessary."

Henry saw no action himself, and there were murmurs in the convention against his command; some feared he was too radical to be an effective military leader. In February 1776, Virginia's forces were reorganized as they were placed under Continental command. Henry was to retain his rank of colonel, but was placed under a former subordinate. Henry refused, and left the army; his troops were outraged by the slight to him, and considered leaving service, but he calmed the situation.

Henry did not sit in the <a href="Fourth%20Virginia%20Convention">Fourth Virginia Convention</a> which met in December 1775, as he was ineligible because of his military commission. Once he was again a civilian, the freeholders of Hanover County in April 1776 elected him to the <a href="Fifth%20Virginia%20Convention">fifth convention</a>, to meet the following month. Most delegates were for independence, but were divided on how to declare it, and over timing. Henry introduced a resolution declaring Virginia independent and urging the Congress to declare all the colonies free. When he at last spoke, according to clergyman <a href="Edmund%20Randolph">Edmund Randolph</a>, Henry "appeared in an element for which he was born. To cut the knot, which calm prudence was puzzled to untie, was worthy of the magnificence of his genius. He entered into no subtlety of reasoning but was roused by the now apparent spirit of the people as a pillar of fire, which notwithstanding the darkness of the prospect would conduct to the promised land." The eventual resolution was based in large part on Henry's, and passed unanimously on May 15, 1776. As well as declaring Virginia independent, the resolution instructed the state's delegates in Congress to press for American independence, which they would, with Lee introducing the motion, and Jefferson penning <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">the Declaration</a>.

The convention then proceeded to consider a constitution for Virginia's government. Henry was appointed to a committee under the leadership of <a href="Archibald%20Cary">Archibald Cary</a>. Much of the work fell to the final appointee to the committee, George Mason of Fairfax County, who did not arrive in Williamsburg until May 18, delayed by illness. Mason first drafted a <a href="Virginia%20Declaration%20of%20Rights">Declaration of Rights</a>; it was discussed in the Cary Committee on May 25. Mason's draft, more than the final declaration, would be highly influential, used by Jefferson in writing the Declaration of Independence, and by writers of many 18th and 19th century state constitutions. When the draft was debated, Henry, at the request of a young delegate from <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20Virginia">Orange County</a>, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, produced an amendment changing Mason's call for religious tolerance to one requiring full <a href="freedom%20of%20worship">freedom of worship</a>. This was seen as a threat to Virginia's established religion, Anglicanism, and did not pass. Madison reworked it and had another delegate introduce it, likely Edmund Randolph, and it passed. Mason's draft called for a ban on <a href="bills%20of%20attainder">bills of attainder</a>. Henry got it removed by telling the delegates that some high offender might be reached by no other means. The convention approved the Declaration of Rights on June 12.

Virginia's form of government, to be placed in its constitution, was a concern not only within its borders; Jefferson, in Philadelphia though he would have preferred to be in Williamsburg, sent a plan, and John Adams sent Henry a pamphlet containing his own views, to which Henry replied, "your sentiments are precisely the same I have long since taken up, and they come recommended by you". But it was Mason's plan for the government of Virginia which dominated, with much power given to the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a>, the lower house of the legislature. The House of Delegates and the <a href="Senate%20of%20Virginia">Senate of Virginia</a> together formed the General Assembly, as the Virginia legislature is known. Under the 1776 constitution, the governor, elected by the two houses of the legislature, was not even given the power to veto legislation, and was required to act with the approval of the <a href="Governor%27s%20Council">Governor's Council</a> on important matters. Henry opposed the weakness of the governor, feeling it was risky at a time of war to have the executive so weak, but his views did not prevail. He had reason to rue the office's lack of power, as on June 29, 1776, the convention elected him as Virginia's first post-independence governor, by 60 votes to 45 for <a href="Thomas%20Nelson%20Jr.">Thomas Nelson Jr.</a> The election of Henry, at that time Virginia's most popular politician, helped assure acceptance of the new authorities, but also placed him in a figurehead position, removed from the true power in the new government, the House of Delegates.

Henry was taken ill almost immediately upon being sworn in as governor on July 5, and recuperated at Scotchtown. He returned to Williamsburg in September, and corresponded with General Washington about the military situation. Washington, who was less effective because of the inadequacies of his troops, complained about the state militias, feeling a <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> committed for the duration of the war was needed. Henry helped recruit new troops for Washington, but his efforts were hampered by several issues, including the weakness of Henry's office. In December 1776, with the General Assembly alarmed at reports Washington's army was in retreat as the British occupied Philadelphia, legislators granted Henry temporary expanded powers, something that Jefferson was still unhappy about years later, feeling that Henry was trying to set himself up as dictator. In March 1777, Henry wrote to Washington seeking permission to recruit soldiers for terms of up to eight months. Washington's anger in his response that such troops were not useful caused Henry to drop the matter, stating that he deferred to Washington's experience in military matters. Recruiting remained a problem; many Virginians were willing to be members of the county militia, but did not want to join the Continental Army lest they be sent out of state or exposed to disease. Desertion was also a problem Henry labored to solve with limited success; many Virginians hand been induced to enlist with promises they would not be sent outside the state or local area, and left when orders came to march.

Henry was elected to a second one-year term without opposition, and took the oath on July 2, 1777. On October 9 at Scotchtown, he married Dorothea Dandridge, daughter of his old client, Nathaniel West Dandridge of Hanover County. This made him closer kin to Washington, as Nathaniel Dandridge was <a href="Martha%20Washington">Martha Washington</a>'s uncle. To add to the six children he had by Sarah Henry, he would have eleven more by Dorothea, though two by the second marriage died very young. She brought 12 slaves with her, adding to the 30 Patrick Henry already had. He sold Scotchtown in 1777, and moved to <a href="Leatherwood%20Plantation">Leatherwood Plantation</a> in <a href="Henry%20County%2C%20Virginia">Henry County</a>, which the General Assembly had just created and named for him.

When Washington and his troops encamped <a href="Valley%20Forge%20National%20Historical%20Park">at Valley Forge</a> in the winter of 1777–1778, Henry arranged for livestock and other food to be sent to their relief. There was discontent against Washington, who was not seen by some as a successful general, and this resulted in the so-called <a href="Conway%20Cabal">Conway Cabal</a>. Henry supported Washington when Dr. <a href="Benjamin%20Rush">Benjamin Rush</a> of Philadelphia, one of those unenthusiastic about Washington, sent the governor an unsigned letter, discussing machinations against the general. Henry immediately sent Washington the letter, and though it is uncertain if Henry recognized Rush's handwriting, Washington did, tipping him off to the conspiracy. President Washington wrote of Henry in 1794, "I have always respected and esteemed him; nay more, I have conceived myself under obligation to him for the friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in the close of the year 1777 with a view to embark him in the opposition that was forming against me at that time".

In an effort to secure Virginia's vast claims in the West (to the Mississippi River, and north to present-day Minnesota) against British and Native American forces, Henry in December 1777 sent <a href="George%20Rogers%20Clark">George Rogers Clark</a> on an expedition against <a href="Kaskaskia%2C%20Illinois">Kaskaskia</a>, site of a British and French settlement. This part of Clark's mission was secret; his public orders merely stated he was to raise a militia and go to Kentucky (then part of Virginia). Clark captured Kaskaskia in July 1778, and remained north of the Ohio River for the remainder of Henry's governorship. Although the expedition did not turn out as well as hoped, Henry trumpeted its successes, but after he left the governorship in 1779 and was elected to the House of Delegates, he became a foe of Clark.
Henry was elected to a third term on May 29, 1778, again without opposition. Thomas Jefferson led the committee of notables sent to inform him of his election. In December 1778, Henry sent an urgent appeal to Congress for naval aid in protecting <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. None was forthcoming, and on May 8, 1779, in the final days of Henry's governorship, British ships under Sir <a href="George%20Collier">George Collier</a> entered the bay, landed troops, and took <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Virginia">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="Suffolk%2C%20Virginia">Suffolk</a>, destroying valuable supplies. The British departed on May 24, and Henry, limited to three consecutive terms in office by the 1776 constitution, left office soon after, succeeded by Jefferson, and with his family returned to Leatherwood.

At Leatherwood, Henry devoted himself to local affairs in the thinly-populated county, and was given seats on the county court (the local governing body), as prominent landowners were, and on the parish vestry. He refused to be elected a delegate to Congress, stating that his personal business and past illness made that impossible. When Governor Jefferson sent a note to him in early 1780, Henry replied with gratitude, complaining of his isolation, and wrote of his many concerns about the state of affairs, as the war continued. The freeholders of Henry County soon thereafter sent its <a href="eponym">eponym</a> to the House of Delegates. But within weeks, health problems recurred, causing his return to Leatherwood. While in Richmond (where the capital had been moved) Henry opposed a congressional plan to revalue <a href="Continental%20currency">Continental currency</a> and impose certain taxes, feeling it would mostly benefit the North. He was successful in defeating it, but after he left Richmond, supporters got the legislature to pass it. Once he returned home, he was heavily involved in efforts to recruit local volunteers to suppress bands of <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a> who were conducting raids in the frontier area. Henry rode with the troops, though he did not lead them, and they were generally successful in suppressing the resistance. The volunteers were disbanded in September 1780.

Richmond had been made the capital since it was believed to be less exposed to attack than Williamsburg, but in January 1781, British forces under the renegade former American general, <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, sailed up the <a href="James%20River">James River</a> and captured Richmond with little opposition as Henry joined the other legislators and Governor Jefferson in fleeing to <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville</a>. Although Arnold soon withdrew to Portsmouth, in February, troops under <a href="Lord%20Cornwallis">Lord Cornwallis</a> entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had for the most part been fought out of state, would have many of its final moves played in Virginia. With Washington's army near New York, Henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend the state, and in March helped draft an angry remonstrance from the House of Delegates to Congress, demanding help. Nevertheless, in May, British forces under Colonel <a href="Banastre%20Tarleton">Banastre Tarleton</a> raided Charlottesville, nearly capturing the Virginia government, which fled to <a href="Staunton%2C%20Virginia">Staunton</a>. There is a story that Henry fled with other prominent leaders, and sought refuge at the home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing Charlottesville. But on learning Henry was with the group, she decided it must be all right, and offered them the best she had.

Jefferson did not go to Staunton: his term as governor had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in <a href="Bedford%20County%2C%20Virginia">Bedford County</a>, and Virginia had no governor for ten days. Several legislators complained of Jefferson's actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature thought better of it. Jefferson was angered at Henry's actions, and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry's death in 1799.

With the war effectively ended by the American victory at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Siege of Yorktown</a>, Henry served as delegate from his county through 1784, when he was elected again as governor. Peace brought many adjustments, and Henry sponsored legislation to reform Virginia's currency and to adjust payments from contracts still outstanding from before periods of high inflation. Jefferson and others wanted to reopen contracts that had been already settled, but in depreciated currency; Henry thought that unjust, and because of his influence in the General Assembly, his version prevailed. This had international implications, as some of the creditors were British, who sought payment in hard money rather than the depreciated currency that had been paid into escrow. At the May 1783 House of Delegates session, Henry successfully sponsored a resolution to repeal the trade embargo against Britain. That passed despite opposition from John Tyler Sr., the Speaker. Henry also introduced legislation to permit Loyalists to return to Virginia. There was considerable opposition to that, and the measure was held over until later in the year, by which time public sentiment had been gauged through meetings in each county. Henry spoke in the debate, asking "shall we, who have laid the proud British lion at our feet, be frightened of its whelps?" Once it was amended (though in what way is not clear), the bill passed in November 1783.

Henry worked together with James Madison, a delegate after three years in Congress, on a number of issues. They differed, though, on state support for Virginia's Protestant churches. Madison, like Jefferson, desired a separation between church and state that meant no public financing of religion, but Henry believed that taxpayers who were Christians should be assessed for the maintenance of the Protestant church of their choice, financing an array of churches in the way that Anglicanism had been funded in Virginia until the start of the war. Henry was not alone in this belief; both Washington and Lee supported such plans. According to Thomas S. Kidd in his biography of Henry, "the general assessment plan is one of the main reasons Henry is not more widely esteemed as a Founder, for in this debate, he seems to have diverted from the progressive flow of history." The General Assembly might well have passed the bill, but on November 17, 1784, the legislators elected Henry as governor. Madison believed that Henry took the position for family reasons—his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in Richmond rather than in remote Henry County—but the cost was Henry's bill as Madison got it postponed to the following year and eventually defeated. Instead, Madison got Jefferson's <a href="Virginia%20Statute%20for%20Religious%20Freedom">Statute for Religious Freedom</a> through the legislature. This law requiring a separation of church and state passed the General Assembly in 1786.

Henry's second time as governor was for two years, as the legislature re-elected him in 1785. It was, generally, more placid than his first. During this time, Henry and his family lived at "Salisbury", in <a href="Chesterfield%20County%2C%20Virginia">Chesterfield County</a>, about from Richmond in open country that he rented, though he had an official residence close to the <a href="Virginia%20Capitol">Virginia Capitol</a>, which was then under construction. The General Assembly had passed legislation for new arms for the militia, and Henry worked with <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Lafayette</a> to have them sent from France.

Each county's militia was under firm local control, a state of affairs that had resulted in problems during the war as local militia refused orders from Henry and other governors when asked to serve out of state or conscript recruits into the Continental Army. In 1784, seeking to bring the militias under central control, the General Assembly passed an act terminating all militia officer commissions, and allowing Henry, with the consent of the Governor's Council, to appoint replacements. The Virginia Constitution required that there be a recommendation from the county court. Instead of asking the county court, Henry solicited recommendations from prominent citizens in each county whom he or his council members knew. The result was near-revolt in the counties, as citizens protested the act as unconstitutional, and counties refused to obey. The law went widely unenforced, and in October 1785, Henry requested the legislators to repeal it; they complied the following year.

Residents of western North Carolina, what is today the state of Tennessee, sought to separate and become the <a href="State%20of%20Franklin">State of Franklin</a>. A former delegate, <a href="Arthur%20Campbell%20%28Virginia%29">Arthur Campbell</a>, wanted to join Virginia's adjacent <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Virginia">Washington County</a> as part of the scheme in 1785. Henry had Campbell removed as a militia officer and from his other county offices, as well as ousting Campbell's supporters, replacing them with residents of known loyalty. Although Henry urged leniency in his report to the General Assembly that October, stating that the Washington County separatists had been led astray by anxiety because of the poor economy, he had the legislature pass a Treason Act forbidding the setting-up of a rival government within Virginia territory.

Henry also sought to advance Virginia's development, both as governor and through his personal investments. He backed schemes to open navigation on the upper Potomac and James rivers, envisioning canals to connect them to the <a href="Ohio%20River%20Valley">Ohio River Valley</a>. He also supported a scheme to have a canal across the <a href="Great%20Dismal%20Swamp">Great Dismal Swamp</a>, believing that with it, the trade of Eastern North Carolina would flow through <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a>. He owned land along the proposed route, and sought to interest General Washington in the scheme, but was not successful. Despite Henry's support for internal improvements, he failed to notify Virgnia's representatives of their appointment to meet with Maryland over navigation on the Potomac, and only two, including George Mason, attended what became known as the <a href="Mount%20Vernon%20Conference">Mount Vernon Conference</a> (1785). Edmund Randolph, unable to attend because of lack of timely notification, hinted that the reason for Henry's neglect was not forgetfulness, but a growing hostility towards things federal. In 1786, Henry was more assiduous in notifying delegates to the <a href="Annapolis%20Conference">Annapolis Conference</a> called with the support of Madison, who was appointed a delegate. Henry stepped down at the end of his fifth term, stating he needed to devote time to his family and earn money to support it.

Disinclined to return to distant Leatherwood after his time as governor ended in November 1786, Henry hoped to purchase land in Hanover County but bought property in <a href="Prince%20Edward%20County%2C%20Virginia">Prince Edward County</a> instead. <a href="Hampden-Sydney%20College">Hampden-Sydney College</a>, which he had helped found in 1775, is located in that county, and Henry enrolled his sons there. The local freeholders elected Henry to the House of Delegates in early 1787, and he would serve there until the end of 1790. The new governor, Randolph, offered to make Henry a delegate to the <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Convention</a>, scheduled to meet in Philadelphia later that year to consider changes to the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>, the document that had governed the loose union among the states since 1777. Henry refused the appointment, alleging it would be difficult financially. One legend is that when Henry was asked why he had not gone, he replied, "I smelt a rat."

Henry's record of urging unity made him a potential supporter of a closer bond between the states, and as late as the end of 1786, Madison hoped for Henry as an ally in the fight. Several factors had eroded Henry's trust in the Northern states, including what he deemed Congress's failure to send adequate troops to protect Virginia settlers in the Ohio River Valley. Henry was outraged by the <a href="Jay%E2%80%93Gardoqui%20Treaty">Jay–Gardoqui Treaty</a>, which would have ceded exclusive navigation on the Mississippi River to Spain for 25 years. This was in exchange for commercial concessions that would benefit New England, where there was a growing separatist movement. Northern votes were sufficient to relax <a href="John%20Jay">John Jay</a>'s negotiating instructions, which had originally forbidden restricting American navigation on the Mississippi, to allow him to reach a deal; Southern votes were sufficient to block the treaty's ratification. These events caused Henry and some other Virginia leaders to feel betrayed, and to have little trust in the good faith of the North.

When the Philadelphia convention adjourned in September 1787, its president, Washington, returned home and immediately sent a copy of the new <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">Constitution</a> to Henry, recommending he support it. Henry was in Richmond for the autumn legislative session as delegate for Prince Edward County. While thanking Washington for presiding in Philadelphia and for sending the document, he said of it, "I have to lament that I cannot bring my Mind to accord with the proposed Constitution. The Concern I feel on this account is really greater than I am able to express." He hinted, though, that he was still open to changing his mind. This allowed Henry to remain noncommittal as opponents of the Constitution, such as Mason and Edmund Randolph (both delegates at Philadelphia) published their opinions, and to refine his views. In the initial Virginia battle over the Constitution, the call for a convention to decide whether the state should ratify it, Henry and Mason were among those who supported allowing the convention to ratify it conditional on amendments being made. The matter was compromised with language allowing the convention's members full rein in deciding what to do, and it was set for June 1788, with elections in March; both those who supported it and those who did not felt time would be to their advantage.

Henry was elected to the convention from Prince Edward County without difficulty, though <a href="John%20Blair%20Smith">John Blair Smith</a>, president of Hampden-Sydney, caused him some annoyance by having students read at an assembly, in Henry's presence, a speech by Henry and Smith's own rebuttal. Henry opposed the Constitution because of its grant of a strong executive, the president; he had not fought to free Virginia from King George to surrender such powers to what might prove a despot. Henry accordingly deemed the Constitution a backwards step, and a betrayal of those who had died in the Revolutionary cause. At the <a href="Virginia%20Ratifying%20Convention">Virginia Ratifying Convention</a>, which began on June 2, 1788, according to Kidd, Henry's "personality blazed in all its power and glory." Henry suggested that the framers of the Constituition had no right to begin it "We the People" and ignore the powers of the states. He suggested that the document put too much power in the hands of too few. He noted that the Constitution, proposed without a <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>, did not protect individual rights, 
Madison, the lead supporter of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry's criticisms, since he was ill through most of the convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but continued to speak at length and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention's debates. Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, it would last six months rather than six weeks. Henry was somewhat mollified, after the convention voted on June 21 to ratify the Constitution, by the fact that the convention then proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated in the Bill of Rights. George Mason, Henry's ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratification, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best all go home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.

Henry returned to the House of Delegates, where he successfully defeated Madison's effort to become federal senator from Virginia, for under the original Constitution, senators were elected by legislators, not the people. Although Henry made it clear he would not serve in office outside Virginia, he received a number of votes in the election. Madison gained election to the House of Representatives in a district where he was opposed by <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, though Madison's supporters complained that Henry's supporters in the legislature had unfairly placed Madison's county, Orange, in a district leaning anti-Federalist. Henry also saw to it that the requested amendments were incorporated in petitions from the legislature to the federal Congress. Despite his qualms, Henry served as one of Virginia's presidential electors, voting for Washington (elected President) and John Adams (elected Vice President). Henry was disappointed when the <a href="1st%20United%20States%20Congress">First Congress</a> passed only amendments dealing with personal liberties, not those designed to weaken the government.

A final cause Henry engaged in before leaving the House of Delegates at the end of 1790 was over the <a href="Funding%20Act%20of%201790">Funding Act of 1790</a>, by which the federal government took over the debts of the states, much of which dated from the Revolutionary War. On November 3 of that year, Henry introduced a resolution, which would be passed by the House of Delegates and by the <a href="Senate%20of%20Virginia">state Senate</a>, declaring the act "repugnant to the constitution of the United States, as it goes to the exercise of a power not granted to the general [federal] government". This would prove the first of many resolutions passed by Southern state legislatures in the decades to come, defending <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> and strict interpretation of the Constitution.

Leaving the House of Delegates after 1790, Henry found himself in debt, owing in part to expenses while governor, and sought to secure his family's fortune through land speculation and a return to the practice of law. Not fully reconciled to the federal government, Henry contemplated a new republic in the thinly-settled frontier lands, but his plans came to nothing. He did not travel as widely for cases as he had in the 1760s, confining his practice mostly to Prince Edward and Bedford counties, though in a compelling case, or for a large enough fee, he would travel to Richmond or over the mountains to <a href="Greenbrier%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Greenbrier County</a> (today in West Virginia).

When the <a href="List%20of%20former%20United%20States%20district%20courts%23Virginia">new federal court</a> opened in Virginia in 1790, British creditors promptly filed over a hundred cases seeking to enforce claims from the Revolutionary War. Henry was part of the defense team in "Jones v. Walker" before the federal court in 1791; his co-counsel included <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>, who prepared the written pleadings while Henry did much of the courtroom advocacy. Henry argued the case for three days; Marshall, looking back, called him "a great orator ... and much more, a learned lawyer, a most accurate thinker, and a profound reasoner". The case ended inconclusively after one of the judges died, but the legal teams reassembled for the case of "<a href="Ware%20v.%20Hylton">Ware v. Hylton</a>". Argued before another three-judge panel that included <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice of the United States</a> John Jay and Associate Justice <a href="James%20Iredell">James Iredell</a>, Henry's argument provoked Justice Iredell to exclaim, "Gracious God! He is an orator indeed." Henry and Marshall were initially successful, but the plaintiffs appealed, and after Marshall argued his only case before the Supreme Court, that court in 1796 ruled for the British creditors.

Henry's friendship with Washington had cooled somewhat amid the ratification debates, but by 1794, both men were looking to reconcile. Henry found himself more aligned with Washington than with Jefferson and Madison, and Washington still considered himself indebted to Henry for notifying him about the Conway Cabal. Washington offered Henry a seat on the Supreme Court in 1794, but he refused, feeling his family needed him. Washington also tried to get Henry to accept positions as Secretary of State and as minister to Spain, and Virginia Governor <a href="Henry%20Lee%20III">"Light-Horse" Harry Lee</a> wanted to appoint him to the Senate. Henry refused each time. Henry's continuing popularity in Virginia made him an attractive ally, and even Jefferson tried to recruit him, sending word though a mutual friend that he bore no grudge. After Washington made it clear he would not seek a third term in 1796, Marshall and Harry Lee discussed a possible Henry run for president with him, but Henry was unwilling. The General Assembly elected him as governor again that year, but he declined, citing age and health. Henry's refusal to accept these offices increased his popularity as he was, like Washington, seen as a <a href="Cincinnatus">Cincinnatus</a>, giving up power to return to his farm and his plow.
Henry sold his property in Prince Edward County in 1792, moving with his family to Long Island, a plantation in <a href="Campbell%20County%2C%20Virginia">Campbell County</a>. In 1794 Henry purchased <a href="Red%20Hill%20Patrick%20Henry%20National%20Memorial">Red Hill</a> near <a href="Brookneal%2C%20Virginia">Brookneal, Virginia</a> in <a href="Charlotte%20County%2C%20Virginia">Charlotte County</a>, where he and his family lived much of the year, though they moved to Long Island in the "sickly season". Henry was gratified at the election of his old friend John Adams as president in 1796 over his foe Jefferson, but Henry's commitment to the <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist Party</a> was tested by the repressive <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a> of 1798. He chose to say nothing, but supported the campaign of Marshall, a moderate Federalist, for the House of Representatives; Marshall won narrowly. Henry was under considerable pressure from Virginia Federalists to return to politics, but it was not until former president Washington urged him to run for the legislature in early 1799 that Henry gave in. Turning down an offer from President Adams to make him an envoy to France, Henry was elected as delegate from Charlotte County on March 4, 1799. The legislature had no immediate session scheduled, so he returned to Red Hill, and never left again, dying there of stomach cancer at his home on June 6, 1799. He was buried at Red Hill.

In Henry's will, he left his estates and his 67 slaves to be divided between his wife and his six sons. He did not free any slaves, despite his speeches against enslavement by tyrants and despite his various comments opposing the institution of slavery itself.

The tributes to Henry upon his death were many. The "Virginia Gazette" printed a death notice bordered in black, "As long as our rivers flow, or mountains stand, Virginia ... will say to rising generations, imitate my H ". The "Petersburg Intelligencer" regretted the death of a man who might have been able "to conciliate all parties and produce that harmony and accord" needed at a time of national controversy. The "Argus", a paper which supported Jefferson's faction, noted that Henry "pointed out those evils in our Constitution ... against which we now complain ... If any are disposed to censure Mr. Henry for his late political transition [to supporting the Federalists], if anything has been written on that subject, let the <a href="Genius%20%28mythology%29">Genius</a> of American Independence drop a tear, and blot it out forever."

Several of Henry's homes are recognized for their association with him. <a href="Scotchtown%20%28plantation%29">Scotchtown</a> Plantation is a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>. The <a href="Red%20Hill%20Patrick%20Henry%20National%20Memorial">Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial</a> preserves Henry's final home, gravesite, and his restored law office. The <a href="Birthplace%20of%20Patrick%20Henry">site of his birthplace</a>, which burned in 1807 and is now reduced to archaeological remains, is also preserved; it is listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. A plaque placed by the <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a> marks the site of Leatherwood, in Henry County.

Henry helped found Hampden-Sydney College, believing that "every free state" should promote "useful knowledge amongst its citizens". He was an original trustee and sent seven of his sons there. Henry was instrumental in getting its charter passed by the General Assembly in 1783. <a href="Emory%20and%20Henry%20College">Emory and Henry College</a> in <a href="Emory%2C%20Virginia">Emory, Virginia</a> was named for him and <a href="John%20Emory">John Emory</a>, an early bishop in Virginia. According to the college, "Bishop Emory symbolizes belief in the union of faith and learning, while Governor Henry represents the commitment to the ideals of freedom and civic virtue."

<a href="Fort%20Henry%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Fort Henry</a> stood in what is now <a href="Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wheeling, West Virginia</a> but was at the time part of Virginia. It was built in 1774 and named Fort Fincastle after one of Lord Dunmore's titles, but was renamed for Henry, then governor, after independence. Fort Patrick Henry was built during the American Revolutionary War along the <a href="Holston%20River">South Fork Holston River</a> at the present-day site of <a href="Kingsport%2C%20Tennessee">Kingsport, Tennessee</a>. This fort serves as the namesake of <a href="Fort%20Patrick%20Henry%20Dam">Fort Patrick Henry Dam</a> and its reservoir on the river. At least three ships have been named in Henry's honor: the Civil War <a href="Confederate%20States%20Navy">Confederate Navy</a> <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> , <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a> and the <a href="ballistic%20missile%20submarine">ballistic missile submarine</a> .

<a href="Camp%20Patrick%20Henry">Camp Patrick Henry</a> was a World War II-era military camp near <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News, Virginia</a>. Decommissioned in 1946, it became the site of the <a href="Newport%20News/Williamsburg%20International%20Airport">Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport</a> on . When opened in 1949, the airport was called Patrick Henry Field, and was later renamed Patrick Henry International Airport, a name it retained until 1990. The airport code is still PHF.
Patrick Henry has been honored twice on U.S. postage stamps. On October 7, 1955, the <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">United States Post Office Department</a> issued a $1 <a href="definitive%20stamp">definitive stamp</a> honoring Henry, one of the high values in the <a href="Liberty%20issue">Liberty issue</a>. A painting of Henry by American artist Alonzo Chappel (1828–1887) was used as the inspiration and as the model by the engraver for this issue. In 1960–1961, the U.S. Post Office issued the American Credo series, six stamps with well-known patriotic quotations. Patrick Henry's most famous words are inscribed on the final issue in the series, a 4-cent stamp first released in Richmond on January 11, 1961.
As historian <a href="Richard%20Beeman">Richard Beeman</a> put it, Henry was a man who "did not bother to write much of anything down", a handicap when being evaluated by history. The lack of primary source materials regarding Henry—only a handful of papers and a few of his speeches survive—has frustrated Henry's biographers from Wirt (1817) to Beeman (1974): Wirt commented two years before publishing his book, "It is all speaking, speaking, speaking. 'Tis true he could talk—Gods! how he "could" talk! but ... to make the matter worse, from 1763 to 1789 ... not one of his speeches lives in print, writing or memory". Beeman, for his part, concluded, "the Revolutionary firebrand, whatever his achievements, possessed a miserable sense of history". This was a deficiency not possessed by Jefferson, who not only survived Henry by a quarter century, but who got to fill the vacuum of information about Henry with his own recollections and opinions. Wirt did not print many of Jefferson's criticisms of Henry, who had irritated Jefferson to such an extent he was still criticizing Henry to guests at <a href="Monticello">Monticello</a> in 1824. Jefferson's negative assessments of Henry, whether justified or not, have adversely affected Henry's historical reputation.

Henry has always been acclaimed by Americans for the brilliance of his political oratory. Kukla wrote, "Henry explained the Revolution to ordinary men and women through America in words they understood—and inspired them to fight for liberty." Mayer argued, "Henry had forged a popular and partisan political style whose democratic implications took another generation to realize fully and accept. His career pointed the transition from the political squirearchy of the eighteenth century to the mass politics of <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s day". In his study of Henry's oratory, David A. McCants suggested that Henry's position as great American orator of his day was not so much because of his "heroism and eloquence" but for adapting the clashing philosophies, religious and political, that met in Henry's Virginia, to create a new style of oratory that appealed to the masses. According to Tate, "by his unmatched oratorical powers, by employing a certain common touch to win the unwavering loyalty of his constituents, and by closely identifying with their interests, he almost certainly contributed to making the Revolution a more widely popular movement than it might otherwise have become". Kidd argued that the historical focus on the quality of Henry's oratory may result from a discomfort with the content of his speeches, especially his opposition to the Constitution.

During the Civil War era, both sides claimed Henry as a partisan, <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a>s citing his writings against slavery, and those sympathetic to the Southern cause pointing to his hostility to the Constitution. That opposition by Henry came to be seen by many writers, even those friendly to Henry, as a blot on an otherwise admirable career. Beeman, writing in 1986, just before the Constitution's bicentennial, predicted that during that anniversary, "it will be hard to avoid depicting Henry as one of history's losers, as one too short-sighted to see beyond the bounds of his own native state to glimpse the promise of national greatness embodied in the federal Constitution."

Henry has been cited as a hero to both Left and Right, but has become a particular favorite of the latter. He is especially attractive to Christian conservatives, who cite his deep religious beliefs, as well as his writings and speeches in favor of Christian virtue, and in defense of religious liberty. Because Henry was educated at home, by his father, he has become a symbol of the <a href="homeschooling">homeschooling</a> movement. In 2000, <a href="Patrick%20Henry%20College">Patrick Henry College</a> was founded in <a href="Purcellville%2C%20Virginia">Purcellville, Virginia</a>, in large part for those who had been homeschooled. Although Henry's most famous declaration has proved as adaptable as ever in the hands of the Right (one sign at a <a href="Tea%20Party%20movement">Tea Party</a> rally in 2010 read "Give Me Liberty or Give Me Debt"), according to Kidd, "few Americans today, Tea Partiers or others, take seriously Henry's fundamental criticisms of the Constitution."

Tate wrote of Henry, "Of the numerous leaders who were active largely at the state level and who generally opposed ratification of the Federal Constitution, Henry was one of the few who came to be ranked among the truly major figures of the American Revolution." Kukla concurred, noting that except for two years in the Continental Congress, Henry never held national office, "and yet he was a founder of the republic". Kidd noted the hazy view of Henry that Americans today have:

Albert, Prince Consort

Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (Francis Albert Augustus Charles Emmanuel; 26 August 1819 – 14 December 1861) was the husband of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>.

He was born in the <a href="Ernestine%20duchies">Saxon duchy</a> of <a href="Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld</a>, to a family connected to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of <a href="prince%20consort">prince consort</a>, which did not afford him power or responsibilities. He gradually developed a reputation for supporting public causes, such as <a href="educational%20reform">educational reform</a> and the <a href="abolition%20of%20slavery">abolition of slavery</a> worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's <a href="royal%20household">household</a>, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the <a href="Great%20Exhibition">Great Exhibition</a> of 1851, which was a resounding success.

Victoria came to depend more and more on his support and guidance. He aided the development of Britain's <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> by persuading his wife to be less partisan in her dealings with <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a>—although he actively disagreed with the <a href="interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionist foreign policy</a> pursued during <a href="Lord%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>'s tenure as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>.

Albert died at the relatively young age of 42. Victoria was so devastated at the loss of her husband that she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life. On her death in 1901, their eldest son succeeded as <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, the first <a href="British%20monarch">British monarch</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, named after the <a href="ducal">ducal</a> house to which Albert belonged.

Albert was born at <a href="Schloss%20Rosenau%2C%20Coburg">Schloss Rosenau</a>, near <a href="Coburg">Coburg</a>, Germany, the second son of <a href="Ernest%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld</a>, and his first wife, <a href="Princess%20Louise%20of%20Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg%20%281800%E2%80%931831%29">Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg</a>. Albert's future wife, Victoria, was born earlier in the same year with the assistance of the same midwife, <a href="Charlotte%20von%20Siebold">Charlotte von Siebold</a>. Albert was baptised into the <a href="Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Germany">Lutheran Evangelical Church</a> on 19 September 1819 in the Marble Hall at Schloss Rosenau with water taken from the local river, the <a href="Itz">Itz</a>. His godparents were his paternal grandmother, the <a href="Countess%20Augusta%20Reuss%20of%20Ebersdorf">Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld</a>; his maternal grandfather, the <a href="Augustus%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg">Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg</a>; the <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor of Austria</a>; the <a href="Prince%20Albert%20of%20Saxony%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Duke of Teschen</a>; and <a href="Emmanuel%20von%20Mensdorff-Pouilly">Emanuel, Count of Mensdorff-Pouilly</a>. In 1825, Albert's great-uncle, <a href="Frederick%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg">Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg</a>, died. His death led to a realignment of <a href="Saxon%20duchies">Saxon duchies</a> the following year and Albert's father became the first reigning duke of <a href="Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>.

Albert and his elder brother, <a href="Ernest%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Ernest</a>, spent their youth in a close companionship marred by their parents' turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After their mother was exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, <a href="Alexander%20von%20Hanstein%2C%20Count%20of%20Polzig%20and%20Beiersdorf">Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf</a>. She presumably never saw her children again, and died of cancer at the age of 30 in 1831. The following year, their father <a href="avunculate%20marriage">married his niece</a>, his sons' cousin <a href="Princess%20Marie%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Princess Marie of Württemberg</a>; their marriage was not close, however, and Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepchildren's lives.

The brothers were educated privately at home by and later studied in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, where <a href="Adolphe%20Quetelet">Adolphe Quetelet</a> was one of their tutors. Like many other German princes, Albert attended the <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">University of Bonn</a>, where he studied law, political economy, philosophy and the history of art. He played music and excelled at sport, especially <a href="fencing%20%28sport%29">fencing</a> and riding. His tutors at Bonn included the philosopher <a href="Immanuel%20Hermann%20Fichte">Fichte</a> and the poet <a href="August%20Wilhelm%20Schlegel">Schlegel</a>.

The idea of marriage between Albert and his cousin, Victoria, was first documented in an 1821 letter from his paternal grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who said that he was "the pendant to the pretty cousin". By 1836, this idea had also arisen in the mind of their ambitious uncle <a href="Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium">Leopold</a>, who had been <a href="King%20of%20the%20Belgians">King of the Belgians</a> since 1831. At this time, Victoria was the <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> to the British throne. Her father, <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn</a>, the fourth son of King <a href="George%20III">George III</a>, had died when she was a baby, and her elderly uncle, King <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William IV</a>, had no legitimate children. Her mother, the <a href="Victoria%20of%20Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">Duchess of Kent</a>, was the sister of both Albert's father—the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha—and King Leopold. Leopold arranged for his sister, Victoria's mother, to invite the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his two sons to visit her in May 1836, with the purpose of meeting Victoria. William IV, however, disapproved of any match with the Coburgs, and instead favoured the suit of <a href="Prince%20Alexander%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Prince Alexander</a>, second son of the <a href="William%20II%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Prince of Orange</a>. Victoria was well aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised a parade of eligible princes. She wrote, "[Albert] is extremely handsome; his hair is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful." Alexander, on the other hand, she described as "very plain".

Victoria wrote to her uncle Leopold to thank him "for the prospect of "great" happiness you have contributed to give me, in the person of dear Albert ... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy." Although the parties did not undertake a formal engagement, both the family and their retainers widely assumed that the match would take place.

Victoria came to the throne aged eighteen on 20 June 1837. Her letters of the time show interest in Albert's education for the role he would have to play, although she resisted attempts to rush her into marriage. In the winter of 1838–39, the prince visited Italy, accompanied by the Coburg family's confidential adviser, <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Freiherr%20von%20Stockmar">Baron Stockmar</a>.
Albert returned to the United Kingdom with Ernest in October 1839 to visit the Queen, with the objective of settling the marriage. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839. Victoria's intention to marry was declared formally to the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> on 23 November, and the couple married on 10 February 1840 at the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a>, <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a>. Just before the marriage, Albert was naturalised by Act of Parliament, and granted the style of "Royal Highness" by an <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a>.

Initially Albert was not popular with the British public; he was perceived to be from an impoverished and undistinguished minor state, barely larger than a small English county. The <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a>, <a href="William%20Lamb%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a>, advised the Queen against granting her husband the title of "<a href="King%20Consort">King Consort</a>"; Parliament also objected to Albert being created a <a href="British%20peerage">peer</a>—partly because of anti-German sentiment and a desire to exclude Albert from any political role. Albert's religious views provided a small amount of controversy when the marriage was debated in Parliament: although as a member of the <a href="Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Germany">Lutheran Evangelical Church</a> Albert was a Protestant, the non-<a href="episcopal%20polity">Episcopal</a> nature of his church was considered worrisome. Of greater concern, however, was that some of Albert's family were Roman Catholic. Melbourne led a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> and the opposition took advantage of the marriage to weaken his position further. They opposed the ennoblement of Albert and granted him a smaller annuity than previous consorts, £30,000 instead of the usual £50,000. Albert claimed that he had no need of a British peerage, writing: "It would almost be a step downwards, for as a Duke of Saxony, I feel myself much higher than a Duke of York or Kent." For the next seventeen years, Albert was formally titled "HRH Prince Albert" until, on 25 June 1857, Victoria formally granted him the title <a href="Prince%20Consort">Prince Consort</a>.

The position in which the prince was placed by his marriage, while one of distinction, also offered considerable difficulties; in Albert's own words, "I am very happy and contented; but the difficulty in filling my place with the proper dignity is that I am only the husband, not the master in the house." The Queen's household was run by her former governess, <a href="Baroness%20Louise%20Lehzen">Baroness Lehzen</a>. Albert referred to her as the "House Dragon", and manoeuvred to dislodge the Baroness from her position.

Within two months of the marriage, Victoria was pregnant. Albert started to take on public roles; he became President of the Society for the Extinction of Slavery (which was still legal in the southern United States and the colonies of France); and helped Victoria privately with her government paperwork. 

In June 1840, while on a public carriage ride, Albert and the pregnant Victoria were shot at by <a href="Edward%20Oxford">Edward Oxford</a>, who was later judged insane. Neither Albert nor Victoria was hurt and Albert was praised in the newspapers for his courage and coolness during the attack. Albert was gaining public support as well as political influence, which showed itself practically when, in August, Parliament passed the <a href="Regency%20Acts%23Regency%20Act%201840">Regency Act 1840</a> to designate him <a href="regent">regent</a> in the event of Victoria's death before their child reached the age of majority. Their first child, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Victoria</a>, named after her mother, was born in November. Eight other children would follow over the next seventeen years. All nine children survived to adulthood, which was remarkable for the era and which biographer Hermione Hobhouse credited to Albert's "enlightened influence" on the healthy running of the nursery. In early 1841, he successfully removed the nursery from Lehzen's pervasive control, and in September 1842, Lehzen left Britain permanently—much to Albert's relief.

After the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201841">1841 general election</a>, Melbourne was replaced as Prime Minister by <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a>, who appointed Albert as chairman of the <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> in charge of redecorating the new <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Palace of Westminster</a>. The Palace had <a href="Burning%20of%20Parliament">burned down seven years before</a>, and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work was slow, and the architect, <a href="Charles%20Barry">Charles Barry</a>, took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a>'s "Apollo and Diana" and <a href="Fra%20Angelico">Fra Angelico</a>'s "St Peter Martyr"—and contemporary pieces from <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20Winterhalter">Franz Xaver Winterhalter</a> and <a href="Edwin%20Landseer">Edwin Landseer</a>. , of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of the highest quality.

Albert and Victoria were shot at again on both 29 and 30 May 1842, but were unhurt. The culprit, John Francis, was detained and condemned to death, although he was later reprieved. Some of their early unpopularity came about because of their stiffness and adherence to protocol in public, though in private the couple were more easy-going. In early 1844, Victoria and Albert were apart for the first time since their marriage when he returned to Coburg on the death of his father.
By 1844, Albert had managed to modernise the royal finances and, through various economies, had sufficient capital to purchase <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> as a private residence for their growing family. Over the next few years a house modelled in the style of an Italianate villa was built to the designs of Albert and <a href="Thomas%20Cubitt">Thomas Cubitt</a>. Albert laid out the grounds, and improved the estate and farm. Albert managed and improved the other royal estates; his model farm at <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a> was admired by his biographers, and under his stewardship the revenues of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Cornwall">Duchy of Cornwall</a>—the hereditary property of the Prince of Wales—steadily increased.

Unlike many landowners who approved of child labour and opposed Peel's repeal of the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>, Albert supported moves to raise working ages and free up trade. In 1846, Albert was rebuked by <a href="Lord%20George%20Bentinck">Lord George Bentinck</a> when he attended the debate on the Corn Laws in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> to give tacit support to Peel. During Peel's premiership, Albert's authority behind, or beside, the throne became more apparent. He had access to all the Queen's papers, was drafting her correspondence and was present when she met her ministers, or even saw them alone in her absence. The clerk of the Privy Council, <a href="Charles%20Greville%20%28diarist%29">Charles Greville</a>, wrote of him: "He is King to all intents and purposes."

In 1847, Albert was elected <a href="Chancellor%20%28education%29">Chancellor</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> after a <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge%20Chancellor%20election%2C%201847">close contest</a> with <a href="Edward%20Herbert%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Powis">the Earl of Powis</a>. Albert used his position as <a href="List%20of%20Chancellors%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Cambridge">Chancellor</a> to campaign successfully for reformed and more modern university curricula, expanding the subjects taught beyond the traditional mathematics and classics to include modern history and the natural sciences.

That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy holiday in the west of Scotland at <a href="Loch%20Laggan">Loch Laggan</a>, but heard from their doctor, <a href="Sir%20James%20Clark%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir James Clark</a>, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>. The tenant of Balmoral, <a href="Robert%20Gordon%20%28diplomat%29">Sir Robert Gordon</a>, died suddenly in early October, and Albert began negotiations to take over the lease from the owner, <a href="James%20Duff%2C%204th%20Earl%20Fife">the Earl Fife</a>. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.

<a href="Revolutions%20of%201848">Revolutions spread throughout Europe in 1848</a> as the result of a widespread economic crisis. Throughout the year, Victoria and Albert complained about <a href="Henry%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Foreign Secretary Palmerston's</a> independent foreign policy, which they believed destabilised foreign European powers further. Albert was concerned for many of his royal relatives, a number of whom were deposed. He and Victoria, who gave birth to their daughter <a href="Princess%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Argyll">Louise</a> during that year, spent some time away from London in the relative safety of Osborne. Although there were sporadic demonstrations in England, no effective revolutionary action took place, and Albert even gained public acclaim when he expressed paternalistic, yet well-meaning and philanthropic, views. In a speech to the <a href="Labourer%27s%20Friend%20Society">Society for the Improvement of the Condition of the Labouring Classes</a>, of which he was President, he expressed his "sympathy and interest for that class of our community who have most of the toil and fewest of the enjoyments of this world". It was the "duty of those who, under the blessings of Divine Providence, enjoy station, wealth, and education" to assist those less fortunate than themselves.

A man of progressive and relatively liberal ideas, Albert not only led reforms in university education, welfare, the royal finances and slavery, he had a special interest in applying science and art to the manufacturing industry. The <a href="Great%20Exhibition%20of%201851">Great Exhibition of 1851</a> arose from the annual exhibitions of the <a href="Society%20of%20Arts">Society of Arts</a>, of which Albert was President from 1843, and owed most of its success to his efforts to promote it. Albert served as president of the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20for%20the%20Exhibition%20of%201851">Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851</a>, and had to fight for every stage of the project. In the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, <a href="Henry%20Brougham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brougham%20and%20Vaux">Lord Brougham</a> fulminated against the proposal to hold the exhibition in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>. Opponents of the exhibition prophesied that foreign rogues and revolutionists would overrun England, subvert the morals of the people, and destroy their faith. Albert thought such talk absurd and quietly persevered, trusting always that British manufacturing would benefit from exposure to the best products of foreign countries.

The Queen opened the exhibition in a specially designed and built glass building known as <a href="the%20Crystal%20Palace">the Crystal Palace</a> on 1 May 1851. It proved a colossal success. A surplus of £180,000 was used to purchase land in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a> on which to establish educational and cultural institutions—including the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a>, <a href="The%20Science%20Museum">Science Museum</a>, <a href="Imperial%20College%20London">Imperial College London</a> and what would later be named the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> and the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. The area was referred to as "<a href="Albertopolis">Albertopolis</a>" by sceptics.

In 1852, <a href="John%20Camden%20Neild">John Camden Neild</a>, an eccentric miser, left Victoria an unexpected legacy, which Albert used to obtain the <a href="Freehold%20%28Scots%20law%29">freehold</a> of Balmoral. As usual, he embarked on an extensive programme of improvements. The same year, he was appointed to several of the offices left vacant by the death of <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">the Duke of Wellington</a>, including the mastership of <a href="Trinity%20House">Trinity House</a> and <a href="Grenadier%20Guards%23Colonels-in-Chief">the colonelcy of the Grenadier Guards</a>. With Wellington's passing, Albert was able to propose and campaign for modernisation of the army, which was long overdue. Thinking that the military was unready for war, and that Christian rule was preferable to Islamic rule, Albert counselled a diplomatic solution to conflict between the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> and <a href="Ottoman%20empire">Ottoman empire</a>s. Palmerston was more bellicose, and favoured a policy that would prevent further Russian expansion. Palmerston was manoeuvred out of the cabinet in December 1853, but at about the same time a Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman fleet at anchor at <a href="Battle%20of%20Sinop">Sinop</a>. The London press depicted the attack as a criminal massacre, and Palmerston's popularity surged as Albert's fell. Within two weeks, Palmerston was re-appointed as a minister. As public outrage at the Russian action continued, false rumours circulated that Albert had been arrested for treason and was being held prisoner in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>.

By March 1854, Britain and Russia were embroiled in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. Albert devised a master-plan for winning the war by laying <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">siege to Sevastopol</a> while starving Russia economically, which became the Allied strategy after the Tsar decided to fight a purely defensive war. Early British optimism soon faded as the press reported that British troops were ill-equipped and mismanaged by aged generals using out-of-date tactics and strategy. The conflict dragged on as the Russians were as poorly prepared as their opponents. The Prime Minister, <a href="George%20Gordon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">Lord Aberdeen</a>, resigned and Palmerston succeeded him. A negotiated settlement eventually put an end to the war with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29">Treaty of Paris</a>. During the war, Albert arranged the marriage of his fourteen-year-old daughter, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Victoria</a>, to <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Prince Frederick William of Prussia</a>, though Albert delayed the marriage until Victoria was seventeen. Albert hoped that his daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging but very conservative <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n state.

Albert promoted many public educational institutions. Chiefly at meetings in connection with these he spoke of the need for better schooling. A collection of his speeches was published in 1857. Recognised as a supporter of education and technological progress, he was invited to speak at scientific meetings, such as the memorable address he delivered as president of the <a href="British%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a> when it met at <a href="Aberdeen%2C%20Scotland">Aberdeen</a> in 1859. His espousal of science met with clerical opposition; he and <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Palmerston</a> unsuccessfully recommended a knighthood for <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, after the publication of "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", which was opposed by the <a href="Samuel%20Wilberforce">Bishop of Oxford</a>.

Albert continued to devote himself to the education of his family and the management of the royal household. His children's governess, <a href="Sarah%20Lyttelton%2C%20Baroness%20Lyttelton">Lady Lyttelton</a>, thought him unusually kind and patient, and described him joining in family games with enthusiasm. He felt keenly the departure of his eldest daughter for Prussia when she married her fiancé at the beginning of 1858, and was disappointed that his eldest son, <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">the Prince of Wales</a>, did not respond well to the intense educational programme that Albert had designed for him. At the age of seven, the Prince of Wales was expected to take six hours of instruction, including an hour of German and an hour of French every day. When the Prince of Wales failed at his lessons, Albert caned him. Corporal punishment was common at the time, and was not thought unduly harsh. Albert's biographer <a href="Roger%20Fulford">Roger Fulford</a> wrote that the relationships between the family members were "friendly, affectionate and normal ... there is no evidence either in the Royal Archives or in the printed authorities to justify the belief that the relations between the Prince and his eldest son were other than deeply affectionate." <a href="Sir%20Philip%20Magnus-Allcroft%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Philip Magnus</a> wrote in his biography of Albert's eldest son that Albert "tried to treat his children as equals; and they were able to penetrate his stiffness and reserve because they realised instinctively not only that he loved them but that he enjoyed and needed their company."

In August 1859, Albert fell seriously ill with stomach cramps. He had an accidental brush with death during a trip to Coburg in the autumn of 1860, when he was driving alone in a carriage drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He confided in his brother and eldest daughter that he had sensed his time had come.

In March 1861, Victoria's mother and Albert's aunt, <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld">the Duchess of Kent</a>, died and Victoria was grief-stricken; Albert took on most of the Queen's duties, despite continuing to suffer with chronic stomach trouble. The last public event he presided over was the opening of the Royal Horticultural Gardens on 5 June 1861. In August, Victoria and Albert visited the <a href="Curragh%20Camp">Curragh Camp</a>, Ireland, where the Prince of Wales was doing army service. At the Curragh, the Prince of Wales was introduced, by his fellow officers, to <a href="Nellie%20Clifden">Nellie Clifden</a>, an Irish actress.

By November, Victoria and Albert had returned to Windsor, and the Prince of Wales had returned to Cambridge, where he was a student. Two of Albert's young cousins, brothers King <a href="Pedro%20V%20of%20Portugal">Pedro V of Portugal</a> and <a href="Prince%20Ferdinand%20of%20Portugal">Prince Ferdinand</a>, died of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> within 5 days of each other in early November. On top of this news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in <a href="gentlemen%27s%20club">gentlemen's club</a>s and the foreign press that the Prince of Wales was still involved with Nellie Clifden. Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy. Although Albert was ill and at a low ebb, he travelled to Cambridge to see the Prince of Wales on 25 November to discuss his son's indiscreet affair. In his final weeks Albert suffered from pains in his back and legs.

When the <a href="Trent%20Affair">Trent Affair</a>—the forcible removal of <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> envoys from a British ship by <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> forces during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>—threatened war between the United States and Britain, Albert was gravely ill but intervened to soften the British diplomatic response.

On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, <a href="Sir%20William%20Jenner%2C%201st%20Baronet">William Jenner</a>, diagnosed typhoid fever. Albert died at 10:50 p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, in the presence of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert's ongoing stomach pain, leaving him ill for at least two years before his death, may indicate that a chronic disease, such as <a href="Crohn%27s%20disease">Crohn's disease</a>, <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a>, or <a href="abdominal%20cancer">abdominal cancer</a>, was the cause of death.

The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid feelings the public had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. The widowed Victoria never recovered from Albert's death; she entered into a deep state of mourning and wore black for the rest of her life. Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the <a href="British%20royal%20family">British royal family</a> should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whigs</a>; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to <a href="Bedchamber%20Crisis">thwart the formation of a Tory government</a> by <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a> by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.

Albert's body was temporarily entombed in <a href="St%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle</a>. A year after his death his remains were deposited at <a href="Frogmore%20Mausoleum">Frogmore Mausoleum</a>, which remained incomplete until 1871. The sarcophagus, in which both he and the Queen were eventually laid, was carved from the largest block of granite that had ever been quarried in Britain. Despite Albert's request that no effigies of him should be raised, many public monuments were erected all over the country and across the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. The most notable are the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> and the <a href="Albert%20Memorial">Albert Memorial</a> in London. The plethora of memorials erected to Albert became so great that <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> told a friend that he sought an "inaccessible cave" to escape from them.

Places and objects named after Albert range from <a href="Lake%20Albert%20%28Africa%29">Lake Albert</a> in Africa to the city of <a href="Prince%20Albert%2C%20Saskatchewan">Prince Albert, Saskatchewan</a>, to the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28RSA%29">Albert Medal</a> presented by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a>. Four regiments of the British Army were named after him: <a href="11th%20%28Prince%20Albert%27s%20Own%29%20Hussars">11th (Prince Albert's Own) Hussars</a>; <a href="Prince%20Albert%27s%20Light%20Infantry">Prince Albert's Light Infantry</a>; <a href="Prince%20Albert%27s%20Own%20Leicestershire%20Regiment%20of%20Yeomanry%20Cavalry">Prince Albert's Own Leicestershire Regiment of Yeomanry Cavalry</a>, and <a href="The%20Prince%20Consort%27s%20Own%20Rifle%20Brigade">The Prince Consort's Own Rifle Brigade</a>. He and Queen Victoria showed a keen interest in the establishment and development of <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> as a <a href="garrison">garrison town</a> in the 1850s. They had a wooden <a href="Royal%20Pavilion%2C%20Aldershot">Royal Pavilion</a> built there in which they would often stay when attending reviews of the army. Albert established and endowed the <a href="Prince%20Consort%27s%20Library">Prince Consort's Library</a> at <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a>, which still exists today.

Biographies published after his death were typically heavy on eulogy. <a href="Theodore%20Martin">Theodore Martin</a>'s five-volume "magnum opus" was authorised and supervised by Queen Victoria, and her influence shows in its pages. Nevertheless, it is an accurate and exhaustive account. <a href="Lytton%20Strachey">Lytton Strachey</a>'s "Queen Victoria" (1921) was more critical, but it was discredited in part by mid-twentieth-century biographers such as <a href="Hector%20Bolitho">Hector Bolitho</a> and <a href="Roger%20Fulford">Roger Fulford</a>, who (unlike Strachey) had access to Victoria's journal and letters. Popular myths about Prince Albert—such as the claim that he introduced <a href="Christmas%20tree">Christmas tree</a>s to Britain—are dismissed by scholars. Recent biographers such as <a href="Stanley%20Weintraub">Stanley Weintraub</a> portray Albert as a figure in a tragic romance who died too soon and was mourned by his lover for a lifetime. In the 2009 movie "<a href="The%20Young%20Victoria">The Young Victoria</a>", Albert, played by <a href="Rupert%20Friend">Rupert Friend</a>, is made into a heroic character; in the fictionalised depiction of the 1840 shooting, he is struck by a bullet—something that did not happen in real life.

In Britain, Albert was styled "His <a href="Serene%20Highness">Serene Highness</a> Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha" in the months before his marriage, until granted the style of "<a href="Royal%20Highness">Royal Highness</a>" on 6 February 1840. He was given the title of Prince Consort on 25 June 1857.

Upon his marriage to Queen Victoria in 1840, Prince Albert received a personal <a href="grant%20of%20arms">grant of arms</a>, being the <a href="royal%20coat%20of%20arms%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom</a> <a href="Cadency">differenced</a> by a white three-point <a href="Label%20%28heraldry%29">label</a> with a red cross in the centre, <a href="Quartering%20%28heraldry%29">quartered</a> with his ancestral <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Saxony">arms of Saxony</a>.

Emu

The emu ("Dromaius novaehollandiae") is the second-largest living bird by height, after its <a href="ratite">ratite</a> relative, the <a href="Common%20ostrich">ostrich</a>. It is <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to Australia where it is the largest native bird and the only <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> member of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Dromaius">Dromaius</a>". The emu's range covers most of mainland Australia, but the <a href="Tasmanian%20emu">Tasmanian</a>, <a href="Kangaroo%20Island%20emu">Kangaroo Island</a> and <a href="King%20Island%20emu">King Island</a> subspecies became extinct after the <a href="History%20of%20Australia%20%281788%E2%80%931850%29">European settlement of Australia</a> in 1788. The bird is sufficiently common for it to be rated as a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>.

Emus are soft-feathered, brown, <a href="flightless%20bird">flightless bird</a>s with long necks and legs, and can reach up to in height. Emus can travel great distances, and when necessary can sprint at ; they forage for a variety of plants and insects, but have been known to go for weeks without eating. They drink infrequently, but take in copious amounts of water when the opportunity arises.

Breeding takes place in May and June, and fighting among females for a mate is common. Females can mate several times and lay several clutches of eggs in one season. The male does the incubation; during this process he hardly eats or drinks and loses a significant amount of weight. The eggs hatch after around eight weeks, and the young are nurtured by their fathers. They reach full size after around six months, but can remain as a family unit until the next breeding season. The emu is an important <a href="National%20symbols%20of%20Australia">cultural icon of Australia</a>, appearing on the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Australia">coat of arms</a> and various coins. The bird features prominently in <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> mythology.

Emus were first reported as having been seen by Europeans when explorers visited the western coast of Australia in 1696; this was an expedition led by Dutch captain <a href="Willem%20de%20Vlamingh">Willem de Vlamingh</a> who was searching for survivors of a ship that had gone missing two years earlier. The birds were known on the eastern coast before 1788, when the first Europeans settled there. The birds were first mentioned under the name of the "New Holland <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a>" in <a href="Arthur%20Phillip">Arthur Phillip</a>'s "Voyage to Botany Bay", published in 1789 with the following description:

The species was named by ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1790 based on a specimen from the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> area of Australia, a country which was known as <a href="New%20Holland%20%28Australia%29">New Holland</a> at the time. He collaborated on Phillip's book and provided the first descriptions of, and names for, many Australian bird species; "<a href="Dromaius">Dromaius</a>" comes from a Greek word meaning "racer" and "novaehollandiae" is the Latin term for New Holland, so the name can be rendered as "fast-footed New Hollander". In his original 1816 description of the emu, the French ornithologist <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> used two <a href="genus">generic</a> names, first "Dromiceius" and later "Dromaius". It has been a point of contention ever since as to which name should be used; the latter is more correctly formed, but the convention in <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29%23Alpha%20and%20beta%20taxonomy">taxonomy</a> is that the first name given to an organism stands, unless it is clearly a <a href="typographical%20error">typographical error</a>. Most modern publications, including those of the Australian government, use "Dromaius", with "Dromiceius" mentioned as an alternative spelling.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the common name "emu" is uncertain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird that was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related cassowary in Australia and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Another theory is that it comes from the word "ema", which is used in Portuguese to denote a large bird akin to an ostrich or crane. In Victoria, some terms for the emu were "Barrimal" in the <a href="Djadjawurrung%20language">Dja Dja Wurrung language</a>, "myoure" in <a href="Gunai%20language">Gunai</a>, and "courn" in <a href="Jardwadjali">Jardwadjali</a>. The birds were known as "murawung" or "birabayin" to the local <a href="Eora">Eora</a> and <a href="Darug">Darug</a> inhabitants of the Sydney basin.

The emu was long classified, with its closest relatives the cassowaries, in the family <a href="Casuariidae">Casuariidae</a>, part of the <a href="ratite">ratite</a> order Struthioniformes. However, an alternate classification was proposed in 2014 by Mitchell et al., based on analysis of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>. This splits off the Casuariidae into their own order, the <a href="Casuariformes">Casuariformes</a>, and includes only the cassowaries in the family Casuariidae, placing the emus in their own family, <a href="Dromaiidae">Dromaiidae</a>. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shown below is from their study.
Two different "Dromaius" species were present in Australia at the time of European settlement, and one additional species is known from fossil remains. The <a href="insular%20dwarf">insular dwarf</a> emus, "<a href="Kangaroo%20Island%20emu">D. n. baudinianus</a>" and "<a href="King%20Island%20emu">D. n. minor</a>", originally present on <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> and <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a> respectively, both became <a href="extinction">extinct</a> shortly after the arrival of Europeans. "<a href="Tasmanian%20emu">D. n. diemenensis</a>", another insular dwarf emu from <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, became extinct around 1865. However, the mainland subspecies, "D. n. novaehollandiae", remains common. The population of these birds varies from decade to decade, largely being dependent on rainfall; in 2009, it was estimated that there were between 630,000 and 725,000 birds. Emus were introduced to <a href="Maria%20Island">Maria Island</a> off Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia, during the 20th century. The Maria Island population died out in the mid-1990s. The Kangaroo Island birds have successfully established a breeding population.

In 1912, the Australian ornithologist <a href="Gregory%20M.%20Mathews">Gregory M. Mathews</a> recognised three living subspecies of emu, "D. n. novaehollandiae" (Latham, 1790), "D. n. woodwardi" Mathews, 1912 and "D. n. rothschildi" Mathews, 1912. However, the <a href="Handbook%20of%20the%20Birds%20of%20the%20World">Handbook of the Birds of the World</a> argues that the last two of these subspecies are invalid; natural variations in plumage colour and the nomadic nature of the species make it likely that there is a single race in mainland Australia. Examination of the DNA of the King Island emu shows this bird to be closely related to the mainland emu and hence best treated as a subspecies.

The emu is the second tallest bird in the world, only being exceeded in height by the ostrich;
the largest individuals can reach up to in height. Measured from the bill to the tail, emus range in length from , with males averaging and females averaging . Emus are the fourth or fifth heaviest living bird after the two species of ostrich and two larger species of <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a>, weighing slightly more on average than an <a href="emperor%20penguin">emperor penguin</a>. Adult emus weigh between , with an average of in males and females, respectively. Females are usually slightly larger than males and are substantially wider across the rump.

Although flightless, emus have <a href="Vestigiality">vestigial</a> wings, the <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord</a> measuring around , and each wing having a small claw at the tip. Emus flap their wings when running, perhaps as a means of stabilising themselves when moving fast. They have long necks and legs, and can run at speeds of due to their highly specialised <a href="Pelvis%23Other%20animals">pelvic</a> limb musculature. Their <a href="Bird%20feet%20and%20legs">feet</a> have only three toes and a similarly reduced number of bones and associated foot muscles; emus are unique among birds in that their <a href="gastrocnemius%20muscle">gastrocnemius muscle</a>s in the back of the lower legs have four bellies instead of the usual three. The pelvic limb muscles of emus contribute a similar proportion of the total body mass as do the flight muscles of flying birds. When walking, the emu takes strides of about , but at full gallop, a stride can be as long as . Its legs are devoid of feathers and underneath its feet are thick, cushioned pads. Like the cassowary, the emu has sharp claws on its toes which are its major defensive attribute, and are used in combat to inflict wounds on opponents by kicking. The toe and claw total in length. The bill is quite small, measuring , and is soft, being adapted for grazing. Emus have good eyesight and hearing, which allows them to detect threats at some distance.
The neck of the emu is pale blue and shows through its sparse feathers. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; the shafts and the tips of the <a href="feather">feather</a>s are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner <a href="plumage">plumage</a> insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double <a href="rachis">rachis</a> emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.

The eyes of an emu are protected by <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>s. These are translucent, secondary eyelids that move horizontally from the inside edge of the eye to the outside edge. They function as visors to protect the eyes from the dust that is prevalent in windy arid regions. Emus have a <a href="trachea">trachea</a>l pouch, which becomes more prominent during the mating season. At more than in length, it is quite spacious; it has a thin wall, and an opening long.

Once common on the east coast of Australia, emus are now uncommon there; by contrast, the development of agriculture and the provision of water for stock in the interior of the continent have increased the range of the emu in arid regions. Emus live in various habitats across Australia both inland and near the coast. They are most common in areas of <a href="savannah">savannah</a> woodland and <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest, and least common in heavily populated districts and arid areas with annual precipitation of less than . Emus predominately travel in pairs, and while they can form large flocks, this is an atypical social behaviour that arises from the common need to move towards a new food source. Emus have been shown to travel long distances to reach abundant feeding areas. In Western Australia, emu movements follow a distinct seasonal pattern – north in summer and south in winter. On the east coast their wanderings seem to be more random and do not appear to follow a set pattern.

Emus are <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a> birds and spend their day foraging, preening their plumage with their beak, dust bathing and resting. They are generally gregarious birds apart from the breeding season, and while some forage, others remain vigilant to their mutual benefit. They are able to swim when necessary, although they rarely do so unless the area is flooded or they need to cross a river.
Emus begin to settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep continuously but rouse themselves several times during the night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsi</a> and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes or so and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.

The vocalisations of emus mostly consist of various booming and grunting sounds. The booming is created by the inflatable throat pouch; the pitch can be regulated by the bird and depends on the size of the aperture. Most of the booming is done by females; it is part of the courtship ritual, is used to announce the holding of territory and is issued as a threat to rivals. A high-intensity boom is audible away, while a low, more resonant call, produced during the breeding season, may at first attract mates and peaks while the male is incubating the eggs. Most of the grunting is done by males. It is used principally during the breeding season in territorial defence, as a threat to other males, during courtship and while the female is laying. Both sexes sometimes boom or grunt during threat displays or on encountering strange objects.

On very hot days, emus pant to <a href="Thermoregulation">maintain their body temperature</a>, their lungs work as <a href="evaporation">evaporative</a> coolers and, unlike some other species, the resulting low levels of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> in the blood do not appear to cause <a href="alkalosis">alkalosis</a>. For normal breathing in cooler weather, they have large, multifolded nasal passages. Cool air warms as it passes through into the lungs, extracting heat from the nasal region. On exhalation, the emu's cold nasal <a href="nasal%20concha">turbinates</a> condense moisture back out of the air and absorb it for reuse. As with other ratites, the emu has great <a href="Homeothermy">homeothermic</a> ability, and can maintain this status from . The <a href="Thermal%20neutral%20zone">thermoneutral zone</a> of emus lies between .

As with other ratites, emus have a relatively low <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a> compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to a higher rate of heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.

Emus forage in a <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> pattern and eat a variety of native and introduced plant species. The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>", "<a href="Casuarina">Casuarina</a>" and <a href="Poaceae">grasses</a> being favoured. They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and <a href="Cricket%20%28insect%29">crickets</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="cockroach">cockroach</a>es, <a href="Coccinellidae">ladybirds</a>, <a href="Bogong%20moth">bogong</a> and <a href="Heliothis">cotton-boll</a> moth larvae, ants, <a href="spider">spider</a>s and <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s. This provides a large part of their protein requirements. In Western Australia, food preferences have been observed in travelling emus; they eat seeds from "<a href="Acacia%20aneura">Acacia aneura</a>" until the rains arrive, after which they move on to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars; in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of "<a href="Cassia%20%28genus%29">Cassia</a>" and in spring, they consume <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s and the fruit of "<a href="Santalum%20acuminatum">Santalum acuminatum</a>", a sort of quandong. They are also known to feed on wheat, and any fruit or other crops that they can access, easily climbing over high fences if necessary. Emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seeds, which contributes to floral biodiversity. One undesirable effect of this occurred in Queensland in the early twentieth century when emus fed on the fruit of <a href="Opuntia">prickly pears</a> in the outback. They defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around, and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread. The cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth ("<a href="Cactoblastis%20cactorum%20">Cactoblastis cactorum </a>") whose larvae fed on the plant, one of the earliest examples of <a href="Biological%20pest%20control">biological control</a>.

<a href="Gastrolith">Small stones</a> are swallowed to assist in the grinding up and digestion of the plant material. Individual stones may weigh and the birds may have as much as in their <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a>s at one time. They also eat charcoal, although the reason for this is unclear. Captive emus have been known to eat shards of glass, marbles, car keys, jewellery, and nuts and bolts.

Emus drink infrequently, but ingest large amounts when the opportunity arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend to wait for the other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.

Emus form breeding pairs during the summer months of December and January, and may remain together for about five months. During this time, they stay in an area a few kilometres in diameter and it is believed they find and defend territory within this area. Both males and females put on weight during the breeding season, with the female becoming slightly heavier at between . Mating usually takes place between April and June; the exact timing is determined by the climate as the birds nest during the coolest part of the year. During the breeding season, males experience hormonal changes, including an increase in <a href="luteinizing%20hormone">luteinizing hormone</a> and <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> levels, and their <a href="testicle">testicle</a>s double in size.

Males construct a rough nest in a semi-sheltered hollow on the ground, using bark, grass, sticks and leaves to line it. The nest is almost always a flat surface rather than a segment of a sphere, although in cold conditions the nest is taller, up to tall, and more spherical to provide some extra heat retention. When other material is lacking, the bird sometimes uses a <a href="Triodia%20%28grass%29">spinifex tussock</a> a metre or so across, despite the prickly nature of the foliage. The nest can be placed on open ground or near a shrub or rock. The nest is usually placed in an area where the emu has a clear view of its surroundings and can detect approaching predators.

Female emus court the males; the female's plumage darkens slightly and the small patches of bare, featherless skin just below the eyes and near the beak turn turquoise-blue. The colour of the male's plumage remains unchanged, although the bare patches of skin also turn light blue. When courting, females stride around, pulling their neck back while puffing out their feathers and emitting low, monosyllabic calls that have been compared to drum beats. This calling can occur when males are out of sight or more than away. Once the male's attention has been gained, the female circles her prospective mate at a distance of . As she does this, she looks at him by turning her neck, while at the same time keeping her rump facing towards him. If the male shows interest in the parading female, he will move closer; the female continues the courtship by shuffling further away but continuing to circle him.

If a male is interested, he will stretch his neck and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his advances with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.

Females are more aggressive than males during the courtship period, often fighting for access to mates, with fights among females accounting for more than half the aggressive interactions during this period. If females court a male that already has a partner, the incumbent female will try to repel the competitor, usually by chasing and kicking. These interactions can be prolonged, lasting up to five hours, especially when the male being fought over is single and neither female has the advantage of incumbency. In these cases, the females typically intensify their calls and displays.

The sperm from a mating is stored by the female and can suffice to fertilise about six eggs. The pair mate every day or two, and every second or third day the female lays one of a clutch of five to fifteen very large, thick-shelled, green eggs. The shell is around thick, but rather thinner in northern regions according to indigenous Australians. The eggs are on average and weigh between . The maternal investment in the egg is considerable, and the proportion of yolk to <a href="Egg%20white">albumen</a>, at about 50%, is greater than would be predicted for a precocial egg of this size. This probably relates to the long <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubation</a> period which means the developing chick must consume greater resources before hatching. The first verified occurrence of genetically identical avian twins was demonstrated in the emu. The egg surface is granulated and pale green. During the incubation period, the egg turns dark green, although if the egg never hatches, it will turn white from the <a href="bleach">bleach</a>ing effect of the sun.
The male becomes broody after his mate starts laying, and may begin to incubate the eggs before the clutch is complete. From this time on, he does not eat, drink, or defecate, and stands only to turn the eggs, which he does about ten times a day. He develops a <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a>, a bare area of wrinkled skin which is in intimate contact with the eggs. Over the course of the eight-week incubation period, he will lose a third of his weight and will survive on stored body fat and on any morning dew that he can reach from the nest. As with many other Australian birds, such as the <a href="superb%20fairywren">superb fairywren</a>, infidelity is the norm for emus, despite the initial pair bond: once the male starts brooding, the female usually wanders off, and may mate with other males and lay in multiple nests; thus, as many as half the chicks in a brood may not be fathered by the incubating male, or even by either parent, as emus also exhibit <a href="Brood%20parasite">brood parasitism</a>.

Some females stay and defend the nest until the chicks start hatching, but most leave the nesting area completely to nest again; in a good season, a female emu may nest three times. If the parents stay together during the incubation period, they will take turns standing guard over the eggs while the other drinks and feeds within earshot. If it perceives a threat during this period, it will lie down on top of the nest and try to blend in with the similar-looking surrounds, and suddenly stand up to confront and scare the other party if it comes close.

Incubation takes 56 days, and the male stops incubating the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the <a href="precocial">precocial</a> emu chicks need to develop a capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will need to be able to cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.

Newly hatched chicks are active and can leave the nest within a few days of hatching. They stand about tall at first, weigh , and have distinctive brown and cream stripes for camouflage, which fade after three months or so. The male guards the growing chicks for up to seven months, teaching them how to find food. Chicks grow very quickly and are fully grown in five to six months; they may remain with their family group for another six months or so before they split up to breed in their second season. During their early life, the young emus are defended by their father, who adopts a belligerent stance towards other emus, including the mother. He does this by ruffling his feathers, emitting sharp grunts, and kicking his legs to drive off other animals. He can also bend his knees to crouch over smaller chicks to protect them. At night, he envelops his young with his feathers. As the young emus cannot travel far, the parents must choose an area with plentiful food in which to breed. In captivity, emus can live for upwards of ten years.

There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it may have faced numerous terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard "<a href="Megalania">Megalania</a>", the <a href="thylacine">thylacine</a>, and possibly other <a href="Dasyuromorphia">carnivorous marsupials</a>, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the <a href="dingo">dingo</a>, which was originally introduced by <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Aboriginals</a> thousands of years ago from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the dingo by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the dingo on its way down. The emu jumps as the dingo barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.

Despite the potential prey-predator relationship, the presence of predaceous dingoes does not appear to heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. <a href="Wedge-tailed%20eagle">Wedge-tailed eagle</a>s are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the dingo is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>, <a href="Perentie">monitor lizards</a>, introduced <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.

Emus can suffer from both external and internal <a href="Parasitism">parasites</a>, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than ostriches or rheas. External parasites include the louse "<a href="Dahlemhornia%20asymmetrica">Dahlemhornia asymmetrica</a>" and various other lice, <a href="tick">tick</a>s, <a href="mite">mite</a>s and <a href="Fly">flies</a>. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by <a href="coccidia">coccidia</a>n <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>, and the nematode "<a href="Trichostrongylus%20tenuis">Trichostrongylus tenuis</a>" infects the emu as well as a wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic <a href="diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a>. Other <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s are found in the trachea and bronchi; "<a href="Syngamus%20trachea">Syngamus trachea</a>" causing haemorrhagic <a href="tracheitis">tracheitis</a> and "<a href="Cyathostoma%20variegatum">Cyathostoma variegatum</a>" causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.

Emus were used as a source of food by indigenous Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple ("<a href="Duboisia%20hopwoodii">Duboisia hopwoodii</a>"), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.

The early European settlers killed emus to provide food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They also tried to prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the <a href="Emu%20War">Emu War</a> in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the <a href="Chandler%2C%20Western%20Australia">Chandler</a> and <a href="Walgoolan%2C%20Western%20Australia">Walgoolan</a> area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.

In the areas in which it was endemic, the emu was an important source of meat to <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal Australians</a>. They used the fat as <a href="bush%20medicine">bush medicine</a> and rubbed it into their skin. It served as a valuable lubricant, was used to oil wooden tools and utensils such as the <a href="Coolamon%20%28vessel%29">coolamon</a>, and was mixed with <a href="ochre">ochre</a> to make the traditional paint for ceremonial body adornment.

An example of how the emu was cooked comes from the <a href="Arrernte%20people">Arrernte</a> of Central Australia who called it "Kere ankerre":

The birds were a food and fuel source for early European settlers, and are now farmed, in Australia and elsewhere, for their meat, <a href="Emu%20oil">oil</a> and leather. Commercial emu farming started in Western Australia around 1970. The commercial industry in the country is based on stock bred in captivity, and all states except Tasmania have licensing requirements to protect wild emus. Outside Australia, emus are farmed on a large scale in North America, with about 1 million birds in the US, Peru, and China, and to a lesser extent in some other countries. Emus breed well in captivity, and are kept in large open pens to avoid the leg and digestive problems that arise from inactivity. They are typically fed on grain supplemented by grazing, and are slaughtered at 15 to 18 months.

The <a href="Salem%20district">Salem district</a> administration in India advised farmers in 2012 not to invest in the emu business which was being heavily promoted at the time; further investigation was needed to assess the profitability of farming the birds in India. In the United States, it was reported in 2013 that many ranchers had left the emu business; it was estimated that the number of growers had dropped from over five thousand in 1998 to one or two thousand in 2013. The remaining growers increasingly rely on sales of oil for their profit, although, leather, eggs, and meat are also sold.

Emus are farmed primarily for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and is comparable to other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other <a href="poultry">poultry</a>, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> to be a <a href="red%20meat">red meat</a> because its red colour and <a href="pH">pH</a> value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it is considered to be poultry.
Emu fat is rendered to produce oil for cosmetics, dietary supplements, and therapeutic products. The oil is obtained from the subcutaneous and retroperitoneal fat; the macerated adipose tissue is heated and the liquefied fat is filtered to get a clear oil. This consists mainly of <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s of which <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic acid</a> (42%), <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic</a> and <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic acid</a>s (21% each) are the most prominent components. It also contains various <a href="anti-oxidant">anti-oxidant</a>s, notably <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a>s and <a href="flavone">flavone</a>s.

There is some evidence that the oil has anti-inflammatory properties; however, there have not yet been extensive tests, and the USDA regards pure emu oil as an unapproved drug and highlighted it in a 2009 article entitled "How to Spot Health Fraud". Nevertheless, the oil has been linked to the easing of gastrointestinal inflammation, and tests on rats have shown that it has a significant effect in treating arthritis and joint pain, more so than olive or fish oils. It has been scientifically shown to improve the rate of wound healing, but the mechanism responsible for this effect is not understood. A 2008 study has claimed that emu oil has a better anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential than ostrich oil, and linked this to emu oil's higher proportion of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. While there are no scientific studies showing that emu oil is effective in humans, it is marketed and promoted as a <a href="dietary%20supplement">dietary supplement</a> with a wide variety of claimed health benefits. Commercially marketed emu oil supplements are poorly standardised.

Emu leather has a distinctive patterned surface, due to a raised area around the feather follicles in the skin; the leather is used in such items as wallets, handbags, shoes and clothes, often in combination with other leathers. The feathers and eggs are used in decorative arts and crafts. In particular, emptied emu eggs have been engraved with portraits, similar to cameos, and scenes of Australian native animals.

The emu has a prominent place in <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20mythology">Australian Aboriginal mythology</a>, including a <a href="creation%20myth">creation myth</a> of the <a href="Gamilaraay%20language">Yuwaalaraay</a> and other groups in New South Wales who say that the sun was made by throwing an emu's egg into the sky; the bird features in numerous <a href="Etiology">aetiological</a> stories told across a number of Aboriginal groups. One story from Western Australia holds that a man once annoyed a small bird, who responded by throwing a <a href="boomerang">boomerang</a>, severing the arms of the man and transforming him into a flightless emu. The <a href="Kurdaitcha">Kurdaitcha</a> man of Central Australia is said to wear sandals made of emu feathers to mask his footprints. Many Aboriginal language groups throughout Australia have a tradition that the dark dust lanes in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> represent a giant <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20astronomy%23Emu%20in%20the%20sky">emu in the sky</a>. Several of the <a href="Sydney%20rock%20engravings">Sydney rock engravings</a> depict emus, and the birds are mimicked in indigenous dances.

The emu is popularly but unofficially considered as a faunal emblem – the <a href="List%20of%20national%20birds">national bird</a> of Australia. It appears as a shield bearer on the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Australia">Coat of arms of Australia</a> with the <a href="red%20kangaroo">red kangaroo</a>, and as a part of the Arms also appears on the Australian <a href="Coins%20of%20the%20Australian%20dollar">50 cent coin</a>. It has featured on numerous Australian <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a>s, including a <a href="federation%20of%20Australia">pre-federation</a> New South Wales 100th Anniversary issue from 1888, which featured a 2 <a href="penny">pence</a> blue emu stamp, a 36 cent stamp released in 1986, and a $1.35 stamp released in 1994. The hats of the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a> are decorated with emu feather plumes.

There are around six hundred <a href="Gazetteer%20of%20Australia">gazetted</a> places in Australia with "emu" in their title, including mountains, lakes, hills, plains, creeks and waterholes. During the 19th and 20th centuries, many Australian companies and household products were named after the bird. In Western Australia, <a href="Emu%20%28beer%29">Emu beer</a> has been produced since the early 20th century and the <a href="Swan%20Brewery">Swan Brewery</a> continues to produce a range of beers branded as "Emu". The quarterly peer-reviewed journal of the <a href="Royal%20Australasian%20Ornithologists%20Union">Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union</a>, also known as Birds Australia, is entitled "<a href="Emu%20%28journal%29">Emu: Austral Ornithology</a>".

The comedian <a href="Rod%20Hull">Rod Hull</a> featured a wayward <a href="Emu%20%28puppet%29">emu puppet</a> in his act for many years and the bird returned to the small screen in the hands of <a href="Toby%20Hull">his son</a> after the puppeteer's death in 1999.

In <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a>'s "Handbook to the Birds of Australia", first published in 1865, he lamented the loss of the emu from Tasmania, where it had become rare and has since become extinct; he noted that emus were no longer common in the vicinity of Sydney and proposed that the species be given protected status. In the 1930s, emu killings in Western Australia peaked at 57,000, and <a href="Culling">culls</a> were also mounted in Queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage. In the 1960s, <a href="Bounty%20%28reward%29">bounties</a> were still being paid in Western Australia for killing emus, but since then, wild emus have been granted formal protection under the "<a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>". Their occurrence range is between , and a 1992 census suggested that their total population was between 630,000 and 725,000. , the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> considers their population trend to be stable and assesses their conservation status as being of <a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a>. The isolated emu population of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20North%20Coast">New South Wales North Coast Bioregion</a> and <a href="Port%20Stephens%20Council">Port Stephens</a> is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Government.

Although the population of emus on mainland Australia is thought to be higher now than it was before European settlement, some local populations are at risk of extinction. The threats faced by emus include the clearance and fragmentation of areas of suitable habitat, deliberate slaughter, collisions with vehicles and predation of the eggs and young.

V. Gordon Childe

Vere Gordon Childe (14 April 1892 – 19 October 1957) was an Australian <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a> who specialized in the study of <a href="European%20prehistory">European prehistory</a>. He spent most of his life in the United Kingdom, working as an academic for the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> and then the <a href="UCL%20Institute%20of%20Archaeology">Institute of Archaeology</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, and wrote twenty-six books during his career. Initially an early proponent of <a href="culture-historical%20archaeology">culture-historical archaeology</a>, he later became the first exponent of <a href="Marxist%20archaeology">Marxist archaeology</a> in the Western world.

Born in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> to a middle-class English migrant family, Childe studied <a href="classics">classics</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a> before moving to England to study <a href="classical%20archaeology">classical archaeology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>. There, he embraced the <a href="socialist">socialist</a> movement and campaigned against the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, viewing it as a conflict waged by competing <a href="imperialist">imperialist</a>s to the detriment of Europe's working class. Returning to Australia in 1917, he was prevented from working in academia because of his socialist activism, instead working for the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Branch%29">Labor Party</a> as the private secretary of the politician <a href="John%20Storey%20%28politician%29">John Storey</a>. Growing critical of Labor, he wrote an analysis of their policies and joined the far-left <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>. Emigrating to London in 1921, he became librarian of the <a href="Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute">Royal Anthropological Institute</a> and journeyed across Europe to pursue his research into the continent's prehistory, publishing his findings in academic papers and books. In doing so he introduced the continental European concept of an <a href="archaeological%20culture">archaeological culture</a>—the idea that a recurring <a href="Assemblage%20%28archaeology%29">assemblage of artefacts</a> demarcates a distinct cultural group—to the British archaeological community.

From 1927 to 1946 he worked as the Abercromby Professor of Archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, and then from 1947 to 1957 as the director of the Institute of Archaeology, London. During this period he oversaw the <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavation</a> of archaeological sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland, focusing on the society of <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> by excavating the settlement of <a href="Skara%20Brae">Skara Brae</a> and the <a href="chambered%20tomb">chambered tomb</a>s of <a href="Maeshowe">Maeshowe</a> and <a href="Quoyness%20chambered%20cairn">Quoyness</a>. In these decades he published prolifically, producing excavation reports, journal articles, and books. With <a href="Stuart%20Piggott">Stuart Piggott</a> and <a href="Grahame%20Clark">Grahame Clark</a> he co-founded <a href="The%20Prehistoric%20Society">The Prehistoric Society</a> in 1934, becoming its first president. Remaining a committed socialist, he embraced <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, and—rejecting culture-historical approaches—used <a href="Historical%20materialism">Marxist ideas</a> as an interpretative framework for archaeological data. He became a sympathiser with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and visited the country on several occasions, although he grew sceptical of Soviet foreign policy following the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian Revolution of 1956</a>. His beliefs resulted in him being legally barred from entering the United States, despite being repeatedly invited to lecture there. Upon retirement, he returned to Australia's <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a>, where he committed suicide.

One of the best-known and most widely cited archaeologists of the twentieth century, Childe became known as the "great synthesizer" for his work integrating regional research with a broader picture of Near Eastern and European prehistory. He was also renowned for his emphasis on the role of revolutionary technological and economic developments in human society, such as the <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a> and the <a href="Urban%20Revolution">Urban Revolution</a>, reflecting the influence of Marxist ideas concerning societal development. Although many of his interpretations have since been discredited, he remains widely respected among archaeologists.

Childe was born on 14 April 1892 in Sydney. He was the only surviving child of the Reverend Stephen Henry Childe (1844–1923) and Harriet Eliza (1853–1910), a middle-class couple of <a href="English%20Australians">English descent</a>. The son of an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> priest, Stephen Childe was ordained into the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> in 1867 after gaining a BA from the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>. Becoming a teacher, in 1871 he married Mary Ellen Latchford, with whom he had five children. They moved to Australia in 1878, where Mary died. In 1886 Stephen married Harriet, an Englishwoman from a wealthy background who had moved to Australia as a child. Gordon Childe was raised alongside five half-siblings at his father's palatial country house, the Chalet Fontenelle, in the township of <a href="Wentworth%20Falls%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wentworth Falls</a> in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a>, west of Sydney. Reverend Stephen Childe worked as the minister for St. Thomas' Parish, but proved unpopular, arguing with his congregation and taking unscheduled holidays.

A sickly child, Gordon Childe was educated at home for several years, before receiving a private-school education in <a href="North%20Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">North Sydney</a>. In 1907, he began attending <a href="Sydney%20Church%20of%20England%20Grammar%20School">Sydney Church of England Grammar School</a>, gaining his Junior Matriculation in 1909 and Senior Matriculation in 1910. At school he studied ancient history, French, Greek, Latin, geometry, algebra, and trigonometry, achieving good marks in all subjects, but he was bullied because of his physical appearance and unathletic physique. In July 1910 his mother died; his father soon remarried. Childe's relationship with his father was strained, particularly following his mother's death, and they disagreed on religion and politics: the Reverend was a devout Christian and <a href="social%20conservatism">conservative</a> while his son was an <a href="atheist">atheist</a> and <a href="socialist">socialist</a>.

Childe studied for a degree in <a href="classics">classics</a> at the University of Sydney in 1911; although focusing on written sources, he first came across <a href="classical%20archaeology">classical archaeology</a> through the work of the archaeologists <a href="Heinrich%20Schliemann">Heinrich Schliemann</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Evans">Arthur Evans</a>. At university, he became an active member of the <a href="debating%20society">debating society</a>, at one point arguing in favour of the proposition that "socialism is desirable". Increasingly interested in socialism, he read the works of <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Engels">Friedrich Engels</a>, as well as those of the philosopher <a href="Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel">G. W. F. Hegel</a>, whose <a href="dialectics">dialectics</a> heavily influenced <a href="Marxist%20theory">Marxist theory</a>. At university, he became a great friend of fellow undergraduate and future judge and politician <a href="Herbert%20Vere%20Evatt">Herbert Vere Evatt</a>, with whom he remained in lifelong contact. Ending his studies in 1913, Childe graduated the following year with various honours and prizes, including Professor <a href="Francis%20Anderson%20%28philosopher%29">Francis Anderson</a>'s prize for philosophy.

Wishing to continue his education, he gained a £200 Cooper Graduate Scholarship in Classics, allowing him to pay the tuition fees at <a href="The%20Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">Queen's College</a>, part of the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, England. He set sail for Britain aboard the <a href="SS%20Orsova%20%281908%29">SS "Orsova"</a> in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. At Queen's, Childe was entered for a diploma in classical archaeology followed by a <a href="Literae%20Humaniores">Literae Humaniores</a> degree, although he never completed the former. Whilst there, he studied under <a href="John%20Beazley">John Beazley</a> and Arthur Evans, the latter being Childe's supervisor. In 1915, he published his first <a href="academic%20paper">academic paper</a>, "On the Date and Origin of <a href="Minyan%20ware">Minyan Ware</a>", in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Hellenic%20Studies">Journal of Hellenic Studies</a>", and the following year produced his B.Litt. thesis, "The Influence of Indo-Europeans in Prehistoric Greece", displaying his interest in combining philological and archaeological evidence.

At Oxford he became actively involved with the socialist movement, antagonising the conservative university authorities. Becoming a noted member of the left-wing <a href="reformism">reformist</a> Oxford University Fabian Society, he was there in 1915 when it changed its name to the Oxford University Socialist Society, following a split from the <a href="Fabian%20Society">Fabian Society</a>. His best friend and flatmate was <a href="Rajani%20Palme%20Dutt">Rajani Palme Dutt</a>, a fervent socialist and Marxist. The pair often got drunk and tested each other's knowledge about classical history late at night. With Britain in the midst of World War I, many socialists refused to fight for the British Army despite the <a href="Recruitment%20to%20the%20British%20Army%20during%20the%20First%20World%20War%23Conscription">government-imposed conscription</a>. They believed that the ruling classes of Europe's <a href="imperialism">imperialist</a> nations were waging the war for their own interests at the expense of the working classes; these socialists thought that <a href="class%20conflict">class war</a> was the only conflict they should be concerned with. Dutt was imprisoned for refusing to fight, and Childe campaigned for the release of both him and other socialists and pacifist <a href="conscientious%20objectors">conscientious objectors</a>. Childe was never required to enlist in the army, most likely because of his poor health and eyesight. His anti-war sentiments concerned the authorities; the intelligence agency <a href="MI5">MI5</a> opening a file on him, his mail was intercepted, and he was kept under observation.

Childe returned to Australia in August 1917. As a known socialist agitator, he was placed under surveillance by the security services, who intercepted his mail. In 1918 he became senior resident tutor at <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20College%2C%20Sydney">St Andrew's College, Sydney University</a>, joining Sydney's socialist and anti-conscription movement. In Easter 1918 he spoke at the Third Inter-State Peace Conference, an event organised by the Australian Union of Democratic Control for the Avoidance of War, a group opposed to Prime Minister <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a>'s plans to introduce conscription. The conference had a prominent socialist emphasis; its report argued that the best hope to end international war was the "abolition of the Capitalist System". News of Childe's participation reached the Principal of St Andrew's College, who forced Childe to resign despite much opposition from staff.

Staff members secured him work as a tutor in ancient history in the Department of Tutorial Classes, but the university chancellor <a href="William%20Portus%20Cullen">William Cullen</a> feared that he would promote socialism to students and fired him. The leftist community condemned this as an infringement of Childe's <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a>, and the centre-left politicians <a href="William%20McKell">William McKell</a> and T.J. Smith raised the issue in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament of Australia</a>. Moving to <a href="Maryborough%2C%20Queensland">Maryborough</a>, Queensland, in October 1918, Childe took up employment teaching Latin at the <a href="Maryborough%20State%20High%20School">Maryborough Grammar School</a>. Here, too, his political affiliations became known, and he was subject to an opposition campaign from local conservative groups and the "Maryborough Chronicle", resulting in abuse from some pupils. He soon resigned.

Realising he would be barred from an academic career by the university authorities, Childe sought employment within the leftist movement. In August 1919, he became private secretary and speech writer to the politician <a href="John%20Storey%20%28politician%29">John Storey</a>, a prominent member of the centre-left <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Branch%29">Labor Party</a> then in opposition to New South Wales' <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20%28Australia%29">Nationalist Party</a> government. Representing the Sydney suburb of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Balmain">Balmain</a> on the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Assembly">New South Wales Legislative Assembly</a>, Storey became <a href="Premiers%20of%20the%20Australian%20states">state premier</a> in 1920 when Labor achieved electoral victory. Working within the Labor Party allowed Childe greater insight into its workings; the deeper his involvement, the more he became critical of Labor, believing that once in political office they betrayed their socialist ideals and moved to a centrist, pro-capitalist stance. He joined the radical leftist <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>, which at the time was banned in Australia. In 1921 Storey sent Childe to London to keep the British press updated about developments in New South Wales, but Storey died in December and an ensuing New South Wales election restored a Nationalist government under <a href="George%20Fuller%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Fuller</a>'s premiership. Fuller thought Childe's job unnecessary, and in early 1922 terminated his employment.

Unable to find an academic job in Australia, Childe remained in Britain, renting a room in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, <a href="Central%20London">Central London</a>, and spending much time studying at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute">Royal Anthropological Institute</a> library. An active member of London's socialist movement, he associated with leftists at the <a href="1917%20Club">1917 Club</a> in <a href="Gerrard%20Street%2C%20London">Gerrard Street</a>, <a href="Soho">Soho</a>. He befriended members of the Marxist <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist Party of Great Britain</a> (CPGB) and contributed to their publication, "<a href="Labour%20Monthly">Labour Monthly</a>", but had not yet openly embraced Marxism. Having earned a good reputation as a prehistorian, he was invited to other parts of Europe to study prehistoric artefacts. In 1922 he travelled to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, Austria to examine unpublished material about the <a href="Cucuteni%E2%80%93Trypillia%20culture">painted Neolithic pottery</a> from <a href="Schipenitz">Schipenitz</a>, <a href="Bukovina">Bukovina</a> held in the Prehistoric Department of the <a href="Naturhistorisches%20Museum">Natural History Museum</a>; he published his findings in the 1923 volume of the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute">Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute</a>". Childe used this excursion to visit museums in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, bringing them to the attention of British archaeologists in a 1922 article in "<a href="Man%20%28journal%29">Man</a>". After returning to London, in 1922 Childe became a private secretary for three <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Members of Parliament</a>, including <a href="John%20Hope%20Simpson">John Hope Simpson</a> and <a href="Frank%20Gray">Frank Gray</a>, both members of the centre-left <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>. Supplementing this income, Childe worked as a translator for the publishers <a href="Kegan%20Paul%2C%20Trench%2C%20Tr%C3%BCbner%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co.</a> and occasionally lectured in prehistory at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>.

In 1923 the London Labour Company published his first book, "How Labour Governs". Examining the Australian Labor Party and its connections to the <a href="Australian%20labour%20movement">Australian labour movement</a>, it reflects Childe's disillusionment with the party, arguing that once elected, its politicians abandoned their socialist ideals in favour of personal comfort. Childe's biographer Sally Green noted that "How Labour Governs" was of particular significance at the time because it was published just as the British <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> was emerging as a major player in British politics, threatening the two-party dominance of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> and Liberals; <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">in 1923</a> Labour formed <a href="First%20MacDonald%20ministry">their first government</a>. Childe planned a sequel expanding on his ideas, but it was never published.

In May 1923 he visited the museums in <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, and <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> to study their prehistoric artefact collections; that year he became a member of the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1925, he became the Institute's librarian, one of the only archaeological jobs available in Britain, through which he cementing connections with scholars across Europe. His job made him well known in Britain's small archaeological community; he developed a great friendship with <a href="O.%20G.%20S.%20Crawford">O. G. S. Crawford</a>, the archaeological officer to the <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a>, influencing Crawford's move toward socialism and Marxism.

In 1925, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co published Childe's second book, "The Dawn of European Civilisation", in which he synthesised the data about European prehistory that he had been exploring for several years. An important work, it was released when there were few professional archaeologists across Europe and most museums focused on their locality; "The Dawn" was a rare example that looked at the larger picture across the continent. Its importance was also due to the fact that it introduced the concept of the <a href="archaeological%20culture">archaeological culture</a> into Britain from continental scholarship, thereby aiding in the development of <a href="culture-historical%20archaeology">culture-historical archaeology</a>. Childe later stated that the book "aimed at distilling from archaeological remains a preliterate substitute for the conventional politico-military history with cultures, instead of statesmen, as actors, and migrations in place of battles." In 1926 he published a successor, "The Aryans: A Study of Indo-European Origins", exploring the theory that <a href="Indo-European%20migrations">civilisation diffused northward and westward into Europe</a> from the Near East via an <a href="Indo-European%20linguistic%20group">Indo-European linguistic group</a> known as the <a href="Indo-Iranian%20peoples">Aryans</a>; with the ensuing racial use of the term "Aryan" by the German <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>, Childe avoided mention of the book. In these works, Childe accepted a moderate version of <a href="diffusionism">diffusionism</a>, the idea that cultural developments diffuse from one place to others, rather than being independently developed in many places. In contrast to the hyper-diffusionism of <a href="Grafton%20Elliot%20Smith">Grafton Elliot Smith</a>, Childe suggested that although most cultural traits spread from one society to another, it was possible for the same traits to develop independently in different places.

In 1927, Scotland's <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> offered Childe the post of Abercromby Professor of Archaeology, a new position established in the bequest of the prehistorian <a href="John%20Abercromby%2C%205th%20Baron%20Abercromby">Lord Abercromby</a>. Although sad to leave London, Childe took the job, moving to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in September 1927. Aged 35, Childe became the "only academic prehistorian in a teaching post in Scotland". Many Scottish archaeologists disliked Childe, regarding him as an outsider with no specialism in Scottish prehistory; he wrote to a friend that "I live here in an atmosphere of hatred and envy." He nevertheless made friends in Edinburgh, including archaeologists like <a href="W.%20Lindsay%20Scott">W. Lindsay Scott</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Curle">Alexander Curle</a>, <a href="J.%20G.%20Callender">J. G. Callender</a>, and <a href="Walter%20Grant%20%28archaeologist%29">Walter Grant</a>, as well as non-archaeologists like the physicist <a href="Charles%20Galton%20Darwin">Charles Galton Darwin</a>, becoming godfather to Darwin's youngest son. Initially lodging at <a href="Liberton%2C%20Scotland">Liberton</a>, he moved into the semi-residential Hotel de Vere on Eglington Crescent.

At Edinburgh University, Childe focused on research rather than teaching. He was reportedly kind to his students but had difficulty talking to large audiences; many students were confused that his <a href="BSc">BSc</a> degree course in archaeology was structured counter-chronologically, dealing with the more recent <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> first before progressing backward to the <a href="Palaeolithic">Palaeolithic</a>. Founding the Edinburgh League of Prehistorians, he took his more enthusiastic students on excavations and invited guest lecturers to visit. An early proponent of <a href="experimental%20archaeology">experimental archaeology</a>, he involved his students in his experiments; in 1937 he used this method to investigate the <a href="Vitrified%20fort">vitrification process evident at several Iron Age forts</a> in northern Britain.

Childe regularly travelled to London to visit friends, among whom was <a href="Stuart%20Piggott">Stuart Piggott</a>, another influential British archaeologist who succeeded Childe as Edinburgh's Abercromby Professor. Another friend was <a href="Grahame%20Clark">Grahame Clark</a>, whom Childe befriended and encouraged in his research. The trio were elected onto the committee of the Prehistoric Society of East Anglia. At Clark's suggestion, in 1935 they used their influence to convert it into a nationwide organisation, the <a href="Prehistoric%20Society">Prehistoric Society</a>, of which Childe was elected president. Membership of the group grew rapidly; in 1935 it had 353 members and by 1938 it had 668.

Childe spent much time in continental Europe and attended many conferences there, having learned several European languages. In 1935, he first visited the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, spending 12 days in <a href="Leningrad">Leningrad</a> and <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>; impressed with the <a href="socialist%20state">socialist state</a>, he was particularly interested in the social role of Soviet archaeology. Returning to Britain, he became a vocal Soviet sympathiser and avidly read the CPGB's "<a href="Morning%20Star%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Worker</a>", although was heavily critical of certain Soviet policies, particularly the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a> with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. His socialist convictions led to an early denunciation of European <a href="fascism">fascism</a>, and he was outraged by the <a href="Ahnenerbe">Nazi co-option of prehistoric archaeology</a> to glorify their own conceptions of an Aryan racial heritage. Supportive of the British government's decision to fight the fascist powers in the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, he thought it probable that he was <a href="The%20Black%20Book">on a Nazi blacklist</a> and made the decision to drown himself in a canal should the Nazis conquer Britain. Though opposing fascist Germany and Italy, he also criticised the imperialist, capitalist governments of the United Kingdom and United States: he repeatedly described the latter as being full of "loathsome fascist hyenas". This did not prevent him from visiting the U.S. In 1936 he addressed a Conference of Arts and Sciences marking the tercentenary of <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>; there, the university awarded him an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">Doctor of Letters</a> degree. He returned in 1939, lecturing at Harvard, the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>.

Childe's university position meant that he was obliged to undertake archaeological excavations, something he loathed and believed that he did poorly. Students agreed, but recognised his "genius for interpreting evidence". Unlike many contemporaries, he was scrupulous with writing up and publishing his findings, producing almost annual reports for the "<a href="Proceedings%20of%20the%20Society%20of%20Antiquaries%20of%20Scotland">Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</a>" and, unusually, ensuring that he acknowledged the help of every digger.

His best known excavation was undertaken from 1928 to 1930 at <a href="Skara%20Brae">Skara Brae</a> in the <a href="Orkney%20Islands">Orkney Islands</a>. Having uncovered a well-preserved Neolithic village, in 1931 he published the excavation results in a book titled "Skara Brae". He made an error of interpretation, erroneously attributing the site to the Iron Age. During the excavation, Childe got on particularly well with the locals; for them, he was "every inch the professor" because of his eccentric appearance and habits. In 1932, Childe, collaborating with the <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a> <a href="C.%20Daryll%20Forde">C. Daryll Forde</a>, excavated two Iron Age <a href="hillfort">hillfort</a>s at <a href="Earn%27s%20Hugh">Earn's Hugh</a> on the <a href="Berwickshire">Berwickshire</a> coast, while in June 1935 he excavated a <a href="promontory%20fort">promontory fort</a> at <a href="Larriban">Larriban</a> near to <a href="Knocksoghey">Knocksoghey</a> in Northern Ireland. Together with Wallace Thorneycroft, another Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, Childe excavated two vitrified Iron Age forts in Scotland, at <a href="Finavon">Finavon</a>, <a href="Angus%2C%20Scotland">Angus</a> (1933–34) and at <a href="Rahoy">Rahoy</a>, <a href="Argyllshire">Argyllshire</a> (1936–37). In 1938, he and Walter Grant oversaw excavations at the Neolithic settlement of <a href="Rinyo">Rinyo</a>; their investigation ceased during the Second World War, but resumed in 1946.

Childe continued writing and publishing books on archaeology, beginning with a series of works following on from "The Dawn of European Civilisation" and "The Aryans" by compiling and synthesising data from across Europe. First was "The Most Ancient Near East" (1928), which assembled information from across Mesopotamia and India, setting a background from which the spread of farming and other technologies into Europe could be understood. This was followed by "The Danube in Prehistory" (1929) which examined the archaeology along the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> river, recognising it as the natural boundary dividing the Near East from Europe; Childe believed that it was via the Danube that new technologies travelled westward. Although Childe had used culture-historical approaches in earlier publications, "The Danube in Prehistory" was his first publication to provide a specific definition of the concept of an <a href="archaeological%20culture">archaeological culture</a>, revolutionising the theoretical approach of British archaeology.

Childe's next book, "The Bronze Age" (1930), dealt with the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> in Europe, and displayed his increasing adoption of Marxist theory as a means of understanding how society functioned and changed. He believed that metal was the first indispensable article of commerce, and that metal-smiths were therefore full-time professionals who lived off the <a href="social%20surplus">social surplus</a>. In 1933, Childe travelled to Asia, visiting Iraq—a place he thought "great fun"—and India, which he felt was "detestable" due to the hot weather and extreme poverty. Touring archaeological sites in the two countries, he opined that much of what he had written in "The Most Ancient Near East" was outdated, going on to produce "New Light on the Most Ancient Near East" (1935), in which he applied his Marxist-influenced ideas about the economy to his conclusions.

After publishing "Prehistory of Scotland" (1935), Childe produced one of the defining books of his career, "Man Makes Himself" (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed through a series of technological, economic, and social revolutions. These included the <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the <a href="Urban%20Revolution">Urban Revolution</a>, when society moved from small towns to the first cities, and up to more recent times, when the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> changed the nature of production.

After the outbreak of the Second World War, Childe was unable to travel across Europe, instead focusing on writing "Prehistoric Communities of the British Isles" (1940). Childe's pessimism regarding the war's outcome led him to believe that "European Civilization – Capitalist and <a href="Stalinist">Stalinist</a> alike – was irrevocably headed for a Dark Age." In this state of mind he produced a sequel to "Man Makes Himself" titled "What Happened in History" (1942), an account of human history from the Palaeolithic through to the fall of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Although <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> offered to publish the work, he released it through <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a> because they could sell it at a cheaper price, something he believed pivotal in providing knowledge for those he called "the masses". This was followed by two short works, "Progress and Archaeology" (1944) and "The Story of Tools" (1944), the latter an explicitly Marxist text written for the <a href="Young%20Communist%20League">Young Communist League</a>.

In 1946, Childe left Edinburgh to take up the position as director and professor of European prehistory at the <a href="UCL%20Institute%20of%20Archaeology">Institute of Archaeology</a> (IOA) in London. Anxious to return to the capital, he had kept silent over his disapproval of government policies so that he would not be prevented from getting the job. He took up residence in the <a href="Isokon%20building">Isokon building</a> near to <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>.

Located in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Lodge%2C%20London">St John's Lodge</a> in the Inner Circle of <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a>, the IOA was founded in 1937, largely by the archaeologist <a href="Mortimer%20Wheeler">Mortimer Wheeler</a>, but until 1946 relied primarily on volunteer lecturers. Childe's relationship with the conservative Wheeler was strained, for their personalities were very different; Wheeler was an extrovert who pursued the limelight, was an efficient administrator, and was intolerant of others' shortcomings, while Childe lacked administrative skill, and was tolerant of others. Childe was popular among the Institute's students, who saw him as a kindly eccentric; they commissioned a bust of Childe from <a href="Marjorie%20Maitland%20Howard">Marjorie Maitland Howard</a>. His lecturing was nevertheless considered poor, as he often mumbled and walked into an adjacent room to find something while continuing to talk. He further confused his students by referring to the socialist states of eastern Europe by their full official titles, and by referring to towns by their Slavonic names rather than the names with which they were better known in English. He was deemed better at giving tutorials and seminars, where he devoted more time to interacting with his students. As Director, Childe was not obliged to excavate, though he did undertake projects at the Orkney Neolithic burial tombs of <a href="Quoyness">Quoyness</a> (1951) and <a href="Maes%20Howe">Maes Howe</a> (1954–55).

In 1949 he and Crawford resigned as fellows of the <a href="Society%20of%20Antiquaries%20of%20London">Society of Antiquaries</a>. They did so to protest the selection of <a href="James%20Mann%20%28curator%29">James Mann</a>—keeper of the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>'s armouries—as the society's president, believing that Wheeler, a professional archaeologist, was a better choice. Childe joined the editorial board of the periodical "<a href="Past%20%26amp%3B%20Present%20%28journal%29">Past & Present</a>", founded by Marxist historians in 1952. During the early 1950s, he also became a board member for "<a href="Modern%20Quarterly%20%28British%20journal%29">The Modern Quarterly</a>"—later "The Marxist Quarterly"—working alongside the board's chairman Rajani Palme Dutt, his best friend and flatmate from his Oxford days. He authored occasional articles for Palme Dutt's socialist journal, the "<a href="Labour%20Monthly">Labour Monthly</a>", but disagreed with him over the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian Revolution of 1956</a>; Palme Dutt defended the Soviet Union's decision to quash the revolution using military force, but Childe, like many Western socialists, strongly opposed with it. The event made Childe abandon faith in the Soviet leadership, but not in socialism or Marxism. He retained a love of the Soviet Union, having visiting on multiple occasions; he was also involved with a CPBG satellite body, the Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR, and served as president of its National History and Archaeology Section from the early 1950s until his death.

In April 1956, Childe was awarded the Gold Medal of the Society of Antiquaries for his services to archaeology. He was invited to lecture in the United States on multiple occasions, by <a href="Robert%20Braidwood">Robert Braidwood</a>, <a href="William%20Duncan%20Strong">William Duncan Strong</a>, and <a href="Leslie%20White">Leslie White</a>, but the <a href="U.S.%20State%20Department">U.S. State Department</a> barred him from entering the country due to his Marxist beliefs. Whilst working at the institute, Childe continued writing and publishing books dealing with archaeology. "History" (1947) promoted a Marxist view of the past and reaffirmed Childe's belief that prehistory and literate history must be viewed together, whilst "Prehistoric Migrations" (1950) displayed his views on moderate diffusionism. In 1946 he also published a paper in the "<a href="Southwestern%20Journal%20of%20Anthropology">Southwestern Journal of Anthropology</a>". This was "Archaeology and Anthropology", which argued that the disciplines of archaeology and anthropology should be used in tandem, an approach that would be widely accepted in the decades following his death.

In the summer of 1956, Childe retired as IOA director a year prematurely. European archaeology had rapidly expanded during the 1950s, leading to increasing specialisation and making the synthesising that Childe was known for increasingly difficult. That year, the Institute was moving to <a href="Gordon%20Square">Gordon Square</a>, Bloomsbury, and Childe wanted to give his successor, <a href="W.F.%20Grimes">W.F. Grimes</a>, a fresh start in the new surroundings. To commemorate his achievements, the "<a href="Proceedings%20of%20the%20Prehistoric%20Society">Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society</a>" published a "<a href="Festschrift">Festschrift</a>" edition on the last day of his directorship containing contributions from friends and colleagues from all over the world, something that touched Childe deeply. Upon his retirement, he told many friends that he planned to return to Australia, visit his relatives, and commit suicide; he was terrified of becoming old, senile, and a burden on society, and suspected that he had <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. Subsequent commentators suggested that a core reason for his suicidal desires was a loss of faith in Marxism following the Hungarian Revolution and <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>'s <a href="On%20the%20Personality%20Cult%20and%20its%20Consequences">denouncement of Joseph Stalin</a>, although <a href="Bruce%20Trigger">Bruce Trigger</a> dismissed this explanation, noting that while Childe was critical of Soviet foreign policy, he never saw the state and Marxism as synonymous.

Sorting out his affairs, Childe donated most of his library and all of his estate to the Institute. After a February 1957 holiday visiting archaeological sites in Gibraltar and Spain, he sailed to Australia, reaching Sydney on his 65th birthday. Here, the University of Sydney, which had once barred him from working there, awarded him an honorary degree. He travelled around the country for six months, visiting family members and old friends, but was unimpressed by Australian society, believing it reactionary, increasingly suburban, and poorly educated. Looking into Australian prehistory, he found it a profitable field for research, and lectured to archaeological and leftist groups on this and other topics, taking to Australian radio to criticise academic racism towards <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australian</a>s.

Writing personal letters to many friends, he sent one to Grimes, requesting that it not be opened until 1968. In it, he described how he feared old age, and stated his intention to take his own life, remarking that "Life ends best when one is happy and strong." On 19 October 1957, Childe went to the area of Govett's Leap in <a href="Blackheath%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Blackheath</a>, an area of the Blue Mountains where he had grown up. Leaving his hat, spectacles, compass, pipe, and Mackintosh atop the cliffs, he fell 1000 feet (300 m) to his death. A coroner ruled his death as accidental, but his death was recognised as suicide when his letter to Grimes was published in the 1980s. His remains were cremated at the <a href="Northern%20Suburbs%20Crematorium">Northern Suburbs Crematorium</a>, and his name added to a small family plaque in the Crematorium Gardens. Following his death, an "unprecedented" level of tributes and memorials were issued by the archaeological community, all testifying to his status as Europe's "greatest prehistorian and a wonderful human being".

The biographer Sally Green noted that Childe's beliefs were "never dogmatic, always idiosyncratic" and "continually changing throughout his life".
His <a href="archaeological%20theory">theoretical approach</a> blended together <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>, <a href="diffusionism">diffusionism</a>, and <a href="Structural%20functionalism">functionalism</a>. Childe was critical of the <a href="evolutionary%20archaeology">evolutionary archaeology</a> dominant during the nineteenth century. He believed that archaeologists who adhered to it placed a greater emphasis on artefacts than on the humans who had made them. Like most archaeologists in Western Europe and the United States at the time, Childe did not regard humans as naturally inventive or inclined to change; thus, he tended to perceive social change in terms of diffusion and migration rather than internal development or cultural evolution.

During the decades in which Childe was working, most archaeologists adhered to the <a href="three-age%20system">three-age system</a> first developed by the Danish antiquarian <a href="Christian%20J%C3%BCrgensen%20Thomsen">Christian Jürgensen Thomsen</a>. This system rested upon an evolutionary chronology that divided prehistory into the <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>, <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, and <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, but Childe highlighted that many of the world's societies were still effectively Stone Age in their technology. He nevertheless saw it as a useful model for analysing socio-economic development when combined with a Marxist framework. He therefore used technological criteria for dividing up prehistory into three ages, but instead used economic criteria for sub-dividing the Stone Age into the <a href="Palaeolithic">Palaeolithic</a> and <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>, rejecting the concept of the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> as useless. Informally, he adopted the division of past societies into the framework of "savagery", "barbarism", and "civilisation" that Engels had employed.

In the early part of his career, Childe was a proponent of the <a href="Culture-historical%20archaeology">culture-historical approach to archaeology</a>, coming to be seen as one of its "founders and chief exponents". Culture-historical archaeology revolved around the concept of "<a href="Archaeological%20culture">culture</a>", which it had adopted from anthropology. This was "a major turning point in the history of the discipline", allowing archaeologists to look at the past through a spatial dynamic rather than a temporal one. Childe adopted the concept of "culture" from the German philologist and archaeologist <a href="Gustaf%20Kossinna">Gustaf Kossinna</a>, although this influence might have been mediated through <a href="Leon%20Koz%C5%82owski">Leon Kozłowski</a>, a Polish archaeologist who had adopted Kossina's ideas and who had a close association with Childe. Trigger expressed the view that while adopting Kossina's basic concept, Childe displayed "no awareness" of the "racist connotations" that Kossina had given it.

Childe's adherence to the culture-historical model is apparent in three of his books—"The Dawn of European Civilisation" (1925), "The Aryans" (1926) and "The Most Ancient East" (1928)—but in none of these does he define what he means by "culture". Only later, in "The Danube in Prehistory" (1929), did Childe give "culture" a specifically archaeological definition. In this book, he defined a "culture" as a set of "regularly associated traits" in the <a href="material%20culture">material culture</a>—i.e. "pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms"—that recur across a given area. He stated that in this respect a "culture" was the archaeological equivalent of a "people". Childe's use of the term was non-racial; he considered a "people" to be a social grouping, not a biological race. He opposed the equation of archaeological cultures with biological races—as various nationalists across Europe were doing at the time—and vociferously criticised Nazi uses of archaeology, arguing that the Jewish people were not a distinct biological race but a socio-cultural grouping. In 1935, he suggested that culture worked as a "living functioning organism" and emphasised the adaptive potential of material culture; in this he was influenced by anthropological <a href="Structural%20functionalism">functionalism</a>. Childe accepted that archaeologists defined "cultures" based on a subjective selection of material criteria; this view was later widely adopted by archaeologists like <a href="Colin%20Renfrew">Colin Renfrew</a>.

Later in his career, Childe tired of culture-historical archaeology. By the late 1940s he was questioning the utility of "culture" as an archaeological concept and thus the basic validity of the culture-historical approach. McNairn suggested that this was because the term "culture" had become popular across the <a href="social%20sciences">social sciences</a> in reference to all learned modes of behaviour, and not just material culture as Childe had done. By the 1940s, Childe was doubtful as to whether a certain archaeological assemblage or "culture" really reflected a social group who had other unifying traits, such as a shared language. In the 1950s, Childe was comparing the role culture-historical archaeology had among prehistorians to the place of the traditional politico-military approach among historians.

Childe has typically been seen as a <a href="Marxist%20archaeologist">Marxist archaeologist</a>, being the first archaeologist in the West to use Marxist theory in his work. Marxist archaeology emerged in the Soviet Union in 1929, when the archaeologist <a href="Vladislav%20I.%20Ravdonikas">Vladislav I. Ravdonikas</a> published a report titled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Criticising the archaeological discipline as inherently <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> and therefore anti-socialist, Ravdonikas's report called for a pro-socialist, Marxist approach to archaeology as part of the academic reforms instituted under <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s rule. It was during the mid-1930s, around the time of his first visit to the Soviet Union, that Childe began to make explicit reference to Marxism in his work.

Many archaeologists have been profoundly influenced by Marxism's socio-political ideas. As a <a href="Historical%20materialism">materialist</a> philosophy, Marxism emphasises the idea that material things are more important than ideas, and that the social conditions of a given period are the result of the existing material conditions, or <a href="mode%20of%20production">mode of production</a>. Thus, a Marxist interpretation foregrounds the social context of any technological development or change. Marxist ideas also emphasise the biased nature of scholarship, each scholar having their own entrenched beliefs and class loyalties; Marxism thus argues that intellectuals cannot divorce their scholarly thinking from political action. Green stated that Childe accepted "Marxist views on a model of the past" because they offer "a structural analysis of culture in terms of economy, sociology and ideology, and a principle for cultural change through economy". McNairn noted that Marxism was "a major intellectual force in Childe's thought", while Trigger stated that Childe identified with Marx's theories "both emotionally and intellectually".

Childe stated that he used Marxist ideas when interpreting the past "because and in so far as it "works""; he criticised many fellow Marxists for treating the socio-political theory as a set of dogmas. Childe's Marxism often differed from the Marxism of his contemporaries, both because he made reference to the original texts of Hegel, Marx, and Engels rather than later interpretations and because he was selective in using their writings. McNairn considered Childe's Marxism "an individual interpretation" that differed from "popular or orthodox" Marxism; Trigger called him a "a creative Marxist thinker"; Gathercole thought that while Childe's "debt to Marx was quite evident", his "attitude to Marxism was at times ambivalent". The Marxist historian <a href="Eric%20Hobsbawm">Eric Hobsbawm</a> later described Childe as "the most original English Marxist writer from the days of my youth".
Aware that in the context of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, his affiliation with Marxism could prove dangerous for him, Childe sought to make his Marxist ideas more palatable to his readership. In his archaeological writings, he sparingly made direct reference to Marx. There is a distinction in his published works from the latter part of his life between those that are explicitly Marxist and those in which Marxist ideas and influences are less obvious. Many of Childe's fellow British archaeologists did not take his adherence to Marxism seriously, regarding it as something which he did for shock value.

Childe was influenced by Soviet archaeology but remained critical of it, disapproving of how the Soviet government encouraged the country's archaeologists to assume their conclusions before analysing their data. He was also critical of what he saw as the sloppy approach to <a href="Typology%20%28archaeology%29">typology</a> in Soviet archaeology. As a moderate diffusionist, Childe was heavily critical of the "Marrist" trend in Soviet archaeology, based on the theories of the Georgian philologist <a href="Nicholas%20Marr">Nicholas Marr</a>, which rejected diffusionism in favour of unilinear evolutionism. In his view, it "cannot be un-Marxian" to understand the spread of domesticated plants, animals, and ideas through diffusionism. Childe did not publicly air these criticisms of his Soviet colleagues, perhaps so as not to offend communist friends or to provide ammunition for right-wing archaeologists. Instead, he publicly praised the Soviet system of archaeology and heritage management, contrasting it favourably with Britain's because it encouraged collaboration rather than competition between archaeologists. After first visiting the country in 1935, he returned in 1945, 1953, and 1956, befriending many Soviet archaeologists, but shortly before his suicide sent a letter to the Soviet archaeological community stating that he was "extremely disappointed" that they had methodologically fallen behind Western Europe and North America.

Other Marxists—such as <a href="George%20Derwent%20Thomson">George Derwent Thomson</a> and <a href="Neil%20Faulkner%20%28archaeologist%29">Neil Faulkner</a>—argued that Childe's archaeological work was not truly Marxist because he failed to take into account <a href="class%20struggle">class struggle</a> as an instrument of social change, a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor Childe considered in his archaeological work, he accepted that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, arguing that most of his contemporaries produced studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe further diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing <a href="dialectics">dialectics</a> in his methodology. He also denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and—unlike many other Marxists—did not consider humanity's <a href="Progress%20%28history%29">progress</a> into <a href="Communist%20society">pure communism</a> inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct.

Influenced by Marxism, Childe argued that society experienced widescale changes in relatively short periods of time, citing the Industrial Revolution as a modern example. This idea was absent from his earliest work; in studies like "The Dawn of European Civilisation" he talked of societal change as "transition" rather than "revolution". In writings from the early 1930s, such as "New Light on the Most Ancient East", he began to describe social change using the term "revolution", although had yet to fully develop these ideas. At this point, the term "revolution" had gained Marxist associations due to Russia's <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> of 1917. Childe introduced his ideas about "revolutions" in a 1935 presidential address to the Prehistoric Society. Presenting this concept as part of his functional-economic interpretation of the three-age system, he argued that a "<a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>" initiated the Neolithic era, and that other revolutions marked the start of the Bronze and Iron Ages. The following year, in "Man Makes Himself", he combined these Bronze and Iron Age Revolutions into a singular "<a href="Urban%20Revolution">Urban Revolution</a>", which corresponded largely to the anthropologist <a href="Lewis%20H.%20Morgan">Lewis H. Morgan</a>'s concept of "civilization".

For Childe, the Neolithic Revolution was a period of radical change, in which humans—who were then hunter-gatherers—began cultivating plants and breeding animals for food, allowing for greater control of the food supply and population growth. He believed that the Urban Revolution was largely caused by the development of bronze metallurgy, and in a 1950 paper proposed ten traits that he believed were present in the oldest cities: they were larger than earlier settlements, they contained full-time craft specialists, the surplus was collected together and given to a god or king, they witnessed monumental architecture, there was an unequal distribution of social surplus, writing was invented, the sciences developed, naturalistic art developed, trade with foreign areas increased, and the state organisation was based on residence rather than kinship. Childe believed that the Urban Revolution had a negative side, in that it led to increased social stratification into classes and oppression of the majority by a power elite. Not all archaeologists adopted Childe's framework of understanding human societal development as a series of transformational "revolutions"; many believed that the term "revolution" was misleading because the processes of agricultural and urban development were gradual transformations.

Through his work, Childe contributed to two of the major theoretical movements in Anglo-American archaeology that developed in the decades after his death, <a href="Processual%20archaeology">processualism</a> and <a href="post-processualism">post-processualism</a>. The former emerged in the late 1950s, emphasised the idea that archaeology should be a branch of anthropology, sought the discovery of universal laws about society, and believed that archaeology could ascertain objective information about the past. The latter emerged as a reaction to processualism in the late 1970s, rejecting the idea that archaeology had access to objective information about the past and emphasising the subjectivity of all interpretation.

The processual archaeologist Colin Renfrew described Childe as "one of the fathers of processual thought" due to his "development of economic and social themes in prehistory", an idea echoed by Faulkner. Trigger argued that Childe's work foreshadowed processual thought in two ways: by emphasising the role of change in societal development, and by adhering to a strictly materialist view of the past. Both of these arose from Childe's Marxism. Despite this connection, most American processualists ignored Childe's work, seeing him as a <a href="Historical%20particularism">particularist</a> who was irrelevant to their search for generalised laws of societal behaviour. In keeping with Marxist thought, Childe did not agree that such generalised laws existed, believing that behaviour was not universal but was conditioned by socio-economic factors. <a href="Peter%20Ucko">Peter Ucko</a>, one of Childe's successors as director of the Institute of Archaeology, highlighted that Childe accepted the <a href="subjectivity">subjectivity</a> of archaeological interpretation, something in stark contrast to the processualists' insistence that archaeological interpretation could be objective. As a result, Trigger thought Childe to be a "prototypical post-processual archaeologist".

Childe's biographer Sally Green found no evidence that Childe ever had a serious intimate relationship; she assumed he was <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a> because she found no evidence of same-sex attraction. Conversely, his student <a href="Don%20Brothwell">Don Brothwell</a> thought him to be <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a>. He had many friends of both sexes, although remained "awkward and uncouth, without any social graces". Despite his difficulties in relating to others, he enjoyed interacting and socialising with his students, often inviting them to dine with him. He was shy and often hid his personal feelings. Brothwell suggested that these personality traits may reflect undiagnosed <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>.

Childe believed that the study of the past could offer guidance for how humans should act in the present and future. He was known for his <a href="radical%20left-wing">radical left-wing</a> views, being a socialist from his undergraduate days. He sat on the committees of several left-wing groups, although avoided involvement in Marxist intellectual arguments within the Communist Party and—with the exception of "How Labour Governs"—did not commit his non-archaeological opinions to print. Many of his political views are therefore only evident through comments made in private correspondence. Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal-minded on social issues, but thought that—although Childe deplored racism—he did not entirely escape the pervasive nineteenth-century view on distinct differences between different races. Trigger similarly observed racist elements in some of Childe's culture-historical writings, including the suggestion that <a href="Nordic%20race">Nordic peoples</a> had a "superiority in physique", although Childe later disavowed these ideas. In a private letter Childe wrote to the archaeologist <a href="Christopher%20Hawkes">Christopher Hawkes</a>, he stated that <a href="anti-Semitism">he disliked Jews</a>.

Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a <a href="false%20consciousness">false consciousness</a> based in superstition that served the interests of dominant elites. In "History" (1947) he commented that "Magic is a way of making people believe they are going to get what they want, whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to want what they get." He nevertheless regarded Christianity as being superior over (what he regarded as) primitive religion, commenting that "Christianity as a religion of love surpasses all others in stimulating positive virtue". In a letter written during the 1930s, he stated that "only in days of exceptional bad temper do I desire to hurt peoples' religious convictions".

Childe was fond of driving cars, enjoying the "feeling of power" he got from them. He often told a story about how he had raced at high speed down <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, London at 3 o'clock in the morning for the sheer enjoyment of it, only to be pulled over by a policeman. He loved practical jokes, and allegedly kept a <a href="halfpenny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">halfpenny</a> in his pocket to trick pickpockets. On one occasion he played a joke on the delegates at a Prehistoric Society conference by lecturing them on a theory that the Neolithic monument of <a href="Woodhenge">Woodhenge</a> had been constructed as an imitation of <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> by a "nouveau riche" chieftain. Some audience members failed to realise that he was being <a href="tongue%20in%20cheek">tongue in cheek</a>. He could speak several European languages, having taught himself in early life when he was travelling across the continent.

Childe's other hobbies included walking in the British hillsides, attending <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a> concerts, and playing the card game <a href="contract%20bridge">contract bridge</a>. Fond of poetry, his favourite poet was <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a>, although his favourite poems were <a href="William%20Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>'s "<a href="Ode%20to%20Duty">Ode to Duty</a>" and <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a>'s "A Grammarian's Funeral". He was not particularly interested in reading novels, but his favourite was <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>'s "<a href="Kangaroo%20%28novel%29">Kangaroo</a>" (1923), a book echoing many of Childe's own feelings about Australia. He was a fan of good quality food and drink, and frequented restaurants. Known for his battered, tatty attire, Childe always wore his wide-brimmed black hat—purchased from a hatter in <a href="Jermyn%20Street">Jermyn Street</a>, central London—as well as a tie, which was usually red, a colour chosen to symbolise his socialist beliefs. He regularly wore a black <a href="Mackintosh">Mackintosh</a> raincoat, often carrying it over his arm or draped over his shoulders like a cape. In summer he frequently wore shorts with socks, sock suspenders, and large boots.

On his death, Childe was praised by his colleague Stuart Piggott as "the greatest prehistorian in Britain and probably the world". The archaeologist <a href="Randall%20H.%20McGuire">Randall H. McGuire</a> later described him as "probably the best known and most cited archaeologist of the twentieth century", an idea echoed by Bruce Trigger, while Barbara McNairn labelled him "one of the most outstanding and influential figures in the discipline". The archaeologist <a href="Andrew%20Sherratt">Andrew Sherratt</a> described Childe as occupying "a crucial position in the history" of archaeology.
Sherratt also noted that "Childe's output, by any standard, was massive". Over the course of his career, Childe published over twenty books and around 240 scholarly articles. The archaeologist <a href="Brian%20Fagan">Brian Fagan</a> described his books as "simple, well-written narratives" which became "archaeological canon between the 1930s and early 1960s". By 1956, he was cited as the most translated Australian author in history, having seen his books published in such languages as Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Sweden and Turkish. The archaeologists <a href="David%20Lewis-Williams">David Lewis-Williams</a> and David Pearce considered Childe "probably the most written about" archaeologist in history, commenting that his books were still "required reading" for those in the discipline in 2005.

Known as "the Great Synthesizer", Childe is primarily respected for developing a synthesis of European and Near Eastern prehistory at a time when most archaeologists focused on regional sites and sequences. Since his death, this framework has been heavily revised following the discovery of <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a>, his interpretations have been "largely rejected", and many of his conclusions about Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe have been found to be incorrect. Childe himself believed that his primary contribution to archaeology was in his interpretative frameworks, an analysis supported by Alison Ravetz and Peter Gathercole. According to Sherratt: "What is of lasting value in his interpretations is the more detailed level of writing, concerned with the recognition of patterns in the material he described. It is these patterns which survive as classic problems of European prehistory, even when his explanations of them are recognised as inappropriate." Childe's theoretical work had been largely ignored in his lifetime, and remained forgotten in the decades after his death, although it would see a resurgence in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It remained best known in Latin America, where Marxism remained a core theoretical current among archaeologists throughout the latter 20th century.

Despite his global influence, Childe's oeuvre was poorly understood in the United States, where his work on European prehistory never became well known. As a result, in the United States he erroneously gained the reputation of being a Near Eastern specialist and a founder of <a href="neo-evolutionism">neo-evolutionism</a>, alongside <a href="Julian%20Steward">Julian Steward</a> and <a href="Leslie%20White">Leslie White</a>, despite the fact that his approach was "more subtle and nuanced" than theirs. Steward repeatedly misrepresented Childe as a unilinear evolutionist in his writings, perhaps as part of an attempt to distinguish his own "multilinear" evolutionary approach from the ideas of Marx and Engels. In contrast to this American neglect and misrepresentation, Trigger believed that it was an American archaeologist, <a href="Robert%20McCormick%20Adams%2C%20Jr.">Robert McCormick Adams, Jr.</a>, who did the most to posthumously develop Childe's "most innovative ideas". Childe also had a small following of American archaeologists and anthropologists in the 1940s who wanted to bring back materialist and Marxist ideas into their research after years in which <a href="Franz%20Boas">Boasian</a> particularism had been dominant within the discipline. In the U.S., his name was also referenced in the 2008 blockbuster film "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Crystal%20Skull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>".

Following his death, several articles examining Childe's impact on archaeology were published. In 1980, Bruce Trigger's "Gordon Childe: Revolutions in Archaeology" appeared, which studied the influences that extended over Childe's archaeological thought; the same year saw the publication of Barbara McNairn's "The Method and Theory of V. Gordon Childe", examining his methodological and theoretical approaches to archaeology. The following year, Sally Green published "Prehistorian: A Biography of V. Gordon Childe", in which she described him as "the most eminent and influential scholar of European prehistory in the twentieth century". Peter Gathercole thought the work of Trigger, McNairn, and Green was "extremely important"; Ruth Tringham considered it all part of a "let's-get-to-know-Childe-better" movement.

In July 1986, a colloquium devoted to Childe's work was held in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, marking the 50th anniversary of "Man Makes Himself"'s publication. In September 1990, the <a href="University%20of%20Queensland">University of Queensland</a>'s Australian Studies Centre organised a centenary conference for Childe in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, with presentations examining both his scholarly and socialist work. In May 1992, a conference marking his centenary was held at the <a href="UCL%20Institute%20of%20Archaeology">UCL Institute of Archaeology</a> in London, co-sponsored by the Institute and the Prehistoric Society, both organisations that he had formerly headed. The conference proceedings were published in a 1994 volume edited by <a href="David%20R.%20Harris">David R. Harris</a>, the Institute's director, entitled "The Archaeology of V. Gordon Childe: Contemporary Perspectives". Harris stated that the book sought to "demonstrate the dynamic qualities of Childe's thought, the breadth and depth of his scholarship, and the continuing relevance of his work to contemporary issues in archaeology". In 1995, another conference collection was published. Titled "Childe and Australia: Archaeology, Politics and Ideas", it was edited by Peter Gathercole, T.H. Irving, and Gregory Melleuish. Further papers appeared on the subject of Childe in ensuing years, looking at such subjects as his personal correspondences, and final resting place.

Maurice Richard

Joseph Henri Maurice "Rocket" Richard (; ; August 4, 1921 – May 27, 2000) was a Canadian professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> player who played 18 seasons in the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) for the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. He was the first player in NHL history to score <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%2050-goal%20seasons">50 goals in one season</a>, accomplishing the feat in <a href="50%20goals%20in%2050%20games">50 games</a> in <a href="1944%E2%80%9345%20NHL%20season">1944–45</a>, and the first to reach <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%20500%20goals">500 career goals</a>. Richard retired in 1960 as the league's all-time leader in <a href="goal%20%28ice%20hockey%29">goals</a> with 544. He won the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Trophy</a> as the NHL's most valuable player in 1947, played in 13 <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Games</a> and was named to 14 post-season <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Team">NHL All-Star Team</a>s, eight on the First-Team. In 2017 Richard was named one of the '<a href="100%20Greatest%20NHL%20Players">100 Greatest NHL Players</a>' in history.

Richard, <a href="Elmer%20Lach">Elmer Lach</a> and <a href="Toe%20Blake">Toe Blake</a> formed the "<a href="Punch%20line%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Punch line</a>", a high-scoring <a href="line%20%28ice%20hockey%29">forward line</a> of the 1940s. Richard was a member of eight <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship teams, including a league record five straight between 1956 and 1960; he was the team's <a href="captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a> for the last four. The <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> waived its five-year waiting period for eligibility and inducted Richard into the hall in 1961. In 1975 he was inducted into <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canada's Sports Hall of Fame</a>. The Canadiens <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> his number, 9, in 1960, and in 1999 donated the <a href="Maurice%20%26quot%3BRocket%26quot%3B%20Richard%20Trophy">Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy</a> to the NHL, awarded annually to the league's regular season leading goal-scorer.

The oldest of eight children, Richard emerged from a poverty-stricken family during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. He was initially viewed as a fragile player. A string of injuries prevented him from joining the Canadian military during the Second World War. Outspoken and intense, he was renowned for his physical and occasionally violent style of play. Richard was involved in a <a href="violence%20in%20ice%20hockey">vicious on-ice</a> incident late in the <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20NHL%20season">1954–55 season</a> during which he struck a <a href="linesman%20%28ice%20hockey%29">linesman</a>. NHL President <a href="Clarence%20Campbell">Clarence Campbell</a> suspended him for the remainder of the season and playoffs, which precipitated the <a href="Richard%20Riot">Richard Riot</a> in Montreal. The riot has taken on a mythical quality in the decades since and is often viewed as a precursor to Quebec's <a href="Quiet%20Revolution">Quiet Revolution</a>. Richard was a cultural icon among Quebec's francophone population; his legend is a primary motif in <a href="Roch%20Carrier">Roch Carrier</a>'s short story "<a href="The%20Hockey%20Sweater">The Hockey Sweater</a>", an emblematic work of Canadian culture. Richard died in 2000 and became the first non-politician honoured by the province of Quebec with a <a href="State%20funerals%20in%20Canada">state funeral</a>.

Joseph Henri Maurice Richard was born August 4, 1921, in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, Quebec. His parents, Onésime Richard and Alice Laramée, were originally from the <a href="Gasp%C3%A9sie%E2%80%93%C3%8Eles-de-la-Madeleine">Gaspé</a> region of Quebec, before moving to Montreal, where they settled in the neighbourhood of <a href="Nouveau-Bordeaux">Nouveau-Bordeaux</a>. Maurice was the oldest of eight children; he had three sisters: Georgette, Rollande and Marguerite; and four brothers: René, Jacques, <a href="Henri%20Richard">Henri</a> and Claude. Onésime was a <a href="carpenter">carpenter</a> by trade, and took a job with the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> shortly after Maurice was born. The Richards struggled during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>; Onésime lost his job in 1930 and the family relied on government aid until he was re-hired by the railway around 1936.

Richard received his first pair of ice skates when he was four, and grew up skating on local rivers and a small backyard ice surface his father created. He did not play organized hockey until he was 14. Instead, Richard developed his skills playing <a href="shinny">shinny</a> and "hog" – a game that required the puck carrier to keep the puck away from others for as long as possible. While he also played <a href="baseball">baseball</a> and was a <a href="boxing">boxer</a>, hockey was his passion. After he began playing in organized leagues, Richard joined several teams and used <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>s such as "Maurice Rochon" to circumvent rules that restricted players to one team. In one league, he led his team to three consecutive championships and scored 133 of his team's 144 goals in the 1938–39 season.

At 16, Richard dropped out of school to work with his father as a machinist. He enrolled in a technical school, intent on earning a trade certificate. At 18, Richard joined the <a href="Verdun%20Maple%20Leafs%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Verdun Juniors</a>, though as a <a href="rookie">rookie</a> he saw little ice time in the regular season. He scored four goals in ten regular season games, and added six goals in four playoff games as Verdun won the provincial championship. He was promoted to the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>' affiliate in the <a href="Quebec%20Senior%20Hockey%20League">Quebec Senior Hockey League</a> in 1940, but suffered a broken ankle in his first game after crashing into the boards and missed the remainder of the season. The injury also aborted his hopes of joining the <a href="Canadian%20Forces">Canadian military</a>: he was called to a recruitment centre in mid-1941, but was deemed unfit for combat.

Off the ice, Richard was a quiet, unassuming youth who spoke little. He met his future wife Lucille Norchet when he was seventeen, when she was nearly fourteen. She was the younger sister of one of his teammates at Bordeaux, and her bright, outgoing personality complemented Richard's reserved nature. Lucille proved adept at guiding him through trials and disappointments he experienced in both hockey and life. They were engaged when he was 20, and though her parents felt she was too young, married on September 12, 1942, when she was seventeen.

Having recovered from his broken ankle in time for the 1941–42 season, Richard returned to the QSHL Canadiens, with whom he played 31 games and recorded 17 <a href="point%20%28ice%20hockey%29">point</a>s before he was again injured. He suffered a broken wrist after becoming entangled with a defenceman and crashed into the net. Richard rejoined the team for the playoffs. The skills he demonstrated in the QSHL, combined with the NHL parent club's loss of players to the war and struggles to draw fans due to its poor record and a lack of francophone players, earned Richard a tryout with the Canadiens for the <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20NHL%20season">1942–43 season</a>. He signed a contract worth $3,500 for the year and, wearing sweater number 15, made his NHL debut with the team. Richard's first goal was against the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> on November 8, 1942.

Injury again sidelined Richard as his <a href="rookie">rookie</a> season ended after only 16 games when he suffered a broken leg. The string of broken bones so early in his career left observers wondering if Richard was too fragile to play at the highest levels. He made a second attempt to enlist with the military but was again turned down after x-rays revealed that his bones had not healed properly; Richard's ankle was left permanently deformed, forcing him to alter his skating style. Humiliated by the rejection, he intensified his training and reported to Montreal's training camp for the <a href="1943%E2%80%9344%20NHL%20season">1943–44 season</a> fully healthy. The arrival of his daughter Huguette prompted Richard to change his uniform to number 9 to match her birth weight of nine pounds.

Remaining healthy throughout the season, Richard appeared in 46 of Montreal's 50 games. He led the Canadiens with 32 goals and tallied 54 points, third-best in his team. His first full NHL season not only ended the criticism about his ability to play in the league, but established him as one of the best young players in the league. Coach <a href="Dick%20Irvin">Dick Irvin</a> shifted him from <a href="winger%20%28ice%20hockey%29">left wing</a> to right and put him on a <a href="line%20%28ice%20hockey%29">forward line</a> with <a href="Toe%20Blake">Toe Blake</a> and <a href="Elmer%20Lach">Elmer Lach</a>. The trio, known as the "<a href="Punch%20line%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Punch line</a>", formed a dominant scoring unit throughout the 1940s. The Canadiens lost only six games after October, and went on to win the franchise's first <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship in 13 years. Richard led the league with 12 playoff goals, including a <a href="List%20of%20players%20with%20five%20or%20more%20goals%20in%20an%20NHL%20game">five-goal</a> effort against the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> in a semi-final game. He tied <a href="Newsy%20Lalonde">Newsy Lalonde</a>'s NHL record for goals in one playoff game (equalled by three players since), which resulted in his being named <a href="three%20stars%20%28ice%20hockey%29">first, second and third star</a> of the game. Richard was named a <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Team">second team All-Star</a> following the season. It was the first of 14 consecutive years he was named a league all-star.

The <a href="1944%E2%80%9345%20NHL%20season">1944–45 NHL season</a> was a record-setting one for Richard. He first set a new mark for points in one game when he made five goals and three assists in a 9–1 victory over the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> on December 28, 1944; his eight points broke the previous record of seven held by three players, and stood for 32 years until surpassed in 1976 by <a href="Darryl%20Sittler">Darryl Sittler</a>. Richard achieved the feat despite arriving for the game exhausted from moving into his new home that afternoon. He continued scoring at an unprecedented rate, and by February 1945 was approaching <a href="Joe%20Malone%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Joe Malone</a>'s 27-year-old NHL record, set <a href="1917%E2%80%9318%20NHL%20season">in 1918</a>, of 44 goals in one season. Richard broke the record on February 25, 1945, in a 5–2 victory over Toronto. Malone was on hand to present Richard with the puck used to score the 45th goal.

As Richard approached <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%2050-goal%20seasons">50 goals</a> for the season, opposition players resorted to increasingly violent efforts to prevent him from scoring. He had to fight past <a href="slashing%20%28ice%20hockey%29">slashes</a>, <a href="hooking%20%28ice%20hockey%29">hooks</a>, and even players who draped themselves across his back. Richard went eight games without scoring and began Montreal's final regular season game, March 18, on the road against the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> with 49 goals. He finally reached the milestone by scoring with 2:15 remaining in the game, a 4–2 Montreal win. He became the first player to score 50 goals, a record that would stand for 21 years (<a href="Bobby%20Hull">Bobby Hull</a>, 54 goals <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20NHL%20season">in 1966</a>). His mark of <a href="50%20goals%20in%2050%20games">50 goals in 50 games</a> also became a standard that remains one of the most celebrated achievements in NHL history, unmatched until 36 years later when <a href="Mike%20Bossy">Mike Bossy</a> did it <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20NHL%20season">in 1981</a> – the first of only four players to match Richard's 50-in-50, in the more than 70 years since Richard set the mark. Richard finished the season with 73 points, seven behind Lach and six ahead of Blake, as the Punch line finished first, second and third in league scoring. Richard finished second in the voting for the Hart Trophy as league MVP behind Lach.

Richard's critics argued that his scoring record was the result of talent dilution brought about by the war; when many players returned in <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20NHL%20season">1945–46</a>, he won his second Stanley Cup with Montreal, but his goal output was nearly halved to 27. Richard again reached lofty scoring totals in <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20NHL%20season">1946–47</a>, leading the league with 45 goals in a 60-game season and winning the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Trophy</a> as the league's <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a> for the only time of his career. He finished second or third in the Hart Trophy voting a further five times in his career. Opponents continued their attempts to drive Richard to anger or frustration, as they had learned he could be goaded into taking himself out of the game by violently retaliating and <a href="fighting%20in%20ice%20hockey">fighting</a>. One such incident occurred in the <a href="1947%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1947 Stanley Cup Final</a> when Richard received a <a href="match%20penalty">match penalty</a> for striking Toronto's <a href="Bill%20Ezinicki">Bill Ezinicki</a> over the head with his stick in a game two loss. Richard was suspended for the third game of the series, which the Maple Leafs won.

As the reigning most valuable player, Richard sought a pay raise prior to the <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20NHL%20season">1947–48 season</a>. General manager <a href="Frank%20Selke">Frank Selke</a> refused, even after Richard and team captain <a href="%C3%89mile%20Bouchard">Émile Bouchard</a> both sat out the Canadiens' preseason before capitulating and returning to the team when the season began. The Punch line was broken up after Blake suffered a career-ending leg injury. Richard's season also ended early as he missed the final games of the season due to a knee injury. He finished second in team scoring with 53 points in 53 games, but Montreal missed the playoffs. After recording only 38 points in <a href="1948%E2%80%9349%20NHL%20season">1948–49</a>, Richard posted a 65-point campaign <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20NHL%20season">the next season</a> and his 43 goals led the NHL for the third time. In <a href="1950%E2%80%9351%20NHL%20season">1950–51</a>, Richard scored 42 goals, including his 271st career goal, making him Montreal's all-time goal leader.

Richard missed over 20 games of the <a href="1951%E2%80%9352%20NHL%20season">1951–52 season</a> due to injury, but overcame another ailment in the playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the semi-final against Boston, Richard was checked by <a href="Leo%20Labine">Leo Labine</a> and briefly knocked unconscious after he fell and struck his head on <a href="Bill%20Quackenbush">Bill Quackenbush</a>'s knee. Though clearly dazed, Richard returned to the game late in the third period after a large cut above his eye was stitched up. Canadiens coach <a href="Dick%20Irvin">Dick Irvin</a> sent Richard back onto the ice in the final minutes of the contest, despite knowing Richard had suffered a <a href="concussion">concussion</a>. Richard scored the winning goal in a 2–1 victory that sent Montreal to the <a href="1952%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1952 Stanley Cup Final</a>. Following the game, a bloodied and still disoriented Richard was photographed shaking the hand of Boston goaltender <a href="Jim%20Henry%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Jim Henry</a>, who was also showing symptoms of injuries from the series and who appeared to be bowing to Richard following the Montreal player's "unconscious goal". The photograph by Roger St. Jean is among the most famous images of Richard. In the final, Montreal lost to Detroit in four straight games.

The <a href="1952%E2%80%9353%20NHL%20season">1952–53 season</a> began with Richard in close pursuit of <a href="Nels%20Stewart">Nels Stewart</a>'s all-time NHL record of 324 goals. Richard tied the record in Toronto on October 29, 1952, by scoring two goals against the Maple Leafs; his achievement earned a rousing ovation from Montreal's <a href="Canadiens%E2%80%93Maple%20Leafs%20rivalry">rival</a> fans. He failed to score in his following three games as frenzied fans followed each contest in anticipation of the record-breaking marker. In his fourth try, a November 8 game against Chicago, Richard scored his 325th goal at the 10:01 mark of the second period. According to the "<a href="Montreal%20Gazette">Montreal Gazette</a>", the ovation Richard received from his fans "shook the rafters" of the <a href="Montreal%20Forum">Montreal Forum</a>. He finished the season with team-leading totals of 61 points and 28 goals – becoming the first player in NHL history to score at least 20 goals in his first ten full seasons. Aided by Richard's 7 goals in 12 playoff games, the Canadiens defeated Boston in the <a href="1953%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1953 Stanley Cup Final</a> to capture Montreal's first Stanley Cup championship since 1946.

Richard led the league in goals for the fourth time in his career with 37 in <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20NHL%20season">1953–54</a>, then for a fifth time in <a href="1954%E2%80%9355%20NHL%20season">1954–55</a> with 38 (shared with <a href="Bernie%20Geoffrion">Bernie Geoffrion</a>). He scored his 400th career goal on December 18, 1954, against Chicago.

Opposition players continued to try to stop Richard through physical intimidation, and he often retaliated with equal force. The situation led to a running feud with NHL President <a href="Clarence%20Campbell">Clarence Campbell</a>. Richard had been fined numerous times by Campbell for on-ice incidents and at one point was forced to post a $1,000 "good-behaviour bond" after he criticized Campbell in a weekly column he helped author for "Samedi-Dimanche". Richard was among many in Quebec who believed that Campbell treated French Canadian players more harshly than their English counterparts. The simmering dispute erupted after an incident in the Canadiens' March 13, 1955, game against Boston, when <a href="Hal%20Laycoe">Hal Laycoe</a> struck Richard in the head with his stick. Richard retaliated by slashing viciously at Laycoe's head, then punched linesman <a href="Cliff%20Thompson">Cliff Thompson</a> when the official attempted to intervene. Boston police attempted to arrest Richard for assault following the incident, but Bruins officials persuaded them to withdraw on the promise that the NHL would handle the situation.

Following two days of deliberation, Campbell announced that he had suspended Richard – who was leading the NHL's overall scoring race at the time – for the remainder of the regular season and the playoffs. In English Canada, Campbell was praised for doing what he could to control the erratic Richard. Unknown to most at the time, Campbell had long wanted to impose a lengthy suspension on Richard over his previous outbursts. As NHL president however, Campbell ultimately answered to the league's owners and they were reluctant to see such severe discipline imposed against one of the league's star players on account of their value in increasing game attendance. In French Quebec the suspension was viewed as an injustice, an unfair punishment given to a Francophone hero by the Anglophone establishment. Richard's supporters reacted angrily to Campbell: he received several death threats and, upon taking his customary seat at the next Canadiens game, unruly fans pelted him with vegetables, eggs and other debris. One fan threw a <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> bomb at Campbell, which resulted in the Forum's evacuation and the game's forfeiture in Detroit's favour. Fans fleeing the arena were met by a large group of demonstrators who had massed outside prior to the game's start.

The mob of over 20,000 people developed into a <a href="riot">riot</a>. Windows and doors were smashed at the Forum and surrounding businesses. By the following morning, between 65 and 70 had been arrested. Over 50 stores were looted and 37 people injured. Damage was estimated at $100,000 ($ in dollars). Richard had also attended the game, but left immediately following the forfeit. Frank Selke attempted to persuade him to return to try to disperse the crowd, but Richard refused, fearing that he would instead further inflame the passions of the mob. He took to the radio the next day asking for calm: "Do no more harm. Get behind the team in the playoffs. I will take my punishment and come back next year and help the club and the younger players to win the Cup."

The suspension cost Richard the <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross Trophy</a> as the leading point scorer in the league, which he lost to teammate Geoffrion by one point. Richard never won the point title finishing second five times in his career. Montreal fans booed Geoffrion when he surpassed Richard on the final day of the regular season. The fans continued to jeer Geoffrion into the following season. Montreal reached the <a href="1955%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1955 Stanley Cup Final</a> without Richard, and lost the championship series four games to three. The defeat was a bitter loss for Richard, who struggled to control his anger.

Richard fulfilled his promise to Canadiens' fans, made in his post-riot radio address, by leading Montreal to a Stanley Cup championship in <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20NHL%20season">1955–56</a> – the start of a still unprecedented 5 consecutive Stanley Cup victories by one team. The season began with the arrival of his young brother <a href="Henri%20Richard">Henri</a> to the Canadiens roster. It also marked the return of his former Punch line teammate, Toe Blake, as head coach. Along with general manager Frank Selke, Blake worked with Richard on moderating his temper and responding to the provocation of his opponents by scoring goals rather than engaging in fisticuffs. Richard finished the season with 38 goals and 71 points, second on the team in both respects to <a href="Jean%20B%C3%A9liveau">Jean Béliveau</a>'s 47 goals and 88 points. Richard added 14 points in 10 playoff games as Montreal defeated Detroit to claim the Stanley Cup. He scored the second and ultimately Cup-clinching goal in the fifth and final game, a 3–1 victory.

Entering his 15th NHL season in <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20NHL%20season">1956–57</a>, Richard's teammates named him <a href="captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a> of the Canadiens, succeeding Émile Bouchard, who had retired prior to the season. With 33 goals and 62 points, Richard again finished second on the team to Béliveau. In the playoffs, he scored the overtime-winning goal in the fifth game of the semi-final to eliminate New York, then scored four goals in a 5–1 victory over Boston in the first game of the final en route to a five-game series win and second consecutive championship for Montreal.

Richard reached a major scoring milestone early in the <a href="1957%E2%80%9358%20NHL%20season">1957–58 season</a>. During the first period of a 3–1 victory over Chicago on October 19, 1957, he became the first player in NHL history to <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%20500%20goals">score 500 goals</a> in his career. As Richard celebrated with his teammates, it was announced to the Montreal Forum crowd: "Canadiens' goal, scored by Mr. Hockey himself, Maurice Richard". He played only 28 regular season games that season, scoring 34 points, as he missed three months due to a severed <a href="Achilles%20tendon">Achilles tendon</a>. Returning in time for the playoffs, Richard led Montreal with 11 goals and 15 points as the team won its third consecutive Stanley Cup. He scored the overtime-winning goal in the fifth game of the final against Boston. It was the sixth playoff overtime-winning goal of his career, and the third during the finals, both NHL records.

At 37, Richard was the oldest player in the NHL in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20NHL%20season">1958–59</a>. He scored 38 points in 42 games, but missed six weeks due to a broken ankle. Injuries again plagued Richard during the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20NHL%20season">1959–60 season</a> as he missed a month due to a broken cheekbone. Montreal nonetheless won the Stanley Cup in both seasons. Richard scored no points in four games in the <a href="1959%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1959 Stanley Cup Final</a>, but recorded a goal and three assists in <a href="1960%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1960</a>. The titles were the seventh and eighth of Richard's career, and Montreal's five consecutive championships remain a record. The 1956–60 Canadiens rank as one of eight <a href="Dynasty%20%28sports%29">dynasties</a> recognized by the NHL.

The playoff goal was Richard's last, as on September 15, 1960, he announced his retirement as a player. Richard had reported to Montreal's training camp that autumn, but Selke compelled Richard to end his playing career, fearing he was risking serious injury. In Richard's retirement speech, he said he had been contemplating leaving the game for two years, and stated that at age 39, the game had become too fast for him. Upon learning of Richard's retirement, Gordie Howe offered praise for his former rival: "He sure was a drawing card. He brought in the crowds that helped pay our wages. Richard certainly has been one of the greatest players in the game and we will miss him."

Richard was nicknamed "the Comet" early in his career. When teammate <a href="Ray%20Getliffe">Ray Getliffe</a> remarked that Richard "went in like a rocket" as he approached the opposition goal, Richard was dubbed "The Rocket" by a local sportswriter; both Baz O'Meara from the "<a href="Montreal%20Star">Montreal Star</a>" and Dink Carroll of the "Montreal Gazette" have been credited for the appellation. The nickname described Richard's play in terms of speed, strength, and determination. Teammate and coach Toe Blake said the moniker was fitting because "when he would take off, nothing got in his way that could stop him". Goaltender <a href="Jacques%20Plante">Jacques Plante</a> declared it one of the most appropriate nicknames given to an athlete, noting the fierce intensity that often showed in Richard's eyes and comparing it to "the rocket's red glare" referenced in "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>". <a href="Glenn%20Hall">Glenn Hall</a> agreed: "What I remember most about Rocket was his eyes. When he came flying toward you with the puck on his stick, his eyes were all lit up, flashing and gleaming like a pinball machine. It was terrifying."
The prime of Richard's career was the era immediately following the Second World War, where battle-hardened players returned to the NHL and implemented a "gladiatorial" style that featured rugged, physical and often violent play. Richard's own temper was infamous, as illustrated by his actions that precipitated the Richard Riot.

A pure goal-scorer, Richard did not play with finesse, nor was he known for his passing. One of his teammates remarked that "Maurice wouldn't even pass you the salt". Richard led the NHL in goals five times, but never in points. He was best known for dashing toward the net from the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20rink">blue line</a> and was equally adept at scoring from his forehand or backhand. His exploits revived a Montreal Canadiens franchise that had struggled to draw fans in the 1930s. In addition to his 14 appearances on a post-season all-star team (eight on the first team, six on the second), Richard played in 13 consecutive <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game</a>s between 1947 and 1959.

Richard was still an active player when <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a> overtook his career record for points. Howe surpassed Richard's career mark of 544 goals in 1963, while the latter's record of 50 goals in one season stood for 20 years until broken by <a href="Bobby%20Hull">Bobby Hull</a> in 1965. The Montreal Canadiens donated the <a href="Maurice%20%26quot%3BRocket%26quot%3B%20Richard%20Trophy">Maurice "Rocket" Richard Trophy</a> to the NHL in 1999 as an award presented annually to the league's leading goal scorer.

Upon his retirement as a player, Selke offered Richard a job as a team ambassador and promised to pay him his full playing salary in the first year. After serving in the position for three years, Richard was named a vice-president of the Canadiens in 1964. He became disgruntled with a role he felt was powerless and only honorary, and resigned one year later. Richard grew estranged from the organization as his desire to be involved in the team's operations was ignored, and the split deepened when the Canadiens forced Frank Selke to retire in 1965. He eventually refused to allow his name to be associated with the team.

As Richard struggled both with the need to find a purpose to his post-retirement life and the fear of being forgotten, he attached his name to numerous endeavours. He acted as a consulting editor for a magazine titled "Maurice Richard's Hockey Illustrated", owned the "544 / 9 Tavern" (named for his career goal total and sweater number) in Montreal, and was a pitchman for dozens of products, including beer, hair dye, car batteries, fishing tackle and children's toys. He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 as head coach for the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> of the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a>. He lasted only two games, a win and a loss, before finding himself unable to handle the strain of coaching. Richard reconciled with the Canadiens in 1981 and resumed his team ambassador role.

Richard and his wife, Lucille, lived in Montreal where they raised seven children: Huguette, Maurice Jr., Norman, André, Suzanne, Polo and Jean. They had 14 grandchildren. Lucille died of cancer in 1994, two years after the Richards celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Richard's companion late in his life was Sonia Raymond. 

It was announced in 1998 that Richard was diagnosed with <a href="abdominal%20cancer">abdominal cancer</a>. He died on May 27, 2000, of respiratory failure as a result of the disease. Prior to game 1 of the <a href="2000%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">2000 Stanley Cup Finals</a> between the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> and <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a>, there was a short tribute video highlighting the great moments and legacy of Richard's career.

Numerous honours were bestowed upon Richard throughout and following his career: the <a href="Canadian%20Press">Canadian Press</a> named him its <a href="Lionel%20Conacher%20Award">male athlete of the year</a> on three occasions, and in 1957, Richard won the <a href="Lou%20Marsh%20Trophy">Lou Marsh Trophy</a> as Canada's athlete of the year. The Canadiens <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> his sweater number 9 in 1960, while the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> waived its five-year waiting period after retirement and inducted him in 1961. That same year, the 5,000-seat <a href="Maurice%20Richard%20Arena">Maurice Richard Arena</a> was built and named in his honour.

Upon the creation of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> in 1967, Richard was named one of the inaugural members and, in 1998, was elevated to the rank of Companion of the Order of Canada. <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canada's Sports Hall of Fame</a> honoured him in 1975, and Richard was given a star on <a href="Canada%27s%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Canada's Walk of Fame</a> in 1999. He was appointed to the <a href="Queen%27s%20Privy%20Council%20for%20Canada">Queen's Privy Council for Canada</a> in 1992.

While he was a popular player throughout Canada, Richard was an icon within Quebec. Author <a href="Roch%20Carrier">Roch Carrier</a> explained the passion Richard elicited from the fans in his 1979 Canadian-classic short story "<a href="The%20Hockey%20Sweater">The Hockey Sweater</a>". Carrier wrote of how he and his friends all emulated Richard's style and mannerisms: "we were five Maurice Richards against five other Maurice Richards, throwing themselves on the puck. We were ten players all wearing the uniform of the Montréal Canadiens, all with the same burning enthusiasm. We all wore the famous number 9 on our backs." The story's publication, and subsequent adaptation into a <a href="National%20Film%20Board%20of%20Canada">National Film Board</a> animated short helped entrench Richard's image as a pan-Canadian icon. Richard's popularity persisted late into his life: when introduced as part of the ceremonies preceding the final hockey game at the Montreal Forum, Richard was brought to tears by Canadiens' fans, who acknowledged him with an 11-minute standing ovation. Upon his death, the province of Quebec honoured Richard with a <a href="State%20funerals%20in%20Canada">state funeral</a>, a first in Quebec for a non-politician. Over 115,000 people paid their respects by viewing his lying in state at the <a href="Molson%20Centre">Molson Centre</a>.

The Richard Riot has achieved a mythical place in Canadian folklore. The riot is commonly viewed as a violent manifestation of the discontent Francophones within Quebec held with their place in largely Anglophone Canada, and some historians consider the riot to be a precursor to the 1960s <a href="Quiet%20Revolution">Quiet Revolution</a>. In its 40th anniversary retrospective of the Riot, Montreal newspaper "<a href="La%20Presse%20%28Canadian%20newspaper%29">La Presse</a>" opened with the following passage: "Forty years ago began one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of Quebec, and of hockey." Richard himself publicly dismissed his role as a catalyst for cultural or political change. In a 1975 interview, he said he played with "English boys" and was largely unaware of the situation in French Quebec at the time.

In an article published four days after the riot, journalist <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Laurendeau">André Laurendeau</a> was the first to suggest that it was a sign of growing <a href="Qu%C3%A9bec%20nationalism">nationalism in Quebec</a>. Laurendeau suggested the riot "betrayed what lay behind the apparent indifference and long-held passiveness of French Canadians". In contrast, in his book "The Rocket: A Cultural History of Maurice Richard", Benoît Melançon disputes the importance of the riot, stating its perceived importance in history grew retroactively with Richard's myth. Melançon wrote: "According to this popular narrative, for the first time the people of Quebec stood up for themselves; especially English Canada delights in anachronistically announcing that this was the beginning of the 1960s Quiet Revolution."

Richard is the subject of the 2005 biopic "<a href="The%20Rocket%20%282005%20film%29">The Rocket</a>".

Nihonium

Nihonium is a synthetic <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with the symbol Nh and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 113. It is extremely <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>; its most stable known <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, nihonium-286, has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of about 10 seconds. In the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, nihonium is a <a href="transactinide%20element">transactinide element</a> in the <a href="p-block">p-block</a>. It is a member of <a href="period%207%20element">period 7</a> and <a href="boron%20group">group 13</a> (boron group).

Nihonium was first reported to have been created in 2003 by a Russian–American collaboration at the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> (JINR) in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, Russia, and in 2004 by a team of Japanese scientists at <a href="Riken">Riken</a> in <a href="Wak%C5%8D%2C%20Saitama">Wakō</a>, Japan. The confirmation of their claims in the ensuing years involved independent teams of scientists working in the United States, Germany, Sweden, and China, as well as the original claimants in Russia and Japan. In 2015, the <a href="IUPAC/IUPAP%20Joint%20Working%20Party">IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party</a> recognised the element and assigned the <a href="scientific%20priority">priority</a> of the discovery and naming rights for the element to Riken, as it judged that they had demonstrated that they had observed element 113 before the JINR team did so. The Riken team suggested the name "nihonium" in 2016, which was approved in the same year. The name comes from the common Japanese name for .

Very little is known about nihonium, as it has only been made in very small amounts that decay away within seconds. The anomalously long lives of some superheavy nuclides, including some nihonium isotopes, are explained by the "<a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>" theory. Experiments support the theory, with the half-lives of the confirmed nihonium isotopes increasing from milliseconds to seconds as <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s are added and the island is approached. Nihonium has been calculated to have similar properties to its homologues <a href="boron">boron</a>, <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="gallium">gallium</a>, <a href="indium">indium</a>, and <a href="thallium">thallium</a>. All but boron are <a href="post-transition%20metal">post-transition metal</a>s, and nihonium is expected to be a post-transition metal as well. It should also show several major differences from them; for example, nihonium should be more stable in the +1 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> than the +3 state, like thallium, but in the +1 state nihonium should behave more like <a href="silver">silver</a> and <a href="astatine">astatine</a> than thallium. Preliminary experiments in 2017 showed that elemental nihonium is not very <a href="volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a>; its chemistry remains largely unexplored.

The syntheses of elements <a href="bohrium">107</a> to <a href="copernicium">112</a> were conducted at the <a href="GSI%20Helmholtz%20Centre%20for%20Heavy%20Ion%20Research">GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research</a> in <a href="Darmstadt">Darmstadt</a>, Germany, from 1981 to 1996. These elements were made by <a href="cold%20fusion">cold fusion</a> reactions, in which targets made of <a href="thallium">thallium</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, and <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>, which are around the <a href="nuclear%20shell%20model">stable configuration</a> of 82 protons, are bombarded with heavy ions of <a href="period%204%20element">period 4 element</a>s. This creates fused nuclei with low excitation energies due to the stability of the targets' nuclei, significantly increasing the yield of <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s. Cold fusion was pioneered by <a href="Yuri%20Oganessian">Yuri Oganessian</a> and his team in 1974 at the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> (JINR) in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, Soviet Union. Yields from cold fusion reactions were found to decrease significantly with increasing atomic number; the resulting nuclei were severely neutron-deficient and short-lived. The GSI team attempted to synthesise element 113 via cold fusion in 1998 and 2003, bombarding bismuth-209 with <a href="zinc">zinc</a>-70, but were unsuccessful both times.

Faced with this problem, Oganessian and his team at the JINR turned their renewed attention to the older hot fusion technique, in which heavy <a href="actinide">actinide</a> targets were bombarded with lighter ions. <a href="Calcium-48">Calcium-48</a> was suggested as an ideal projectile, because it is very neutron-rich for a light element (combined with the already neutron-rich actinides) and would minimise the neutron deficiencies of the nuclides produced. Being <a href="doubly%20magic">doubly magic</a>, it would confer benefits in stability to the fused nuclei. In collaboration with the team at the <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> (LLNL) in <a href="Livermore%2C%20California">Livermore, California</a>, United States, they made an attempt on <a href="flerovium">element 114</a> (which was predicted to be a <a href="magic%20number%20%28physics%29">magic number</a>, closing a proton shell, and more stable than element 113).

In 1998, the JINR–LLNL collaboration started their attempt on element 114, bombarding a target of <a href="plutonium-244">plutonium-244</a> with ions of calcium-48:

A single atom was observed which was thought to be the isotope 114: the results were published in January 1999. Despite numerous attempts to repeat this reaction, an isotope with these decay properties has never again been found, and the exact identity of this activity is unknown. A 2016 paper considered that the most likely explanation of the 1998 result is that two neutrons were emitted by the produced compound nucleus, leading to 114 and <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> to 113, while more neutrons were emitted in all other produced chains. This would have been the first report of a decay chain from an isotope of element 113, but it was not recognised at the time, and the assignment is still uncertain. A similar long-lived activity observed by the JINR team in March 1999 in the Pu + Ca reaction may be due to the electron-capture daughter of 114, 113; this assignment is also tentative.

The now-confirmed discovery of element 114 was made in June 1999 when the JINR team repeated the first Pu + Ca reaction from 1998; following this, the JINR team used the same hot fusion technique to synthesise elements <a href="livermorium">116</a> and <a href="oganesson">118</a> in 2000 and 2002 respectively via the <a href="curium">Cm</a> + Ca and <a href="californium">Cf</a> + Ca reactions. They then turned their attention to the missing odd-numbered elements, as the odd protons and possibly neutrons would hinder decay by <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> and result in longer decay chains.

The first report of element 113 was in August 2003, when it was identified as an <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> product of <a href="moscovium">element 115</a>. Element 115 had been produced by bombarding a target of <a href="americium">americium</a>-243 with calcium-48 projectiles. The JINR–LLNL collaboration published its results in February 2004:

Four further alpha decays were observed, ending with the <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> of isotopes of element 105, <a href="dubnium">dubnium</a>.

While the JINR–LLNL collaboration had been studying fusion reactions with Ca, a team of Japanese scientists at the <a href="Riken">Riken</a> Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science in <a href="Wak%C5%8D%2C%20Saitama">Wakō</a>, Japan, led by Kōsuke Morita had been studying cold fusion reactions. Morita had previously studied the synthesis of superheavy elements at the JINR before starting his own team at Riken. In 2001, his team confirmed the GSI's discoveries of elements <a href="hassium">108</a>, <a href="darmstadtium">110</a>, <a href="roentgenium">111</a>, and 112. They then made a new attempt on element 113, using the same Bi + Zn reaction that the GSI had attempted unsuccessfully in 1998. Despite the much lower yield expected than for the JINR's hot fusion technique with calcium-48, the Riken team chose to use cold fusion as the synthesised isotopes would alpha decay to known daughter nuclides and make the discovery much more certain, and would not require the use of radioactive targets. In particular, the isotope 113 expected to be produced in this reaction would decay to the known Bh, which had been synthesised in 2000 by a team at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (LBNL) in Berkeley.

The bombardment of Bi with Zn at Riken began in September 2003. The team detected a single atom of 113 in July 2004 and published their results that September:

The Riken team observed four alpha decays from 113, creating a decay chain passing through Rg, Mt, and Bh before terminating with the spontaneous fission of Db. The decay data they observed for the alpha decay of Bh matched the 2000 data, lending support for their claim. Spontaneous fission of its daughter Db had not been previously known; the American team had observed only alpha decay from this nuclide.

When the discovery of a new element is claimed, the <a href="IUPAC/IUPAP%20Joint%20Working%20Party">Joint Working Party</a> (JWP) of the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) and the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Physics">International Union of Pure and Applied Physics</a> (IUPAP) assembles to examine the claims according to their criteria for the discovery of a new element, and decides <a href="scientific%20priority">scientific priority</a> and naming rights for the elements. According to the JWP criteria, a discovery must demonstrate that the element has an atomic number different from all previously observed values. It should also preferably be repeated by other laboratories, although this requirement has been waived where the data is of very high quality. Such a demonstration must establish properties, either physical or chemical, of the new element and establish that they are those of a previously unknown element. The main techniques used to demonstrate atomic number are cross-reactions (creating claimed nuclides as parents or daughters of other nuclides produced by a different reaction) and anchoring decay chains to known daughter nuclides. For the JWP, priority in confirmation takes precedence over the date of the original claim. Both teams set out to confirm their results by these methods.
In June 2004 and again in December 2005, the JINR–LLNL collaboration strengthened their claim for the discovery of element 113 by conducting chemical experiments on <a href="Dubnium">Db</a>, the final <a href="decay%20product">decay product</a> of 115. This was valuable as none of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known, so that their claim was not supported by any previous experimental data, and chemical experimentation would strengthen the case for their claim, since the chemistry of dubnium is known. Db was successfully identified by extracting the final decay products, measuring <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> (SF) activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a <a href="group%205%20element">group 5 element</a> (dubnium is known to be in group 5). Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed Db which lends support to the assignment of the parent and <a href="daughter%20isotope">daughter nuclei</a> to elements 115 and 113 respectively. Further experiments at the JINR in 2005 confirmed the observed decay data.

In November and December 2004, the Riken team studied the Tl + Zn reaction, aiming the zinc beam onto a <a href="thallium">thallium</a> rather than a bismuth target, in an effort to directly produce Rg in a cross-bombardment as it is the immediate daughter of 113. The reaction was unsuccessful, as the thallium target was <a href="Strength%20of%20materials">physically weak</a> compared to the more commonly used lead and bismuth targets, and it deteriorated significantly and became non-uniform in thickness. The reasons for this weakness are unknown, given that thallium has a higher melting point than bismuth. The Riken team then repeated the original Bi + Zn reaction and produced a second atom of 113 in April 2005, with a decay chain that again terminated with the spontaneous fission of Db. The decay data were slightly different from those of the first chain: this could have been because an <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a> escaped from the detector without depositing its full energy, or because some of the intermediate decay products were formed in <a href="metastable%20state">metastable isomeric states</a>.

In 2006, a team at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in <a href="Lanzhou">Lanzhou</a>, China, investigated the Am + Mg reaction, producing four atoms of Bh. All four chains started with an alpha decay to Db; three chains ended there with spontaneous fission, as in the 113 chains observed at Riken, while the remaining one continued via another alpha decay to Lr, as in the Bh chains observed at LBNL.

In June 2006, the JINR–LLNL collaboration claimed to have synthesised a new isotope of element 113 directly by bombarding a <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a>-237 target with accelerated calcium-48 nuclei:

Two atoms of 113 were detected. The aim of this experiment had been to synthesise the isotopes 113 and 113 that would fill in the gap between isotopes produced via hot fusion (113 and 113) and cold fusion (113). After five alpha decays, these nuclides would reach known isotopes of <a href="lawrencium">lawrencium</a>, assuming that the decay chains were not terminated prematurely by spontaneous fission. The first decay chain ended in fission after four alpha decays, presumably originating from Db or its electron-capture daughter Rf. Spontaneous fission was not observed in the second chain even after four alpha decays. A fifth alpha decay in each chain could have been missed, since Db can theoretically undergo alpha decay, in which case the first decay chain would have ended at the known Lr or No and the second might have continued to the known long-lived Md, which has a half-life of 51.5 days, longer than the duration of the experiment: this would explain the lack of a spontaneous fission event in this chain. In the absence of direct detection of the long-lived alpha decays, these interpretations remain unconfirmed, and there is still no known link between any superheavy nuclides produced by hot fusion and the well-known main body of the chart of nuclides.

The JWP published its report on elements 113–116 and 118 in 2011. It recognised the JINR–LLNL collaboration as having discovered elements 114 and 116, but did not accept either team's claim to element 113 and did not accept the JINR–LLNL claims to elements 115 and 118. The JINR–LLNL claim to elements 115 and 113 had been founded on chemical identification of their daughter dubnium, but the JWP objected that current theory could not distinguish between <a href="group%204%20element">group 4</a> and group 5 elements by their chemical properties with enough confidence to allow this assignment. The decay properties of all the nuclei in the decay chain of element 115 had not been previously characterised before the JINR experiments, a situation which the JWP generally considers "troublesome, but not necessarily exclusive", and with the small number of atoms produced with neither known daughters nor cross-reactions the JWP considered that their criteria had not been fulfilled. The JWP did not accept the Riken team's claim either due to inconsistencies in the decay data, the small number of atoms of element 113 produced, and the lack of unambiguous anchors to known isotopes.

In early 2009, the Riken team synthesised the decay product Bh directly in the Cm + Na reaction to establish its link with 113 as a cross-bombardment. They also established the branched decay of Db, which sometimes underwent spontaneous fission and sometimes underwent the previously known alpha decay to Lr.

In late 2009, the JINR–LLNL collaboration studied the Bk + Ca reaction in an effort to produce <a href="tennessine">element 117</a>, which would decay to elements 115 and 113 and bolster their claims in a cross-reaction. They were now joined by scientists from <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) and <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a>, both in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, United States, who helped procure the rare and highly radioactive <a href="berkelium">berkelium</a> target necessary to complete the JINR's calcium-48 campaign to synthesise the heaviest elements on the periodic table. Two isotopes of element 117 were synthesised, decaying to element 115 and then element 113:

The new isotopes 113 and 113 produced did not overlap with the previously claimed 113, 113, and 113, so this reaction could not be used as a cross-bombardment to confirm the 2003 or 2006 claims.

In March 2010, the Riken team again attempted to synthesise Rg directly through the Tl + Zn reaction with upgraded equipment; they failed again and abandoned this cross-bombardment route.

After 450 more days of irradiation of bismuth with zinc projectiles, Riken produced and identified another 113 atom in August 2012. In this case, a series of six alpha decays was observed, leading to an isotope of <a href="mendelevium">mendelevium</a>:

This decay chain differed from the previous observations at Riken mainly in the decay mode of Db, which was previously observed to undergo spontaneous fission, but in this case instead alpha decayed; the alpha decay of Db to Lr is <a href="isotopes%20of%20dubnium">well-known</a>. The team calculated the probability of accidental <a href="mathematical%20coincidence">coincidence</a> to be 10, or totally negligible. The resulting Md atom then underwent <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> to <a href="fermium">Fm</a>, which underwent the seventh alpha decay in the chain to the long-lived <a href="californium">Cf</a>, which has a half-life of around thirteen years.

The Bk + Ca experiment was repeated at the JINR in 2012 and 2013 with consistent results, and again at the GSI in 2014. In August 2013, a team of researchers at <a href="Lund%20University">Lund University</a> in <a href="Lund">Lund</a>, Sweden, and at the GSI announced that they had repeated the 2003 Am + Ca experiment, confirming the findings of the JINR–LLNL collaboration. The same year, the 2003 experiment had been repeated at the JINR, now also creating the isotope 115 that could serve as a cross-bombardment for confirming their discovery of the <a href="tennessine">element 117</a> isotope 117, as well as its daughter 113 as part of its decay chain. Further confirmation was published by the team at the LBNL in 2015.

In December 2015, the conclusions of a new JWP report were published by IUPAC in a press release, in which element 113 was awarded to Riken; elements 115, 117, and 118 were awarded to the collaborations involving the JINR. A joint 2016 announcement by IUPAC and IUPAP had been scheduled to coincide with the publication of the JWP reports, but IUPAC alone decided on an early release because the news of Riken being awarded credit for element 113 had been leaked to Japanese newspapers. For the first time in history, a team of Asian physicists would name a new element. The JINR considered the awarding of element 113 to Riken unexpected, citing their own 2003 production of elements 115 and 113, and pointing to the precedents of elements <a href="lawrencium">103</a>, <a href="rutherfordium">104</a>, and <a href="dubnium">105</a> where IUPAC had awarded joint credit to the JINR and LBNL. They stated that they respected IUPAC's decision, but reserved determination of their position for the official publication of the JWP reports.

The full JWP reports were published in January 2016. The JWP recognised the discovery of element 113, assigning priority to Riken. They noted that while the individual decay energies of each nuclide in the decay chain of 113 were inconsistent, their sum was now confirmed to be consistent, strongly suggesting that the initial and final states in 113 and its daughter Db were the same for all three events. The decay of Db to Lr and Md was previously known, firmly anchoring the decay chain of 113 to known regions of the chart of nuclides. The JWP considered that the JINR–LLNL collaborations of 2004 and 2007, producing element 113 as the daughter of element 115, did not meet the discovery criteria as they had not convincingly determined the atomic numbers of their nuclides through cross-bombardments, which were considered necessary since their decay chains were not anchored to previously known nuclides. They also considered that the previous JWP's concerns over their chemical identification of the dubnium daughter had not been adequately addressed. The JWP recognised the JINR–LLNL–ORNL–Vanderbilt collaboration of 2010 as having discovered elements 117 and 115, and accepted that element 113 had been produced as their daughter, but did not give this work shared credit.

After the publication of the JWP reports, Sergey Dimitriev, the lab director of the Flerov lab at the JINR where the discoveries were made, remarked that he was happy with IUPAC's decision, mentioning the time Riken spent on their experiment and their good relations with Morita, who had learnt the basics of synthesising superheavy elements at the JINR.

The sum argument advanced by the JWP in the approval of the discovery of element 113 was later criticised in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI, as it is only valid if no <a href="gamma%20decay">gamma decay</a> or <a href="internal%20conversion">internal conversion</a> takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 113 decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility. If this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters becomes a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have different half-lives: for example, the ground state of Ta has a half-life of hours, but an excited state <a href="isotopes%20of%20tantalum">Ta</a> has never been observed to decay. This study found reason to doubt and criticise the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of elements 115 and 117, but the data from Riken for element 113 was found to be congruent, and the data from the JINR team for elements 115 and 113 to probably be so, thus endorsing the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113. Two members of the JINR team published a journal article rebutting these criticisms against the congruence of their data on elements 113, 115, and 117 in June 2017.

Using <a href="Mendeleev%27s%20predicted%20elements">Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements</a>, nihonium should be known as "eka-thallium". In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called "ununtrium" (with the corresponding symbol of "Uut"), a <a href="systematic%20element%20name">systematic element name</a> as a <a href="placeholder%20name">placeholder</a>, until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a name is decided on. The recommendations were widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, but were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it "element 113", with the symbol of "E113", "(113)", or even simply "113".

Before the JWP recognition of their priority, the Japanese team had unofficially suggested various names: "japonium", after their home country; "nishinanium", after Japanese physicist <a href="Yoshio%20Nishina">Yoshio Nishina</a>, the "founding father of modern physics research in Japan"; and "rikenium", after the institute. After the recognition, the Riken team gathered in February 2016 to decide on a name. Morita expressed his desire for the name to honour the fact that element 113 had been discovered in Japan. "Japonium" was considered, making the connection to Japan easy to identify for non-Japanese, but it was rejected as <a href="Jap">Jap</a> is considered an <a href="ethnic%20slur">ethnic slur</a>. The name "nihonium" was chosen after an hour of deliberation: it comes from , one of the two Japanese pronunciations for the name of Japan. The discoverers also intended to reference the support of their research by the Japanese people (Riken being almost entirely government-funded), recover lost pride and trust in science among those who were affected by the <a href="Fukushima%20Daiichi%20nuclear%20disaster">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</a>, and honour Japanese chemist <a href="Masataka%20Ogawa">Masataka Ogawa</a>'s 1908 discovery of <a href="rhenium">rhenium</a>, which he named "nipponium" with symbol Np after the other Japanese pronunciation of Japan's name. As Ogawa's claim had not been accepted, the name "nipponium" could not be reused for a new element, and its symbol Np had since been used for <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a>. In March 2016, Morita proposed the name "nihonium" to IUPAC, with the symbol Nh.
The former president of IUPAP, <a href="Cecilia%20Jarlskog">Cecilia Jarlskog</a>, complained at the Nobel Symposium on Superheavy Elements in <a href="B%C3%A4ckaskog%20Castle">Bäckaskog Castle</a>, Sweden, in June 2016 about the lack of openness involved in the process of approving new elements, and stated that she believed that the JWP's work was flawed and should be redone by a new JWP. A survey of physicists determined that many felt that the Lund–GSI 2016 criticisms of the JWP report were well-founded, but that the conclusions would hold up if the work was redone, and the new president, <a href="Bruce%20McKellar">Bruce McKellar</a>, ruled that the proposed names should be released in a joint IUPAP–IUPAC press release. Thus, IUPAC and IUPAP publicised the proposal of "nihonium" that June, and set a five-month term to collect comments, after which the name would be formally established at a conference. The name was officially approved in November 2016. The naming ceremony for the new element was held in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, Japan, in March 2017, with <a href="Naruhito%2C%20Crown%20Prince%20of%20Japan">Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan</a>, in attendance.

Nihonium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesised in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Eight different isotopes of nihonium have been reported with atomic masses 278, 282–287, and 290 (Nh and Nh are unconfirmed); they all decay through alpha decay to isotopes of <a href="roentgenium">roentgenium</a>; there have been indications that nihonium-284 can also decay by <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> to <a href="copernicium">copernicium</a>-284.

The stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after <a href="curium">curium</a>, element 96, whose half-life is over ten thousand times longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above <a href="mendelevium">101</a> undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours: this is because of the ever-increasing <a href="Coulomb%27s%20law">Coulomb repulsion</a> of protons, so that the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong nuclear force</a> cannot hold the nucleus together against <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilising factors, elements with more than <a href="lawrencium">103 protons</a> should not exist. Researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed <a href="nuclear%20shell%20model">nuclear shells</a> around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, and create an "<a href="island%20of%20stability">island of stability</a>" containing nuclides with half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. The existence of the island is still unproven, but the existence of the <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s (including nihonium) confirms that the stabilising effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island.

All nihonium isotopes are unstable and radioactive; the heavier nihonium isotopes are more stable than the lighter ones, as they are closer to the centre of the island. The most stable known nihonium isotope, Nh, is also the heaviest; it has a half-life of 8 seconds. The isotope Nh, as well as the unconfirmed Nh and Nh, have also been reported to have half-lives of over a second. The isotopes Nh and Nh have half-lives of 1 and 0.1 seconds respectively. The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100 milliseconds: Nh has a half-life of 70 milliseconds, and Nh, the lightest known nihonium isotope, is also the shortest-lived, with a half-life of 1.4 milliseconds. This rapid increase in the half-lives near the closed neutron shell at "N" = 184 is seen in roentgenium, copernicium, and nihonium (elements 111 through 113), where each extra neutron so far multiplies the half-life by a factor of 5 to 20.

Nihonium is the first member of the 7p series of elements and the heaviest <a href="boron%20group">group 13</a> element on the periodic table, below <a href="boron">boron</a>, <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="gallium">gallium</a>, <a href="indium">indium</a>, and <a href="thallium">thallium</a>. All the group 13 elements except boron are metals, and nihonium is expected to follow suit. Nihonium is predicted to show many differences from its lighter homologues. The major reason for this is the <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit (SO) interaction</a>, which is especially strong for the <a href="superheavy%20element">superheavy element</a>s, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities close to the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. In relation to nihonium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilising those electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilised more than the other four. The stabilisation of the 7s electrons is called the <a href="inert%20pair%20effect">inert pair effect</a>, and the separation of the 7p subshell into the more and less stabilised parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists see the split as a change of the second, <a href="azimuthal%20quantum%20number">azimuthal quantum number</a> "l", from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more and less stabilised parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s 7p. The first ionisation energy of nihonium is expected to be 7.306 <a href="electronvolt">eV</a>, the highest among the metals of group 13. Similar subshell splitting should exist for the 6d electron levels, with four being 6d and six being 6d. Both these levels are raised to be close in energy to the 7s ones, high enough to possibly be chemically active. This would allow for the possibility of exotic nihonium compounds without lighter group 13 analogues.

Periodic trends would predict nihonium to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one <a href="period%20%28periodic%20table%29">period</a> further down the periodic table, but calculations suggest nihonium has an atomic radius of about 170 pm, the same as that of thallium, due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of its 7s and 7p orbitals. Thus nihonium is expected to be much denser than thallium, with a predicted density of about 16 to 18 g/cm compared to thallium's 11.85 g/cm, since nihonium atoms are heavier than thallium atoms but have the same volume. Bulk nihonium is expected to have a <a href="hexagonal%20close-packed">hexagonal close-packed</a> crystal structure, like thallium. The melting and boiling points of nihonium have been predicted to be 430 °C and 1100 °C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.

The chemistry of nihonium is expected to be very different from that of thallium. This difference stems from the spin–orbit splitting of the 7p shell, which results in nihonium being between two relatively inert closed-shell elements (<a href="copernicium">copernicium</a> and <a href="flerovium">flerovium</a>), an unprecedented situation in the periodic table. Nihonium is expected to be less reactive than thallium, because of the greater stabilisation and resultant chemical inactivity of the 7s subshell in nihonium compared to the 6s subshell in thallium. The <a href="standard%20electrode%20potential">standard electrode potential</a> for the Nh/Nh couple is predicted to be 0.6 V, so nihonium should be a rather <a href="noble%20metal">noble metal</a>, as unreactive as <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a> and <a href="ruthenium">ruthenium</a>.

The metallic group 13 elements are typically found in two <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s: +1 and +3. The former results from the involvement of only the single p electron in bonding, and the latter results in the involvement of all three valence electrons, two in the s-subshell and one in the p-subshell. Going down the group, bond energies decrease and the +3 state becomes less stable, as the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the s-electrons. Hence, for aluminium and gallium +3 is the most stable state, but +1 gains importance for indium and by thallium it becomes more stable than the +3 state. Nihonium is expected to continue this trend and have +1 as its most stable oxidation state.

The simplest possible nihonium compound is the monohydride, NhH. The bonding is provided by the 7p electron of nihonium and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The SO interaction causes the <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> of nihonium monohydride to be reduced by about 1 eV and the nihonium–hydrogen bond length to decrease as the bonding 7p orbital is relativistically contracted. This is unique among the 7p element monohydrides; all the others have relativistic expansion of the bond length instead of contraction. Another effect of the SO interaction is that the Nh–H bond is expected to have significant <a href="pi%20bond">pi bond</a>ing character (side-on orbital overlap), unlike the almost pure <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>ing (head-on orbital overlap) in thallium monohydride (TlH). The analogous monofluoride (Nh<a href="fluorine">F</a>) should also exist. Nihonium(I) is predicted to be more similar to <a href="silver">silver</a>(I) than thallium(I): the Nh ion is expected to more willingly bind <a href="anion">anion</a>s, so that NhCl should be quite soluble in excess <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> or <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>; <a href="thallium%28I%29%20chloride">TlCl</a> is not. In contrast to Tl, which forms the strongly <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a> hydroxide (<a href="thallium%28I%29%20hydroxide">TlOH</a>) in solution, the Nh cation should instead hydrolyse all the way to the <a href="amphoterism">amphoteric</a> oxide NhO, which would be soluble in aqueous ammonia and weakly soluble in water.

The <a href="adsorption">adsorption</a> behaviour of nihonium on <a href="gold">gold</a> surfaces in thermochromatographical experiments is expected to be closer to that of <a href="astatine">astatine</a> than that of thallium. The destabilisation of the 7p subshell effectively leads to a valence shell closing at the 7s 7p configuration rather than the expected 7s 7p configuration with its stable octet. As such, nihonium, like astatine, can be considered to be one p-electron short of a closed valence shell. Hence, even though nihonium is in group 13, it has several properties similar to the group 17 elements. (<a href="Tennessine">Tennessine</a> in group 17 has some group-13-like properties, as it has three valence electrons outside the 7s 7p closed shell.) Nihonium is expected to be able to gain an electron to attain this closed-shell configuration, forming the −1 oxidation state like the <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s (<a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, <a href="bromine">bromine</a>, <a href="iodine">iodine</a>, and astatine). This state should be more stable than it is for thallium as the SO splitting of the 7p subshell is greater than that for the 6p subshell. Nihonium should be the most <a href="electronegativity">electronegative</a> of the metallic group 13 elements, even more electronegative than tennessine, the period 7 congener of the halogens: in the compound NhTs, the negative charge is expected to be on the nihonium atom rather than the tennessine atom. The −1 oxidation should be more stable for nihonium than for tennessine. The electron affinity of nihonium is calculated to be around 0.68 eV, higher than thallium's at 0.4 eV; tennessine's is expected to be 1.8 eV, the lowest in its group. It is theoretically predicted that nihonium should have an <a href="enthalpy%20of%20sublimation">enthalpy of sublimation</a> around 150 kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159 kJ/mol.

Significant 6d involvement is expected in the Nh–Au bond, although it is expected to be more unstable than the Tl–Au bond and entirely due to magnetic interactions. This raises the possibility of some <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a> character for nihonium. On the basis of the small energy gap between the 6d and 7s electrons, the higher oxidation states +3 and +5 have been suggested for nihonium. Some simple compounds with nihonium in the +3 oxidation state would be the trihydride (NhH), trifluoride (NhF), and trichloride (Nh<a href="chlorine">Cl</a>). These molecules are predicted to be <a href="T-shaped%20molecular%20geometry">T-shaped</a> and not <a href="trigonal%20planar%20molecular%20geometry">trigonal planar</a> as their <a href="boron">boron</a> analogues are: this is due to the influence of the 6d electrons on the bonding. The heavier nihonium tribromide (Nh<a href="bromine">Br</a>) and triiodide (Nh<a href="iodine">I</a>) are trigonal planar due to the increased steric repulsion between the peripheral atoms; accordingly, they do not show significant 6d involvement in their bonding, though the large 7s–7p energy gap means that they show reduced sp hybridisation compared to their boron analogues.

The bonding in the lighter NhX molecules can be considered as that of a linear species (similar to <a href="mercury%28II%29%20fluoride">HgF</a> or ) with an additional Nh–X bond involving the 7p orbital of nihonium perpendicular to the other two ligands. These compounds are all expected to be highly unstable towards the loss of an X molecule and reduction to nihonium(I):
Nihonium thus continues the trend down group 13 of reduced stability of the +3 oxidation state, as all five of these compounds have lower reaction energies than the unknown thallium(III) iodide. The +3 state is stabilised for thallium in anionic complexes such as , and the presence of a possible vacant coordination site on the lighter T-shaped nihonium trihalides is expected to allow a similar stabilisation of and perhaps .

The +5 oxidation state is unknown for all lighter group 13 elements: calculations predict that nihonium pentahydride (NhH) and pentafluoride (NhF) should have a <a href="square%20pyramidal%20molecular%20geometry">square pyramidal molecular geometry</a>, but also that both would be highly thermodynamically unstable to loss of an X molecule and reduction to nihonium(III). Despite its instability, the possible existence of nihonium pentafluoride is entirely due to relativistic effects allowing the 6d electrons to participate in the bonding. Again, some stabilisation is expected for anionic complexes, such as . The structures of the nihonium trifluoride and pentafluoride molecules are the same as those for <a href="chlorine%20trifluoride">chlorine trifluoride</a> and <a href="chlorine%20pentafluoride">pentafluoride</a>.

The chemical characteristics of nihonium have yet to be determined unambiguously. The isotopes Nh, Nh, and Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the JINR to determine the <a href="volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatility</a> of nihonium. The isotope Nh was investigated, made as the daughter of Mc produced in the Am+Ca reaction. The nihonium atoms were synthesised in a recoil chamber and then carried along <a href="polytetrafluoroethylene">polytetrafluoroethylene</a> (PTFE) capillaries at 70 °C by a carrier gas to the gold-covered detectors. About ten to twenty atoms of Nh were produced, but none of these atoms were registered by the detectors, suggesting either that nihonium was similar in volatility to the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es (and thus diffused away too quickly to be detected) or, more plausibly, that pure nihonium was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the PTFE capillaries. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH should ease the transport, as nihonium hydroxide is expected to be more volatile than elemental nihonium, and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more <a href="water%20vapour">water vapour</a> into the carrier gas. It seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favoured, so the longer-lived isotopes Nh and Nh were considered more desirable for future experiments.

A 2017 experiment at the JINR, producing Nh and Nh via the Am+Ca reaction as the daughters of Mc and Mc, avoided this problem by removing the quartz surface, using only PTFE. No nihonium atoms were observed after chemical separation, implying an unexpectedly large retention of nihonium atoms on PTFE surfaces. This experimental result for the interaction limit of nihonium atoms with a PTFE surface disagrees significantly with previous theory, which expected a lower value of 14.00 kJ/mol. This suggests that the nihonium species involved in the previous experiment was likely not elemental nihonium but rather nihonium hydroxide, and that high-temperature techniques such as vacuum <a href="chromatography">chromatography</a> would be necessary to further probe the behaviour of elemental nihonium. <a href="Bromine">Bromine</a> saturated with <a href="boron%20tribromide">boron tribromide</a> has been suggested as a carrier gas for experiments on nihonium chemistry; this oxidises nihonium's lighter congener thallium to thallium(III), providing an avenue to investigate the oxidation states of nihonium, similar to earlier experiments done on the bromides of group 5 elements, including the superheavy <a href="dubnium">dubnium</a>.

From Russia, with Love (novel)

From Russia, with Love is the fifth novel by the English author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> to feature his fictional British <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Service</a> agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica; at the time he thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> on 8 April 1957.

The story centres on a plot by <a href="SMERSH%20%28James%20Bond%29">SMERSH</a>, the Soviet <a href="counter-intelligence">counter-intelligence</a> agency, to assassinate Bond in such a way as to discredit both him and his organisation. As bait, the Russians use a beautiful cipher clerk and the Spektor, a Soviet decoding machine. Much of the action takes place in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and on the <a href="Orient%20Express">Orient Express</a>. The book was inspired by Fleming's visit to Turkey on behalf of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" to report on an <a href="Interpol">Interpol</a> conference; he returned to Britain by the Orient Express. "From Russia, with Love" deals with the East–West tensions of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, and the decline of British power and influence in the post-Second World War era.

"From Russia, with Love" received broadly positive reviews at the time of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a> to the Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>", which listed "From Russia, with Love" as one of US President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the <a href="From%20Russia%20with%20Love%20%28film%29">second film</a> in the <a href="James%20Bond%20in%20film">Bond series</a>, starring <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>.

<a href="SMERSH%20%28James%20Bond%29">SMERSH</a>, the Soviet <a href="counterintelligence">counterintelligence</a> agency, plans to commit a grand act of terrorism in the intelligence field. For this, it targets the British secret service agent <a href="James%20Bond%20%28literary%20character%29">James Bond</a>. Due in part to his role in the defeat of the SMERSH agents <a href="Le%20Chiffre">Le Chiffre</a>, Mr Big and <a href="Hugo%20Drax">Hugo Drax</a>, Bond has been listed as an enemy of the Soviet state and a "death warrant" is issued for him. His death is planned to precipitate a major sex scandal, which will run in the world press for months and leave his and his service's reputations in tatters. Bond's killer is to be the SMERSH executioner Red Grant, a psychopath whose homicidal urges coincide with the full moon. Kronsteen, SMERSH's chess-playing master planner, and Colonel <a href="Rosa%20Klebb">Rosa Klebb</a>, the head of Operations and Executions, devise the operation. They instruct an attractive young cipher clerk, Corporal <a href="Tatiana%20Romanova">Tatiana Romanova</a>, to falsely defect from her post in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> having, she would claim, fallen in love with Bond after seeing a photograph on his file. As an added lure for Bond, Romanova will provide the British with a Spektor, a Russian decoding device much coveted by <a href="MI6">MI6</a>. She is not told the details of the plan.
The offer of defection is received by MI6 in London, ostensibly from Romanova, but is conditional that Bond collects her and the Spektor from Istanbul. MI6 is unsure of Romanova's motive, but the prize of the Spektor is too tempting to ignore; Bond's superior, <a href="M%20%28James%20Bond%29">M</a>, orders him to go to Turkey. Once there, Bond forms a comradeship with Darko Kerim, head of the British service's station in Turkey. Bond meets Romanova and they plan their route out of Turkey with the Spektor. He and Kerim believe her story and the three board the <a href="Orient%20Express">Orient Express</a>. Kerim quickly discovers three Russian <a href="Ministry%20of%20State%20Security%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">MGB</a> agents on board, travelling incognito. He uses bribes and trickery to have two of them taken off the train, but he is later found dead in his compartment with the body of the third MGB agent.

At <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> a fellow MI6 agent, "Captain Nash", introduces himself and Bond presumes he has been sent by M as added protection for the rest of the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Bond is woken with a weapon pointing at him and Nash reveals himself to be the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is to shoot Bond through the heart and dispose of Romanova after leaving a film of their love-making in the luggage; in addition, the Spektor is booby-trapped to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal cigarette case between the pages of a book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.

Later, in Paris, after successfully delivering Romanova and the booby-trapped Spektor to his superiors, Bond meets Rosa Klebb. She is captured but manages to kick Bond with a poisoned blade concealed in her shoe; the story ends with Bond fighting for breath and falling to the floor.

By January 1956 the author <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> had published three novels—"<a href="Casino%20Royale%20%28novel%29">Casino Royale</a>" in 1953, "<a href="Live%20and%20Let%20Die%20%28novel%29">Live and Let Die</a>" in 1954 and "<a href="Moonraker%20%28novel%29">Moonraker</a>" in 1955. A fourth, "<a href="Diamonds%20Are%20Forever%20%28novel%29">Diamonds Are Forever</a>", was being edited and prepared for production. That month Fleming travelled to his <a href="Goldeneye%20%28estate%29">Goldeneye estate</a> in Jamaica to write "From Russia, with Love". He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in "<a href="Hansom%20Books">Books and Bookmen</a>" magazine: "I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works. One of the significant re-writes changed Bond's fate; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend, the American author <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>: "My muse is in a very bad way ... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks." Fleming re-wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond, which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted.

Breathing became difficult. Bond sighed to the depth of his lungs. He clenched his jaws and half closed his eyes, as people do when they want to hide their drunkenness. ... He prised his eyes open. ... Now he had to gasp for breath. Again his hand moved up towards his cold face. He had an impression of Mathis starting towards him. Bond felt his knees begin to buckle ... [he] pivoted slowly on his heel and crashed head-long to the wine-red floor.
"From Russia, with Love", novel's closing lines

Fleming's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance. By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story, and began work on "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28novel%29">Dr. No</a>" in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica.

Fleming's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 to cover an <a href="Interpol">Interpol</a> conference for "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" was a source of much of the background information in the story. While there he met the Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan, who became the model for Darko Kerim; Fleming took down many of Kalkavan's conversations in a notebook, and used them verbatim in the novel.

Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for <a href="Ian%20Fleming%20Publications">Ian Fleming Publications</a>—have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the <a href="List%20of%20James%20Bond%20novels%20and%20short%20stories">novel series</a> as a whole. Chancellor put the events of "From Russia, with Love" in 1955; Griswold considers the story to have taken place between June and August 1954.

In August 1956, for fifty <a href="Guinea%20%28coin%29">guineas</a>, Fleming commissioned <a href="Richard%20Chopping">Richard Chopping</a> to provide the art for the cover, based on Fleming's design; the result won a number of prizes. After "Diamonds Are Forever" had been published in March 1956, Fleming received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert, <a href="Geoffrey%20Boothroyd">Geoffrey Boothroyd</a>, criticising the author's choice of firearm for Bond.

I wish to point out that a man in James Bond's position would never consider using a .25 Beretta. It's really a lady's gun—and not a very nice lady at that! Dare I suggest that Bond should be armed with a .38 or a nine millimetre—let's say a German Walther PPK? That's far more appropriate.

Boothroyd's suggestions came too late to be included in "From Russia, with Love", but one of his guns—a .38 <a href="Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Wesson">Smith & Wesson</a> <a href="snubnosed%20revolver">snubnosed revolver</a> modified with one third of the trigger guard removed—was used as the model for Chopping's image. Fleming later thanked Boothroyd by naming the armourer in <a href="Dr.%20No%20%28novel%29">"Dr. No"</a> Major Boothroyd.

As with several of his works, Fleming appropriated the names or backgrounds of people he knew or had heard of for the story's characters: Red Grant, a Jamaican river guide—whom Fleming's biographer <a href="Andrew%20Lycett">Andrew Lycett</a> described as "a cheerful, voluble giant of villainous aspect"—was used for the half-German, half-Irish assassin. Rosa Klebb was partly based on Colonel Rybkin—a real-life member of the Lenin Military-Political Academy about whom Fleming had written an article for "The Sunday Times". The Spektor machine used as the bait for Bond was not a <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> device, but had its roots in the Second World War <a href="Enigma%20machine">Enigma machine</a>, which Fleming had tried to obtain while serving in the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a>.

The idea of the Orient Express came from two sources: Fleming had returned from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the restaurant car was closed. He also knew of the story of Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in "Live and Let Die", "Diamonds Are Forever" and "<a href="The%20Man%20with%20the%20Golden%20Gun%20%28novel%29">The Man with the Golden Gun</a>".

The cultural historian <a href="Jeremy%20Black%20%28historian%29">Jeremy Black</a> points out that "From Russia, with Love" was written and published at a time when tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A <a href="Operation%20Gold">joint British and American operation</a> to tap into landline communication of the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a> headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20zone">Soviet-occupied zone</a> had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver <a href="Lionel%20Crabb">Lionel Crabb</a> had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser "Ordzhonikidze" while the ship was moored in <a href="Portsmouth%20Harbour">Portsmouth Harbour</a>, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">popular uprising</a> in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.

To make Bond a more rounded character, Fleming put further aspects of his personality into his creation. The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that Bond's "physical and mental ennui" is a reflection of Fleming's poor health and low spirits when he wrote the book. The early depictions of Bond were based on earlier literary characters. In "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>", the journalist William Cook writes of the early Bond:

James Bond is the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the <a href="Bulldog%20Drummond">Bulldog Drummond</a> tales of Lieutenant Colonel <a href="H.%20C.%20McNeile">Herman Cyril McNeile</a> (aka "Sapper") and the <a href="Richard%20Hannay">Richard Hannay</a> stories of <a href="John%20Buchan">John Buchan</a>. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain ... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age.

Following on from the character development of Bond in his previous four novels, Fleming adds further background to Bond's private life, largely around his home life and personal habits, with Bond's introduction to the story seeing him at breakfast with his housekeeper, May. The novelist <a href="Raymond%20Benson">Raymond Benson</a>—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees aspects of self-doubt entering Bond's mind with the "soft" life he has been leading when he is introduced in the book. Benson identifies Bond's fear when the flight to Istanbul encounters severe turbulence from a storm, and notes Bond's apparent nervousness when he first meets Romanova; he seems concerned and guilty about his mission. The other characters in the book are also well developed, according to Benson. He considers that the head of the Turkish office, Darko Kerim Bey, is "one of Fleming's more colourful characters"; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel (in "Live and Let Die") and Colombo (in the short story "<a href="Risico">Risico</a>"). Parker considers that Kerim is "an antidote" to Bond's lethargy, while the essayist <a href="Umberto%20Eco">Umberto Eco</a> sees the character as having some of the moral qualities of the villains in the series, but that those qualities are used in support of Bond.

"From Russia, with Love" is one of the few stories by Fleming in which the Soviets are the main enemy, although Eco considers Bond's Russian opponents "so monstrous, so improbably evil that it seems impossible to take them seriously". Fleming introduced what was a new development for him, a female opponent for Bond, although much like the former adversaries in the series, Rosa Klebb is described as being physically repulsive, with poor hygiene and gross tastes. Eco—and Anthony Synnott, in his examination of aesthetics in the Bond novels—consider that despite Klebb being female, the character is more akin to a "sexually neuter" individual. Red Grant was Fleming's first "psychotic opponent" for Bond, according to Benson. <a href="Charlie%20Higson">Charlie Higson</a>—who later wrote the <a href="Young%20Bond">Young Bond</a> series—finds Grant to be "a very modern villain: the relentless, remorseless psycho with the cold dead eyes of a 'drowned man'."

According to Higson, Fleming spent the first four novels changing the style of his books, and his approach to his characters, but in "From Russia, with Love" the author "finally hits on the classic Bond formula, and he happily moved into his most creative phase". The literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek observes that the previous novels were, in essence, episodic detective stories, while "From Russia, with Love" is structured differently, with an "extended opening picture" that describes Grant, the Russians and Romanova before moving onto the main story and then bringing back some of the elements when least expected. The extensive prose that describes the Soviet opponents and the background to the mission takes up the first ten chapters of the book, and Bond is only introduced into the story in chapter eleven. Eco identifies that the opening passage introducing Red Grant is a "cleverly presented" beginning, similar to the opening of a film. Eco remarks that "Fleming abounds in such passages of high technical skill".

Benson describes the "Fleming Sweep" as taking the reader from one chapter to another using "hooks" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next. He feels that the "Fleming Sweep steadily propels the plot" of "From Russia, with Love" and, though it was the longest of Fleming's novels, "the Sweep makes it seem half as long". <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>, who later wrote a Bond novel, considers that the story is "full of pace and conviction", while Parker identifies "cracks" in the plot of the novel, but believes that "the action mov[es] fast enough for the reader to skim over them".

Fleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which Amis calls "the Fleming effect". Amis describes "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world ... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced."

The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and <a href="Tony%20Bennett%20%28sociologist%29">Tony Bennett</a> consider that Fleming's preface note—in which he informs readers that "a great deal of the background to this story is accurate"—indicates that in this novel "cold war tensions are most massively present, saturating the narrative from beginning to end". As in "Casino Royale", the concept of the loss of British power and influence during the post-Second World War and Cold War period was also present in the novel. The journalist William Cook observes that, with the British Empire in decline "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight." Woollacott and Bennett agree, and maintain that "Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining." In "From Russia, with Love", this acknowledgement of decline manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim when he admits that in England "we don't show teeth any more—only gums."

Woollacott and Bennett argue that in selecting Bond as the target for the Russians, he is "deemed the most consummate embodiment of the myth of England". The literary critic <a href="Meir%20Sternberg">Meir Sternberg</a> sees the theme of <a href="Saint%20George%20and%20the%20Dragon">Saint George and the Dragon</a> running through several of the Bond stories, including "From Russia, with Love". He sees Bond as <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a>—the <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of England—in the story, and notes that the opening chapter begins with an examination of a <a href="dragonfly">dragonfly</a> as it flies over the supine body of Grant.

"From Russia, with Love" was released in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>. The American edition was published a few weeks later by <a href="Macmillan%20Publishers">Macmillan</a>. Fleming was pleased with the book and later said:

Personally I think "from Russia, with Love" was, in many respects, my best book, but the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned.

In November 1956 the Prime Minister, <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Sir Anthony Eden</a>, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of "From Russia, with Love" was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in "<a href="Daily%20Express">The Daily Express</a>" in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" on 17 March 1961, the US President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> listed "From Russia, with Love" as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the <a href="From%20Russia%20with%20Love%20%28film%29">film of the same name</a> in 1963, which saw the sales of the <a href="Pan%20Books">Pan</a> paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.

"From Russia, with Love" received mainly positive reviews from critics. <a href="Julian%20Symons">Julian Symons</a>, in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>", considered that it was Fleming's "tautest, most exciting and most brilliant tale", that the author "brings the thriller in line with modern emotional needs", and that Bond "is the intellectual's <a href="Mike%20Hammer">Mike Hammer</a>: a killer with a keen eye and a soft heart for a woman". The critic for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" was less persuaded by the story, suggesting that "the general tautness and brutality of the story leave the reader uneasily hovering between fact and fiction". Although the review compared Fleming in unflattering terms to <a href="Peter%20Cheyney">Peter Cheyney</a>, a <a href="crime%20fiction">crime fiction</a> writer of the 1930s and 1940s, it concluded that "From Russia, with Love" was "exciting enough of its kind".

"<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>"s critic, Maurice Richardson, thought that "From Russia, with Love" was a "stupendous plot to trap ... Bond, our deluxe cad-clubman agent" and wondered "Is this the end of Bond?" The reviewer for the "<a href="Oxford%20Mail">Oxford Mail</a>" declared that "Ian Fleming is in a class by himself", while the critic for "The Sunday Times" argued that "If a psychiatrist and a thoroughly efficient copywriter got together to produce a fictional character who would be the mid-twentieth century subconscious male ambition, the result would inevitably be James Bond."

Writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>—described by a Fleming biographer, <a href="John%20Pearson%20%28author%29">John Pearson</a>, as "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was damning in his review, saying that "From Russia, with Love" was Fleming's "longest and poorest book". Boucher further wrote that the novel contained "as usual, sex-cum-sadism with a veneer of literacy but without the occasional brilliant setpieces". The critic for the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>", conversely, wrote that "Mr Fleming is intensely observant, acutely literate and can turn a cliché into a silk purse with astute alchemy". Robert R Kirsch, writing in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", also disagreed with Boucher, saying that "the espionage novel has been brought up to date by a superb practitioner of that nearly lost art: Ian Fleming." In Kirsch's opinion, "From Russia, with Love" "has everything of the traditional plus the most modern refinements in the sinister arts of spying".

"From Russia, with Love" was serialised in "The Daily Express" from 1 April 1957; it was the first Bond novel the paper had adapted. In 1960 the novel was also adapted as a daily <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> in the paper and was syndicated worldwide. The series, which ran from 3 February to 21 May 1960, was written by <a href="Henry%20Gammidge">Henry Gammidge</a> and illustrated by <a href="John%20McLusky">John McLusky</a>. The comic strip was reprinted in 2005 by <a href="Titan%20Books">Titan Books</a> in the "Dr. No" anthology, which also included "Diamonds Are Forever" and "Casino Royale".

The film "<a href="From%20Russia%20with%20Love%20%28film%29">From Russia with Love</a>" was released in 1963, produced by <a href="Albert%20R.%20Broccoli">Albert R. Broccoli</a> and <a href="Harry%20Saltzman">Harry Saltzman</a>, and directed by <a href="Terence%20Young%20%28director%29">Terence Young</a>. It was the second Bond film in the <a href="Eon%20Productions">Eon Productions</a> series and starred <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> as Bond. The film version contained some changes to the novel, with the leading villains switching from SMERSH to <a href="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a>, a fictional terrorist organisation. In the main it was a faithful adaptation of the novel; the ending was changed to make clear Bond's survival. Benson declares that "many fans consider it "the" best Bond film, simply because it is close to Fleming's original story".

The novel was dramatised for radio in 2012 by Archie Scottney, directed by <a href="Martin%20Jarvis%20%28actor%29">Martin Jarvis</a> and produced by <a href="Rosalind%20Ayres">Rosalind Ayres</a>; it featured a full cast starring <a href="Toby%20Stephens">Toby Stephens</a> as James Bond and was first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>. It continued the series of Bond radio adaptations featuring Jarvis and Stephens following <a href="Dr.%20No%20%28novel%29">"Dr. No"</a> in 2008 and <a href="Goldfinger%20%28novel%29">"Goldfinger"</a> in 2010.

Damon Hill

Damon Graham Devereux Hill, (born 17 September 1960) is a British former <a href="racing%20driver">racing driver</a>. He is the son of <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a>, and, along with <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>, one of only two sons of a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> world champion to also win the title. He started racing on motorbikes in 1981, and after minor success moved on to single-seater racing cars. Despite progressing steadily up the ranks to the <a href="International%20Formula%203000">International Formula 3000</a> championship by 1989, and often being competitive, he never won a race at that level.

Hill became a test driver for the Formula One title-winning Williams team in 1992. He was promoted to the <a href="Williams%20Grand%20Prix%20Engineering">Williams</a> race team the following year after <a href="Riccardo%20Patrese">Riccardo Patrese</a>'s departure and took the first of his 22 victories at the <a href="1993%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">1993 Hungarian Grand Prix</a>. During the mid-1990s, Hill was <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a>'s main rival for the Formula One Drivers' Championship, which saw the two clash several times on and off the track. Their collision at the <a href="1994%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1994 Australian Grand Prix</a> gave Schumacher his first title by a single point. Hill became champion in with eight wins, but was dropped by Williams for the following season. He went on to drive for the less competitive <a href="Arrows%20Grand%20Prix%20International">Arrows</a> and <a href="Jordan%20Grand%20Prix">Jordan</a> teams, and in gave Jordan their first win.

Hill retired from racing after the season. He has since launched several businesses and has made appearances playing the guitar with celebrity bands. In 2006, he became president of the <a href="British%20Racing%20Drivers%27%20Club">British Racing Drivers' Club</a>, succeeding <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a>. Hill stepped down from the position in 2011 and was succeeded by <a href="Derek%20Warwick">Derek Warwick</a>. He presided over the securing of a 17-year contract for <a href="Silverstone%20Circuit">Silverstone</a> to hold Formula One races, which enabled the circuit to see extensive renovation work. Hill currently works as part of the <a href="Sky%20Sports%20F1">Sky Sports F1</a> broadcasting team.

Hill was born in <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, London, to Graham and Bette Hill. <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a> was a racing driver in the international <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> series. He won the world Drivers' Championship in 1962 and 1968 and became a well-known personality in the United Kingdom. Graham Hill's career provided a comfortable living. Bette (née Shubrook) was a former rower and medalist at the <a href="European%20Rowing%20Championships">European Rowing Championships</a>. By 1975 the family lived in a "25-room country mansion" in Hertfordshire and Damon attended the independent <a href="The%20Haberdashers%27%20Aske%27s%20Boys%27%20School">The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School</a>. The death of his father in an aeroplane crash in 1975 left the 15-year-old Hill, his mother, and sisters Samantha and Brigitte in drastically reduced circumstances. Hill worked as a labourer and a motorcycle courier to support his further education.

Hill is married to Susan George ('Georgie' – born 29 April 1961) and they have four children: Oliver (born 4 March 1989), <a href="Josh%20Hill%20%28racing%20driver%29">Joshua</a> (born 9 January 1991), Tabitha (born 19 July 1995) and Rosie (born 1 February 1998). Oliver was born with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down's syndrome</a> and Hill and Georgie are both patrons of the Down's Syndrome Association. In 2008, Hill also became the first patron of St. Joseph's Specialist School and College, a school for children with severe learning disabilities and autism in Cranleigh, Surrey. Joshua started racing in 2008, competing in the <a href="British%20Formula%20Renault%20Championship">British Formula Renault Championship</a> in 2011. On 9 July 2013 Joshua announced his retirement from motor racing.

Hill started his motorsport career in <a href="motorcycle%20racing">motorcycle racing</a> in 1981. He used the same simple, easily identifiable helmet design as his father: eight white oar blades arranged vertically around the upper surface of a dark blue helmet. The device and colours represent the <a href="London%20Rowing%20Club">London Rowing Club</a> for which Graham Hill rowed in the early 1950s. Although he won a 350 cc clubman's championship at the <a href="Brands%20Hatch">Brands Hatch</a> circuit, his racing budget came from working as a building labourer and he "didn't really look destined for great things" according to "<a href="Motorcycle%20News">Motorcycle News</a>" reporter Rob McDonnell. He also worked as a dispatch rider for Special Delivery, a London motorcycle dispatch company and was provided TZ350 racing bikes by them. His mother, who was concerned about the dangers of racing motorcycles, persuaded him to take a racing car course at the Winfield Racing School in France in 1983. Although he showed "above-average aptitude", Hill had only sporadic single-seater races until the end of 1984. He graduated through British <a href="Formula%20Ford">Formula Ford</a>, winning six races driving a <a href="Van%20Diemen">Van Diemen</a> for Manadient Racing in 1985, his first full season in cars, and finishing third and fifth in the two UK national championships. He also took third place in the final of the 1985 <a href="Formula%20Ford%20Festival">Formula Ford Festival</a>, helping the UK to win the team prize.

For 1986, Hill planned to move up to the <a href="BRDC%20British%20Formula%203%20Championship">British Formula Three Championship</a> with title-winning team <a href="West%20Surrey%20Racing">West Surrey Racing</a>. The loss of sponsorship from Ricoh, and then the death of his proposed teammate Bertrand Fabi in a testing accident, ended Hill's proposed drive. Hill says "When Bert was killed, I took the conscious decision that I wasn't going to stop doing that sort of thing. It's not just competing, it's doing something more exciting. I'm at my fullest skiing, racing or whatever. And I'm more frightened of letting it all slip and reaching 60 and finding I've done nothing." Hill borrowed £100,000 to finance his racing and had a steady first season for Murray Taylor Racing in 1986 before taking a brace of wins in each of the following years for Intersport. He finished third in the 1988 championship.

In Europe in the 1990s, a successful driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, the pinnacle of the sport, or to the <a href="International%20Formula%203000">International Formula 3000</a> championship. However, Hill did not have enough sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it to the best of my ability and see where it led." He took a one-off drive in the lower level <a href="British%20Formula%203000">British F3000 championship</a> and shared a <a href="Porsche%20962">Porsche 962</a> at <a href="1989%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a> for <a href="Richard%20Lloyd%20Racing">Richard Lloyd Racing</a>, where the engine failed after 228 laps. He also competed in one race in the <a href="British%20Touring%20Car%20Championship">British Touring Car Championship</a> at <a href="Donington%20Park">Donington Park</a>, driving a <a href="Ford%20Sierra">Ford Sierra RS500</a>. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and <a href="Perry%20McCarthy">Perry McCarthy</a>. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a <a href="Lola%20Cars">Lola</a> chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.

Hill started his Grand Prix career during the <a href="1991%20Formula%20One%20season">1991 season</a> as a test driver with the championship-winning <a href="WilliamsF1">Williams</a> team while still competing in the F3000 series. However, midway through <a href="1992%20Formula%20One%20season">1992</a> Hill broke into Grand Prix racing as a driver with the dying <a href="Brabham">Brabham</a> team. The formerly competitive team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill started the season only after three races, replacing <a href="Giovanna%20Amati">Giovanna Amati</a> after her sponsorship had failed to materialise. Amati had been unable to get the car through qualifying but Hill matched his teammate, <a href="Eric%20van%20de%20Poele">Eric van de Poele</a>, by qualifying for two races, the mid-season <a href="1992%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British</a> and <a href="1992%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">Hungarian</a> Grands Prix. Hill continued to test for the Williams team that year and the British Grand Prix saw <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a> win the race for Williams, while he finished last in the Brabham. The Brabham team collapsed after the Hungarian Grand Prix and did not complete the season.

When Mansell's teammate <a href="Riccardo%20Patrese">Riccardo Patrese</a> left Williams to drive for <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> in <a href="1993%20Formula%20One%20season">1993</a>, Hill was unexpectedly promoted to the race team alongside triple world champion <a href="Alain%20Prost">Alain Prost</a> ahead of more experienced candidates such as <a href="Martin%20Brundle">Martin Brundle</a> and <a href="Mika%20H%C3%A4kkinen">Mika Häkkinen</a>. Traditionally, the reigning driver's world champion carries the number "1" on his car and his teammate takes the number "2". Because Mansell, the 1992 champion, was not racing in Formula One in 1993, his Williams team were given numbers "0" and "2". As the junior partner to Prost, Hill took "0", the second man in Formula One history to do so, after <a href="Jody%20Scheckter">Jody Scheckter</a> in <a href="1973%20Formula%20One%20season">1973</a>.

The season did not start well when Hill spun out of second place shortly after the start of the <a href="1993%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South African</a> Grand Prix and failed to finish the race after colliding with <a href="Alex%20Zanardi">Alex Zanardi</a> on lap 16. At the <a href="1993%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazilian</a> Grand Prix, Hill qualified and spent the early stages of the race running second behind Prost, and then took the lead when Prost crashed out, but was relegated back to second by another triple world champion, <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a>. Nevertheless, the race still gave Hill his first podium finish.

In the next round in <a href="1993%20European%20Grand%20Prix">Europe</a>, Hill again finished second behind Senna and ahead of a lapped Prost. In his first full season, Hill benefited from the experience of his veteran French teammate. He continued to impress as the season went on, and in <a href="1993%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">San Marino</a> Hill took the lead at the start, though he was passed by Prost and Senna and ultimately retired with brake failure. More bad luck struck him in <a href="1993%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spain</a> where he kept pace with Prost for most of the race only for his engine to fail.

After strong podiums in Monaco and Canada, Hill took his first career pole in <a href="1993%20French%20Grand%20Prix">France</a>, finishing second to Prost after team orders prevented him from seriously challenging for the win. He looked set to win his home race in <a href="1993%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Britain</a> before another engine failure put him out and led the <a href="1993%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> comfortably only to suffer a puncture with two laps left, handing the win to Prost.

At the <a href="1993%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">Hungarian</a> race, Hill did take his first career win after leading from start to finish. In doing so he became the first son of a Formula One Grand Prix winner to take victory himself, and he followed it with two more wins, first at <a href="1993%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Spa</a> where he took the lead after pitstop problem for Prost, and then at the <a href="1993%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> where Prost's engine failed towards the end. This third consecutive win clinched the Constructors' Championship for Williams and moved him temporarily to second in the Drivers' standings.

At the <a href="1993%20Portuguese%20Grand%20Prix">Portuguese Grand Prix</a> Hill charged from the back of the grid to third, having stalled on the warm up lap from pole. He finished off the season finishing fourth in <a href="1993%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japan</a> and third in <a href="1993%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australia</a>, but it was not enough to hold 2nd place in the championship as Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last two races. Prost finished the season as champion. Hill ended the season in Australia by setting the lap record for the <a href="Adelaide%20Street%20Circuit">Adelaide Street Circuit</a>. the full Grand Prix track has not been used since 2000, and Hill's lap record of 1:15.381 for the 3.780 km (2.349 mi) long track still stands.

In <a href="1994%20Formula%20One%20season">1994</a>, <a href="Ayrton%20Senna">Ayrton Senna</a> joined Hill at Williams. As the reigning champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill retained his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, but the <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> team and <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the <a href="1994%20San%20Marino%20Grand%20Prix">San Marino Grand Prix</a> on 1 May, <a href="Death%20of%20Ayrton%20Senna">Senna died</a> after his car crashed into a concrete barrier while he was leading. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported at the time that the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.
Hill represented Williams alone at the next race, the <a href="1994%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. His race ended early in a collision involving several cars on the opening lap of the race. For the following race, the <a href="1994%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spanish Grand Prix</a>, Williams's test driver <a href="David%20Coulthard">David Coulthard</a> was promoted to the race team alongside Hill, who won the race just four weeks after Senna's death. Twenty-six years earlier Graham Hill had won in Spain under similar circumstances for <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a> after the death of his teammate <a href="Jim%20Clark">Jim Clark</a>. Championship leader Schumacher finished second with a gearbox fault restricting him to fifth gear, having led the early laps.

Schumacher led by 66 points to 29 by the midpoint of the season. At the <a href="1994%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>, <a href="Frank%20Williams%20%28Formula%20One%29">Frank Williams</a> brought back <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a>, for the French, European, Japanese and Australian Grands Prix with Coulthard doing the majority of the 1994 season. Mansell earned approximately £900,000 for each of his four races, while Hill was paid £300,000 for the entire season, though Hill's position as lead driver remained unquestioned. Hill came back into contention for the title after winning the <a href="1994%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a>, a race his father had never won. Schumacher was disqualified from that race and banned for two further races for overtaking Hill during the formation lap and ignoring the subsequent black flag. Four more victories for Hill, three of which were in races where Schumacher was excluded or disqualified, took the title battle to the final event at Adelaide. At Schumacher's first race since his ban, the <a href="1994%20European%20Grand%20Prix">European Grand Prix</a>, he suggested that Hill (who was eight years his senior) was not a world-class driver. However, during the penultimate race at the <a href="1994%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a>, Hill took victory ahead of Schumacher in a rain-soaked event. This put Hill just one point behind the German before the last race of the season.

Neither Hill nor Schumacher finished the season-closing <a href="1994%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a>, after a controversial collision which gave the title to Schumacher. Schumacher ran off the track hitting the wall with the right-hand side of his Benetton while leading. Coming into the sixth corner Hill moved to pass the Benetton and the two collided, breaking the Williams's front left <a href="Double%20wishbone%20suspension">suspension wishbone</a>, and forcing both drivers' retirement from the race. BBC Formula One commentator <a href="Murray%20Walker">Murray Walker</a>, has often maintained that Schumacher did not cause the crash intentionally, but WilliamsF1 co-owner <a href="Patrick%20Head">Patrick Head</a> felt differently. In 2006 he said that at the time of the incident "Williams were already 100% certain that Michael was guilty of foul play" but did not protest Schumacher's title because the team was still dealing with the death of Ayrton Senna. In 2007, Hill explicitly accused Schumacher of causing the collision deliberately.

Hill's season earned him the 1994 <a href="BBC%20Sports%20Personality%20of%20the%20Year">BBC Sports Personality of the Year</a>.

Coming into the <a href="1995%20Formula%20One%20season">1995 season</a>, Hill was one of the title favourites. The Williams team were reigning Constructors' Champions, having beaten Benetton in 1994, and with young David Coulthard, who was embarking on his first full season in Formula One, as teammate, Hill was the clear number one driver. The year seemed to start well with pole position in Brazil, although a spin while in the lead due to a mechanical problem handed the lead to Schumacher. But wins in the next two races put him in the championship lead. However, Schumacher won seven of the next twelve races, and took his second title with two races to spare, while Benetton took the Constructors' Championship. Schumacher and Hill had several on-track incidents during the season, two of which led to suspended one-race bans for both. Schumacher's penalty was for blocking and forcing Hill off the road at the <a href="Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a>; Hill's was for colliding with Schumacher under braking at the <a href="1995%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a>. Hill's season finished positively when he won the <a href="1995%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> by finishing two laps ahead of the runner-up, <a href="Olivier%20Panis">Olivier Panis</a> in a <a href="Equipe%20Ligier">Ligier</a>.

In <a href="1996%20Formula%20One%20season">1996</a> the Williams car was clearly the quickest in Formula One and Hill went on to win the title ahead of his teammate, reigning Indycar champion <a href="Jacques%20Villeneuve">Jacques Villeneuve</a>, becoming the first son of a Formula One champion to win the championship himself. Taking eight wins and never qualifying off the front row, Hill enjoyed by far his most successful season. At Monaco, where his father had won five times in the 1960s, he led until his engine failed, curtailing his race and allowing Olivier Panis to take his only Formula One win. Near the end of the season, Villeneuve began to mount a title challenge and took pole in the <a href="1996%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a>, the final race of the year. However, Hill took the lead at the start and won both the race and the championship while the Canadian retired.

Hill equalled the record for starting all 16 races of the season from the front row, matching Ayrton Senna in and Alain Prost in .

Despite winning the title, Hill learned before the season's close that he was to be dropped by Williams in favour of Frentzen for the following season. Hill left Williams as the team's second most successful driver in terms of race victories, with 21, second only to Mansell. Hill's 1996 world championship earned him his second BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, making him one of only three people to receive the award twice – the others being boxer <a href="Henry%20Cooper%20%28boxer%29">Henry Cooper</a> and Mansell. Hill was also awarded the <a href="Segrave%20Trophy">Segrave Trophy</a> by the <a href="Royal%20Automobile%20Club">Royal Automobile Club</a>. The trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.

Hill became the fourth driver in nine years to win the World Drivers' Championship for Williams and not drive for the team the following season, as occurred with <a href="Nelson%20Piquet">Nelson Piquet</a> ( champion – driver for <a href="Team%20Lotus">Lotus</a>), <a href="Nigel%20Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a> ( champion – 1993 driver in the US-based <a href="Champ%20Car">Indy Car World Series</a> instead of F1) and <a href="Alain%20Prost">Alain Prost</a> (<a href="F1%201993">1993</a> champion – retired in 1994). As world champion, Hill was in high demand and had offers for a race seat from <a href="McLaren%20%28racing%29">McLaren</a>, <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> and <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> but not adequately financially valued despite his status. As a consequence, he opted to sign for <a href="Arrows%20Grand%20Prix%20International">Arrows</a>, a team which had never won a race in its 20-year history and had scored only a single point the previous year. Hill's title defence in <a href="1997%20Formula%20One%20season">1997</a> proved unsuccessful, getting off to a poor start when he only narrowly qualified for the <a href="1997%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grand Prix</a> and then retired on the parade lap. The Arrows car, which used tyres from series debutant <a href="Bridgestone">Bridgestone</a> and previously unproven Yamaha engines, was generally uncompetitive, and Hill did not score his first point for the team until the <a href="1997%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Silverstone%20Circuit">Silverstone</a> in July. His best result for the year then came at the <a href="1997%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">Hungarian Grand Prix</a>. On a day when the Bridgestone tyres had a competitive edge over their <a href="Goodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Goodyear</a> rivals, Hill qualified third in a car that had not previously placed higher than 9th on the grid. During the race, he passed his rival and new championship contender, Michael Schumacher, on the track and was leading late in the race, 35 seconds ahead of the eventual 1997 World Champion, Villeneuve, until a hydraulic problem drastically slowed the Arrows. Villeneuve thus passed Hill, who finished second and achieved the team's first podium since the <a href="1995%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1995 Australian Grand Prix</a>. This new podium ultimately turned out to be Arrows' last ever podium finish.

Only after one year with Arrows, Hill came close to signing a deal with <a href="Alain%20Prost">Alain Prost</a>'s team, before deciding to instead signup with the <a href="Jordan%20Grand%20Prix">Jordan team</a> for the <a href="1998%20Formula%20One%20season">1998 season</a>. His new teammate was <a href="Ralf%20Schumacher">Ralf Schumacher</a>, younger brother of Michael. In the first half of the season, the <a href="Jordan%20198">Jordan 198</a> car was off the pace and unreliable until improvements in performance from the <a href="1998%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a>. During that race, Hill moved up to second place as others retired or pitted for fuel. On lap 38, Michael Schumacher, who was delayed by a stop-and-go penalty after forcing Frentzen's Williams off the track, caught Hill on the home straight; Hill moved across the track three times to block Schumacher, who took the place by running over the kerbs at the last chicane. Hill then ran fourth after his only pit stop before retiring due to an electrical failure. After the race, Schumacher accused Hill of dangerous driving. Hill responded by stating that Schumacher "cannot claim anyone drives badly when you look at the things he's been up to in his career. He took Frentzen out completely." At the <a href="1998%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a>, Hill scored his first point of the year and at the <a href="1998%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a>, in very wet conditions, he took the Jordan team's first ever win. At that race, Hill was leading late in the race, with teammate Schumacher closing rapidly, when he asked the team whether they would be allowed to race each other. Team principal Eddie Jordan ordered Ralf Schumacher to hold position instead of risking losing a 1–2 finish. In all, only eight drivers finished the race. The victory was his first since being dropped by the Williams team, which won no races that season. Hill finished the year with a last lap move on Frentzen at the <a href="1998%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a>, which earned him fourth place in the race and Jordan fourth position in that year's Constructors' Championship.

Hopes were high for <a href="1999%20Formula%20One%20season">1999</a>, but Hill did not enjoy a good season. Struggling with the newly introduced four-grooved tyres, he was outpaced by his new teammate, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was Hill's replacement at Williams two years prior. After a crash at the <a href="1999%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canadian Grand Prix</a>, Hill announced plans to retire from the sport at the end of the year, but after failing to finish the <a href="1999%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a> that Frentzen won, he considered quitting the sport immediately.

Jordan persuaded Hill to at least stay for the <a href="1999%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a>. Going into that race weekend, Hill announced he would retire after the Grand Prix, leading Jordan to test <a href="Jos%20Verstappen">Jos Verstappen</a> in case Hill had to be quickly replaced. Following a strong fifth place at his home event, however, Hill changed his mind and decided to see out the year. His best result for the remainder of the season was sixth place, which he achieved in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 to go, there were rumours that the <a href="Prost%20Grand%20Prix">Prost Grand Prix</a> team would release <a href="Jarno%20Trulli">Jarno Trulli</a> early after he signed for Jordan's <a href="2000%20Formula%20One%20season">2000</a> campaign as Hill's replacement. At the same time, his teammate, Frentzen, became a title contender going into the final few races of the season and, eventually, finished third in the championship. In so doing, both Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to achieve its best-ever finish with a third position in the Constructors' Championship. Hill's last race was the <a href="1999%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese Grand Prix</a> where he spun off the track and pulled into the pits citing mental fatigue.

In retirement Hill has continued to be involved with cars and motorsport. He founded the Prestige and Super Car Private Members Club P1 International with Michael Breen in 2000; Breen bought Hill out in October 2006. Hill also became involved in a <a href="BMW">BMW</a> dealership, just outside Royal Leamington Spa, that bore his name and an Audi dealership in Exeter. In April 2006, Hill succeeded <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a> as President of the <a href="British%20Racing%20Drivers%27%20Club">British Racing Drivers' Club</a> (BRDC).

In 2009 he received an <a href="Honorary%20title%20%28academic%29">Honorary Fellowship</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Northampton">University of Northampton</a> recognising his successful career and his connection with Northampton through Silverstone and the BRDC.

Hill also made a UK television advert with F1 commentator Murray Walker for <a href="Pizza%20Hut">Pizza Hut</a>, in which Walker commentated on Hill's meal as if it were a race. Hill has also appeared on many British television programmes, including "<a href="Top%20Gear%20%28current%20format%29">Top Gear</a>", "<a href="This%20Is%20Your%20Life%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">This is Your Life</a>", "<a href="TFI%20Friday">TFI Friday</a>", "<a href="Shooting%20Stars%20%28TV%20series%29">Shooting Stars</a>" and "<a href="Bang%20Bang%2C%20It%27s%20Reeves%20and%20Mortimer">Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer</a>".

Hill has raced both cars and motorcycles at the <a href="Goodwood%20Festival%20of%20Speed">Goodwood Festival of Speed</a> and in 2005 he tested the new <a href="GP2%20Series">GP2 Series</a> car. Hill was back behind the wheel of a single-seater race car in the summer of 2006, when he took a <a href="Grand%20Prix%20Masters">Grand Prix Masters</a> machine for a test run around the Silverstone circuit. Hill said that he enjoyed the experience and "I wouldn't rule [a return to racing] out, but I can't honestly say that right now I need to race. That is the bit that is missing. I love driving, I love pushing the limit and all the rest of it but racing for me ... I don't have an ambition to do it and I think that's an important part of the equation."

Hill served as the driver representative on the stewards panel at the <a href="2010%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">2010 Monaco Grand Prix</a> where he and the rest of the panel decided to relegate former rival Michael Schumacher for overtaking under yellow flag conditions. The decision led to Hill receiving hate mail.

Between 18 and 19 May 2012, Hill along with <a href="Mark%20Blundell">Mark Blundell</a>, <a href="Perry%20McCarthy">Perry McCarthy</a>, <a href="Martin%20Donnelly%20%28racing%20driver%29">Martin Donnelly</a> and <a href="Julian%20Bailey">Julian Bailey</a> participated in the first round of the VW Scirocco R-Cup at Brands Hatch to raise funds for the Halow Charity. Hill only managed to complete seven laps of the circuit.

On 7 October 2012, Hill drove his father <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a>'s <a href="BRM">BRM</a> in celebration of winning the 1962 F1 World Championship, where Graham became the first <a href="Formula%20One%20drivers%20from%20Great%20Britain">British driver</a> to win the Drivers' World Championship with a British team.

In June 2018, Hill became the President of the <a href="Brooklands%20Trust%20Members">Brooklands Trust Members</a> who are the support group for <a href="Brooklands%20Museum">Brooklands Museum</a>.

Hill has also regularly appeared in the British media. In June 1975 he appeared alongside his father, <a href="Graham%20Hill">Graham Hill</a>, on the popular television programme "<a href="Jim%27ll%20Fix%20It">Jim'll Fix It</a>". He again appeared on the programme in January 1995, marking the twentieth anniversary of the show. He has contributed many articles to "<a href="F1%20Racing">F1 Racing</a>" magazine and has twice appeared in <a href="ITV%20F1">ITV F1</a>'s commentary box, covering for Martin Brundle at the <a href="2007%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">2007</a> and <a href="2008%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">2008 Hungarian Grands Prix</a>. 
In January 2012, <a href="British%20Sky%20Broadcasting">British Sky Broadcasting</a> announced that they had signed Hill to join their F1 presentation team on <a href="Sky%20Sports%20F1">Sky Sports F1</a> as a pundit for the 2012 Formula One season.

Hill was interested in music from an early age and formed the <a href="punk%20rock">punk</a> band "Sex Hitler and the Hormones" with some friends while at school. After achieving success in Formula One, he was able to play guitar with several famous musicians, including his friend <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>, and appeared on "Demolition Man", the opening track of <a href="Def%20Leppard">Def Leppard</a>'s album "<a href="Euphoria%20%28Def%20Leppard%20album%29">Euphoria</a>". Hill also made a regular appearance at the British Grand Prix alongside other Formula One musicians such as Eddie Jordan. After his retirement at the end of the 1999 season, Hill devoted more time to music and played with celebrity bands including <a href="Spike%20Edney">Spike Edney</a>'s SAS band, and <a href="Pat%20Cash">Pat Cash</a>'s Wild Colonial Boys. Hill also formed his own band, The Conrods, which was active between 1999 and 2003 and played cover versions of well-known songs from <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="The%20Kinks">The Kinks</a>. Since becoming president of the BRDC in 2006, Hill says he has abandoned the guitar, being "too busy doing school runs and looking after pets."

 Did not finish, but was classified as he had completed more than 90% of the race distance.

Wilco

Wilco is an American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band based in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> group <a href="Uncle%20Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a> following singer <a href="Jay%20Farrar">Jay Farrar</a>'s departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a> and bassist <a href="John%20Stirratt">John Stirratt</a> remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist <a href="Nels%20Cline">Nels Cline</a>, multi-instrumentalist <a href="Pat%20Sansone">Pat Sansone</a>, keyboard player <a href="Mikael%20Jorgensen">Mikael Jorgensen</a>, and drummer <a href="Glenn%20Kotche">Glenn Kotche</a>. Wilco has released ten studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with <a href="Billy%20Bragg">Billy Bragg</a> and one with <a href="The%20Minus%205">The Minus 5</a>.

Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including <a href="Bill%20Fay">Bill Fay</a>, <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a>, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album "<a href="A.M.%20%28Wilco%20album%29">A.M.</a>" (1995), but has since introduced more <a href="experimental%20music">experimental</a> aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current "eclectic <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> collective that touches on many eras and genres."

Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, "<a href="Yankee%20Hotel%20Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a>" (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a> rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming "Foxtrot" on its website, Wilco sold the album to <a href="Nonesuch%20Records">Nonesuch Records</a> in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of <a href="Warner%20Music%20Group">Warner Music Group</a>, leading one critic to say the album showed "how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century." "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s for their fifth studio album, 2004's "<a href="A%20Ghost%20Is%20Born">A Ghost Is Born</a>", including <a href="Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a>. Wilco released their ninth studio album, "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28Wilco%20album%29">Star Wars</a>", in July 2015, and in September 2016 released their tenth studio album, "<a href="Schmilco">Schmilco</a>".

Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group <a href="Uncle%20Tupelo">Uncle Tupelo</a>. Singer <a href="Jay%20Farrar">Jay Farrar</a> quit the band in 1994 because of a soured relationship with co-singer <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a>. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including <a href="bassist">bassist</a> John Stirratt, <a href="drummer">drummer</a> <a href="Ken%20Coomer">Ken Coomer</a>, and multi-instrumentalist <a href="Max%20Johnston">Max Johnston</a>. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist <a href="Brian%20Henneman">Brian Henneman</a> of <a href="the%20Bottle%20Rockets">the Bottle Rockets</a>, who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, "<a href="A.M.%20%28Wilco%20album%29">A.M.</a>". The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself "Wilco" after the <a href="Military%20and%20commercial%20aviation%20radio%20voice%20acronym">military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation</a> for "will comply", a choice which Tweedy has called "fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves."

After collaborating with <a href="Syd%20Straw">Syd Straw</a> on a cover version of the <a href="Ernest%20Tubb">Ernest Tubb</a> song "The T.B. is Whipping Me" (released in September 1994 on the "<a href="Red%20Hot%20%2B%20Country">Red Hot + Country</a>" compilation produced by the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Organization">Red Hot Organization</a>), Wilco began <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20081220011754/http%3A//www.undertowmusic.com/messageboards/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D20%26amp%3Bt%3D3926%26amp%3Bp%3D26462%23p26462">recording tracks</a> for "<a href="A.M.%20%28Wilco%20album%29">A.M.</a>", their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission—John Stirratt's "It's Just That Simple"—appeared on "A.M.". It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.

Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on "A.M." was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as "trying to tread some water with a perceived audience." "A.M." peaked at number twenty-seven on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Top%20Heatseekers">Heatseekers</a> chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, <a href="Son%20Volt">Son Volt</a>. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>"'s 1995 <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived "A.M." to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, <a href="multi-instrumentalist">multi-instrumentalist</a> <a href="Jay%20Bennett">Jay Bennett</a> joined the band, providing the band with a <a href="Keyboard%20instrument">keyboardist</a> and another guitarist.

Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> (the band was billed for the occasion as "<a href="Black%20Shampoo">Black Shampoo</a>").

During the two hundred-date tour supporting "A.M.", Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:

The whole "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28periodical%29">No Depression</a>" thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on "Misunderstood," where I'm playing guitar.

A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including "Sunken Treasure" and "Hotel Arizona", however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of "A.M." Wilco named the album "<a href="Being%20There%20%28Wilco%20album%29">Being There</a>" after a <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a> <a href="Being%20There">film of the same name</a>. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of <a href="Freakwater">Freakwater</a> briefly joined the band in the studio, playing <a href="pedal%20steel%20guitar">pedal steel guitar</a> on "Far, Far Away" and "Dreamer in My Dreams", and then became an official member in September 1996.

Unlike the "A.M." recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a <a href="double%20album">double album</a> would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied. "Being There" was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>". The album reached No. 73 on the "Billboard" album charts, a significant improvement from "A.M.", and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996. The album's single "Outtasite (Outta Mind)" became the group's first song to enter the "Billboard" charts, reaching No. 39 on the <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart and No. 22 on the <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20%28chart%29">Mainstream Rock Tracks</a> chart.

In November 1997, Wilco entered <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>'s recording studio in <a href="Spicewood">Spicewood</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century <a href="literature">literature</a>. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's "bold, but depressing" lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including "Via Chicago" and "She's a Jar", but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.

<a href="Nora%20Guthrie">Nora Guthrie</a> contacted singer-songwriter <a href="Billy%20Bragg">Billy Bragg</a> in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of <a href="Huntington%27s%20disease">Huntington's disease</a>. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a "relic" to the <a href="MTV%20generation">MTV generation</a>, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was "the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody." Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.

Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their "Being There" tour. Bragg was particularly fond of "Being There" because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols—Bennett's previous band <a href="Titanic%20Love%20Affair">Titanic Love Affair</a> was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush%20Empire">Shepherd's Bush Empire</a>. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a "freak weirdo". The recording of "<a href="Mermaid%20Avenue">Mermaid Avenue</a>" began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Man%20in%20the%20Sand">Man in the Sand</a>" documentary film.

Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded "you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker." Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.

Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and "Rolling Stone", and was nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Contemporary%20Folk%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album</a>. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist <a href="Leroy%20Bach">Leroy Bach</a>.

After the completion of the "Mermaid Avenue" sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, "<a href="Summerteeth">Summerteeth</a>". Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a>. Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:

The story of "Summerteeth" is Jay bought a <a href="Mellotron">Mellotron</a> and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness ... It reminds me of "<a href="Heart%20of%20Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a>", where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.

During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with <a href="Time%20Inc.">Time Inc.</a>. As a result, Warner's <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a>s were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, <a href="Howie%20Klein">Howie Klein</a>, who had previously authorized the release of "Being There" as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce "Summerteeth" without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this "once and once only" and recorded a radio-friendly version of "Can't Stand It" at the request of <a href="David%20Kahne">David Kahne</a>, the head of the A&R department. The single version of "Can't Stand It" failed to cross over from <a href="Adult%20album%20alternative">Triple-A</a> radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than "Being There". This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999.

After the release of "<a href="Summerteeth">Summerteeth</a>", the band resumed the "Mermaid Avenue" sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for "<a href="Mermaid%20Avenue%20Vol.%20II">Mermaid Avenue Vol. II</a>". "Someday Some Morning Sometime," featuring a <a href="vibraphone">vibraphone</a> filtered through a <a href="space%20echo">space echo</a>, was identified by Tweedy as being the "piece to the puzzle" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions. The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as "<a href="Mermaid%20Avenue%20Vol.%20III">Mermaid Avenue Vol. III</a>", also part of "".

Shortly after the recording sessions for "Mermaid Avenue Vol. II", Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with <a href="Jim%20O%27Rourke%20%28musician%29">Jim O'Rourke</a> at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's "<a href="Bad%20Timing%20%28album%29">Bad Timing</a>". O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer <a href="Glenn%20Kotche">Glenn Kotche</a>, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named <a href="Loose%20Fur">Loose Fur</a>. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.

Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for "<a href="Yankee%20Hotel%20Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a>", Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart", and the results impressed the other band members—even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as "Poor Places", only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by <a href="Sam%20Jones%20%28filmmaker%29">Sam Jones</a> and released in 2002 as the film "".

Time Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with <a href="America%20Online">America Online</a> in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the <a href="album">album</a> was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.

Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. <a href="Music%20journalist">Music journalist</a> Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot". The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco "bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/<a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a> for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether" after Wilco was "[u]nwilling to change the album to make it more 'commercially viable'" To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as <a href="The%20Flaming%20Lips">The Flaming Lips</a>. Lead singer <a href="Wayne%20Coyne">Wayne Coyne</a> once remarked:

We are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, "we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again." They'd tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!

As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality <a href="MP3">MP3</a>s. The band signed with <a href="Nonesuch%20Records">Nonesuch Records</a>, another <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, "<a href="Yankee%20Hotel%20Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a>" reached number thirteen on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, Wilco's highest chart position to that date. "<a href="Yankee%20Hotel%20Foxtrot">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a>" sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco's best selling album. "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002's Pazz & Jop critics' poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by "<a href="Q%20Magazine">Q Magazine</a>".

Rolling Stone rated it at 493 of their 500 Greatest Albums of all Time, in May 2012.

While waiting for the commercial release of "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot", Wilco agreed to support <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> collaborator <a href="Scott%20McCaughey">Scott McCaughey</a> for an album release by <a href="The%20Minus%205">The Minus 5</a>. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the <a href="9/11">9/11</a> terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to "create something good in the world right now" and record some material. Influenced by <a href="Bill%20Fay">Bill Fay</a>'s "<a href="Time%20of%20the%20Last%20Persecution">Time of the Last Persecution</a>", The Minus 5's "<a href="Down%20with%20Wilco">Down with Wilco</a>" was released in 2003. Keyboardist <a href="Mikael%20Jorgensen">Mikael Jorgensen</a>, who had engineered "Down with Wilco", joined Wilco in 2002 as they toured in support of "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot".

In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed "Foxtrot" and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. Unlike "Summerteeth" and "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot", "<a href="A%20Ghost%20Is%20Born">A Ghost Is Born</a>" featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song "Less Than You Think", which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called "the track that everyone will hate". Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song:

Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album's completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot", Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in <a href="MPEG-4">MPEG-4</a> form on <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a>'s website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach's departure, and added <a href="Pat%20Sansone">Pat Sansone</a> of <a href="The%20Autumn%20Defense">The Autumn Defense</a>, and <a href="avant-garde%20music">avant-garde</a> guitarist <a href="Nels%20Cline">Nels Cline</a> to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself into a <a href="Drug%20rehabilitation">rehabilitation</a> clinic in Chicago for an addiction to <a href="opioid">opioid</a>s. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks. "A Ghost Is Born" was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco's first top ten album in the U.S. The album earned Wilco <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> for <a href="Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a> and <a href="Best%20Recording%20Package">Best Recording Package</a> in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.

In 2004, the band released "<a href="The%20Wilco%20Book">The Wilco Book</a>", a picture book detailing the creation of "A Ghost Is Born". The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the "A Ghost Is Born" recording sessions. Also that year, "Chicago Tribune" music critic <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> released a biography of the band entitled "". The new six-piece Wilco lineup debuted on "", a two disc live album recorded at <a href="The%20Vic%20Theater">The Vic Theater</a> in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", "Billboard", and "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>". As of 2007, it has sold over 114,000 copies.

Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by <a href="The%20Byrds">The Byrds</a> and <a href="Fairport%20Convention">Fairport Convention</a>, the band considered "<a href="Sky%20Blue%20Sky">Sky Blue Sky</a>" to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations.

Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song "What Light" as a free MP3 download. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the "Sky Blue Sky" recording sessions for use in a <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a> and <a href="movistar">Telefónica Móviles (Movistar)</a>. The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U.S. album charts. It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries.

Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco "shine[s] on a handful of the songs" on "Sky Blue Sky", such as the "light, and straightforward" songs. While he calls the album "great traditional rock and folk album at times", he states that "once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances ... the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced." The "allaboutjazz" review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as "deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to" and noting its "impeccable sound quality," the reviewer claimed that ""Sky Blue Sky" becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good."

Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for "Lost at Sea" praised the album's "breezy atmosphere and pacing," and noted that it is not "easily judged upon first listen." Overall, Hernandez stated that it "may be no masterpiece, but at worst it's a more than worthy entry into Wilco's laudable catalogue."
Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as "one of the best albums of the year," calling it a "timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class" and "a lean, mean, soulful album." Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording "isn't groundbreaking," they praised its "coherent musical expression" and emphasis on "solid songcraft without pretense" which created a "satisfying and melodically sound album."

In anticipation of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008 US presidential election</a>, Wilco released a downloadable version of <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="I%20Shall%20Be%20Released">I Shall Be Released</a>" that they performed with <a href="Fleet%20Foxes">Fleet Foxes</a>. The MP3 was available as a free download from the band's website in exchange for a promise to vote in the election. The band also made an appearance on "<a href="The%20Colbert%20Report">The Colbert Report</a>" to support presidential candidate <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. Wilco released a live performance DVD, "<a href="Ashes%20of%20American%20Flags">Ashes of American Flags</a>", on April 18, 2009, to celebrate <a href="Record%20Store%20Day">Record Store Day</a>.

In December 2008, Jeff Tweedy, Pat Sansone, Glenn Kotche and John Stirratt traveled to Auckland, New Zealand to participate in <a href="Neil%20Finn">Neil Finn</a>'s <a href="7%20Worlds%20Collide">7 Worlds Collide</a> sequel project, <a href="The%20Sun%20Came%20Out">The Sun Came Out</a>, joined by <a href="Ed%20O%27Brien">Ed O'Brien</a>, <a href="Phil%20Selway">Phil Selway</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Marr">Johnny Marr</a>, <a href="KT%20Tunstall">KT Tunstall</a>, <a href="Liam%20Finn">Liam Finn</a>, and <a href="Lisa%20Germano">Lisa Germano</a>. They wrote and recorded several new tracks for the <a href="Oxfam">Oxfam</a>-benefiting album including "You Never Know", "What Could Have Been", "Over and Done" and "Don't Forget Me". Jeff Tweedy co-wrote "Too Blue" with Johnny Marr, and Glenn, John and Pat play on most tracks on the album.

Having enjoyed their time in New Zealand and the vibe of Finn's own <a href="Roundhead%20Studios">Roundhead Studios</a>, the four members stayed in Auckland through January to record the foundation tracks for their next album. Jim Scott, who acted as engineer and mixer for the Neil Finn project, stayed on in the same capacity for the Wilco sessions. Nels Cline and Mikael Jorgensen would later add overdubs to these tracks at the band's Chicago Loft.

Wilco released their seventh album, "<a href="Wilco%20%28The%20Album%29">Wilco (The Album)</a>", on June 30, 2009. In March 2009, it was announced that singer-songwriter <a href="Feist%20%28singer%29">Feist</a> would make a guest appearance on the new album, on the track "You and I". Like their previous three albums, Wilco streamed the entirety of the album on its website prior to release. The album hit the charts at a career-high No. 4 with sales of 99,000 on the Billboard Top 200 Album chart as well as the No. 2 spot on Billboard's Top Rock Albums chart. It marked Wilco's third top 10 album on the U.S. pop chart. The album's first single "You Never Know" reached the No. 1 spot on the AAA Chart, their first No. 1 in twelve years.

Beginning in April 2009, the band freely distributed a cover of Woody Guthrie's "<a href="Library%20of%20Congress%20Recordings">The Jolly Banker</a>", downloadable from their website. It was recorded at the Wilco loft in February of that year, at the suggestion of Guthrie's daughter, <a href="Nora%20Guthrie">Nora</a>. Downloaders were encouraged to donate to the <a href="Woody%20Guthrie%20Foundation">Woody Guthrie Foundation</a>. Feist returned to accompany on the track, playing the <a href="Garden%20Weasel">Garden Weasel</a>. The track eventually became unavailable for download. In October 2011, the website began streaming the track via a <a href="Plug-in%20%28computing%29">plugin</a>.

On May 25, 2009, former band member <a href="Jay%20Bennett">Jay Bennett</a> died in his home in <a href="Urbana%2C%20Illinois">Urbana, Illinois</a>. In a prepared statement, Jeff Tweedy remarked that he was "deeply saddened" by Bennett's death.

Feist and Wilco performed "You and I" on "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>" on July 14, 2009. In June during their West Coast tour, Wilco joined <a href="Beck">Beck</a>, Feist, <a href="Jamie%20Lidell">Jamie Lidell</a> and <a href="James%20Gadson">James Gadson</a> in the studio to take part in Beck's <a href="Record%20Club">Record Club</a> project, covering <a href="Skip%20Spence">Skip Spence</a>'s "<a href="Oar%20%28Skip%20Spence%20album%29">Oar</a>" album. The first song "Little Hands" was posted on Beck's website on November 12, 2009.

On April 6, 2010, Wilco announced during their Boston performance that they would be headlining and curating a festival in <a href="North%20Adams%2C%20MA">North Adams</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, dubbed Solid Sound Festival. The event ran at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art">Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art</a> from August 13–15, and featured various Wilco side projects, including The Autumn Defense, Pronto, <a href="The%20Nels%20Cline%20Singers">The Nels Cline Singers</a>, and Jeff Tweedy solo.

Wilco's contract with Nonesuch ended in 2010 and they formed their own label. Wilco announced via their web site and Twitter page on January 27, 2011 that the new label will be called <a href="Dbpm%20records">dBpm Records</a> (Decibels per Minute) and will be run out of the offices of their manager, Tony Margherita, in <a href="Easthampton%2C%20Massachusetts">Easthampton, Massachusetts</a>.

Wilco's eighth studio album, "<a href="The%20Whole%20Love">The Whole Love</a>", was released on September 27, 2011. The first single of the album is titled "Art of Almost". The B-Side to "I Might" is a cover of Nick Lowe's 1977 song "<a href="A%20Bunch%20of%20Stiff%20Records">I Love My Label</a>". The single was shown at the Wilco's 2011 Solid Sound Festival at <a href="MassMoca">MassMoca</a> and was met by positive reviews. The entire album was streamed live on Wilco's official website for 24 hours between September 3 and 4, 2011.

Wilco's ninth studio album, "<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28Wilco%20album%29">Star Wars</a>", was released on July 16, 2015, as a surprise free download. In October 2015, Wilco announced that they would embark on a US tour beginning in early 2016 in support of the album. In December 2015, "Star Wars" was nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album</a>.

On July 14, 2016, the band released a new single, titled "Locator", as a free download. Four days later, the band released another new single, titled "If I Ever Was a Child", and announced that their tenth album, "<a href="Schmilco">Schmilco</a>", would be released on September 9. "Schmilco" earned generally favourable reviews, earning a positive score of 79 on Metacritic, while reviewer Josh Modell called the album "Wilco’s most musically simple and emotionally resonant record in a decade."

On Monday, August 14, 2017, Wilco released a single, "All Lives You Say" on their Bandcamp page to benefit the <a href="Southern%20Poverty%20Law%20Center">SPLC</a> in memory of Jeff's father Robert L. Tweedy who passed away on August 4. Upon sharing this news, Tweedy stated, "My dad was named after a Civil War general, and he voted for Barack Obama twice. He used to say 'If you know better, you can do better.' America - we know better, we can do better."

Wilco's music is typically categorized as <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> and <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a>. Despite their career-long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a>. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974. <a href="John%20Cale">John Cale</a>'s "<a href="Paris%201919%20%28album%29">Paris 1919</a>" was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, "It was eye-opening that I wasn't the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they'd been given credit for—that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y'know?"

Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a>, <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian Wilson</a>. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from <a href="Richard%20Lloyd%20%28guitarist%29">Richard Lloyd</a> of <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a>; Tweedy was a fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as <a href="Jason%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Scorchers">Jason & the Scorchers</a> and the <a href="Minutemen%20%28band%29">Minutemen</a>, influencing the recording of Wilco's "A.M.". Tweedy and O'Rourke enjoyed <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a> artists such as <a href="Ornette%20Coleman">Ornette Coleman</a>, <a href="Albert%20Ayler">Albert Ayler</a>, and <a href="Derek%20Bailey%20%28guitarist%29">Derek Bailey</a>; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a> and <a href="John%20Coltrane">John Coltrane</a>. The lyrical structure of Wilco's songs was dictated by classic literature and "<a href="Exquisite%20corpse">cadavre exquis</a>"—an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include <a href="William%20H.%20Gass">William H.

Some critics have dubbed Wilco the "American <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>", due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the "New York Times" argues that Wilco has a "<a href="roots%20rock">roots-rock</a> ...

The Raven

"The Raven" is a <a href="narrative%20poetry">narrative poem</a> by <a href="American%20literature">American writer</a> <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. First published in January 1845, the poem is often noted for its musicality, stylized language, and <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> atmosphere. It tells of a <a href="Talking%20bird">talking</a> <a href="raven">raven</a>'s mysterious visit to a distraught lover, tracing the man's slow fall into madness. The lover, often identified as being a student, is lamenting the loss of his love, Lenore. Sitting on a bust of <a href="Athena%23Pallas%20Athena">Pallas</a>, the raven seems to further distress the protagonist with its constant repetition of the word "Nevermore". The poem makes use of <a href="folklore">folk</a>, mythological, religious, and <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical</a> references.

Poe claimed to have written the poem logically and methodically, intending to create a poem that would appeal to both critical and popular tastes, as he explained in his 1846 follow-up essay, "<a href="The%20Philosophy%20of%20Composition">The Philosophy of Composition</a>". The poem was inspired in part by a talking raven in the novel "<a href="Barnaby%20Rudge">Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty</a>" by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. Poe borrows the complex rhythm and <a href="Meter%20%28poetry%29">meter</a> of <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett's</a> poem "Lady Geraldine's Courtship", and makes use of <a href="internal%20rhyme">internal rhyme</a> as well as <a href="alliteration">alliteration</a> throughout.

"The Raven" was first attributed to Poe in print in the "<a href="New%20York%20Mirror">New York Evening Mirror</a>" on January 29, 1845. Its publication made Poe popular in his lifetime, although it did not bring him much financial success. The poem was soon reprinted, <a href="Parody">parodied</a>, and illustrated. Critical opinion is divided as to the poem's literary status, but it nevertheless remains one of the most famous poems ever written.

"The Raven" follows an unnamed narrator on a dreary night in December who sits reading "forgotten lore" by a dying fire as a way to forget the death of his beloved Lenore. A "tapping at [his] chamber door" reveals nothing, but excites his soul to "burning". The tapping is repeated, slightly louder, and he realizes it is coming from his window. When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber. Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a <a href="bust%20%28sculpture%29">bust</a> of <a href="Athena%23Pallas%20Athena">Pallas</a> above the door.

Amused by the raven's comically serious disposition, the man asks that the bird tell him its name. The raven's only answer is "Nevermore". The narrator is surprised that the raven can talk, though at this point it has said nothing further. The narrator remarks to himself that his "friend" the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as "other friends have flown before" along with his previous hopes. As if answering, the raven responds again with "Nevermore". The narrator reasons that the bird learned the word "Nevermore" from some "unhappy master" and that it is the only word it knows.

Even so, the narrator pulls his chair directly in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks for a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore. The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories. The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a "thing of evil" and a "<a href="prophet">prophet</a>". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical "Nevermore", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the "<a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Plutonian</a> shore"—but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven "still is sitting" on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted "Nevermore".

Poe wrote the poem as a narrative, without intentional <a href="allegory">allegory</a> or <a href="didacticism">didacticism</a>. The main theme of the poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a <a href="The%20Imp%20of%20the%20Perverse">perverse conflict</a> between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word "Nevermore" is the raven's "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the answer will be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually knows what it is saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as "weak and weary," becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of <a href="elegiac">elegiac</a> <a href="paraclausithyron">paraclausithyron</a>, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.

Poe says that the narrator is a young <a href="student">scholar</a>. Though this is not explicitly stated in the poem, it is mentioned in "<a href="The%20Philosophy%20of%20Composition">The Philosophy of Composition</a>". It is also suggested by the narrator reading books of "lore" as well as by the bust of Pallas Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom.

He is reading in the late night hours from "many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore". Similar to the studies suggested in Poe's short story "<a href="Ligeia">Ligeia</a>", this lore may be about the <a href="occult">occult</a> or <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a>. This is also emphasized in the author's choice to set the poem in December, a month which is traditionally associated with the forces of darkness. The use of the raven—the "devil bird"—also suggests this. This devil image is emphasized by the narrator's belief that the raven is "from the Night's Plutonian shore", or a messenger from the afterlife, referring to <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a>, the <a href="Roman%20god">Roman god</a> of the <a href="underworld">underworld</a> (also known as <a href="Dis%20Pater">Dis Pater</a> in <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman mythology</a>). A direct allusion to <a href="Satan">Satan</a> also appears: "Whether <a href="Temptation%20of%20Christ">Tempter</a> sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore..."

Poe chose a raven as the central symbol in the story because he wanted a "non-reasoning" creature capable of speech. He decided on a raven, which he considered "equally capable of speech" as a parrot, because it matched the intended tone of the poem. Poe said the raven is meant to symbolize ""Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance"". He was also inspired by Grip, the raven in "" by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. One scene in particular bears a resemblance to "The Raven": at the end of the fifth chapter of Dickens's novel, Grip makes a noise and someone says, "What was that – him tapping at the door?" The response is, "'Tis someone knocking softly at the shutter."<ref name="Staford Cremains / Ravens"></ref> Dickens's raven could speak many words and had many comic turns, including the popping of a champagne cork, but Poe emphasized the bird's more dramatic qualities. Poe had written a review of "Barnaby Rudge" for "Graham's Magazine" saying, among other things, that the raven should have served a more symbolic, prophetic purpose. The similarity did not go unnoticed: <a href="James%20Russell%20Lowell">James Russell Lowell</a> in his "<a href="A%20Fable%20for%20Critics">A Fable for Critics</a>" wrote the verse, "Here comes Poe with his raven, like "Barnaby Rudge" / Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge." The <a href="Free%20Library%20of%20Philadelphia">Free Library of Philadelphia</a> has on display a taxidermied raven that is reputed to be the very one that Dickens owned and that helped inspire Poe's poem.

Poe may also have been drawing upon various references to ravens in <a href="mythology">mythology</a> and <a href="folklore">folklore</a>. In <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, <a href="Odin">Odin</a> possessed two ravens named <a href="Huginn%20and%20Muninn">Huginn and Muninn</a>, representing thought and memory. According to <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> folklore, <a href="Noah">Noah</a> sends a white raven to check conditions while on the <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">ark</a>. It learns that the floodwaters are beginning to dissipate, but it does not immediately return with the news. It is punished by being turned black and being forced to feed on <a href="carrion">carrion</a> forever. In <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", a raven also begins as white before <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> punishes it by turning it black for delivering a message of a lover's unfaithfulness. The raven's role as a messenger in Poe's poem may draw from those stories.

<a href="wikt%3Anepenthe">Nepenthe</a>, a drug mentioned in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", erases memories; the narrator wonders aloud whether he could receive "respite" this way: "Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!" 

Poe also mentions the <a href="Balsam%20of%20Mecca">Balm of Gilead</a>, a reference to the <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Book of Jeremiah</a> (8:22) in the Bible: "Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?" In that context, the Balm of Gilead is a <a href="resin">resin</a> used for medicinal purposes (suggesting, perhaps, that the narrator needs to be healed after the loss of Lenore). In 1 Kings 17:1 - 5 <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> is said be from <a href="Gilead">Gilead</a>, and to have been fed by ravens during a period of drought. 

Poe also refers to "Aidenn", another word for the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a>, though Poe uses it to ask if Lenore has been accepted into <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a>.

The poem is made up of 18 <a href="stanza">stanza</a>s of six lines each. Generally, the meter is <a href="trochaic%20octameter">trochaic octameter</a> – eight trochaic feet per line, each foot having one stressed syllable followed by one unstressed syllable. The first line, for example (with / representing stressed syllables and x representing unstressed):

Poe, however, claimed the poem was a combination of <a href="octameter">octameter</a> <a href="acatalectic">acatalectic</a>, <a href="heptameter">heptameter</a> <a href="catalectic">catalectic</a>, and <a href="tetrameter">tetrameter</a> catalectic. The <a href="rhyme%20scheme">rhyme scheme</a> is ABCBBB, or AA,B,CC,CB,B,B when accounting for <a href="internal%20rhyme">internal rhyme</a>. In every stanza, the "B" lines rhyme with the word "nevermore" and are catalectic, placing extra emphasis on the final syllable. The poem also makes heavy use of <a href="alliteration">alliteration</a> ("Doubting, dreaming dreams ..."). 20th-century American poet <a href="Daniel%20Hoffman">Daniel Hoffman</a> suggested that the poem's structure and meter is so formulaic that it is artificial, though its mesmeric quality overrides that.

Poe based the structure of "The Raven" on the complicated rhyme and rhythm of <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett's</a> poem "Lady Geraldine's Courtship". Poe had reviewed Barrett's work in the January 1845 issue of the "<a href="Broadway%20Journal">Broadway Journal</a>" and said that "her poetic inspiration is the highest – we can conceive of nothing more august. Her sense of Art is pure in itself." As is typical with Poe, his review also criticizes her lack of originality and what he considers the repetitive nature of some of her poetry. About "Lady Geraldine's Courtship", he said "I have never read a poem combining so much of the fiercest passion with so much of the most delicate imagination."

Poe first brought "The Raven" to his friend and former employer <a href="George%20Rex%20Graham">George Rex Graham</a> of "<a href="Graham%27s%20Magazine">Graham's Magazine</a>" in Philadelphia. Graham declined the poem, which may not have been in its final version, though he gave Poe $15 as charity. Poe then sold the poem to "", which paid him $9 for it, and printed "The Raven" in its February 1845 issue under the pseudonym "Quarles", a reference to the English poet <a href="Francis%20Quarles">Francis Quarles</a>. The poem's first publication with Poe's name was in the "Evening Mirror" on January 29, 1845, as an "advance copy". <a href="Nathaniel%20Parker%20Willis">Nathaniel Parker Willis</a>, editor of the "Mirror", introduced it as "unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift ... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it." Following this publication the poem appeared in periodicals across the United States, including the "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>" (February 4, 1845), "<a href="Broadway%20Journal">Broadway Journal</a>" (vol. 1, February 8, 1845), "<a href="Southern%20Literary%20Messenger">Southern Literary Messenger</a>" (vol. 11, March 1845), "Literary Emporium" (vol. 2, December 1845), "Saturday Courier", 16 (July 25, 1846), and the "Richmond Examiner" (September 25, 1849). It has also appeared in numerous anthologies, starting with "Poets and Poetry of America" edited by <a href="Rufus%20Wilmot%20Griswold">Rufus Wilmot Griswold</a> in 1847.

The immediate success of "The Raven" prompted <a href="G.%20P.%20Putnam%27s%20Sons">Wiley and Putnam</a> to publish a collection of Poe's prose called "Tales" in June 1845; it was his first book in five years. They also published a collection of his poetry called "The Raven and Other Poems" on November 19 by Wiley and Putnam which included a dedication to Barrett as "the Noblest of her Sex". The small volume, his first book of poetry in 14 years, was 100 pages and sold for 31 cents. In addition to the title poem, it included "The Valley of Unrest", "Bridal Ballad", "<a href="The%20City%20in%20the%20Sea">The City in the Sea</a>", "<a href="Eulalie">Eulalie</a>", "<a href="The%20Conqueror%20Worm">The Conqueror Worm</a>", "<a href="The%20Haunted%20Palace%20%28poem%29">The Haunted Palace</a>" and eleven others. In the preface, Poe referred to them as "trifles" which had been altered without his permission as they made "the rounds of the press".

Later publications of "The Raven" included artwork by well-known illustrators. Notably, in 1858 "The Raven" appeared in a British Poe anthology with illustrations by <a href="John%20Tenniel">John Tenniel</a>, the "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>" illustrator ("The Poetical Works of Edgar Allan Poe: With Original Memoir", London: Sampson Low). "The Raven" was published independently with lavish <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s by <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a> in 1884 (New York: Harper & Brothers). Doré died before its publication. In 1875, a French edition with English and French text, "Le Corbeau", was published with <a href="lithographs">lithographs</a> by <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a> and translation by the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> <a href="St%C3%A9phane%20Mallarm%C3%A9">Stéphane Mallarmé</a>.
Many 20th-century artists and contemporary illustrators created artworks and illustrations based on "The Raven", including <a href="Edmund%20Dulac">Edmund Dulac</a>, <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Orosz">István Orosz</a>, and Ryan Price.

Poe capitalized on the success of "The Raven" by following it up with his essay "<a href="The%20Philosophy%20of%20Composition">The Philosophy of Composition</a>" (1846), in which he detailed the poem's creation. His description of its writing is probably exaggerated, though the essay serves as an important overview of Poe's <a href="literary%20theory">literary theory</a>. He explains that every component of the poem is based on logic: the raven enters the chamber to avoid a storm (the "midnight dreary" in the "bleak December"), and its perch on a pallid white bust was to create visual contrast against the dark black bird. No aspect of the poem was an accident, he claims, but is based on total control by the author. Even the term "Nevermore", he says, is used because of the effect created by the long vowel sounds (though Poe may have been inspired to use the word by the works of <a href="George%20Byron%2C%206th%20Baron%20Byron">Lord Byron</a> or <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>). Poe had experimented with the long "o" sound throughout many other poems: "no more" in "<a href="Poems%20by%20Edgar%20Allan%20Poe%23Silence%20%281839%29">Silence</a>", "evermore" in "<a href="The%20Conqueror%20Worm">The Conqueror Worm</a>". The topic itself, Poe says, was chosen because "the death... of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world." Told from "the lips ... of a bereaved lover" is best suited to achieve the desired effect. Beyond the poetics of it, the lost Lenore may have been inspired by events in Poe's own life as well, either to the early loss of his mother, <a href="Eliza%20Poe">Eliza Poe</a>, or the long illness endured by his wife, <a href="Virginia%20Eliza%20Clemm%20Poe">Virginia</a>. Ultimately, Poe considered "The Raven" an experiment to "suit at once the popular and critical taste", accessible to both the mainstream and high literary worlds. It is unknown how long Poe worked on "The Raven"; speculation ranges from a single day to ten years. Poe recited a poem believed to be an early version with an alternate ending of "The Raven" in 1843 in <a href="Saratoga%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga</a>, New York. An early draft may have featured an owl.

In the summer of 1844, when the poem was likely written, Poe, his wife, and mother-in-law were boarding at the farmhouse of Patrick Brennan. The location of the house, which was demolished in 1888, has been a disputed point and, while there are two different plaques marking its supposed location on West 84th Street, it most likely stood where 206 West 84th Street is now.

In part due to its dual printing, "The Raven" made Edgar Allan Poe a household name almost immediately, and turned Poe into a national celebrity. Readers began to identify poem with poet, earning Poe the nickname "The Raven". The poem was soon widely reprinted, imitated, and <a href="parody">parodied</a>. Though it made Poe popular in his day, it did not bring him significant financial success. As he later lamented, "I have made no money. I am as poor now as ever I was in my life—except in hope, which is by no means bankable".

The "New World" said, "Everyone reads the Poem and praises it ... justly, we think, for it seems to us full of originality and power." "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Pennsylvania Inquirer</a>" reprinted it with the heading "A Beautiful Poem". Elizabeth Barrett wrote to Poe, "Your 'Raven' has produced a sensation, a fit o' horror, here in England. Some of my friends are taken by the fear of it and some by the music. I hear of persons haunted by 'Nevermore'." Poe's popularity resulted in invitations to recite "The Raven" and to lecture – in public and at private social gatherings. At one literary <a href="salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a>, a guest noted, "to hear [Poe] repeat the Raven ... is an event in one's life." It was recalled by someone who experienced it, "He would turn down the lamps till the room was almost dark, then standing in the center of the apartment he would recite ... in the most melodious of voices ... So marvelous was his power as a reader that the auditors would be afraid to draw breath lest the enchanted spell be broken."

Parodies sprung up especially in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia and included "The Craven" by "Poh!", "The Gazelle", "The <a href="Whip-poor-will">Whippoorwill</a>", and "The Turkey". One parody, "The Pole-Cat", caught the attention of Andrew Johnston, a lawyer who sent it on to <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Though Lincoln admitted he had "several hearty laughs", he had not, at that point read "The Raven". However, Lincoln eventually read and memorized the poem.

"The Raven" was praised by fellow writers <a href="William%20Gilmore%20Simms">William Gilmore Simms</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Fuller">Margaret Fuller</a>, though it was denounced by <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a>, who called it "insincere and vulgar ... its execution a rhythmical trick". <a href="Transcendentalism">Transcendentalist</a> <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> said, "I see nothing in it." A critic for the "Southern Quarterly Review" wrote in July 1848 that the poem was ruined by "a wild and unbridled extravagance" and that minor things like a tapping at the door and a fluttering curtain would only affect "a child who had been frightened to the verge of idiocy by terrible ghost stories". An anonymous writer going by the pseudonym "Outis" suggested in the "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20Mirror">Evening Mirror</a>" that "The Raven" was <a href="plagiarism">plagiarized</a> from a poem called "The Bird of the Dream" by an unnamed author. The writer showed 18 similarities between the poems and was made as a response to Poe's accusations of plagiarism against <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. It has been suggested Outis was really <a href="Cornelius%20Conway%20Felton">Cornelius Conway Felton</a>, if not Poe himself. After Poe's death, his friend <a href="Thomas%20Holley%20Chivers">Thomas Holley Chivers</a> said "The Raven" was plagiarized from one of his poems. In particular, he claimed to have been the inspiration for the meter of the poem as well as the refrain "nevermore".

Ralph Vaughan Williams

Ralph Vaughan Williams (; 12 October 1872– 26 August 1958) was an English composer. His works include operas, ballets, chamber music, secular and religious vocal pieces and orchestral compositions including nine symphonies, written over sixty years. Strongly influenced by <a href="Tudor%20music">Tudor music</a> and <a href="English%20folk-song">English folk-song</a>, his output marked a decisive break in British music from its German-dominated style of the 19th century.

Vaughan Williams was born to a well-to-do family with strong moral views and a progressive social outlook. Throughout his life he sought to be of service to his fellow citizens, and believed in making music as available as possible to everybody. He wrote many works for amateur and student performance. He was musically a late developer, not finding his true voice until his late thirties; his studies in 1907–1908 with the French composer <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a> helped him clarify the textures of his music and free it from <a href="Music%20of%20Germany">Teutonic influences</a>.

Vaughan Williams is among the best-known British symphonists, noted for his very wide range of moods, from stormy and impassioned to tranquil, from mysterious to exuberant. Among the most familiar of his other concert works are "<a href="Fantasia%20on%20a%20Theme%20by%20Thomas%20Tallis">Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis</a>" (1910) and "<a href="The%20Lark%20Ascending">The Lark Ascending</a>" (1914). His vocal works include hymns, folk-song arrangements and large-scale choral pieces. He wrote eight works for stage performance between 1919 and 1951. Although none of his operas became popular repertoire pieces, his ballet "" (1930) was successful and has been frequently staged.

Two episodes made notably deep impressions in Vaughan Williams's personal life. The <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, in which he served in the army, had a lasting emotional effect. Twenty years later, though in his sixties and devotedly married, he was reinvigorated by a love affair with a much younger woman, who later became his second wife. He went on composing through his seventies and eighties, producing his last symphony months before his death at the age of eighty-five. His works have continued to be a staple of the British concert repertoire, and all his major compositions and many of the minor ones have been recorded.

Vaughan Williams was born at <a href="Down%20Ampney">Down Ampney</a>, <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, the third child and younger son of the <a href="vicar">vicar</a>, the Reverend Arthur Vaughan Williams (1834–1875) and his wife, Margaret, "née" Wedgwood (1842–1937). His paternal forebears were of mixed English and Welsh descent; many of them went into the law or the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church</a>. The judges <a href="Edward%20Vaughan%20Williams">Sir Edward</a> and <a href="Roland%20Vaughan%20Williams">Sir Roland Vaughan Williams</a> were respectively Arthur's father and brother. Margaret Vaughan Williams was a great-granddaughter of <a href="Josiah%20Wedgwood">Josiah Wedgwood</a> and niece of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>.
Arthur Vaughan Williams died suddenly in February 1875, and his widow took the children to live in her family home, Leith Hill Place, <a href="Wotton%2C%20Surrey">Wotton, Surrey</a>. The children were under the care of a nurse, Sara Wager, who instilled in them not only polite manners and good behaviour but also liberal social and philosophical opinions. Such views were consistent with the progressive-minded tradition of both sides of the family. When the young Vaughan Williams asked his mother about Darwin's controversial book "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>", she answered, "The Bible says that God made the world in six days. Great Uncle Charles thinks it took longer: but we need not worry about it, for it is equally wonderful either way".

In 1878, at the age of five, Vaughan Williams began receiving piano lessons from his aunt, Sophy Wedgwood. He displayed signs of musical talent early on, composing his first piece of music, a four-bar piano piece called "The Robin's Nest", in the same year. He did not greatly like the piano, and was pleased to begin violin lessons the following year. In 1880, when he was eight, he took a correspondence course in music from <a href="Edinburgh%20University">Edinburgh University</a> and passed the associated examinations.

In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">preparatory school</a> in <a href="Rottingdean">Rottingdean</a> on the south coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was generally happy there, although he was shocked to encounter for the first time social snobbery and political conservatism, which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the <a href="public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public school</a> <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse</a> in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.

While at Charterhouse Vaughan Williams found that religion meant less and less to him, and for a while he was an atheist. This softened into "a cheerful agnosticism", and he continued to attend church regularly to avoid upsetting the family. His views on religion did not affect his love of the <a href="King%20James%20Version">Authorised Version of the Bible</a>, the beauty of which, in the words of <a href="Ursula%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ursula Vaughan Williams</a> in her 1964 biography of the composer, remained "one of his essential companions through life." In this, as in many other things in his life, he was, according to his biographer <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a>, "that extremely English product the natural nonconformist with a conservative regard for the best tradition".

In July 1890 Vaughan Williams left Charterhouse and in September he was enrolled as a student at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> (RCM), London. After a compulsory course in <a href="harmony">harmony</a> with <a href="Francis%20Edward%20Gladstone">Francis Edward Gladstone</a>, professor of organ, counterpoint and harmony, he studied organ with <a href="Walter%20Parratt">Walter Parratt</a> and composition with <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a>. He idolised Parry, and recalled in his "Musical Autobiography" (1950):
Vaughan Williams's family would have preferred him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years and then go on to <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling it would be wrong to prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he spent three years, studying music and history.

Among those with whom Vaughan Williams became friendly at Cambridge were the philosophers <a href="G.%20E.%20Moore">G. E. Moore</a> and <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, the historian <a href="G.%20M.%20Trevelyan">G. M. Trevelyan</a> and the musician <a href="Hugh%20Allen%20%28conductor%29">Hugh Allen</a>. He felt intellectually overshadowed by some of his companions, but he learned much from them and formed lifelong friendships with several. Among the women with whom he mixed socially at Cambridge was Adeline Fisher, the daughter of <a href="Herbert%20William%20Fisher">Herbert Fisher</a>, an old friend of the Vaughan Williams family. She and Vaughan Williams grew close, and in June 1897, after he had left Cambridge, they became engaged to be married.
During his time at Cambridge Vaughan Williams continued his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with <a href="Charles%20Wood%20%28composer%29">Charles Wood</a> and organ with <a href="Alan%20Gray">Alan Gray</a>. He graduated as <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Music">Bachelor of Music</a> in 1894 and <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded <a href="George%20Grove">Sir George Grove</a> as director of the college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a>. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, and he stood up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for <a href="Mode%20%28music%29">modal music</a>.

In his second spell at the RCM (1895–1896) Vaughan Williams got to know a fellow student, <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, who became a lifelong friend. Stanford emphasised the need for his students to be self-critical, but Vaughan Williams and Holst became, and remained, one another's most valued critics; each would play his latest composition to the other while still working on it. Vaughan Williams later observed, "What one really learns from an Academy or College is not so much from one's official teachers as from one's fellow-students ... [we discussed] every subject under the sun from the lowest note of the double bassoon to the philosophy of "<a href="Jude%20the%20Obscure">Jude the Obscure</a>"". In 1949 he wrote of their relationship, "Holst declared that his music was influenced by that of his friend: the converse is certainly true."

Vaughan Williams had a modest private income, which in his early career he supplemented with a variety of musical activities. Although the organ was not his preferred instrument, the only post he ever held for an annual salary was as a church organist and choirmaster. He held the position at St Barnabas, in the inner London district of South <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, from 1895 to 1899 for a salary of £50 a year. He disliked the job, but working closely with a choir was valuable experience for his later undertakings.

In October 1897 Adeline and Vaughan Williams were married. They honeymooned for several months in Berlin, where he studied with <a href="Max%20Bruch">Max Bruch</a>. On their return they settled in London, originally in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> and, from 1905, in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>. There were no children of the marriage.

In 1899 Vaughan Williams passed the examination for the degree of Doctor of Music at Cambridge; the title was formally conferred on him in 1901. The song "Linden Lea" became the first of his works to appear in print, published in the magazine "The Vocalist" in April 1902 and then as separate sheet music. In addition to composition he occupied himself in several capacities during the first decade of the century. He wrote articles for musical journals and for the second edition of "<a href="Grove%27s%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>", edited the first volume of Purcell's "Welcome Songs" for the Purcell Society, and was for a while involved in adult education in the University Extension Lectures. From 1904 to 1906 he was music editor of a new hymn-book, "The English Hymnal", of which he later said, "I now know that two years of close association with some of the best (as well as some of the worst) tunes in the world was a better musical education than any amount of sonatas and fugues". Always committed to music-making for the whole community, he helped found the amateur <a href="Dorking%23Leith%20Hill%20Music%20Festival">Leith Hill Music Festival</a> in 1905, and was appointed its principal conductor, a post he held until 1953.

In 1903–1904 Vaughan Williams started collecting folk-songs. He had always been interested in them, and now followed the example of a recent generation of enthusiasts such as <a href="Cecil%20Sharp">Cecil Sharp</a> and <a href="Lucy%20Broadwood">Lucy Broadwood</a> in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style for the rest of his career.

Over this period Vaughan Williams composed steadily, producing songs, choral music, chamber works and orchestral pieces, gradually finding the beginnings of his mature style. His compositions included the <a href="symphonic%20poem">tone poem</a> "<a href="In%20the%20Fen%20Country">In the Fen Country</a>" (1904) and the "<a href="Norfolk%20Rhapsodies%23Norfolk%20Rhapsody%20No.%201%20in%20E%20minor">Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1</a>" (1906). He remained unsatisfied with his technique as a composer. After unsuccessfully seeking lessons from <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Sir Edward Elgar</a>, he contemplated studying with <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a> in Paris. Instead, he was introduced by the critic and musicologist <a href="Michel-Dimitri%20Calvocoressi">M.D.Calvocoressi</a> to <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>, a more modernist, less dogmatic musician than d'Indy.

Ravel took few pupils, and was known as a demanding taskmaster for those he agreed to teach. Vaughan Williams spent three months in Paris in the winter of 1907–1908, working with him four or five times each week. There is little documentation of Vaughan Williams's time with Ravel; the musicologist <a href="Byron%20Adams">Byron Adams</a> advises caution in relying on Vaughan Williams's recollections in the "Musical Autobiography" written forty-three years after the event. The degree to which the French composer influenced the Englishman's style is debated. Ravel declared Vaughan Williams to be "my only pupil who does not write my music"; nevertheless, commentators including Kennedy, Adams, <a href="Hugh%20Ottaway">Hugh Ottaway</a> and Alain Frogley find Vaughan Williams's instrumental textures lighter and sharper in the music written after his return from Paris, such as the String Quartet in G minor, "<a href="On%20Wenlock%20Edge%20%28song%20cycle%29">On Wenlock Edge</a>", the Overture to "<a href="The%20Wasps%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">The Wasps</a>" and "<a href="A%20Sea%20Symphony">A Sea Symphony</a>". Vaughan Williams himself said that Ravel had helped him escape from "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner".
In the years between his return from Paris in 1908 and the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914, Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music. For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals, which generated publicity and royalties. In 1910 his music featured at two of the largest and most prestigious festivals, with the premieres of the "<a href="Fantasia%20on%20a%20Theme%20by%20Thomas%20Tallis">Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis</a>" at the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> in <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester Cathedral</a> in September and "A Sea Symphony" at the <a href="Leeds%20Festival%20%28classical%20music%29">Leeds Festival</a> the following month. The leading British music critics of the time, <a href="J.%20A.%20Fuller%20Maitland">J. A. Fuller Maitland</a> of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and <a href="Samuel%20Langford">Samuel Langford</a> of "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", were strong in their praise. The former wrote of the fantasia, "The work is wonderful because it seems to lift one into some unknown region of musical thought and feeling. Throughout its course one is never sure whether one is listening to something very old or very new". Langford declared that the symphony "definitely places a new figure in the first rank of our English composers". Between these successes and the start of war Vaughan Williams's largest-scale work was the first version of "<a href="A%20London%20Symphony">A London Symphony</a>" (1914). In the same year he wrote "<a href="The%20Lark%20Ascending">The Lark Ascending</a>" in its original form for violin and piano.

Despite his age—he was forty-two in 1914—Vaughan Williams volunteered for military service on the outbreak of the First World War. Joining the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a> as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a>, he <a href="List%20of%20ambulance%20drivers%20during%20World%20War%20I">drove ambulance wagons</a> in France and later in Greece. Frogley writes of this period that Vaughan Williams was considerably older than most of his comrades, and "the back-breaking labour of dangerous night-time journeys through mud and rain must have been more than usually punishing". The war left its emotional mark on Vaughan Williams, who lost many comrades and friends, including the young composer <a href="George%20Butterworth">George Butterworth</a>. In 1917 Vaughan Williams was commissioned as a <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, seeing action in France from March 1918. The continual noise of the guns damaged his hearing, and led to deafness in his later years. After the armistice in 1918 he served as director of music for the British <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a> until demobilised in February 1919.

During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, and after returning to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works. He revised some earlier pieces, and turned his attention to other musical activities. In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen, who had succeeded Parry as director, to teach composition at the RCM; he remained on the faculty of the college for the next twenty years. In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the <a href="Bach%20Choir">Bach Choir</a>, London. It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition, "<a href="A%20Pastoral%20Symphony">A Pastoral Symphony</a>"; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a> and its American premiere in New York in December conducted by the composer.
Throughout the 1920s Vaughan Williams continued to compose, conduct and teach. Kennedy lists forty works premiered during the decade, including the <a href="Mass%20in%20G%20minor%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Mass in G minor</a> (1922), the ballet "Old King Cole" (1923), the operas "<a href="Hugh%20the%20Drover">Hugh the Drover</a>" and "<a href="Sir%20John%20in%20Love">Sir John in Love</a>" (1924 and 1928), the suite "<a href="Flos%20Campi">Flos Campi</a>" (1925) and the oratorio "<a href="Sancta%20Civitas">Sancta Civitas</a>" (1925).

During the decade Adeline became increasingly immobilised by arthritis, and the numerous stairs in their London house finally caused the Vaughan Williamses to move in 1929 to a more manageable home, "The White Gates", <a href="Dorking">Dorking</a>, where they lived until Adeline's death in 1951. Vaughan Williams, who thought of himself as a complete Londoner, was sorry to leave the capital, but his wife was anxious to live in the country, and Dorking was within reasonably convenient reach of town.

In 1932 Vaughan Williams was elected president of the <a href="English%20Folk%20Dance%20and%20Song%20Society">English Folk Dance and Song Society</a>. From September to December of that year he was in the US as a visiting lecturer at <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a>, Pennsylvania. The texts of his lectures were published under the title "National Music" in 1934; they sum up his artistic and social credo more fully than anything he had published previously, and remained in print for most of the remainder of the century.

During the 1930s Vaughan Williams came to be regarded as a leading figure in British music, particularly after the deaths of Elgar, <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a> and Holst in 1934. Holst's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer <a href="Gerald%20Finzi">Gerald Finzi</a>, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.

In some of Vaughan Williams's music of the 1930s there is an explicitly dark, even violent tone. The ballet "" (1930) and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Fourth Symphony</a> (1935) surprised the public and critics. The discordant and violent tone of the symphony, written at a time of growing international tension, led many critics to suppose the symphony to be <a href="program%20music">programmatic</a>. <a href="Hubert%20J.%20Foss">Hubert Foss</a> dubbed it "The Romantic" and <a href="Frank%20Howes">Frank Howes</a> called it "The Fascist". The composer dismissed such interpretations, and insisted that the work was <a href="absolute%20music">absolute music</a>, with no programme of any kind; nonetheless, some of those close to him, including Foss and Boult, remained convinced that something of the troubled spirit of the age was captured in the work.

As the decade progressed, Vaughan Williams found musical inspiration lacking, and experienced his first fallow period since his wartime musical silence. After his anti-war cantata "<a href="Dona%20nobis%20pacem%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Dona nobis pacem</a>" in 1936 he did not complete another work of substantial length until late in 1941, when the first version of the <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Fifth Symphony</a> was completed.

In 1938 Vaughan Williams met <a href="Ursula%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ursula Wood</a> (1911–2007), the wife of an army officer, Captain (later Lieutenant-Colonel) Michael Forrester Wood. She was a poet, and had approached the composer with a proposed scenario for a ballet. Despite their both being married, and a four-decade age-gap, they fell in love almost from their first meeting; they maintained a secret love affair for more than a decade. Ursula became the composer's muse, helper and London companion, and later helped him care for his ailing wife. Whether Adeline knew, or suspected, that Ursula and Vaughan Williams were lovers is uncertain, but the relations between the two women were of warm friendship throughout the years they knew each other. The composer's concern for his first wife never faltered, according to Ursula, who admitted in the 1980s that she had been jealous of Adeline, whose place in Vaughan Williams's life and affections was unchallengeable.

During the Second World War Vaughan Williams was active in civilian war work, chairing the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> Committee for the Release of Interned Alien Musicians, helping <a href="Myra%20Hess">Myra Hess</a> with the organisation of the daily <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> concerts, serving on a committee for refugees from Nazi oppression, and on the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), the forerunner of the <a href="Arts%20Council%20of%20Great%20Britain">Arts Council</a>. In 1940 he composed his first film score, for the propaganda film "<a href="49th%20Parallel%20%28film%29">49th Parallel</a>".

In 1942 Michael Wood died suddenly of heart failure. At Adeline's behest the widowed Ursula was invited to stay with the Vaughan Williamses in Dorking, and thereafter was a regular visitor there, sometimes staying for weeks at a time. The critic Michael White suggests that Adeline "appears, in the most amicable way, to have adopted Ursula as her successor". Ursula recorded that during air raids all three slept in the same room in adjacent beds, holding hands for comfort.

In 1943 Vaughan Williams conducted the premiere of his Fifth Symphony at the <a href="the%20Proms">Proms</a>. Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth, and led some commentators to think it a symphonic valediction. <a href="William%20Glock">William Glock</a> wrote that it was "like the work of a distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language". The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war, "Thanksgiving for Victory", was marked by what the critic <a href="Edward%20Lockspeiser">Edward Lockspeiser</a> called the composer's characteristic avoidance of "any suggestion of rhetorical pompousness". Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Sixth Symphony</a> (1948), described by the critic Gwyn Parry-Jones as "one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century", opening with a "primal scream, plunging the listener immediately into a world of aggression and impending chaos." Coming as it did near the start of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, many critics thought its "pianissimo" last movement a depiction of a nuclear-scorched wasteland. The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories: "It never seems to occur to people that a man might just want to write a piece of music."
In 1951 Adeline died, aged eighty. In the same year Vaughan Williams's last opera, "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress%20%28opera%29">The Pilgrim's Progress</a>", was staged at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> as part of the <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>. He had been working intermittently on a musical treatment of <a href="John%20Bunyan">John Bunyan</a>'s allegory for forty-five years, and the 1951 "morality" was the final result. The reviews were respectful, but the work did not catch the opera-going public's imagination, and the Royal Opera House's production was "insultingly half-hearted" according to Frogley. The piece was revived the following year, but was still not a great success. Vaughan Williams commented to Ursula, "They don't like it, they won't like it, they don't want an opera with no heroine and no love duets—and I don't care, it's what I meant, and there it is."

In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 <a href="Hanover%20Terrace">Hanover Terrace</a>, <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a>, London. It was the year of <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II%27s%20coronation">Queen Elizabeth II's coronation</a>; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the <a href="Old%20100th">Old Hundredth</a> psalm tune, and a new setting of "O taste and see" from <a href="Psalm%2034">Psalm 34</a>, performed at the service in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.
Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in "<a href="pro%20bono%20publico">pro bono publico</a>" activities. He was a leading figure in the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Promotion%20of%20New%20Music">Society for the Promotion of New Music</a>, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell</a> and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as "like a musical state occasion".

Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, "Grove" makes particular mention of "<a href="Three%20Shakespeare%20Songs">Three Shakespeare Songs</a>" (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata "<a href="Hodie">Hodie</a>" (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the "<a href="Ten%20Blake%20Songs">Ten Blake Songs</a>" (1957) for voice and oboe, "a masterpiece of economy and precision". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, "Thomas the Rhymer". The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled "<a href="Sinfonia%20antartica">Sinfonia antartica</a>"—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film "<a href="Scott%20of%20the%20Antarctic%20%28film%29">Scott of the Antarctic</a>", and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Eighth</a>, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the <a href="the%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> under the dedicatee, <a href="John%20Barbirolli">Sir John Barbirolli</a>. The <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Ninth</a>, premiered at a <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> concert conducted by <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Sir Malcolm Sargent</a> in April 1958, puzzled critics with its sombre, questing tone, and did not immediately achieve the recognition it later gained.

Having been in excellent health, Vaughan Williams died suddenly in the early hours of 26 August 1958 at Hanover Terrace, aged 85. Two days later, after a private funeral at <a href="Golders%20Green%20Crematorium">Golders Green</a>, he was cremated. On 19 September, at a crowded memorial service, his ashes were interred near the burial plots of Purcell and Stanford in the north choir aisle of Westminster Abbey.

Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams's music as a strongly individual blending of the modal harmonies familiar from folk‐song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy. The basis of his work is melody, his rhythms, in Kennedy's view, being unsubtle at times. Vaughan Williams's music is often described as visionary; Kennedy cites the masque "Job" and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies. Vaughan Williams's output was prolific and wide-ranging. For the voice he composed songs, operas, and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses. His comparatively few chamber works are not among his better known compositions. Some of his finest works elude conventional categorisation, such as the "<a href="Serenade%20to%20Music">Serenade to Music</a>" (1938) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra; "Flos Campi" (1925) for solo viola, small orchestra, and small chorus; and his most important chamber work, in Howes's view—not purely instrumental but a song cycle—"On Wenlock Edge" (1909) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano.

In 1955 the authors of "The Record Guide", <a href="Edward%20Sackville-West%2C%205th%20Baron%20Sackville">Edward Sackville-West</a> and <a href="Desmond%20Shawe-Taylor%20%28music%20critic%29">Desmond Shawe-Taylor</a>, wrote that Vaughan Williams's music showed an exceptionally strong individual voice: Vaughan Williams's style is "not remarkable for grace or politeness or inventive colour", but expresses "a consistent vision in which thought and feeling and their equivalent images in music never fall below a certain high level of natural distinction". They commented that the composer's vision is expressed in two main contrasting moods: "the one contemplative and trance-like, the other pugnacious and sinister". The first mood, generally predominant in the composer's output, was more popular, as audiences preferred "the stained-glass beauty of the Tallis Fantasia, the direct melodic appeal of the "Serenade to Music", the pastoral poetry of "The Lark Ascending", and the grave serenity of the Fifth Symphony". By contrast, as in the ferocity of the Fourth and Sixth Symphonies and the Concerto for Two Pianos: "in his grimmer moods Vaughan Williams can be as frightening as Sibelius and <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a>".

It is as a symphonist that Vaughan Williams is best known. The composer and academic <a href="Elliott%20Schwartz">Elliott Schwartz</a> wrote (1964), "It may be said with truth that Vaughan Williams, <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> and <a href="Sergei%20Prokofiev">Prokofieff</a> are the symphonists of this century". Although Vaughan Williams did not complete the first of them until he was thirty-eight years old, the nine symphonies span nearly half a century of his creative life. In his 1964 analysis of the nine, Schwartz found it striking that no two of the symphonies are alike, either in structure or in mood. Commentators have found it useful to consider the nine in three groups of three—early, middle and late.

The first three symphonies, to which Vaughan Williams assigned titles rather than numbers, form a sub-group within the nine, having <a href="programme%20music">programmatic</a> elements, absent from the later six.

"<a href="A%20Sea%20Symphony">A Sea Symphony</a>" (1910), the only one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier <a href="Choral%20symphony">choral symphonies</a> in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley describes it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly tonal construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> which were soon to follow.

"<a href="A%20London%20Symphony">A London Symphony</a>" (1911–1913) which the composer later observed might more accurately be called a "symphony by a Londoner", is for the most part not overtly pictorial in its presentation of London. Vaughan Williams insisted that it is "self-expressive, and must stand or fall as 'absolute' music". There are some references to the urban soundscape: brief impressions of street music, with the sound of the <a href="barrel%20organ">barrel organ</a> mimicked by the orchestra; the characteristic <a href="Street%20cries">chant</a> of the lavender-seller; the jingle of <a href="hansom%20cab">hansom cab</a>s; and the chimes of <a href="Big%20Ben">Big Ben</a> played by harp and clarinet. But commentators have heard—and the composer never denied or confirmed—some social comment in sinister echoes at the end of the scherzo and an orchestral outburst of pain and despair at the opening of the finale. Schwartz comments that the symphony, in its "unified presentation of widely heterogeneous elements", is "very much like the city itself". Vaughan Williams said in his later years that this was his favourite of the symphonies.

The last of the first group is "<a href="A%20Pastoral%20Symphony">A Pastoral Symphony</a>" (1921). The first three movements are for orchestra alone; a wordless solo soprano or tenor voice is added in the finale. Despite the title the symphony draws little on the folk-songs beloved of the composer, and the pastoral landscape evoked is not a tranquil English scene, but the French countryside ravaged by war. Some English musicians who had not fought in the First World War misunderstood the work and heard only the slow tempi and quiet tone, failing to notice the character of a requiem in the music and mistaking the piece for a rustic idyll. Kennedy comments that it was not until after the Second World War that "the spectral 'Last Post' in the second movement and the girl's lamenting voice in the finale" were widely noticed and understood.

The middle three symphonies are purely orchestral, and generally conventional in form, with <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a> (modified in places), specified <a href="Tonic%20%28music%29">home keys</a>, and four-movement structure. The orchestral forces required are not large by the standards of the first half of the 20th century, although the Fourth calls for an augmented woodwind section and the Sixth includes a part for <a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>. The <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Fourth Symphony</a> (1935) astonished listeners with its striking dissonance, far removed from the prevailing quiet tone of the previous symphony. The composer firmly contradicted any notions that the work was programmatical in any respect, and Kennedy calls attempts to give the work "a meretricious programme ... a poor compliment to its musical vitality and self-sufficiency".

The <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Fifth Symphony</a> (1943) was in complete contrast to its predecessor. Vaughan Williams had been working on and off for many years on his operatic version of Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress". Fearing—wrongly as it turned out—that the opera would never be completed, Vaughan Williams reworked some of the music already written for it into a new symphony. Despite the internal tensions caused by the deliberate conflict of modality in places, the work is generally serene in character, and was particularly well received for the comfort it gave at a time of all-out war. <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> later wrote, "The Fifth Symphony contains the most benedictory and consoling music of our time."

With the <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Sixth Symphony</a> (1948) Vaughan Williams once again confounded expectations. Many had seen the Fifth, composed when he was seventy, as a valedictory work, and the turbulent, troubled Sixth came as a shock. After violent orchestral clashes in the first movement, the obsessive "<a href="ostinato">ostinato</a>" of the second and the "diabolic" scherzo, the finale perplexed many listeners. Described as "one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken in music", it is marked "pianissimo" throughout its 10–12-minute duration.

The seventh symphony, the "<a href="Sinfonia%20antartica">Sinfonia antartica</a>" (1952), a by-product of the composer's score for "Scott of the Antarctic", has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in "Grove" argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood sense of the term nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for <a href="wind%20machine">wind machine</a>.

The <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Eighth Symphony</a> (1956) in D minor is noticeably different from its seven predecessors by virtue of its brevity and, despite its minor key, its general light-heartedness. The orchestra is smaller than for most of the symphonies, with the exception of the percussion section, which is particularly large, with, as Vaughan Williams put it, "all the 'phones' and 'spiels' known to the composer". The work was enthusiastically received at its early performances, and has remained among Vaughan Williams's most popular works.

The final symphony, the <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Ninth</a>, was completed in late 1957 and premiered in April 1958, four months before the composer's death. It is scored for a large orchestra, including three saxophones, a <a href="flugelhorn">flugelhorn</a>, and an enlarged percussion section. The mood is more sombre than that of the Eighth; "Grove" calls its mood "at once heroic and contemplative, defiant and wistfully absorbed". The work received an ovation at its premiere, but at first the critics were not sure what to make of it, and it took some years for it to be generally ranked alongside its eight predecessors.

"Grove" lists more than thirty works by Vaughan Williams for orchestra or band over and above the symphonies. They include two of his most popular works—the "<a href="Fantasia%20on%20a%20Theme%20by%20Thomas%20Tallis">Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis</a>" (1910, revised 1919), and "The Lark Ascending", originally for violin and piano (1914); orchestrated 1920. Other works that survive in the repertoire in Britain are the "Norfolk Rhapsody No 1" (1905–1906), "The Wasps, Aristophanic suite"—particularly the overture (1909), the "<a href="English%20Folk%20Song%20Suite">English Folk Song Suite</a>" (1923) and the "Fantasia on Greensleeves" (1934).

Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">piano</a> (1926), <a href="Oboe%20Concerto%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">oboe</a> (1944) and <a href="Tuba%20Concerto%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">tuba</a> (1954); another concertante piece is his Romance for <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a>, strings and piano (1951). None of these works has rivalled the popularity of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers of the Piano Concerto, written for and championed by <a href="Harriet%20Cohen">Harriet Cohen</a>, but it has remained, in the words of the critic Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.

In addition to the music for "Scott of the Antarctic", Vaughan Williams composed incidental music for eleven other films, from "49th Parallel" (1941) to "The Vision of William Blake" (1957).

By comparison with his output in other genres, Vaughan Williams's music for chamber ensembles and solo instruments forms a small part of his oeuvre. "Grove" lists twenty-four pieces under the heading "Chamber and instrumental"; three are early, unpublished works. Vaughan Williams, like most leading British 20th-century composers, was not drawn to the solo piano and wrote little for it. From his mature years, there survive for standard chamber groupings two string quartets (1908–1909, revised 1921; and 1943–1944), a "phantasy" string quintet (1912), and a sonata for violin and piano (1954). The first quartet was written soon after Vaughan Williams's studies in Paris with Ravel, whose influence is strongly evident. In 2002 the magazine "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" described the second quartet as a masterpiece that should be, but is not, part of the international chamber repertory. It is from the same period as the Sixth Symphony, and has something of that work's severity and anguish. The quintet (1912) was written two years after the success of the "Tallis Fantasia", with which it has elements in common, both in terms of instrumental layout and the mood of rapt contemplation. The violin sonata has made little impact.

Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote of her husband's love of literature, and listed some of his favourite writers and writings:

In addition to his love of poetry, Vaughan Williams's vocal music is inspired by his lifelong belief that the voice "can be made the medium of the best and deepest human emotion."

Between the mid-1890s and the late 1950s Vaughan Williams set more than eighty poems for voice and piano accompaniment. The earliest to survive is "A Cradle Song", to <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Coleridge</a>'s words, from about 1894. The songs include many that have entered the repertory, such as "Linden Lea" (1902), "Silent Noon" (1904) and the song cycles "<a href="Songs%20of%20Travel">Songs of Travel</a>" (1905 and 1907) and "On Wenlock Edge". To Vaughan Williams the human voice was "the oldest and greatest of musical instruments". He described his early songs as "more or less simple and popular in character", and the musicologist Sophie Fuller describes this simplicity and popularity as consistent throughout his career. Many composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries wrote sentimental works for female voice; by contrast, songs by Vaughan Williams, such as "The Vagabond" from "Songs of Travel", to words by <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, are "a particularly masculine breath of fresh air" (Fuller), "virile open-air verses" (Kennedy). Some of Vaughan Williams's later songs are less well known; Fuller singles out the cycle "Three Poems by Walt Whitman", a largely dark work, as too often overlooked by singers and critics. For some of his songs the composer expands the accompaniment to include two or more string instruments in addition to the piano; they include "On Wenlock Edge", and the Chaucer cycle "Merciless Beauty" (1921), judged by an anonymous contemporary critic as "surely among the best of modern English songs".

 Despite his agnosticism Vaughan Williams composed many works for church performance. His two best known hymn tunes, both from c. 1905, are "Down Ampney" to the words "Come Down, O Love Divine", and ""Sine nomine"" "For All the Saints". "Grove" lists a dozen more, composed between 1905 and 1935. Other church works include a "Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis" (1925), the Mass (1920–1921), a Te Deum (1928) and the motets "<a href="O%20clap%20your%20hands%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">O Clap Your Hands</a>" (1920), "Lord, Thou hast been our Refuge" (1921) and "O Taste and See" (1953, first performed at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II).

Vaughan Williams's choral works for concert performance include settings of both secular and religious words. The former include "Toward the Unknown Region" to words by Whitman (composed 1904–1906), "Five Tudor Portraits", words by John Skelton (1935), and the Shakespearean "Serenade to Music" (in its alternative version for chorus and orchestra, 1938). Choral pieces with religious words include the oratorio "<a href="Sancta%20Civitas">Sancta Civitas</a>" (1923–1925) and the Christmas cantata "<a href="Hodie">Hodie</a>" (1954). In 1953 the composer said that of his choral works "Sancta Civitas" was his favourite. The "<a href="Dona%20nobis%20pacem%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Dona Nobis Pacem</a>", an impassioned anti-war cantata (1936) is a combination of both, with words from Whitman and others juxtaposed with extracts from the Latin mass, anticipating a similar mixture of sacred and secular text in <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>'s "<a href="War%20Requiem">War Requiem</a>" twenty-five years later.

Vaughan Williams was wary of conventional labels; his best known ballet is described on the title page as "a masque for dancing" and only one of his operatic works is categorised by the composer simply as an opera. For some of his theatre pieces that could be classed as operas or ballets, he preferred the terms "masque", "romantic extravaganza", "play set to music", or "morality".

In a 2013 survey of Vaughan Williams's stage works, Eric Saylor writes, "With the possible exception of <a href="Peter%20Ilyitch%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>, no composer's operatic career was less emblematic of his success elsewhere." Although Vaughan Williams was a regular opera-goer, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about works by operatic masters from <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> to Wagner and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>, his success in the operatic field was at best patchy. There is widespread agreement among commentators that this was partly due to the composer's poor choice of librettists for some, though not all, of his operas. Another problem was his keenness to encourage amateurs and student groups, which sometimes led to the staging of his operas with less than professional standards. A further factor was the composer's expressed preference for "slow, long "tableaux"", which tended to reduce dramatic impact, although he believed them essential, as "music takes a long time to speak—much longer than words by themselves."

"Hugh the Drover, or Love in the Stocks" (completed 1919, premiere 1924) has a libretto, by the writer and theatre critic Harold Child, which was described by "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage</a>" as "replete with folksy, Cotswold village archetypes". In the view of the critic <a href="Richard%20Traubner">Richard Traubner</a> the piece is a cross between traditional ballad opera and the works of Puccini and Ravel, "with rhapsodic results." The score uses genuine and pastiche folk songs but ends with a passionate love duet that Traubner considers has few equals in English opera. Its first performance was by students at the Royal College of Music, and the work is rarely staged by major professional companies.

"Old King Cole" (1923) is a humorous ballet. The score, which makes liberal use of folk-song melodies, was thought by critics to be strikingly modern when first heard. Kennedy comments that the music "is not a major work but it is fun." The piece has not been seen frequently since its premiere, but was revived in a student production at the RCM in 1937.

"On Christmas Night" (1926), a masque by <a href="Adolph%20Bolm">Adolph Bolm</a> and Vaughan Williams, combines singing, dancing and mime. The story is loosely based on <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Dickens</a>'s "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>". The piece was first given in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> by Bolm's company; the London premiere was in 1935. Saylor describes the work as a "dramatic hodgepodge" which has not attracted the interest of later performers.

The only work that the composer designated as an opera is the comedy "Sir John in Love" (1924–1928). It is based on <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>". Folk song is used, though more discreetly than in "Hugh the Drover", and the score is described by Saylor as "ravishingly tuneful". Although versions of the play had already been set by <a href="Otto%20Nicolai">Nicolai</a>, Verdi, and Holst, Vaughan Williams's is distinctive for its greater emphasis on the love music rather than on the robust comedy. In 1931, with the Leith Hill Festival in mind, the composer recast some of the music as a five-section cantata, "In Windsor Forest", giving the public "the plums and no cake", as he put it.

"The Poisoned Kiss" (1927–1929, premiered in 1936) is a light comedy. Vaughan Williams knew the <a href="Savoy%20operas">Savoy operas</a> well, and his music for this piece was and is widely regarded as in the <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sullivan</a> vein. The words, by an inexperienced librettist, were judged to fall far short of <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">Gilbert</a>'s standards. Saylor sums up the critical consensus that the work is something between "a frothy romantic comedy [and] a satirical fairy-tale", and not quite successful in either category.
"Job: A Masque for Dancing" (1930) was the first large-scale ballet by a modern British composer. Vaughan Williams's liking for long "tableaux", however disadvantageous in his operas, worked to successful effect in this ballet. The work is inspired by <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>'s "<a href="William%20Blake%27s%20Illustrations%20of%20the%20Book%20of%20Job">Illustrations of the Book of Job</a>" (1826). The score is divided into nine sections and an epilogue, presenting dance interpretations of some of Blake's engravings. The work, choreographed by <a href="Ninette%20de%20Valois">Ninette de Valois</a>, made a powerful impression at its early stagings, and has been revived by the <a href="Royal%20Ballet">Royal Ballet</a> several times. Kennedy ranks the score as "one of Vaughan Williams's mightiest achievements", and notes that it is familiar in concert programmes, having "the stature and cohesion of a symphony."

In Kennedy's view the one-act "Riders to the Sea" (1925–1931, premiered 1937) is artistically Vaughan Williams's most successful opera; Saylor names "Sir John in Love" for that distinction, but rates "Riders to the Sea" as one of the composer's finest works in any genre. It is an almost verbatim setting of <a href="J.%20M.%20Synge">J. M. Synge</a>'s 1902 play of the same name, depicting family tragedy in an Irish fishing village. Kennedy describes the score as "organized almost symphonically" with much of the thematic material developed from the brief prelude. The orchestration is subtle, and foreshadows the ghostly finale of the Sixth Symphony; there are also pre-echoes of the "Sinfonia antartica" in the lamenting voices of the women and in the sound of the sea.

"The Bridal Day" (1938–1939) is a masque, to a scenario by Ursula, combining voice, mime and dance, first performed in 1953 on <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television. Vaughan Williams later recast it a <a href="cantata">cantata</a>, "Epithalamion" (1957).

"The Pilgrim's Progress" (1951), the composer's last opera, was the culmination of more than forty years' intermittent work on the theme of Bunyan's religious allegory. Vaughan Williams had written incidental music for an amateur dramatisation in 1906, and had returned to the theme in 1921 with the one-act "The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains" (finally incorporated, with amendments, into the 1951 opera). The work has been criticised for a preponderance of slow music and stretches lacking in dramatic action, but some commentators believe the work to be one of Vaughan Williams's supreme achievements. Summaries of the music vary from "beautiful, if something of a stylistic jumble" (Saylor) to "a synthesis of Vaughan Williams's stylistic progress over the years, from the pastoral mediation of the 1920s to the angry music of the middle symphonies and eventually the more experimental phase of the "Sinfonia antartica" in his last decade" (Kennedy).

Vaughan Williams conducted a handful of recordings for gramophone and radio. His studio recordings are the overture to "The Wasps", and the ballet "Old King Cole" (both made in 1925), "Dona Nobis Pacem" (1936), and the Fourth Symphony (1937). Live concert tapings include the "Serenade to Music", and the Fifth Symphony, recorded in 1951 and 1952, respectively. There is a recording of Vaughan Williams conducting the "St Matthew Passion" with his Leith Hill Festival forces. In the early days of LP in the 1950s Vaughan Williams was better represented in the record catalogues than most British composers. "The Record Guide" (1955) contained nine pages of listings of his music on disc, compared with five for <a href="William%20Walton">Walton</a>, and four apiece for Elgar and Britten.

All the composer's major works and many of the minor ones have been recorded. There have been numerous complete LP and CD sets of the nine symphonies, beginning with Boult's <a href="Decca%20Classics">Decca</a> cycle of the 1950s, most of which was recorded in the composer's presence. Although rarely staged, the operas have fared well on disc. The earliest recording of a Vaughan Williams opera was "Hugh the Drover", in an abridged version conducted by Sargent in 1924. Since the 1960s there have been stereophonic recordings of "Hugh the Drover", "Sir John in Love", "Riders to the Sea", "The Poisoned Kiss", and "The Pilgrim's Progress". Most of the orchestral recordings have been by British orchestras and conductors, but notable non-British conductors who have made recordings of Vaughan Williams's works include <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>, <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a>, and, most frequently, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a>, who conducted the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> in the first complete stereo cycle of the symphonies, recorded between 1967 and 1972. Among the British conductors most closely associated with Vaughan Williams's music on disc and in concert in the generations after Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli are <a href="Vernon%20Handley">Vernon Handley</a>, <a href="Richard%20Hickox">Richard Hickox</a>, <a href="Mark%20Elder">Sir Mark Elder</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Davis%20%28conductor%29">Sir Andrew Davis</a>. Record companies with extensive lists of Vaughan Williams recordings include <a href="EMI%20Classics">EMI</a>, Decca, <a href="Chandos%20Records">Chandos</a>, <a href="Hyperion%20Records">Hyperion</a> and <a href="Naxos%20Records">Naxos</a>.

Vaughan Williams refused a <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighthood</a> at least once, and declined the post of <a href="Master%20of%20the%20King%27s%20Music">Master of the King's Music</a> after Elgar's death. The one state honour he accepted was the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> in 1935, which confers no prenominal title: he preferred to remain "Dr Vaughan Williams". His academic and musical honours included an honorary doctorate of music from the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> (1919); the <a href="Walter%20Willson%20Cobbett">Cobbett</a> medal for services to chamber music (1930); the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society (1930); the Collard life fellowship of the Worshipful Company of Musicians (1934, in succession to Elgar); an honorary fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge (1935); the <a href="Shakespeare%20Prize">Shakespeare prize</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Hamburg">University of Hamburg</a> (1937); the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts%29">Albert medal</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> (1955); and the <a href="Howland%20Memorial%20Prize">Howland memorial prize</a> of Yale University (1954).

At the time of his death Vaughan Williams was President of the <a href="English%20Folk%20Dance%20and%20Song%20Society">English Folk Dance and Song Society</a>, who renamed their library the <a href="Vaughan%20Williams%20Memorial%20Library">Vaughan Williams Memorial Library</a> in his honour.

After Vaughan Williams's death, "The Times" summed up his legacy in a <a href="editorial">leading article</a>:

The Royal College of Music commissioned an official portrait of the composer from <a href="Gerald%20Kelly">Sir Gerald Kelly</a> (1952) which hangs in the college. The <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a> has a bronze sculpture of Vaughan Williams by Epstein (1952) and the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Portrait Gallery</a> (NPG) has drawings by Joyce Finzi (1947) and <a href="Juliet%20Pannett">Juliet Pannett</a> (1957 and 1958); versions of a bronze head of the composer by <a href="David%20McFall">David McFall</a> (1956) are in the NPG and at the entrance to the Music reading room of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>. There is a statue of Vaughan Williams in Dorking, and a bust in <a href="Chelsea%20Embankment">Chelsea Embankment Gardens</a>, near his old house in Cheyne Walk.

In 1994 a group of enthusiasts founded the Ralph Vaughan Williams Society, with the composer's widow as its president and Roy Douglas and Michael Kennedy as vice presidents. The society, a <a href="Charitable%20organization">registered charity</a>, has sponsored and encouraged performances of the composer's works including complete symphony cycles and a Vaughan Williams opera festival. The society has promoted premieres of neglected works, and has its own record label, Albion Records.

Composers of the generation after Vaughan Williams reacted against his style, which became unfashionable in influential musical circles in the 1960s; <a href="diatonic">diatonic</a> and melodic music such as his was neglected in favour of <a href="atonal">atonal</a> and other modernist compositions. In the 21st century this neglect has been reversed. In the fiftieth anniversary year of his death two contrasting documentary films were released: <a href="Tony%20Palmer">Tony Palmer</a>'s "O Thou Transcendent: The Life of Vaughan Williams" and <a href="John%20Bridcut">John Bridcut</a>'s "The Passions of Vaughan Williams". British audiences were prompted to reappraise the composer. The popularity of his most accessible works, particularly the "Tallis Fantasia" and "The Lark Ascending" increased, but a wide public also became aware of what a reviewer of Bridcut's film called "a genius driven by emotion". Among the 21st-century musicians who have acknowledged Vaughan Williams's influence on their development are <a href="John%20Adams%20%28composer%29">John Adams</a>, <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a>, <a href="Peter%20Maxwell%20Davies">Sir Peter Maxwell Davies</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Payne">Anthony Payne</a>, <a href="Wayne%20Shorter">Wayne Shorter</a>, <a href="Neil%20Tennant">Neil Tennant</a> and <a href="Mark-Anthony%20Turnage">Mark-Anthony Turnage</a>.

The Clements Park development, located in <a href="Warley%2C%20Essex">Warley, Brentwood, Essex</a>, has roads taking their names after the composer and his works, the most obvious being the main road "Vaughan Williams Way" which runs through the development. Vaughan Williams lectured in Brentwood on folk music, and collected 140 songs from villages in the region.

Willamette River

The Willamette River ( ) is a major <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> is long, lying entirely in northwestern <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> in the United States. Flowing northward between the <a href="Oregon%20Coast%20Range">Oregon Coast Range</a> and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>, the river and its tributaries form the <a href="Willamette%20Valley">Willamette Valley</a>, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem</a>, and the state's largest city, <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia.

Originally created by <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a> about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> and erosion, the river's <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> was significantly modified by the <a href="Missoula%20Floods">Missoula Floods</a> at the end of the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">most recent ice age</a>. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well.

Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a>. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although <a href="Willamette%20Falls">Willamette Falls</a>, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges.

Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a>, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of <a href="salmon">salmon</a> and <a href="trout">trout</a>; this is despite the dams, other alterations, and pollution (especially on the river's lower reaches). Part of the <a href="Willamette%20Floodplain">Willamette Floodplain</a> was established as a <a href="National%20Natural%20Landmark">National Natural Landmark</a> in 1987 and the river was named as one of 14 <a href="American%20Heritage%20Rivers">American Heritage Rivers</a> in 1998.

The upper tributaries of the Willamette originate in the mountains south and southeast of <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>. Formed by the confluence of the <a href="Middle%20Fork%20Willamette%20River">Middle Fork Willamette River</a> and the <a href="Coast%20Fork%20Willamette%20River">Coast Fork Willamette River</a> near <a href="Springfield%2C%20Oregon">Springfield</a>, the <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> Willamette meanders generally north for to the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>. The river's two most significant course deviations occur at <a href="Newberg%2C%20Oregon">Newberg</a>, where it turns sharply east, and about downstream from Newberg, where it turns north again. Near its mouth north of downtown <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, the river splits into two channels that flow around <a href="Sauvie%20Island">Sauvie Island</a>. Used for navigation purposes, these channels are managed by the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. federal government</a>. The main channel, which is deep and varies in width from (although the river broadens to in some of its lower reaches), enters the Columbia about from the larger river's mouth on the Pacific Ocean. The channel forms the primary navigational conduit for Portland's harbor and riverside industrial areas. The smaller <a href="Multnomah%20Channel">Multnomah Channel</a>, a <a href="distributary">distributary</a>, is long, about wide, and deep. It ends about further downstream on the Columbia, near <a href="St.%20Helens%2C%20Oregon">St. Helens</a> in <a href="Columbia%20County%2C%20Oregon">Columbia County</a>.

Proposals have been made for deepening the Multnomah Channel to in conjunction with roughly of tandem-maintained navigation on the Columbia River. Between the 1850s and the 1960s, channel-straightening and flood control projects, as well as agricultural and urban encroachment, cut the length of the river between the McKenzie River confluence and Harrisburg by 65 percent. Similarly, the river was shortened by 40 percent in the stretch between Harrisburg and Albany.

<a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Oregon">Interstate 5</a> and three branches of <a href="Oregon%20Route%2099">Oregon Route 99</a> are the two major highways that follow the river for its entire length. Communities along the main stem include Springfield and Eugene in <a href="Lane%20County%2C%20Oregon">Lane County</a>; <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Oregon">Harrisburg</a> in <a href="Linn%20County%2C%20Oregon">Linn County</a>; <a href="Corvallis%2C%20Oregon">Corvallis</a> in <a href="Benton%20County%2C%20Oregon">Benton County</a>; <a href="Albany%2C%20Oregon">Albany</a> in Linn and Benton counties; <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem</a> in <a href="Marion%20County%2C%20Oregon">Marion County</a>; Newberg in <a href="Yamhill%20County%2C%20Oregon">Yamhill County</a>; <a href="Oregon%20City%2C%20Oregon">Oregon City</a>, <a href="West%20Linn%2C%20Oregon">West Linn</a>, <a href="Milwaukie%2C%20Oregon">Milwaukie</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Oswego%2C%20Oregon">Lake Oswego</a> in <a href="Clackamas%20County%2C%20Oregon">Clackamas County</a>; and Portland in Multnomah and <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Oregon">Washington</a> counties. Significant tributaries from source to mouth include the Middle and Coast forks and the <a href="McKenzie%20River%20%28Oregon%29">McKenzie</a>, <a href="Long%20Tom%20River">Long Tom</a>, <a href="Marys%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Marys</a>, <a href="Calapooia%20River">Calapooia</a>, <a href="Santiam%20River">Santiam</a>, <a href="Luckiamute%20River">Luckiamute</a>, <a href="Yamhill%20River">Yamhill</a>, <a href="Molalla%20River">Molalla</a>, <a href="Tualatin%20River">Tualatin</a>, and <a href="Clackamas%20River">Clackamas</a> rivers.

Beginning at above sea level, the main stem descends between source and mouth, or about 2.3 feet per mile (0.4 m per km). The gradient is slightly steeper from the source to Albany than it is from Albany to Oregon City. At <a href="Willamette%20Falls">Willamette Falls</a>, between West Linn and Oregon City, the river plunges about . For the rest of its course, the river is extremely low-gradient and is affected by Pacific Ocean tidal effects from the Columbia. The main stem of the Willamette varies in width from about .

With an average flow at the mouth of about , the Willamette ranks 19th in volume among rivers in the United States and contributes 12 to 15 percent of the total flow of the Columbia River. The Willamette's flow varies considerably season to season, averaging about in August to more than in December.

The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">U.S. Geological Survey</a> (USGS) operates five <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a>s along the river, at Harrisburg, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, and Portland. The average discharge at the lowermost gauge, near the Morrison Bridge in Portland, was between 1972 and 2013. Located at <a href="river%20mile">river mile</a> (RM) 12.8 or river kilometer (RK) 20.6, the gauge measures the flow from an area of , roughly 97 percent of the Willamette basin. The highest flow recorded at this station was on February 9, 1996, during the <a href="Willamette%20Valley%20Flood%20of%201996">Willamette Valley Flood of 1996</a>, and the minimum was on July 10, 1978. The highest recorded flow of for the Willamette at a different gauge in Portland occurred during a <a href="Great%20Flood%20of%201862">flood in 1861</a>. This and many other large flows preceded the <a href="Flood%20Control%20Act%20of%201936">Flood Control Act of 1936</a> and dam construction on the Willamette's major tributaries.

The river below Willamette Falls, from the mouth, is affected by <a href="tide">semidiurnal tides</a>, and gauges have detected reverse flows (backwards river flows) upstream from <a href="Ross%20Island%20%28Oregon%29">Ross Island</a> at RM 15 (RK 24). The <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> issues tide forecasts for the river at the <a href="Morrison%20Bridge">Morrison Bridge</a>.

The Willamette River basin was created primarily by <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a> and <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> and was altered by erosion and sedimentation, including some related to enormous glacial floods as recent as 13,000 years ago. The initial trough-like configuration was created about 35 million years ago as a <a href="forearc">forearc</a> basin while the <a href="Pacific%20Plate">Pacific Plate</a> <a href="subduction">subducted</a> beneath the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a>. Marine deposits on top of older volcanics underlie the valley, which was initially part of the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>, rather than a separate inland sea. About 20 to 16 million years ago, uplift formed the Coast Range and separated the basin from the Pacific Ocean.

<a href="Basalt">Basalt</a>s of the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Basalt%20Group">Columbia River Basalt Group</a>, from eruptions in <a href="eastern%20Oregon">eastern Oregon</a>, flowed across large parts of the northern half of the basin about 15 million years ago. They covered the <a href="Tualatin%20Mountains">Tualatin Mountains</a> (West Hills), most of the <a href="Tualatin%20Valley">Tualatin Valley</a>, and the slopes of hills further south, with up to of <a href="lava">lava</a>. Later depositions covered the basalt with up to of silt in the Portland and Tualatin basins. During the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, beginning roughly 2.5 million years ago, volcanic activity in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascades</a> combined with a cool, moist climate to produce further heavy sedimentation across the basin; <a href="braided%20river">braided river</a>s created <a href="alluvial%20fan">alluvial fan</a>s spreading down from the east.

Between about 15,500 and 13,000 years ago, the <a href="Missoula%20Floods">Missoula Floods</a>—a series of large outpourings originating at <a href="Glacial%20Lake%20Missoula">Glacial Lake Missoula</a> in Montana—swept down the Columbia River and backfilled the Willamette watershed. Each flood produced "discharges that exceeded the annual discharge of all the present-day rivers of the world combined". Filling the Willamette basin to depths of in the Portland region, each flood created a temporary lake, <a href="Lake%20Allison">Lake Allison</a>, that stretched from Lake Oswego to near Eugene. The ancestral Tualatin Valley, part of the Willamette basin, flooded as well; water depths ranged from at Lake Oswego to as far upstream (west) as <a href="Forest%20Grove%2C%20Oregon">Forest Grove</a>. Flood deposits of silt and clay, ranging in thickness from in the north to about in the south, settled from this muddy water to form today's valley floor. The floods carried Montana icebergs well into the basin, where they melted and dropped <a href="glacial%20erratic">glacial erratic</a>s on the land's surface. These rocks, composed of granite and other materials common to central Montana but not to the <a href="Willamette%20Valley">Willamette Valley</a>, include more than 40 boulders, each at least in diameter. Before being partly chipped away and removed, the largest of these originally weighed about .

The northern part of the watershed is underlain by a network of <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a> capable of producing earthquakes at any time, and many small quakes have been recorded in the basin since the mid-19th century. In 1993, the <a href="1993%20Scotts%20Mills%20earthquake">Scotts Mills earthquake</a>—the largest recent earthquake in the valley, measuring 5.6 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter scale</a>—was centered near <a href="Scotts%20Mills%2C%20Oregon">Scotts Mills</a>, about south of Portland. It caused $30 million in damage, including harm to the <a href="Oregon%20State%20Capitol">Oregon State Capitol</a> in Salem. Evidence suggests that massive quakes of 8 or more on the Richter scale have occurred historically in the <a href="Cascadia%20subduction%20zone">Cascadia subduction zone</a> off the Oregon coast, most recently in <a href="1700%20Cascadia%20earthquake">1700 CE</a>, and that others as strong as 9 on the Richter scale occur every 500 to 800 years. The basin's high population density, its nearness to this subduction zone, and its loose soils, which tend to amplify shaking, make the Willamette Valley especially vulnerable to damage from strong earthquakes.

The Willamette River drains a region of , which is 12 percent of the total area of Oregon. Bounded by the Coast Range to the west and the Cascade Range to the east, the river basin is about long and wide. Elevations within the watershed range from at <a href="Mount%20Jefferson%20%28Oregon%29">Mount Jefferson</a> in the Cascade Range to at the mouth on the Columbia River. Watersheds bordering the Willamette River basin are those of the <a href="Little%20Deschutes%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Little Deschutes River</a> to the southeast, the <a href="Deschutes%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Deschutes River</a> to the east, and the <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy River</a> to the northeast; the <a href="North%20Umpqua%20River">North Umpqua</a> and <a href="Umpqua%20River">Umpqua</a> rivers to the south; coastal rivers including (from south to north) the <a href="Siuslaw%20River">Siuslaw</a>, the <a href="Alsea%20River">Alsea</a>, the <a href="Yaquina%20River">Yaquina</a>, the <a href="Siletz%20River">Siletz</a>, the <a href="Nestucca%20River">Nestucca</a>, the <a href="Trask%20River">Trask</a>, and the <a href="Wilson%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Wilson</a> to the west; the <a href="Nehalem%20River">Nehalem</a> and the <a href="Clatskanie%20River">Clatskanie</a> to the northwest, and the Columbia River to the north.

About 2.5 million people lived in the Willamette River basin as of 2010, about 65 percent of the population of Oregon. As of 2009, the basin contained 20 of the 25 most populous cities in Oregon. These cities include Springfield, Eugene, Corvallis, Albany, Salem, Keizer, Newberg, Oregon City, West Linn, Milwaukie, Lake Oswego, and Portland. The largest is Portland, with more than 500,000 residents. Not all of these cities draw water directly from the Willamette for their municipal water supply. Other cities in the watershed (but not on the main-stem river) with populations of 20,000 or more are Gresham, Hillsboro, Beaverton, Tigard, McMinnville, Tualatin, <a href="Woodburn%2C%20Oregon">Woodburn</a>, and Forest Grove.

Sixty-four percent of the watershed is privately owned, while 36 percent is publicly owned. The <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> manages 30 percent of the watershed, the U.S. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> 5 percent, and the State of Oregon 1 percent. Sixty-eight percent of the watershed is forested; agriculture, concentrated in the Willamette Valley, makes up 19 percent, and urban areas cover 5 percent. More than of roads criss-cross the watershed.

In 1987, the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">U.S. Secretary of the Interior</a> designated of the watershed in Benton County as a <a href="National%20Natural%20Landmark">National Natural Landmark</a>. This area is the <a href="Willamette%20Floodplain">Willamette Floodplain</a>, the largest remaining unplowed native grassland in the North Pacific geologic province, which encompasses most of the Pacific Northwest coast.

For at least 10,000 years, a variety of indigenous peoples populated the Willamette Valley. These included the <a href="Kalapuya%20people">Kalapuya</a>, the <a href="Chinook%20people">Chinook</a>, and the <a href="Clackamas%20people">Clackamas</a>. The territory of the Clackamas encompassed the northeastern portion of the basin, including the Clackamas River (with which their name is shared). Although it is unclear exactly when, the territory of the Chinook once extended across the northern part of the watershed, through the Columbia River valley. Indigenous peoples of the Willamette Valley were further divided into groups including the <a href="Kalapuyan%20languages">Kalapuyan-speaking</a> <a href="Yamhill%20%28tribe%29">Yamhill</a> and <a href="Atfalati">Atfalati (Tualatin)</a> (both Northern Kalapuya), Central Kalapuya like the <a href="Santiam%20people">Santiam</a>, Muddy Creek (Chemapho), Long Tom (Chelamela), Calapooia (Tsankupi), Marys River (Chepenafa) and Luckiamute, and the <a href="Yoncalla%20language">Yoncalla</a> or Southern Kalapuya, as well other tribes such as the Chuchsney-Tufti, <a href="Siuslaw%20people">Siuslaw</a> and <a href="Molala">Molala</a>. The name "Willamette" is of indigenous origin, deriving from the French pronunciation of the name of a Clackamas Native American village. However, Native American languages in Oregon were very similar, so the name may also be derived from <a href="Kalapuyan%20languages">Kalapuya dialects</a>.<ref name="RG 3/18/10"></ref>

Around the year 1850, the Kalapuya numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; there may have been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">U.S. Census Bureau</a> estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both the north and the south side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley. The total native population was estimated at about 15,000.

The indigenous peoples of the Willamette River practiced a variety of life ways. Those on the lower river, slightly closer to the coast, often relied on fishing as their primary economic mainstay. <a href="Salmon">Salmon</a> was the most important fish to Willamette River tribes as well as to the Native Americans of the Columbia River, where white traders traded fish with the Native Americans. Upper-river tribes caught <a href="Rainbow%20trout">steelhead</a> and salmon, often by building <a href="weir">weir</a>s across tributary streams. Tribes of the northern Willamette Valley practiced a generally settled lifestyle. The Chinooks lived in great <a href="Plank%20house">wooden lodges</a>, practiced <a href="slavery">slavery</a>, and had a well-defined <a href="caste">caste</a> system. People of the south were more nomadic, traveling from place to place with the seasons. They were known for the controlled burning of woodlands to create meadows for hunting and plant gathering (especially <a href="Camassia">camas</a>).

The Willamette River first appears in the records of outsiders in 1792, when it was seen by British Lieutenant <a href="William%20Robert%20Broughton">William Robert Broughton</a> of the <a href="Vancouver%20Expedition">Vancouver Expedition</a>, led by <a href="George%20Vancouver">George Vancouver</a>. From the 18th to the mid-19th century, much of the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> and most of its rivers were involved in the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>, in which fur trappers (mostly <a href="French-Canadian">French-Canadian</a>s working for the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> and the <a href="North%20West%20Company">North West Company</a>, which later merged) hunted for <a href="beaver">beaver</a> and <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a> on rivers, streams, and coastlines. The pelts of these animals commanded substantial prices in either the United States, Canada or eastern Asia, because of their "thick, luxurious and water-repellent" qualities.

Fur traders heavily exploited the Willamette River and its tributaries. During this period, the <a href="Siskiyou%20Trail">Siskiyou Trail</a> (or California-Oregon Trail) was created. This trading path, over long, stretched from the mouth of the Willamette River near present-day Portland south through the Willamette Valley, crossing the Cascades and the <a href="Siskiyou%20Mountains">Siskiyou Mountains</a>, and south through the <a href="Sacramento%20Valley">Sacramento Valley</a> to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>.

In 1805, the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> traveled thousands of miles across central North America in an attempt to map and explore the <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">Louisiana Territory</a> of the United States and the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a>, which were then occupied mainly by Native Americans and settlers from Great Britain. As the expedition traveled down and back up the Columbia River, it missed the mouth of the Willamette, one of the Columbia's largest tributaries. It was only after receiving directions from natives along the <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy River</a> that the explorers learned about their oversight. <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark</a> returned down the Columbia and entered the Willamette River in April 1806. The <a href="United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition">United States Exploring Expedition</a> passed through the Willamette Valley in 1841 while traveling along the Siskiyou Trail. The expedition members noted extensive salmon fishing by natives at Willamette Falls, much like that at <a href="Celilo%20Falls">Celilo Falls</a> on the Columbia River.

In the middle part of the 19th century, the Willamette Valley's fertile soils, pleasant climate, and abundant water attracted thousands of settlers from the <a href="eastern%20United%20States">eastern United States</a>, mainly the <a href="Upland%20South">Upland South</a> borderlands of Missouri, Iowa, and the Ohio Valley. Many of these emigrants followed the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a>, a trail across western North America that began at <a href="Independence%2C%20Missouri">Independence, Missouri</a>, and ended at various locations near the mouth of the Willamette River. Although people had been traveling to Oregon since 1836, large-scale migration did not begin until 1843, when nearly 1,000 pioneers headed westward. Over the next 25 years, some 500,000 settlers traveled the Oregon Trail, braving the rapids of the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake</a> and Columbia Rivers to reach the Willamette Valley.

Starting in the 1820s, <a href="Oregon%20City">Oregon City</a> developed near Willamette Falls. It was incorporated in 1844, becoming the first city west of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> to have that distinction. <a href="John%20McLoughlin">John McLoughlin</a>, a Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) official, was one of the major contributors to the founding of the town in 1829. McLoughlin attempted to persuade the British government (which still held sway over the area) to allow American settlers to live on the land, and provided significant help to American colonization of the area, all against the HBC's orders. Oregon City prospered because of the <a href="paper%20mill">paper mill</a>s that were run by the water power of Willamette Falls, but the falls formed an impassable barrier to river navigation. <a href="Linn%20City%2C%20Oregon">Linn City</a> (originally Robins Nest) was established across the Willamette from Oregon City.

After Portland was incorporated in 1851, quickly growing into Oregon's largest city, Oregon City gradually lost its importance as the economic and political center of the Willamette Valley. Beginning in the 1850s, <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a>s began to ply the Willamette, despite the fact that they could not pass Willamette Falls. As a result, navigation on the Willamette River was divided into two stretches: the lower stretch from Portland to Oregon City—which allowed connection with the rest of the Columbia River system—and the upper reach, which encompassed most of the Willamette's length. Any boats whose owners found it absolutely necessary to get past the falls had to be <a href="portage">portage</a>d. This led to competition for business among steam portage companies. In 1873, the construction of the <a href="Willamette%20Falls%20Locks">Willamette Falls Locks</a> bypassed the falls and allowed easy navigation between the upper and lower river. Each lock chamber measured long and wide, and the canal was originally operated manually before it switched to electrical power. Today, the lock system is little used.

As commerce and industry flourished on the lower river, most of the original settlers acquired farms in the upper Willamette Valley. By the late 1850s, farmers had begun to grow crops on most of the available fertile land. The settlers increasingly encroached on Native American lands. Skirmishes between natives and settlers in the Umpqua and <a href="Rogue%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Rogue</a> valleys to the southwest of the Willamette River led the <a href="Government%20of%20Oregon">Oregon state government</a> to remove the natives by military force. They were first led off their traditional lands to the Willamette Valley, but soon were marched to the <a href="Coast%20Indian%20Reservation">Coast Indian Reservation</a>. In 1855, <a href="Joel%20Palmer">Joel Palmer</a>, an Oregon legislator, negotiated a treaty with the Willamette Valley tribes, who, although unhappy with the treaty, ceded their lands to non-natives. The natives were then relocated by the government to a part of the Coast Reservation that later became the <a href="Grande%20Ronde%20Reservation">Grande Ronde Reservation</a>.

Between 1879 and 1885, the Willamette River was charted by <a href="Cleveland%20S.%20Rockwell">Cleveland S. Rockwell</a>, a topographical engineer and cartographer for the <a href="U.S.%20National%20Geodetic%20Survey">U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey</a>. Rockwell surveyed the lower Willamette from the foot of <a href="Ross%20Island%20%28Oregon%29">Ross Island</a> through Portland to the Columbia River and then downstream on the Columbia to <a href="Bachelor%20Island%20%28Washington%29">Bachelor Island</a>. Rockwell's survey was extremely detailed, including 17,782 hydrographic soundings. His work helped open the port of Portland to commerce.

In the second half of the 19th century, the USACE dredged channels and built locks and levees in the Willamette's watershed. Although products such as lumber were often transported on an existing network of railroads in Oregon, these advances in navigation helped businesses deliver more goods to Portland, feeding the city's growing economy. Trade goods from the Columbia basin north of Portland could also be transported southward on the Willamette due to the deeper channels made at the Willamette's mouth.

By the early 20th century, major river-control projects had begun to take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.

With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor <a href="Tom%20McCall">Tom McCall</a> led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by <a href="Robert%20W.%20Straub">Robert (Bob) Straub</a>—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a <a href="Willamette%20Greenway">Willamette Greenway</a> program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an <a href="American%20Heritage%20River">American Heritage River</a> by former U.S. President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.

In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit <a href="Willamette%20Riverkeeper">Willamette Riverkeeper</a> organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> added the Willamette water trail—expanded to to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of <a href="National%20Recreation%20Trail">national water trails</a>. The water-trail system is meant to protect and restore waterways in the United States and to enhance recreation on and near them.

A 1991 agreement between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce <a href="combined%20sewer">combined sewer</a> overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's <a href="West%20Side%20CSO%20Tunnel">Big Pipe Project</a>. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 at a cost of $1.44 billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater treatment plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94 percent.

In June 2014, Dean Hall became the first person to swim the entire length of the Willamette River. He swam from Eugene to the river mouth in 25 days.

There are more than 20 major dams on the Willamette's tributaries, as well as a complex series of levees, dikes, and channels to control the river's flow.

The only dam on the Willamette's main stem is the <a href="Willamette%20Falls">Willamette Falls</a> Dam, a low <a href="weir">weir</a>-type structure at Willamette Falls that diverts water into the headraces of the adjacent mills and a power plant. The <a href="Willamette%20Falls%20Locks">locks at Willamette Falls</a> were completed in 1873. Elsewhere on the main stem, numerous minor flow-regulation structures force the river into a narrower and deeper channel to facilitate navigation and flood control.

The dams on the Willamette's major tributaries are primarily large flood-control, water storage, and power-generating dams. Thirteen of these dams were built from the 1940s through the 1960s to be operated by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> (USACE), and 11 of those produce hydropower. Flood-control dams operated by the USACE are estimated to hold up to 27 percent of the Willamette's runoff. They are used to regulate river flows so as to cut peaks off floods and increase low flows in late summer and autumn, and to divert water into deeper, narrower channels to prevent flooding. In addition, a relatively small of amount of the water stored in the reservoirs is used for irrigation.
<a href="Detroit%20Dam">Detroit Dam</a> on the <a href="North%20Santiam%20River">North Santiam River</a> is the second tallest dam in the Willamette River basin after <a href="Cougar%20Dam">Cougar Dam</a>. It is high and stores of water. <a href="Lookout%20Point%20Dam">Lookout Point Dam</a> on the <a href="Middle%20Fork%20Willamette%20River">Middle Fork Willamette River</a>, forming <a href="Lookout%20Point%20Lake">Lookout Point Lake</a>, has the largest water storage capacity, at . The other 11 dams are <a href="Big%20Cliff%20Dam">Big Cliff</a> on the North Santiam River; <a href="Green%20Peter%20Dam">Green Peter</a> and <a href="Foster%20Dam">Foster</a> on the <a href="Santiam%20River">Santiam River</a>; Cougar on the <a href="South%20Fork%20McKenzie%20River">South Fork McKenzie River</a>; <a href="Blue%20River%20Reservoir">Blue River</a> on the <a href="Blue%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Blue River</a>; <a href="Fern%20Ridge%20Reservoir">Fern Ridge</a> on the <a href="Long%20Tom%20River">Long Tom River</a>; <a href="Hills%20Creek%20Dam">Hills Creek</a>, <a href="Dexter%20Reservoir">Dexter</a> on the Middle Fork Willamette River; <a href="Fall%20Creek%20Dam">Fall Creek</a> on <a href="Fall%20Creek%20%28Middle%20Fork%20Willamette%20River%29">Fall Creek</a>; <a href="Cottage%20Grove%20Dam">Cottage Grove</a> on the <a href="Coast%20Fork%20Willamette%20River">Coast Fork Willamette River</a>, and <a href="Dorena%20Reservoir">Dorena</a> on the <a href="Row%20River">Row River</a>.

A continuing controversy about these high dams involves <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook salmon</a> and <a href="Rainbow%20trout">steelhead</a> blocked from roughly half of their historic habitat and <a href="spawn%20%28biology%29">spawning</a> grounds on the Willamette's major tributaries. Unable to survive and reproduce as they once did, they have been "brought to the brink of extinction". Endangered species listings and a subsequent lawsuit by Willamette Riverkeeper led to a plan to improve fish passage and other actions to help native fish recover in 2008. Since then, work has proceeded slowly, and the Corps, citing engineering difficulties and cost, may not meet the original agreed-upon deadline of 2023 for a system of effective remedies.

Other major dams in the Willamette watershed are owned by other interests; for example, several hydroelectric facilities on the <a href="Clackamas%20River">Clackamas River</a> are owned by <a href="Portland%20General%20Electric">Portland General Electric</a>. They include the <a href="River%20Mill%20Hydroelectric%20Project">River Mill Hydroelectric Project</a>, the <a href="Oak%20Grove%20Hydroelectric%20Project">Oak Grove</a> project, and the dam at <a href="Timothy%20Lake">Timothy Lake</a>.

The 50 or so <a href="List%20of%20crossings%20of%20the%20Willamette%20River">crossings</a> of the Willamette River include many historic structures, such as the <a href="Van%20Buren%20Street%20Bridge">Van Buren Street Bridge</a>, a <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a>. Built in 1913, it carries <a href="Oregon%20Route%2034">Oregon Route 34</a> (Corvallis–Lebanon Highway) over the river upstream of RM 131 (RK 211) in Corvallis. The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s. The <a href="Oregon%20City%20Bridge">Oregon City Bridge</a>, built in 1922, replaced a <a href="Suspension%20bridge">suspension span</a> constructed at the site in 1888. It carries <a href="Oregon%20Route%2043">Oregon Route 43</a> over the river at about RM 26 (RK 42) between Oregon City and <a href="West%20Linn%2C%20Oregon">West Linn</a>.

The <a href="Ross%20Island%20Bridge">Ross Island Bridge</a> carries <a href="U.S.%20Route%2026%20in%20Oregon">U.S. Route 26</a> (<a href="Mount%20Hood%20Highway">Mount Hood Highway</a>) over the river at RM 14 (RK 23). It is one of 10 highway bridges crossing the river in Portland. The bridge is the only <a href="Cantilever%20bridge">cantilevered deck truss</a> in Oregon.

<a href="Tilikum%20Crossing">Tilikum Crossing</a> is a <a href="cable-stayed%20bridge">cable-stayed bridge</a> that carries public transit, bicycles, and pedestrians, but no cars or trucks, over the river. It opened for general use on September 12, 2015, becoming the first new bridge built across the river in the <a href="Portland%20metropolitan%20area">Portland metropolitan area</a> since 1973.

Further downstream is the oldest remaining highway structure over the Willamette, the <a href="Hawthorne%20Bridge">Hawthorne Bridge</a>, built in 1910. It is the oldest vertical-lift bridge in operation in the United States and the oldest highway bridge in Portland. It is also the busiest bicycle and <a href="Transportation%20in%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">transit</a> bridge in Oregon, with over 8,000 cyclists and 800 <a href="TriMet">TriMet</a> buses (carrying about 17,400 riders) daily.
Another historic structure, the <a href="Steel%20Bridge">Steel Bridge</a>, further downstream, was "the largest telescoping bridge in the world at the time of its opening" in 1912. It carries trains on its lower deck, <a href="MAX%20Light%20Rail">MAX</a> (Metropolitan Area Express) <a href="light-rail">light-rail</a> trains and motorized vehicles on its upper deck, and foot and bicycle traffic on a cantilevered walkway attached to the lower deck. When small ships must pass under the bridge, its double vertical-lift span can raise a lower railway deck without disturbing traffic on the upper deck. Operators can raise both decks as high as above the water. The Steel Bridge is "believed to be the world's only double-lift span that can raise its lower deck independently of the upper deck."

The <a href="Broadway%20Bridge%20%28Portland%2C%20Oregon%29">Broadway Bridge</a>, slightly downstream of the Steel Bridge, was the world's longest double-leaf <a href="Bascule%20bridge">bascule</a> drawbridge at the time of its construction in 1913. Further downstream, the <a href="St.%20Johns%20Bridge">St. Johns Bridge</a>, a steel suspension bridge built in 1931, replaced the last of the Willamette River <a href="ferry">ferries</a> in Portland. At about RM 6 (RK 10), it carries the <a href="Special%20routes%20of%20U.S.%20Route%2030%23Portland%20bypass">U.S. Route 30 Bypass</a>. The bridge has two <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic towers</a> supporting the span. The adjacent park and neighborhood of <a href="Cathedral%20Park%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Cathedral Park</a> are named after the <a href="Gothic%20Cathedral">Gothic Cathedral</a>-like appearance of the bridge towers. It is the tallest bridge in Portland, with tall towers and a navigational clearance.

Due to the volume and seasonality of precipitation in western Oregon, the Willamette River has often flooded. Heavy rains and mountain snows are common in winter, and snowpack in the Cascade Range can rapidly melt during warmer winter storms. The greatest Willamette River flood in recorded history began in 1861, well before the construction of dams in the watershed.

Rainstorms and warm temperatures in December 1861 combined with a well-above-average snowpack in the Cascades created the largest Willamette River flood in recorded history. An observer of the flood wrote, "The whole Willamette valley was a sheet of water". From Eugene to Portland, thousands of acres of farmland were washed away, and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed. The "<a href="Great%20Flood%20of%201862">Great Flood</a>", as it is sometimes called, was massively destructive to human development because most of that development was located on the river's floodplain, which provided rich soils and ready access to water transportation. The 1861 flood peaked at —more than the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> usually discharges in the 21st century—and inundated some of land. This flood destroyed the town of <a href="Linn%20City%2C%20Oregon">Linn City</a>. When the flood ended on December 14, only three homes remained standing in Linn City. No one died in the Linn City flood, but the destruction was too significant for the town to recover, and it was abandoned. Today the city of <a href="West%20Linn%2C%20Oregon">West Linn</a> stands about where Linn City once was.

Significant flooding recurred in the winter of early 1890, when the river rapidly rose and crested. Portland's main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades was cut off, and many rail lines were forced to shut down. Another major flood occurred on the Willamette in 1894, and although it too caused much damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.

Throughout the 1940s the Willamette continued to flood its valley. It washed out five bridges in Lane County in December 1942, caused seven deaths in Portland and evacuations in Eugene in January 1943, flooded Corvallis in November 1946, contributed to the destruction of <a href="Vanport%20City%2C%20Oregon">Vanport City</a> and the death of about 15 of its residents in May 1948, and nearly flooded parts of Salem in December 1948.

Although the Willamette was, by the mid-20th century, heavily engineered and controlled by a complex system of dams, channels, and barriers, it experienced severe floods through the end of the century. Storms caused a <a href="Christmas%20flood%20of%201964">major flood</a> that swelled the Willamette and other rivers in the Pacific Northwest from December 1964 through January 1965, submerging nearly of land. Before dawn on December 21, 1964, the Willamette reached , which was higher than the seawall on its banks in Portland. By this time, about 15 people had died as a result of the flooding, and about 8,000 had been forced to evacuate their homes.

On December 24, 1964, President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> ordered federal aid for the flooded areas, as the Willamette continued to rise. In the next couple of days, the river receded, but on December 27, it was at , which was still nearly above the flood stage. The river continued to pose flood threats through January 1965, and more stormy weather occurred along the Pacific Coast.

In February 1996, heavy warm rains driven by a subtropical <a href="jet%20stream">jet stream</a> fell on a deep snowpack in the Willamette watershed. These conditions, similar to those that caused the 1861 flood, caused <a href="Willamette%20Valley%20Flood%20of%201996">some of the costliest flooding in the river's recorded history</a>. An <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> journalist reported, "The river crested at one town after another—at Corvallis 3½ feet above flood stage, Oregon City 18 feet above, Portland 10.5 feet above—much like a meal moving through a boa constrictor." The flood was serious enough to interrupt the progress of Oregon's growing economy, but the inundated acreage was smaller than in 1964—only about .

About 450 concrete flood-protection walls in Portland that had been constructed during the February flood, each weighing about , were removed in April 1996. In October, they were replaced by a larger steel wall that cost the city about $300,000. The new wall had removable steel plates designed to better prevent future flooding.

Since as early as 1869, with the introduction of a federally funded "snag puller" designed to keep the waterway clear, human habitation has affected the <a href="ecology">ecology</a> of the river basin. The construction of large federal dams on the Willamette's tributaries between 1941 and 1969 damaged the spawning grounds for spring <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook salmon</a> and <a href="Rainbow%20trout">steelhead</a>. Domestic and industrial waste from the cities built up along the river, "essentially turning the main-stem river into an open sewer by the 1920s."

A 1927 <a href="City%20Club%20of%20Portland">City Club of Portland</a> report labeled the waterway "filthy and ugly", and identified the City of Portland as the worst offender. The Oregon Anti-Stream Pollution League brought a pollution-abatement measure before the <a href="39th%20Oregon%20Legislative%20Assembly">39th Oregon Legislative Assembly</a> in 1937. The bill passed, but Governor <a href="Charles%20Martin%20%28Oregon%20politician%29">Charles Martin</a> vetoed it. The <a href="Izaak%20Walton%20League">Izaak Walton League</a> and the Oregon affiliate of the <a href="National%20Wildlife%20Federation">National Wildlife Federation</a> countered the governor's veto with a ballot initiative, which passed in November 1938.

Shortly after he was elected in 1966, Governor <a href="Tom%20McCall">Tom McCall</a> ordered water quality tests on the Willamette, conducted his own research on the water quality, and became head of the <a href="Oregon%20State%20Sanitary%20Authority">Oregon State Sanitary Authority</a>. McCall learned that the river was heavily polluted in Portland. In a television documentary, "Pollution in Paradise", he said that "the Willamette River was actually cleaner when the Oregon Sanitary Authority was created in 1938 than it was in 1962." He then discouraged tourism in the state and made it harder for companies to qualify for a permit to operate near the river. He also regulated how much those companies could pollute and closed plants that did not meet state pollution standards.

Despite earlier cleanup efforts, state studies in the 1990s identified a wide variety of pollutants in the river bottom, including <a href="toxic%20heavy%20metal">heavy metals</a>, <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyl</a>s (PCBs), and <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s along the lower of the river, in Portland. As a result, this section of the river was designated a <a href="Superfund">Superfund</a> site in 2000, involving the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) in cleanup of the river bottom. The area to be addressed stretches from the Fremont Bridge almost to the Columbia – spanning nearly 11 river miles. Reducing risk from the pollutants in this stretch will involve removing contaminated sediment from the river bottom and efforts to contain contaminated sediment by placing clean sediment on top (known as "capping"). Pollution has been exacerbated by combined sewer overflows, which the city has greatly reduced through its <a href="West%20Side%20CSO%20Tunnel">Big Pipe Project</a>. Further upstream, the pressing environmental issues have mainly been variations in pH and dissolved oxygen. The Willamette is nevertheless clean enough to be used by cities such as Corvallis and <a href="Wilsonville%2C%20Oregon">Wilsonville</a> for drinking water.

Since pollution concerns are primarily along the lower river, the Willamette in general scores relatively high on the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI), which is compiled by the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ). The DEQ considers index scores of less than 60 to be very poor; the other categories are 60–79 (poor); 80–84 (fair); 85–89 (good), and 90–100 (excellent). The Willamette River's water quality is rated excellent near the source, though it gradually declines to fair near the mouth. Between 1998 and 2007, the average score for the upper Willamette at Springfield (RM 185, RK 298) was 93. At Salem (RM 84, RK 135), the score was 89, and good scores continued all the way to the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland (RM 13, RK 21) at 85. Scores were in the "fair" category further downstream; the least favorable reading was at the Swan Island Channel midpoint (RM 0.5, RK 0.8) at 81. By comparison, sites on the <a href="Winchuck%20River">Winchuck River</a>, the Clackamas, and the North Santiam all scored 95, and a site at a pump station on Klamath Strait Drain between <a href="Upper%20Klamath%20Lake">Upper Klamath Lake</a> and <a href="Lower%20Klamath%20Lake">Lower Klamath Lake</a> recorded the lowest score in Oregon at 19.

Over the past 150 years, a significant change for the Willamette River has been the loss of its floodplain forests, which covered an estimated 89 percent of a band along each river bank in 1850. By 1990 only 37 percent of this zone was forested; the rest had been converted to farm fields or cleared for urban or suburban uses. The remaining forests close to the river include large stands of <a href="Populus%20trichocarpa">black cottonwood</a>, <a href="Fraxinus%20latifolia">Oregon ash</a>, <a href="willow">willow</a>, and <a href="Acer%20macrophyllum">bigleaf maple</a>. The central valley—a former perennial grass prairie interspersed with oaks, <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pines</a>, and other trees—is devoted almost entirely to farming. <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a>, <a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">western hemlock</a>, and <a href="Thuja%20plicata">western red cedar</a> dominate the forest on the Coast Range side of the basin. Forests to the east in the Cascade Range include <a href="Abies%20amabilis">Pacific silver fir</a> as well as western hemlock and western red cedar.

Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, among them <a href="Coastal%20cutthroat%20trout">cutthroat</a>, <a href="Bull%20trout">bull</a>, and <a href="Rainbow%20trout">rainbow</a> trout, several species of <a href="salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="Catostomidae">sucker</a>, <a href="minnow">minnow</a>, <a href="sculpin">sculpin</a>, and <a href="lamprey">lamprey</a>, as well as <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>, <a href="stickleback">stickleback</a>, and others. Among the 29 non-native species in the basin, there are <a href="Brook%20trout">brook</a>, <a href="Brown%20trout">brown</a>, and <a href="Lake%20trout">lake</a> trout, <a href="Largemouth%20bass">largemouth</a> and <a href="Smallmouth%20bass">smallmouth</a> bass, <a href="walleye">walleye</a>, <a href="carp">carp</a>, <a href="bluegill">bluegill</a>, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the <a href="Pacific%20giant%20salamander">Pacific giant salamander</a>. <a href="Beaver">Beaver</a> and <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otter</a> are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the <a href="American%20dipper">American dipper</a>, <a href="osprey">osprey</a>, and <a href="harlequin%20duck">harlequin duck</a>. <a href="Garter%20snake">Garter snake</a>s are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.

Species diversity is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries. Threatened, endangered, or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon, winter steelhead, <a href="chum%20salmon">chum salmon</a>, <a href="Coho%20salmon">Coho salmon</a> and <a href="Oregonichthys">Oregon chub</a>. In the central valley, several projects have been done to restore and protect wetlands in order to provide habitat for <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s, <a href="Fender%27s%20blue%20butterfly">Fender's blue butterfly</a> (of which 6,000 remain), Oregon chub, <a href="Lomatium%20bradshawii">Bradshaw's desert parsley</a>, a variety of <a href="Erigeron%20decumbens">Willamette fleabane</a>, and <a href="Lupinus%20sulphureus">Kincaid's lupine</a>. In the early 21st century, osprey populations are increasing along the river, possibly because of a ban on the pesticide <a href="DDT">DDT</a> and on the birds' ability to use power poles for nesting. Beaver populations, presumed to be much lower than historic levels, are increasing throughout the basin.

Interstate 96

Interstate 96 (I-96) is an east–west <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway</a> that runs for approximately entirely within the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a> of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The western terminus is at an interchange with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US Highway 31</a> (US 31) and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Muskegon%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 31</a> (Bus. US 31) on the eastern boundary of <a href="Norton%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">Norton Shores</a> southeast of <a href="Muskegon%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon</a>, and the eastern terminus is at <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> near the <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a> in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>. From <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> through <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> to Detroit, the freeway parallels Grand River Avenue, never straying more than a few miles from the decommissioned <a href="U.S.%20Route%2016%20in%20Michigan">US 16</a>. The <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wayne County</a> section of I-96 is named the Jeffries Freeway from its eastern terminus to the junction with <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> and <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a>. Though maps still refer to the freeway as the Jeffries, the portion within the city of Detroit was renamed by the state legislature as the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway in December 2005 in honor of the late <a href="Rosa%20Parks">civil rights pioneer</a>. There are four <a href="List%20of%20auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highways">auxiliary Interstates</a> as well as two current and four former <a href="business%20route">business route</a>s associated with I-96.

Grand River Avenue originated as an <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trail before Michigan statehood. It later was used as a wagon road across the state. The roadway was included in the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a> in 1919 as M-16 and later the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">United States Numbered Highway System</a> as US 16. Construction of a freeway along the length of the corridor was proposed in the 1940s, and included as part of the Interstate Highway System in the mid-1950s. This construction was started in 1956 and initially completed across the state to Detroit in 1962. The proposed route for the Jeffries Freeway in Detroit was moved in the 1960s; it was built in the 1970s. I-96 was completed on November 21, 1977, in the Detroit area, closing the last gap along the route. Since then, additional interchanges and lanes have been added in places to accommodate traffic needs.

I-96 is maintained by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) as a segment of the larger <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a>. In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on <a href="Annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">average</a>, 201,200 vehicles used the highway daily between 6 and 7 Mile roads in Livonia. Near Norton Shores, 20,638 vehicles did so each day between Airline and Fruitport roads. These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-96 is included in the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway in Detroit has been named the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway by the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> to honor the civil rights pioneer <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a>. The segment from Livonia west to I-275 is the Jeffries Freeway, named for a former mayor of Detroit, <a href="Edward%20Jeffries">Edward Jeffries</a>.

I-96 begins at a <a href="partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">three-quarter cloverleaf interchange</a> with US 31 northeast of the <a href="Muskegon%20County%20Airport">Muskegon County Airport</a> in <a href="Norton%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">Norton Shores</a>, near <a href="Muskegon%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon</a>. At the starting terminus, the highway has a grassy median and two lanes in each direction as it travels southeasterly through rural <a href="Muskegon%20County%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon County</a>. The freeway is paralleled by Airline Highway in an area with a mix of fields and residences as far as <a href="Fruitport%2C%20Michigan">Fruitport</a>. I-96 bypasses that village to the north and east before crossing into <a href="Ottawa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ottawa County</a> at Fruitport Road. After a distance of about in the county, the trunkline reaches <a href="Crockery%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Nunica</a>. The highway crosses the Crockery Creek and turns eastward toward <a href="Coopersville%2C%20Michigan">Coopersville</a>. The freeway runs parallel to the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a>, about to the north. Near Ironwood Drive, I-96 turns southeasterly again and goes through <a href="Marne%2C%20Michigan">Marne</a>.

Beyond Marne, I-96 passes the western end of <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a> and crosses into <a href="Kent%20County%2C%20Michigan">Kent County</a>, curving around a rest area for the eastbound lanes. The freeway runs eastward through a light industrial area of the suburb of <a href="Walker%2C%20Michigan">Walker</a> as it enters the <a href="Grand%20Rapids%20metropolitan%20area">Grand Rapids metropolitan area</a>. At the interchange with Alpine Avenue, <a href="M-37%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-37</a> merges onto the freeway and the two <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> past the studios for <a href="WZZM">WZZM-TV</a> with its iconic <a href="Weather%20beacon">weatherball</a>, a sphere above the ground that uses colored lights to display a weather forecast. Adjacent to the studios are the ramps from eastbound I-96 to southbound <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> and from northbound US 131 to westbound I-96. These ramps mark the northern end of <a href="Interstate%20296">I-296</a>, an <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned</a> auxiliary Interstate Highway designation applied to them and the US 131 freeway south to downtown Grand Rapids. I-96 turns northeasterly past a commercial area to a three-quarter cloverleaf interchange that provides all of the other connections with US 131 next to a crossing of the Grand River.
East of the river, I-96 and M-37 pass through the northern suburb of <a href="Comstock%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Comstock Park</a>, intersecting <a href="M-44%20Connector%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Connector M-44</a> (CONN M-44, Plainfield Avenue) near <a href="Lamberton%20Lake">Lamberton Lake</a>. Past that interchange, the freeway angles southeasterly and then southward, bypassing Grand Rapids to the northeast. East of downtown, I-96/M-37 meets <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> (Gerald R. Ford Freeway) at a partial interchange; traffic headed eastbound on I-196 must enter I-96 eastbound and only westbound I-96 traffic may enter I-196. Immediately east of the interchange is another for <a href="M-44%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-44</a> (East Beltline Avenue) where M-37 separates from the freeway to turn southward. Through this series of interchanges, I-96 curves to the east and then turns back southward after passing through them. There are two more interchanges for <a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a> (Fulton Street) and Cascade Road before I-96 meets the eastern end of M-11 at 28th Street. The next interchange for 36th Street provides access to the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20International%20Airport">Gerald R. Ford International Airport</a>. The freeway continues to the east of the airport and then intersects the eastern end of <a href="M-6%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-6</a> (Paul B. Henry Freeway, South Beltline Freeway) at an interchange over the confluence of the <a href="Thornapple%20River">Thornapple</a> and Grand rivers.

The freeway exits the edges of the Grand Rapids urban area past the interchange with M-6, turning due east and paralleling the northern edge of Cascade Road. I-96 curves to the south of Pratt Lake near the county line, crossing into <a href="Ionia%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ionia County</a>. Grand River Avenue is the <a href="frontage%20road">frontage road</a> as the freeway heads east through farm fields. South of <a href="Ionia%2C%20Michigan">Ionia</a>, I-96 intersects <a href="M-66%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-66</a>. Near <a href="Portland%2C%20Michigan">Portland</a>, the trunkline turns to the southeast to cross the Grand River again. On the east side of town, the freeway crosses Grand River Avenue, its former <a href="Business%20route">business spur</a> into town. I-96 continues southeasterly, crossing into <a href="Clinton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Clinton County</a>, and passes the community of <a href="Eagle%2C%20Michigan">Eagle</a>. Entering the western reaches of the <a href="Lansing%E2%80%93East%20Lansing%20metropolitan%20area">Lansing metropolitan area</a>, I-96 merges with <a href="Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">I-69</a> and turns southward at an interchange in the southwestern corner of the county; this interchange also provides access to <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Lansing%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-96</a> (BL I-96, Grand River Avenue).
These two Interstates run southward together for about on the west side of the metropolitan area, picking up a third lane in each direction. The exit numbers and mileposts along the concurrency reflect those of I-96, which is considered the dominant designation of the pair. South of that interchange, the freeway crosses into <a href="Eaton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Eaton County</a> and over the Grand River. The trunkline passes near residential subdivisions, and next to the interchange for <a href="Interstate%2069%20Business%20%28Lansing%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-69</a>/<a href="M-43%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-43</a> (Saginaw Highway), there is a large retail development. Further south, <a href="Interstate%20496">I-496</a> (Olds Freeway) branches off to run into downtown Lansing before the split between I-96 and I-69. I-69 turns southward while I-96 turns southeasterly, dropping back to four lanes in total. After the Lansing Road interchange, the freeway crosses the Grand River one last time and runs due east to bypass Lansing.
I-96 crosses into <a href="Ingham%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ingham County</a> and continues along the southern edges of the Lansing metro area. It passes through areas with residential subdivisions and commercial developments, coming to a pair of interchanges including one for the eastern end of BL I-96 (Cedar Street). Near the crossing of the <a href="Red%20Cedar%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Red Cedar River</a>, I-96 goes through the interchange for I-496/<a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a>. East of that interchange, the freeway begins to exit the metro area as the landscape transitions back to farm fields. I-96 continues eastward, bypassing <a href="Williamston%2C%20Michigan">Williamston</a> and <a href="Webberville%2C%20Michigan">Webberville</a> to the south. Near the latter, the freeway turns more southeasterly and crosses into <a href="Livingston%20County%2C%20Michigan">Livingston County</a>. In Livingston County, I-96 passes to the south of <a href="Fowlerville%2C%20Michigan">Fowlerville</a> and then enters the far northwestern edge of <a href="Metro%20Detroit">Metro Detroit</a>, passing south of <a href="Howell%2C%20Michigan">Howell</a>. From this point, the freeway expands to six lanes and runs parallel to Grand River Avenue on the southern side of town.

Near the <a href="Livingston%20County%20Spencer%20J.%20Hardy%20Airport">Livingston County Spencer J. Hardy Airport</a> on the western edge of Howell, I-96 meets <a href="M-59%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-59</a>, which runs to <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac</a> and carries the <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Howell%2C%20Michigan%29">Howell business loop</a> easterly to Grand River Avenue. The business loop reconnects near Lake Chemung on the east side of town, and I-96 turns further to the southeast. On the northeast side of <a href="Brighton%2C%20Michigan">Brighton</a>, I-96 crosses over Grand River Avenue and the landscape transitions to include residential subdivisions. I-96 proceeds to cross <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a>.

I-96 passes through an area with several lakes as it crosses into <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County</a>. This area includes the <a href="Island%20Lake%20Recreation%20Area">Island Lake State Recreation Area</a> to the south and the <a href="Kensington%20Metropark">Kensington Metropark</a> to the north of the freeway in an area where it crosses the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a>. The Interstate runs through <a href="Wixom%2C%20Michigan">Wixom</a> into <a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a>, where it passes to the south of the <a href="Twelve%20Oaks%20Mall">Twelve Oaks Mall</a>. Southeast of the mall, I-96 enters a complex interchange on the border between Novi and <a href="Farmington%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Farmington Hills</a> that connects it to <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a> (Haggerty Connector), <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> and <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> (Reuther Freeway). The trunkline drops a lane in each direction as it enters the interchange and turns southward. The freeway then merges into I-275 and increases to four lanes in each direction running south in Farmington Hills.

According to the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>, I-275 ends at the junction with I-96 and <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a> along the boundary between <a href="Livonia%2C%20Michigan">Livonia</a> and <a href="Plymouth%20Charter%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Plymouth Township</a> and not at the interchange in Novi and Farmington Hills. MDOT considers I-275 to extend northward concurrently with I-96 to the Novi and Farmington Hills, and maps from other providers follow MDOT's lead and label the freeway north of M-14 as I-96/I-275.

I-96/I-275 runs southward for about before crossing into <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wayne County</a> at the interchange with <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">8 Mile Road</a> near the <a href="Meadowbrook%20Country%20Club">Meadowbrook Country Club</a>. The freeway curves to the east around <a href="Schoolcraft%20College">Schoolcraft College</a>; then, south of 5 Mile Road, I-96 meets the interchange with M-14 and I-275 where it turns to the east along the Jeffries Freeway. To the north and south sides of I-96 are a pair of <a href="Frontage%20road">service drive</a>s named Schoolcraft Road which follow the 4 Mile location on the <a href="Mile%20Road%20System%20%28Detroit%29">Mile Road System</a> for Detroit. To the north of the Jeffries are residential neighborhoods and to the south are commercial or industrial areas. At Inkster Road, the freeway crosses into <a href="Redford%20Charter%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Redford Township</a> where it intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> (Telegraph Road) near <a href="Eliza%20Howell%20Park">Eliza Howell Park</a>. East of the park, I-96 enters Detroit.

Past the <a href="Outer%20Drive">Outer Drive</a> interchange, I-96 splits into a <a href="local-express%20lanes">local-express lanes</a> configuration. There are two <a href="carriageway">carriageway</a>s in each direction, and the central ones have three lanes that bypass almost all of the exits while the outer ones have two lanes that have access to each exit. The Jeffries turns southeasterly and separates from Schoolcraft Road shifting to the south. The interchange with <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> (Southfield Freeway) features slip ramps so that traffic can pass between the local and express lanes. Further east, I-96 turns northeasterly to cross Grand River Avenue at the southern end of M-5. I-96 curves over to the interchange with <a href="M-8%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-8</a> (Davison Avenue) and the local-express configuration ends as the freeway turns back to the south to cross over Grand River Avenue.
From the crossing south of Davison, I-96 runs parallel to Grand River Avenue southeasterly with eight lanes total. The two run together as far as the interchange with <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> (Edsel Ford Freeway) near Bishop Park. I-96 turns more south-southeasterly there through residential neighborhoods on Detroit's southeastern side. I-96 terminates at an interchange that connects it to I-75 (Fisher Freeway) and to the <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a>.

Interstate 96 was mostly constructed in sections that opened from 1957 to 1962, but it was not completed in the Detroit area until 1977. Even before the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">National Interstate and Defense Highways Act</a> was signed in 1956, the route was being planned as a replacement of the old US 16, which was <a href="decommissioned%20highway">decommissioned</a> in 1962.

The Muskegon–Grand Rapids–Lansing–Detroit corridor was initially named the Grand River Road, an Indian trail that was designated as a military highway in 1825. The roadway was included as a branch of "Division 2" of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a> when that was created in May 1913. When the system was signposted in 1919, the highway was assigned the <a href="M-16%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-16</a> designation. Grand River Avenue was the first <a href="paved%20highway">paved highway</a> across the state when paving was completed in 1926. The entire highway was designated as part of US 16 later that year.
East of Grand Rapids, the highway was a major artery of national importance, and was added to the proposed "Interregional Highway System" as part of a northern route between <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and Detroit by the 1940s. A branch from Grand Rapids to Muskegon was added later that decade, and in 1957 the Chicago–Detroit route was labeled as part of <a href="Interstate%2094">Interstate 94</a>, with Interstate 94N on the spur to Muskegon. Michigan, believing that this would "cause considerable confusion to the public", requested a change in April 1958, which would move I-94 to the shorter <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo</a> route (which was planned as I-92), make the Muskegon–Detroit route I-96, and assign I-67 to the connection from I-94 to I-96 at Grand Rapids, but this was initially rejected by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> (AASHO). By mid-1959, Michigan's plan had been approved, with one change: I-96 would take the south leg from I-94 at <a href="Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Benton Harbor</a> to Grand Rapids, and the north leg to Muskegon would be I-196.

Construction of the Brighton–Farmington Expressway piece of the US 16 upgrade began in 1956, and, when a piece opened on August 1, 1957, it was the first section of funded Interstate to open in Michigan. The entire freeway from east of <a href="Brighton%2C%20Michigan">Brighton</a> to a bypass of <a href="Farmington%2C%20Michigan">Farmington</a> was completed in December of that year. By early 1959, when signs for I-96 and I-196 were posted, of the "Detroit–Muskegon Freeway" had been completed and marked as US 16. With the opening of from west of Lansing to east of <a href="Howell%2C%20Michigan">Howell</a>, the entire route, except in the Detroit area, opened for travel on December 12, 1962. US 16 was decommissioned in the state at that time; the portions into Muskegon and Detroit, beyond the ends of the freeway, became separate related highways named Business Spur Interstate 196 (BS I-196) <a href="Interstate%20196%20Business%20%28Muskegon%2C%20Michigan%29">for Muskegon</a> and <a href="Interstate%2096%20Business%20%28Detroit%2C%20Michigan%29">for Detroit</a>.

In 1963, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> petitioned AASHO to again make the change it had requested back in 1958, moving I-96 over I-196 to end at Muskegon and renumbering I-96 west of Grand Rapids to I-67. The state cited problems with destination signing and numerous complaints from the public about confusion caused by the numbering. At their October 21, 1963 meeting, AASHO approved the relocation of I-96, but rejected I-67, stating that the number should be kept for a more major route in case the system is expanded, and instead assigned I-196 to the not-yet-complete Benton Harbor–Grand Rapids highway. The signage was switched in January 1964. With the scheduled completion of the <a href="Lodge%20Freeway">Lodge Freeway</a> on October 29, 1964, a full freeway route was available from I-96 into downtown Detroit via I-696 and the Lodge, but it would be some time before I-96 was finished into the city.

The Detroit Expressway and Transit System plan, prepared in 1945 for the city of Detroit, included a Grand River Expressway, which was to parallel Grand River Avenue into downtown and relieve <a href="traffic%20congestion">congestion</a> on that artery. A rail line would be built in the <a href="median%20%28road%29">median</a> of the freeway west of West Chicago Street, where <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a>s would exit onto the existing surface tracks on Grand River Avenue into downtown. The plan called for a future conversion to <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> with a grade-separated route to downtown. The <a href="Department%20of%20Street%20Railways">Department of Street Railways</a> determined in 1947 that the operation would cost $6 million per year (equivalent to $/yr in ), and the planned transit line was dropped from the plans. By 1961, the proposed highway was renamed the Jeffries Freeway, after <a href="Edward%20Jeffries">Edward Jeffries</a>, who served as <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Detroit%2C%20Michigan">Detroit mayor</a> from 1940 to 1948.

The first piece of the Jeffries Freeway connected the <a href="Fisher%20Freeway">Fisher Freeway</a> (I-75) with the <a href="Edsel%20Ford%20Freeway">Ford Freeway</a> (I-94) in 1970. It was extended northwest to Livernois Avenue (exit 188A) in July 1971, and then to Grand River Avenue at Schaefer Highway (exit 185) in 1973. In 1976, the freeway was extended west to the <a href="Southfield%20Freeway">Southfield Freeway</a> (exit 183), and the entire I-275 concurrent section was opened. The final piece was completed on November 21, 1977, connecting the Detroit section to I-275. The I-96 designation was assigned along the I-275 freeway south to the Jeffries Freeway, and eastward along the new freeway to the M-39 interchange; the remaining stub of I-96 around Farmington was redesignated as an extension of <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a> (now <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a>).
Originally, the route of Interstate 96 from the east end of the existing freeway in Farmington through Detroit, named the Jeffries Freeway (commonly referred to as simply "the Jeffries"), was to closely parallel Grand River Avenue (formerly US 16). However, by 1963, several <a href="freeway%20revolt">freeway revolt</a>s were taking place in urban locations throughout the country, including Detroit. Several of Detroit's planned freeways were modified, scaled back, or outright cancelled. To minimize the impact to existing communities and businesses, it was decided that the Jeffries Freeway would no longer utilize the Grand River Avenue corridor. Instead, the new I-96 freeway corridor would partially use <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> from the <a href="C%26amp%3BO%20Railroad">C&O Railroad</a> through the city of Livonia (ultimately being built over Schoolcraft Road), and utilize the planned I-275 freeway bypassing Detroit to the west to connect back to the existing freeway.

Since the completion of I-96 in 1977, several changes to the freeway have taken place. Beginning in 1984, an extension of the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a> freeway (later to become I-69) bypassing Lansing opened; US 27 was then cosigned with I-96 along the western side of Lansing. Three years later, the I-69 designation was applied to this new bypass, resulting in a triple concurrency (I-96/I-69/US 27) that existed until 2002, when US 27 was decommissioned in Michigan.
From 2003 to 2005, the Beck Road interchange (exit 160) in <a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a> was reconstructed as a <a href="single%20point%20urban%20interchange">single point urban interchange</a> (SPUI), the first in the metropolitan Detroit area and the first on I-96.
An interchange between 36th Street and I-96 was built starting in 2005 and was completed in 2006. The project aimed to improve access to the Gerald R. Ford International Airport southeast of Grand Rapids. The reconstruction of the Wixom Road interchange near Novi as a SPUI was completed in late fall of 2008. Another interchange at Latson Road in Howell was approved for construction on July 19, 2012. This interchange was designed to bring improved access to the eastern Howell area, which prior to construction of the Latson Road exit was only accessible from westbound I-96. The project was completed on December 2, 2013. Also in 2013, the two interchanges near <a href="Nunica%2C%20Michigan">Nunica</a> serving <a href="M-104%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-104</a> and <a href="B-31%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">B-31</a> were reconstructed, with two ramps removed from the former and two added to the latter; a new partial interchange was also built in preparation of <a href="M-231%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-231</a>, which opened on October 30, 2015.

On April 5, 2014, MDOT closed I-96 between Newburgh Road and US 24 (Telegraph Road). The project was estimated to cost $148 million, and would rebuild the of roadway, replace two bridges, and repair 32 other bridges. The department also planned to install new drainage and replace the signs along I-96. The project was expected to be completed in October 2014. Instead, it was finished ahead of schedule, and that segment of I-96 was re-opened on September 21, 2014.

Also in 2015, work began on bypassing the 1960s interchange with US 23 near <a href="Brighton%2C%20Michigan">Brighton</a>. A new set of through lanes was built on I-96 between the current eastbound and westbound lanes with three new bridges over northbound and southbound US 23, and over Old US 23. The existing lanes of I-96 were changed to be <a href="collector-distributor%20lane">collector-distributor lane</a>s for ramp traffic. This project was completed in November 2016.

Beginning on February 25, 2008, MDOT and the <a href="Detroit%20International%20Bridge%20Company">Detroit International Bridge Company</a> initiated the Ambassador Gateway Project at the eastern end of I-96. The adjacent section of I-75 closed completely to traffic in both directions to start the complete reconstruction of the road to better connect I-75 and I-96 to the <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a>, and the plans included the reconstruction of a mile (1.6 km) of I-96. That segment of I-96 closed on July 14, 2008, and it was scheduled to reopen a month early the following September. The overall project to realign ramps and connect the bridge to the freeways was mired in lawsuits between MDOT and the private company that owns the bridge. The <a href="Manuel%20Moroun">company's owner</a> was jailed for <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a> during court proceedings in early 2012. MDOT was later ordered to assume responsibility for construction, and the department completed the project on September 21, 2012.

On January 12, 2005, a large <a href="multiple-vehicle%20collision">multiple-vehicle collision</a> consisting of over 200 motor vehicles occurred on both directions of I-96 near <a href="Williamston%2C%20Michigan">Williamston</a> in <a href="Ingham%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ingham County</a>. Two people, Douglas James Baker (age 15) and Jason Eldridge (age 27) were killed in the incident. It was one of the largest collisions in US history and was blamed on heavy fog.

In October 2012, reports of a sniper shooting cars along I-96 in four counties led to a federal investigation and a multi-jurisdictional task force of 100 law enforcement officials. As of October 30, 2012, 25 shootings had been linked to one suspect. The <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives</a>, and <a href="Crime%20Stoppers">Crime Stoppers</a> offered a $102,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrator. The suspect, Raulie Casteel of <a href="Wixom%2C%20Michigan">Wixom</a>, was arrested on November 5, 2012, and ordered to stand trial in 2013 in Oakland County for 60 charges in one case, with a second trial on terrorism and murder charges to be brought by the <a href="Michigan%20Attorney%20General">Michigan Attorney General</a>. On October 30, 2013, the suspect pleaded <a href="Nolo%20contendere">no contest, but mentally ill</a>, in the Oakland County case, and he was sentenced to serve anywhere from six years and eight months to 10 years in prison on multiple assault charges (as well as two concurrent years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.

I-96 has four related, <a href="List%20of%20auxiliary%20Interstate%20Highways">auxiliary Interstate highways</a> that connect the main freeway to downtowns and other cities. <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> is a relatively long freeway spur, beginning at I-96 east of downtown <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> and heading west through downtown to <a href="Holland%2C%20Michigan">Holland</a>, and then south to I-94 near <a href="Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Benton Harbor</a>. The unsigned <a href="Interstate%20296">I-296</a> connects I-96 north of downtown Grand Rapids with I-196 in downtown, and is signed as US 131. <a href="Interstate%20496">I-496</a> is a loop through downtown <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a>, which I-96 bypasses to the south, and <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> is a northern bypass of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, connecting I-96 in <a href="Novi%2C%20Michigan">Novi</a> with I-75 in <a href="Royal%20Oak%2C%20Michigan">Royal Oak</a> and I-94 in <a href="St.%20Clair%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair Shores</a>.

There have been six business routes of Interstate 96 (I-96) in the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. There are two <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s designated Business Loop Interstate 96 (BL I-96): one through <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> and one through <a href="Howell%2C%20Michigan">Howell</a>. Both follow the old route of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2016%20in%20Michigan">US 16</a>, with appropriate connections to I-96. There are three former <a href="business%20spur">business spur</a>s that were designated Business Spur Interstate 96 (BS I-96). One connected to the carferry docks in <a href="Muskegon%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon</a>, <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">running concurrently</a> with part of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Muskegon%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 31</a> (Bus. US 31) along former US 16, but it has been eliminated. The second spur ran into downtown <a href="Portland%2C%20Michigan">Portland</a> until it was decommissioned in 2007. Two routes in the Detroit area—a loop through <a href="Farmington%2C%20Michigan">Farmington</a> and a spur into <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>—both using <a href="Grand%20River%20Avenue">Grand River Avenue</a>, and meeting at the temporary end of I-96 near Purdue Avenue, were eliminated when I-96 was moved to the completed Jeffries Freeway in 1977. These Detroit-area business routes are still state-maintained as <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned highway</a>s.

Unas

Unas or Wenis, also spelled Unis (, <a href="Hellenization">hellenized</a> form Oenas or Onnos), was a <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, the ninth and last ruler of the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty of Egypt</a> during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a>. Unas reigned for 15 to 30 years in the mid-<a href="24th%20century%20BC">24th century BC</a>, succeeding <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a>, who might have been his father.

Little is known of Unas' activities during his reign, which was a time of economic decline. Egypt maintained trade relations with the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ine coast and <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, and military action may have taken place in southern <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. The growth and decentralization of the administration in conjunction with the lessening of the king's power continued under Unas, ultimately contributing to the collapse of the Old Kingdom some 200 years later.

Unas built a <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Unas">pyramid</a> in <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a>, the smallest of the royal <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramids</a> completed during the Old Kingdom. The accompanying mortuary complex with its high and valley temples linked by a causeway was lavishly decorated with painted reliefs, whose quality and variety surpass the usual royal iconography. Furthermore, Unas was the first pharaoh to have the "<a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a>" carved and painted on the walls of the chambers of his pyramid, a major innovation that was followed by his successors until the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">First Intermediate Period</a> (c. 2160–c. 2050 BC). These texts identify the king with <a href="Ra">Ra</a> and with <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, whose cult was on the rise in Unas' time, and were meant to help the king reach the afterlife.

Unas had several daughters and possibly one or two sons who are believed to have predeceased him. <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>, a third century BC Egyptian priest of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> and author of the first history of Egypt, claims that with Unas' death the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. Unas was succeeded by <a href="Teti">Teti</a>, the first pharaoh of the <a href="Sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Sixth Dynasty</a>, possibly after a short crisis. However, the archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians at the time made no conscious break with the preceding dynasty and the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth dynasties might be illusory.

The <a href="funerary%20cult">funerary cult</a> of Unas established at his death continued until the end of the Old Kingdom and may have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period. The cult was still in existence or revived during the later <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c. 2050–c. 1650 BC). This did not prevent <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a> and <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a> (c. 1990–c. 1930 BC) from partially dismantling the mortuary complex of Unas for its materials.

In parallel to the official cult, Unas may have received popular veneration as a local god of Saqqara until as late as the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period</a> (664–332 BC), nearly 2000 years after his death.

Unas is well attested by historical sources with three ancient Egyptian king lists dating to the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a> period mentioning him. Unas occupies the 33rd entry of the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a>, which was written during the reign of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> (1290–1279 BC). Unas' name is also present on the <a href="Saqqara%20Tablet">Saqqara Tablet</a> (32nd entry) and on the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a> (third column, 25th row), both of which were written during the reign of <a href="Ramses%20II">Ramses II</a> (1279–1213 BC). The Turin canon further credits Unas with 30 years of reign. These sources all place Unas as the ninth and final ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, succeeding <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a> and preceding <a href="Teti">Teti</a> on the throne. This relative chronology is corroborated by archaeological evidence, for example in the tomb of officials serving under these kings.

In addition to these sources, Unas was also likely mentioned in the "<a href="Manetho%23Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>. No copies of the "Aegyptiaca" have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>. Africanus relates that the "Aegyptiaca" mentioned a pharaoh "Onnos" reigning for 33 years at the end of the Fifth Dynasty. Onnos is believed to be the <a href="Hellenization">hellenized</a> form for Unas, and Africanus' 33-year figure fits well with the 30 years of reign given to Unas on the Turin canon.

The primary contemporaneous sources attesting to Unas' activities are the many reliefs from his pyramid complex.
Excluding these, surprisingly few documents dating to Unas' reign have survived to this day, considering the 30-year length that later records give for his reign. Excavations at <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a>, the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty, have produced only four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas. They explicitly mention his third, fourth, sixth and eighth years on the throne. Unas also left a rock inscription on the island of <a href="Elephantine">Elephantine</a>, next to the <a href="Cataracts%20of%20the%20Nile">First Cataract</a> of the Nile in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>.

In addition, several alabaster vases bearing Unas' cartouche are known. A complete vessel and additional fragments originating from <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> on the Levantine coast are now in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Beirut">National Museum of Beirut</a>. A vase of unknown provenance is located in the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%20%28Florence%29">National Archaeological Museum</a> of <a href="Florence">Florence</a> and reads "Horus Wadjtawy, living eternally, king of Upper and Lower Egypt, son of Ra, Unas, living eternally". Another vessel, of unknown origins, is on display at the <a href="Louvre%20Museum">Louvre Museum</a>. It is a , globular alabaster vase finely decorated with a falcon with outstretched wings and two <a href="uraei">uraei</a>, or rearing cobras, holding ankh signs surrounding Unas' cartouche. An ointment jar bearing Unas' cartouche and Horus name is in the <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Museum</a>. Finally, a fragment of a calcite vase rim bearing two cartouches of Unas is on display in the <a href="Petrie%20Museum">Petrie Museum</a>.

Unas assumed the throne at the death of his predecessor Djedkare Isesi. Djedkare is thought to have been Unas' father, in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question. The succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth.

Unas had at least two queens, <a href="Nebet%20%28queen%29">Nebet</a> and <a href="Khenut">Khenut</a>, who were buried in a large double mastaba adjacent to their husband's pyramid. Unas and Nebet possibly had a son, the "king's son", "royal chamberlain", "priest of <a href="Maat">Maat</a>" and "<a href="overseer%20of%20Upper%20Egypt">overseer of Upper Egypt</a>" Unas-Ankh, who died about 10 years into Unas' reign. The filiation of Unas-Ankh is indirectly hinted at by his name and titles and by the presence of his tomb near those of Nebet and Unas but is not universally accepted. Two other sons have been proposed, Nebkauhor and Shepsespuptah, but these filiations are conjectural and contested. Unas likely died without a male heir.

Unas had at least five daughters named Hemetre Hemi, Khentkaues, Neferut, Nefertkaues Iku, and Sesheshet Idut. The status of another possible daughter, <a href="Iput">Iput</a>, is uncertain.

The duration of Unas' reign is uncertain. As indicated above, historical sources credit him with 30 and 33 years on the throne, figures that have been adopted by many Egyptologists, including <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Flinders Petrie</a>, <a href="William%20C.%20Hayes">William C. Hayes</a>, Darrell Baker, Peter Munro, and Jaromir Malek. In favor of such a long reign are scenes of a <a href="Sed%20festival">Sed festival</a> found in Unas' mortuary temple. This festival was normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign and was meant to rejuvenate the pharaoh's strength and power. Mere depictions of the festival do not necessarily imply a long reign; however, for example, a relief showing pharaoh <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a> in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years.

Other Egyptologists suspect a reign of less than 30 years for Unas owing to the scarcity of artefacts datable to his reign as well as the lack of documents dated to beyond his eighth year on the throne. Hence, <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20von%20Beckerath">Jürgen von Beckerath</a> believes that Unas ruled Egypt for 20 years while Rolf Krauss, David Warburton and <a href="Erik%20Hornung">Erik Hornung</a> shortened this number to 15 years in their 2012 study of <a href="Egyptian%20chronology">Egyptian chronology</a>. Krauss and <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a> further question the credibility of the Turin Canon concerning the <a href="Fourth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth</a> and Fifth Dynasties, so that the 30-year figure credited to Unas by the canon might not be reliable.

Excavations of the tomb of Nikau-Isesi under the direction of <a href="Naguib%20Kanawati">Naguib Kanawati</a> at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign. Nikau-Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi, lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper-Egypt under Unas' successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh <a href="cattle%20count">cattle count</a> during Teti's reign, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c.2055–c.1650 BC). Thus Nikau-Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas, would have died past 70 years old. However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Teti's time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas' 30-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 15 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 15 years, which together with just 11 years during Teti's reign would account for Nikau-Isesi's death at around 40 to 45 years of age.

Owing to the scarcity of evidence dating to Unas' reign, we know very little about his activities. Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities, in particular Byblos, seem to have continued during Unas' time on the throne. Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ine coast with Syro-Canaanite men, who were either the boat crews or slaves. Another relief depicts a military campaign, Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the <a href="Shasu">Shasu</a>. Similar reliefs have been found in preceding pyramid complexes, such as <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Sahure">that of Sahure</a>, and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events. Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions; however, for example the <a href="autobiography%20of%20Weni">autobiography of Weni</a> relates many punitive raids against Canaanite nomads in the early Sixth Dynasty.

To the South of Egypt, inscriptions of Unas on Elephantine record a visit of the king to Lower Nubia, possibly to receive tribute from local chieftains or because of growing unrest in the region. In addition, a relief from the causeway of Unas leading to his pyramid shows a giraffe, suggesting trade relations with Nubia.


Unas' reign was a time of economic decline although, as the French Egyptologist <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a> writes, it was "by no means a time of decadence". Indeed, the Egyptian state was still capable of mounting important expeditions to provide building stones for the king's pyramid complex. These expeditions are depicted on unique reliefs found in Unas' causeway and are also referred to in the autobiographical stela of an administration official. This official reports the transport of palmiform columns of red granite from Elephantine to Saqqara in only four days, a feat for which he was praised by the king. In addition to the important construction works undertaken in Saqqara for the construction of his pyramid complex, building activities also took place on Elephantine.

Until 1996, the domestic situation during Unas' reign was thought to have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.

In his history of Egypt Manetho states that with the death of Unas the Fifth Dynasty came to an end. This may be because Unas died without a male heir, his probable son Unas-Ankh having predeceased him. This might have caused a succession crisis hinted at by the personal name chosen by Teti upon his accession to the throne: "Seheteptawy" meaning "He who reconciles/pacifies the two lands". Teti's claim to the throne could have relied on his marriage to Iput, who may have been a daughter of Unas. This possibility is heavily debated, as the interpretation of Iput's titles that would indicate that she was the daughter of a king is uncertain. Furthermore, the idea that Teti could legitimate his claim by marrying into the royal family is rejected by many Egyptologists, including Munro, Dobrev, <a href="Michel%20Baud">Baud</a>, Mertz, Pirenne, and Robin, who do not think that the right to the pharaonic throne passed through the female line.

In addition to Manetho's statement, the Turin king list presents a special break point between Unas and his successor Teti.
Although the king list is not organized in dynasties–which were invented by Manetho–the Egyptologist Jaromir Malek explains that "the criterion for such divisions in the Turin Canon invariably was the change of location of the capital and royal residence." Malek thus suggests that the capital of Egypt, then known as Inbu-Hedj, was indeed supplanted at the time by settlements located to the South, East of South Saqqara, where Unas' palace may have been located. In the second millennium BC these cities finally merged and gave rise to <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>.

Whatever the basis for Manetho's choice to end the Fifth Dynasty with Unas, Egyptians living at the time probably perceived no particular change from one dynasty to the next. The administration of the state shows no evidence of disturbances, with many officials continuing their careers from Unas' onto Teti's reign. These include the viziers Mehu, <a href="Kagemni">Kagemni</a> and Nikau-Isesi and the overseer of the province of <a href="Edfu">Edfu</a> Isi. Given that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom might not have conceived of dynasties, the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties might be illusory.

The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time of changes in <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Ancient Egyptian religion</a> and in the ideology of kingship, changes that are first demonstrable under Unas. A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20titulary%23Horus%20name">Horus name</a>s of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of the cult of the king during Unas' time on the throne. This continued under Unas' successor Teti, for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name. This trend reflects the lessening of the king's power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood.

Meanwhile, the cult of <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a> was becoming more important with this god replacing the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaoh's subjects. The German Egyptologist <a href="Hartwig%20Altenm%C3%BCller">Hartwig Altenmüller</a> writes that for an Egyptian of the time "the [...] afterlife no longer depends on the relationship between the individual mortal and the king, [...] instead it is linked to his ethical position in direct relation to Osiris". In contrast, the cult of the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a> was in apparent decline, even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon. Thus, Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">sun temple</a> in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors. In addition, the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra, in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>, about a century earlier. The "Pyramid Texts" found in Unas' pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time. Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife, with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained.

Unas had a pyramid built for himself in North <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a>, between the <a href="Buried%20Pyramid">pyramid of Sekhemkhet</a> and the southwestern corner of the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Djoser">pyramid complex of Djoser</a>, in symmetry with the <a href="pyramid%20of%20Userkaf">pyramid of Userkaf</a> located at the northeastern corner. In the process, workers leveled and covered older tombs located in the area, most notably the tomb of the <a href="Second%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Second Dynasty</a> pharaoh <a href="Hotepsekhemwy">Hotepsekhemwy</a> (c. 2890 BC).

The original Egyptian name of the pyramid was "Nefer Isut Unas", meaning "Beautiful are the places of Unas". The pyramid of Unas is the smallest of the pyramids completed during the Old Kingdom, having a square base of for a height of .

The pyramid of Unas is part of a larger mortuary complex built around it. It was approached via an ancient lake on the shores of which Unas' valley temple was located. This temple received the provisions for the cult of the king and the offerings to be made were prepared there. At the back of the valley temple was the beginning of a causeway, equaled only by that of <a href="Khufu">Khufu</a>, and leading to an upper temple adjacent to the pyramid. A thin slit in the roof of the causeway allowed the light to illuminate its walls covered for their entire length in painted reliefs. These depicted the Egyptian seasons, processions of people from the nomes of Egypt, craftsmen at work, offerings bearers, battle scenes and the transport of granite columns for the construction of the pyramid complex.

At the end of the causeway was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to the eastern side of the pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by <a href="Gaston%20Maspero">Gaston Maspero</a>, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black greywacke sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.

The main innovation of the pyramid of Unas is the first appearance of the "<a href="Pyramid%20Texts">Pyramid Texts</a>", one of the oldest religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day. In doing so, Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties, until the end of the Old Kingdom circa 200 years later.

In total 283 magical spells, also known as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue on the walls of the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They constitute the most complete rendition of the "Pyramid Texts" existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts on the walls of the pyramid internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.
Hence, the "Pyramid Texts" of the pyramid of Unas incorporate instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during the cult of the king in his mortuary temple.

The good preservation of the texts in Unas' pyramid shows that they were arranged so as to be read by the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23Ba%20.28personality.29">Ba</a> of Unas, as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings. The Ba would then leave the burial chamber, which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the <a href="Duat">Duat</a>, and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the <a href="Akhet%20%28hieroglyph%20and%20season%29">Akhet</a>. Included in the spells written on the walls of the antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the <a href="Pyramid%20Texts%23Cannibal%20hymn">Cannibal Hymn</a>, which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods. At this point the Ba of Unas would face east, the direction of the sunrise, and beyond the pyramid masonry, the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally, turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.

An example of a spell from the pyramid of Unas is Utterance 217:Re-Atum, this Unas comes to you<br>A spirit indestructible<br>Your son comes to you<br> This Unas comes to you<br> May you cross the sky united in the dark<br> May you rise in lightland, the place in which you shine!

Unas' most immediate legacy is his funerary cult, which continued at least until the end of the Old Kingdom. This cult is attested by the tombs at Saqqara of seven priests responsible for the religious duties to be performed in the funerary complex. Three of these tombs date to the early Sixth Dynasty in the time following the death of Pepi I. Three more tombs date to the reign of <a href="Pepi%20II">Pepi II</a> and the last one dates to the very end of the Old Kingdom (c. 2180 BC). The priests of the cult of Unas adopted basilophorous names, incorporating that of the king, possibly upon taking office.

Unas' funerary cult appears to have survived during the chaotic <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a> until the Middle Kingdom. By the time of the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">12th Dynasty</a> (c. 1990–c. 1800 BC), the lector-priest Unasemsaf and his family were involved in the cult of Unas. In spite of this, Unas' funerary complex was partially dismantled and its materials reemployed for the construction of <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a> and <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a> own pyramid complexes.

In addition to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts the existence of a popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550–c.1077 BC) until the <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period</a> (664–332 BC). The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.
This activity could explain why the pyramid complex of Unas was the object of restoration works under the impulse of Prince <a href="Khaemweset">Khaemweset</a>, a son of <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> (1279–1213 BC).

Ahmose I

Ahmose I (, <a href="Egyptological%20pronunciation">Egyptological pronunciation</a> "Ahmose", sometimes written "Amosis I", "Amenes" and "Aahmes" and meaning "<a href="Iah">Iah</a> is born") was a <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a> and founder of the <a href="Eighteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Theban</a> royal house, the son of pharaoh <a href="Seqenenre%20Tao">Seqenenre Tao</a> and brother of the last pharaoh of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Seventeenth dynasty</a>, <a href="Kamose">Kamose</a>. During the reign of his father or grandfather, Thebes rebelled against the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a>, the rulers of <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a>. When he was seven years old, his father was killed, and he was about ten when his brother died of unknown causes after reigning only three years. Ahmose I assumed the throne after the death of his brother, and upon coronation became known as <a href="wikt%3Anb%23Etymology%202">nb</a>-<a href="wikt%3Ap%E1%B8%A5tj">pḥtj</a>-<a href="wikt%3Ar%EA%9C%A5">rꜥ</a> "The Lord of Strength is <a href="Ra">Ra</a>".

During his reign, Ahmose completed the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>, restored Theban rule over the whole of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. He then reorganized the administration of the country, reopened <a href="quarry">quarries</a>, <a href="mining">mines</a> and trade routes and began massive construction projects of a type that had not been undertaken since the time of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>. This building program culminated in the construction of the last <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramid</a> built by native Egyptian rulers. Ahmose's reign laid the foundations for the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a>, under which Egyptian power reached its peak. His reign is usually <a href="Ahmose%20I%23Dates%20and%20length%20of%20reign">dated to the mid-16th century BC</a>.

Ahmose descended from the Theban Seventeenth Dynasty. His grandfather and grandmother, <a href="Senakhtenre%20Ahmose">Senakhtenre Ahmose</a> and <a href="Tetisheri">Tetisheri</a>, had at least twelve children, including <a href="Seqenenre%20Tao">Seqenenre Tao</a> and <a href="Ahhotep%20I">Ahhotep I</a>. The brother and sister, according to the tradition of Egyptian queens, married; their children were <a href="Kamose">Kamose</a>, Ahmose I, and several daughters. Ahmose I followed in the tradition of his father and married several of his sisters, making <a href="Ahmose-Nefertari">Ahmose-Nefertari</a> his chief wife. They had several children including daughters <a href="Ahmose-Meritamun">Meritamun B</a>, <a href="Ahmose-Sitamun">Sitamun A</a> and sons <a href="Siamun%20%28son%20of%20Ahmose%20I%29">Siamun A</a>, <a href="Ahmose-ankh">Ahmose-ankh</a>, <a href="Amenhotep%20I">Amenhotep I</a> and <a href="ramose%20%28prince%29">Ramose A</a> (the "A" and "B" designations after the names are a convention used by Egyptologists to distinguish between royal children and wives that otherwise have the same name). They may also have been the parents of <a href="Mutnofret">Mutnofret</a>, who would become the wife of later successor <a href="Thutmose%20I">Thutmose I</a>. Ahmose-ankh was Ahmose's heir apparent, but he preceded his father in death sometime between Ahmose's 17th and 22nd <a href="regnal%20year">regnal year</a>. Ahmose was succeeded instead by his eldest surviving son, <a href="Amenhotep%20I">Amenhotep I</a>, with whom he might have shared <a href="Ahmose%20I%23Succession">a short coregency</a>.

There was no distinct break in the line of the royal family between the 17th and 18th dynasties. The historian <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>, writing much later during the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a>, considered the final expulsion of the Hyksos after nearly a century and the restoration of native Egyptian rule over the whole country a significant enough event to warrant the start of a new dynasty.

Ahmose's reign can be fairly accurately dated using the <a href="Sothic%20cycle">Heliacal rise of Sirius</a> in his <a href="Amenhotep%20I%23Dates%20and%20length%20of%20reign">successor's reign</a>, but because of disputes over from where the observation was made, he has been assigned a reign from 1570–1546, 1560–1537 and 1551–1527 by various sources. <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a> supposedly gives Ahmose a reign of 25 years and 4 months (but, as Manetho called the first ruler of his dynasty "Tethmosis", he probably intended someone else). This figure is seemingly supported by a 'Year 22' inscription from his reign at the stone quarries of <a href="Tura%20%28Egypt%29">Tura</a>. A medical examination of his <a href="mummy">mummy</a> indicates that he died when he was about thirty-five, supporting a 25-year reign if he came to the throne at the age of 10. The radiocarbon date range for the start of his reign is 1570–1544 BC, the mean point of which is 1557 BC.

Alternative dates for his reign (1194 to 1170 BC) were suggested by <a href="David%20Rohl">David Rohl</a>, but these were rejected by the majority of Egyptologists even before the radiocarbon date was published in 2010.

 
The conflict between the local kings of Thebes and the Hyksos king <a href="Apepi%20%28pharaoh%29">Apepi</a> had started during the reign of Ahmose's father, Seqenenre Tao, and would be concluded, after almost 30 years of intermittent conflict and war, during his own reign. Seqenenre Tao was possibly killed in a battle against the Hyksos, as his much-wounded mummy gruesomely suggests, and his successor Kamose (likely Ahmose's elder brother) is known to have attacked and raided the lands around the Hyksos capital, <a href="Avaris">Avaris</a> (modern <a href="Tell%20el-Dab%27a">Tell el-Dab'a</a>). Kamose evidently had a short reign, as his highest attested regnal year is year 3, and was succeeded by Ahmose I. Apepi may have died near the same time. The two royal names—Awoserre and Aqenienre—known for Apepi attested in the historical record were for the same Hyksos king that were used by Ahmose's opponent at different times during the latter king's reign.

Ahmose ascended the throne when he was still a child, so his mother, <a href="Ahhotep%20I">Ahhotep</a>, reigned as <a href="regent">regent</a> until he was of age. Judging by some of the descriptions of her regal roles while in power, including the general honorific "carer for Egypt", she effectively consolidated the Theban power base in the years before Ahmose assumed full control. If in fact Apepi II was a successor to Apepi I, then he is thought to have remained bottled up in the delta during Ahhotep's regency, because his name does not appear on any monuments or objects south of <a href="Bubastis">Bubastis</a>.

Ahmose began the conquest of Lower Egypt held by the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a> starting around the 11th year of <a href="Khamudi">Khamudi</a>'s reign, but the sequence of events is not universally agreed upon.

Analyzing the events of the conquest prior to the siege of the Hyksos capital of Avaris is extremely difficult. Almost everything known comes from a brief but invaluable military commentary on the back of the <a href="Rhind%20Mathematical%20Papyrus">Rhind Mathematical Papyrus</a>, consisting of brief diary entries, one of which reads

While in the past this regnal year date was assumed to refer to Ahmose, it is today believed instead to refer to Ahmose's Hyksos opponent Khamudi since the Rhind papyrus document refers to Ahmose by the inferior title of 'Prince of the South' rather than king or pharaoh, as a Theban supporter of Ahmose surely would have called him. Anthony Spalinger, in a JNES 60 (2001) book review of <a href="Kim%20Ryholt">Kim Ryholt</a>'s 1997 book, "The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800–1550 BC", notes that Ryholt's translation of the middle portion of the Rhind text chronicling Ahmose's invasion of the Delta reads instead as the "1st month of Akhet, 23rd day. "He-of-the-South" (i.e. Ahmose) strikes against <a href="Tjaru">Sile</a>." Spalinger stresses in his review that he does not question Ryholt's translation of the Rhind text but instead asks whether:

The Rhind Papyrus illustrates some of Ahmose's military strategy when attacking the Delta. Entering Heliopolis in July, he moved down the eastern delta to take <a href="Tjaru">Tjaru</a>, the major border fortification on the Horus Road, the road from Egypt to Canaan, in October, totally avoiding <a href="Avaris">Avaris</a>. In taking Tjaru he cut off all traffic between <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> and Avaris. This indicates he was planning a blockade of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from help or supplies coming from Canaan.

Records of the latter part of the campaign were discovered on the tomb walls of a participating soldier, <a href="Ahmose%2C%20son%20of%20Ebana">Ahmose, son of Ebana</a>. These records indicate that Ahmose I led three attacks against Avaris, the Hyksos capital, but also had to quell a small rebellion further south in Egypt. After this, in the fourth attack, he conquered the city. He completed his victory over the Hyksos by conquering their stronghold <a href="Sharuhen">Sharuhen</a> near <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a> after a three-year siege. Ahmose would have conquered Avaris by the 18th or 19th year of his reign at the very latest. This is suggested by "a graffito in the quarry at Tura whereby 'oxen from Canaan' were used at the opening of the quarry in Ahmose's regnal year 22." Since the cattle would probably have been imported after Ahmose's siege of the town of Sharuhen which followed the fall of Avaris, this means that the reign of Khamudi must have terminated by Year 18 or 19 of Ahmose's 25-year reign at the very latest.

After defeating the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>. A campaign during his 22nd year reached <a href="Djahy">Djahy</a> in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> and perhaps as far as the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, although the later Pharaoh <a href="Thutmose%20I">Thutmose I</a> is usually credited with being the first to campaign that far. Ahmose did, however, reach at least as far as Kedem (thought to be near <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>), according to an <a href="ostracon">ostracon</a> in the tomb of his wife, <a href="Ahmose-Nefertari">Ahmose-Nefertari</a>. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, <a href="Ahmose%2C%20son%20of%20Ebana">Ahmose, son of Ebana</a>, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take part in this land expedition. However, it can be inferred from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.

Ahmose I's campaigns in Nubia are better documented. Soon after the first Nubian campaign, a Nubian named Aata rebelled against Ahmose, but was crushed. After this attempt, an anti-Theban Egyptian named Tetian gathered many rebels in Nubia, but he too was defeated. Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled from a new administrative center established at <a href="Buhen">Buhen</a>. When re-establishing the national government, Ahmose appears to have rewarded various local princes who supported his cause and that of his dynastic predecessors.

With the re-unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Ahmose, a renewal of royal support for the arts and monumental construction occurred. Ahmose reportedly devoted a tenth of all the productive output towards the service of the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">traditional gods</a>, reviving massive monumental constructions as well as the arts. However, as the defeat of the Hyksos occurred relatively late in Ahmose's reign, his subsequent building program likely lasted no more than seven years, and much of what was started was probably finished by his son and successor Amenhotep I.

Work from Ahmose's reign is made of much finer material than anything from the Second Intermediate Period, though the craftsmanship from his reign does not always match the best work from either the Old or Middle Kingdoms. With the Delta and Nubia under Egyptian control once more, access was gained to resources not available in Upper Egypt. <a href="Gold">Gold</a> and <a href="silver">silver</a> were received from Nubia, <a href="Lapis%20Lazuli">Lapis Lazuli</a> from distant parts of central Asia, <a href="Cedrus%20libani">cedar</a> from <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>, and in the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai</a> the <a href="Serabit%20el-Khadim">Serabit el-Khadim</a> <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a> mines were reopened. Although the exact nature of the relationship between Egypt and Crete is uncertain, at least some <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> designs have been found on objects from this period, and Egypt considered the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> to be part of its empire. Ahmose reopened the <a href="Tura%20%28Egypt%29">Tura</a> <a href="limestone">limestone</a> quarries to provide stone for monuments and used Asiatic <a href="cattle">cattle</a> from <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> to haul the stone, according to his quarry inscription.

The art during Ahmose I's reign was similar to the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> royal Theban style, and <a href="stele">stelae</a> from this period were once more of the same quality. This reflects a possibly natural conservative tendency to revive fashions from the pre-Hyksos era. Despite this, only three positively identified statuary images of Ahmose I survive: a single <a href="shabti">shabti</a> kept at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, presumably from his tomb (which has never been positively located), and two life-size statues; one of which resides in the <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum">Metropolitan Museum</a>, the other in the <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a> Museum. All display slightly bulging eyes, a feature also present on selected stelae depicting the pharaoh. Based on style, a small limestone sphinx that resides at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Scotland">National Museum of Scotland</a>, Edinburgh, has also been tentatively identified as representing Ahmose I.

The art of <a href="glass%20making">glass making</a> is thought to have developed during Ahmose's reign. The oldest samples of glass appear to have been defective pieces of <a href="Egyptian%20faience">faience</a>, but intentional crafting of glass did not occur until the beginning of the 18th dynasty. One of the earliest glass beads found contains the names of both Ahmose and Amenhotep I, written in a style dated to about the time of their reigns. If glassmaking was developed no earlier than Ahmose's reign and the first objects are dated to no later than his successor's reign, it is quite likely that it was one of his subjects who developed the craft.

Ahmose resumed large construction projects like those before the <a href="Second%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">second intermediate period</a>. In the south of the country he began constructing temples mostly built of brick, one of them in the Nubian town of <a href="Buhen">Buhen</a>. In Upper Egypt he made additions to the existing temple of <a href="Amun">Amun</a> at <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a> and to the temple of Montu at Armant. According to an inscription at <a href="Tura%20%28Egypt%29">Tura</a>, he used white limestone to build a temple to <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a> and the southern harem of <a href="Amun">Amun</a>, but did not finish either project. He built a cenotaph for his grandmother, <a href="Tetisheri">Queen Tetisheri</a>, at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a>.

Excavations at the site of Avaris by <a href="Manfred%20Bietak">Manfred Bietak</a> have shown that Ahmose had a palace constructed on the site of the former Hyksos capital city's fortifications. Bietak found fragmentary Minoan-style remains of the <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es that once covered the walls of the palace; there has subsequently been much speculation as to what role this Aegean civilization may have played in terms of trade and in the arts.

Under Ahmose's reign, the city of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> became the capital for the whole of Egypt, as it had been under the <a href="Eleventh%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">11th Dynasty</a> in the early Middle Kingdom. It also became the center for a newly established professional <a href="civil%20service">civil service</a>, where there was a greater demand for scribes and the literate as the royal archives began to fill with accounts and reports. Having Thebes as the capital was probably a strategic choice as it was located at the center of the country, the logical conclusion from having had to fight the Hyksos in the north as well as the Nubians to the south. Any future opposition at either border could be met easily.

Perhaps the most important shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious as well as the political center of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos. The importance of the temple complex at Karnak (on the east bank of the Nile north of Thebes) grew and the importance of the previous cult of <a href="Ra">Ra</a> based in <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a> diminished.

Several stelae detailing the work done by Ahmose were found at Karnak, two of which depict him as a benefactor to the temple. In one of these stelae, known as the "<a href="Tempest%20Stele">Tempest Stele</a>", he claims to have rebuilt the pyramids of his predecessors at Thebes that had been destroyed by a major storm. The <a href="Thera%20eruption%23Impact%20on%20Egyptian%20history">Thera eruption</a> in the Aegean has been implicated by some scholars as the source of the damages described in the Tempest Stele.

The remains of Ahmose's <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramid</a> in <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> were discovered in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its outer casing stones had been robbed for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built has collapsed. However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by <a href="Arthur%20Mace">Arthur Mace</a>, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, based on the evidence of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a>). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.

The axis of the pyramid complex may be associated with a series of monuments strung out along a kilometer of desert. Along this axis are several key structures: 1) a large pyramid dedicated to his grandmother <a href="Tetisheri">Tetisheri</a> which contained a <a href="Stela%20of%20Queen%20Tetisheri">stele depicting Ahmose providing offerings</a> to her; 2) a rockcut underground complex which may either have served as a token representation of an <a href="Osiris">Osirian</a> underworld or as an actual royal tomb; and 3) a terraced temple built against the high cliffs, featuring massive stone and brick terraces. These elements reflect in general a similar plan undertaken for the cenotaph of <a href="Senwosret%20III">Senwosret III</a> and in general its construction contains elements which reflect the style of both <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old</a> and <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> pyramid complexes.

There is some dispute as to if this pyramid was Ahmose's burial place, or if it was a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>. Although earlier explorers Mace and Currelly were unable to locate any internal chambers, it is unlikely that a burial chamber would have been located in the midst of the pyramid's rubble core. In the absence of any mention of a tomb of King Ahmose in the tomb robbery accounts of the Abbott Papyrus, and in the absence of any likely candidate for the king's tomb at Thebes, it is possible that the king was interred at Abydos, as suggested by Harvey. Certainly the great number of cult structures located at the base of the pyramid located in recent years, as well as the presence at the base of the pyramid of a cemetery used by priests of Ahmose's cult, argue for the importance of the king's Abydos cult. However, other <a href="Egyptology">Egyptologists</a> believe that the pyramid was constructed (like Tetisheri's pyramid at Abydos) as a cenotaph and that Ahmose may have originally been buried in the southern part of <a href="Dra%27%20Abu%20el-Naga%27">Dra' Abu el-Naga'</a> with the rest of the late 17th and early 18th Dynasties.

This pyramid was the last pyramid ever built as part of a mortuary complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The <a href="Giza">Giza</a> plateau offered plenty of room for building pyramids; but this was not the case with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god <a href="Ra">Re</a>, who had been overshadowed by <a href="Amun">Amun</a> in importance. One of the meanings of Amun's name was "the hidden one", which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the <a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Kings">Valley of the Kings</a>.

Ahmose I's <a href="mummy">mummy</a> was discovered in 1881 within the <a href="Deir%20el-Bahri">Deir el-Bahri</a> <a href="DB320">Cache</a>, located in the hills directly above the <a href="mortuary%20temple">Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut</a>. He was interred along with the mummies of other 18th and 19th dynasty leaders <a href="Amenhotep%20I">Amenhotep I</a>, <a href="Thutmose%20I">Thutmose I</a>, <a href="Thutmose%20II">Thutmose II</a>, <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a>, <a href="Ramesses%20I">Ramesses I</a>, <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a>, <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> and <a href="Ramesses%20IX">Ramesses IX</a>, as well as the 21st dynasty pharaohs <a href="Pinedjem%20I">Pinedjem I</a>, <a href="Pinedjem%20II">Pinedjem II</a> and <a href="Siamun">Siamun</a>.

Ahmose I's mummy was unwrapped by <a href="Gaston%20Maspero">Gaston Maspero</a> on June 9, 1886. It was found within a coffin that bore his name in <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a>, and on his bandages his name was again written in hieratic script. While the cedarwood coffin's style dates it squarely to the time of the 18th dynasty, it was neither of royal style nor craftsmanship, and any <a href="gilding">gilding</a> or <a href="inlay">inlay</a>s may have been stripped in antiquity. He had evidently been moved from his original burial place, re-wrapped and placed within the cache at Deir el-Bahri during the reign of the 21st dynasty priest-king Pinedjem II, whose name also appeared on the mummy's wrappings. Around his neck a garland of "<a href="Delphinium">Delphinium</a>" flowers had been placed. The body bore signs of having been plundered by ancient grave-robbers, his head having been broken off from his body and his nose smashed.

The body was 1.63 m in height. The mummy had a small face with no defining features, though he had slightly prominent front teeth; this may have been an inherited family trait, as this feature can be seen in some female mummies of the same family, as well as the mummy of his descendant, Thutmose II.

A short description of the mummy by Gaston Maspero sheds further light on familial resemblances:

Initial studies of the mummy were first thought to reveal a man in his 50s, but subsequent examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of <a href="orthodontics">orthodontics</a>, and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a>s of all of the supposed royal mummies at the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Cairo Museum</a>. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also different from that of the female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed with arms crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.

The mummy is now in the <a href="Luxor%20Museum">Luxor Museum</a> alongside the purported one of <a href="Ramesses%20I">Ramesses I</a>, as part of a permanent exhibition called "The Golden Age of the Egyptian Military".

Ahmose I was succeeded by his son, <a href="Amenhotep%20I">Amenhotep I</a>. A minority of scholars have argued that Ahmose had a short <a href="coregency">co-regency</a> with Amenhotep, potentially lasting up to six years. If there was a co-regency, Amenhotep could not have been made king before Ahmose's 18th regnal year, the earliest year in which Ahmose-ankh, the heir apparent, could have died. There is circumstantial evidence indicating a co-regency may have occurred, although definitive evidence is lacking.

The first piece of evidence consists of three small objects which contain both of their <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20titulary%23Throne%20name%20%28praenomen%29">praenomen</a> next to one another: the aforementioned small glass bead, a small feldspar amulet and a broken stele, all of which are written in the proper style for the early 18th dynasty. The last stele said that Amenhotep was "given life eternally", which is an Egyptian idiom meaning that a king is alive, but the name of Ahmose does not have the usual epithet "true of voice" which is given to dead kings. Since praenomen are only assumed upon taking the throne, and assuming that both were in fact alive at the same time, it is indicated that both were reigning at the same time. There is, however, the possibility that Amenhotep I merely wished to associate himself with his beloved father, who reunited Egypt.

Second, <a href="Amenhotep%20I">Amenhotep I</a> appears to have nearly finished preparations for a <a href="sed%20festival">sed festival</a>, or even begun celebrating it; but Amenhotep I's reign is usually given only 21 years and a sed festival traditionally cannot be celebrated any earlier than a ruler's 30th year. If Amenhotep I had a significant co-regency with his father, some have argued that he planned to celebrate his Sed Festival on the date he was first crowned instead of the date that he began ruling alone. This would better explain the degree of completion of his Sed Festival preparations at Karnak. There are two contemporary New Kingdom examples of the breaking of this tradition; <a href="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a> celebrated her Heb Sed Festival in her 16th year and Akhenaten celebrated a Sed Festival near the beginning of his 17-year reign.

Third, Ahmose's wife, Ahmose Nefertari, was called both "King's Great Wife" and "King's Mother" in two stelae which were set up at the limestone quarries of Ma`sara in Ahmose's 22nd year. For her to literally be a "King's Mother," Amenhotep would already have to be a king. It is possible that the title was only honorific, as <a href="Ahhotep%20II">Ahhotep II</a> assumed the title without being the mother of any known king; though there is a possibility that her son Amenemhat was made Amenhotep I's co-regent, but preceded him in death.

Because of this uncertainty, a co-regency is currently impossible to prove or disprove. Both Redford's and Murnane's works on the subject are undecided on the grounds that there is too little conclusive evidence either for or against a coregency. Even if there was one, it would have made no difference to the chronology of the period because in this kind of institution Amenhotep would have begun counting his regnal dates from his first year as sole ruler. However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, it would certainly have been logical to crown a successor before one's death to prevent a struggle for the crown.

Grim Fandango

Grim Fandango is an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a>, directed by <a href="Tim%20Schafer">Tim Schafer</a>, developed and published by <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a> in 1998 for <a href="Windows">Windows</a>. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D computer graphics</a> overlaid on <a href="Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">pre-rendered</a> static backgrounds. As with other <a href="LucasArts%20adventure%20games">LucasArts adventure games</a>, the player must converse with characters and examine, collect, and use objects to solve puzzles.

"Grim Fandango" is set in the Land of the Dead, through which recently departed souls, represented as "<a href="calaca">calaca</a>"-like figures, travel before they reach their final destination. The story follows travel agent Manuel "Manny" <a href="Calavera">Calavera</a> as he attempts to save new arrival Mercedes "Meche" Colomar, a virtuous soul, on her journey. The game combines elements of the <a href="Aztec%20religion%23Cosmology%20and%20ritual">Aztec belief of afterlife</a> with "<a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>" style, with influences including "<a href="The%20Maltese%20Falcon%20%281941%20film%29">The Maltese Falcon</a>", "<a href="On%20the%20Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a>" and "<a href="Casablanca%20%28film%29">Casablanca</a>."

"Grim Fandango" received praise for its art design and direction. It was selected for several awards and is often listed as <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">one of the greatest video games of all time</a>. However, it was a commercial failure and contributed towards LucasArts' decision to end adventure game development and the decline of the adventure game genre.

In 2014, with help from <a href="Sony">Sony</a>, Schafer's studio <a href="Double%20Fine%20Productions">Double Fine Productions</a> acquired the "Grim Fandango" license following <a href="Disney">Disney</a>'s acquisition and closure of LucasArts the previous year. On January 27, 2015, Double Fine released a remastered version of the game, featuring improved graphics, controls (including point and click), an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary. It was initially released for Windows, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a>, and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> platforms. Mobile versions for <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> and <a href="iOS">iOS</a> devices were released on May 5, 2015. A <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> port of the remastered version was also released on November 1, 2018.

"Grim Fandango" is an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a>, in which the player controls Manuel "Manny" Calavera ("<a href="calavera">calavera</a>" being <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes "Meche" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the <a href="GrimE">GrimE</a> engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from <a href="3D%20model">3D model</a>s, while the main objects and characters are animated in <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a>. Additionally, cutscenes in the game have also been pre-rendered in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a <a href="keyboard%20%28computing%29">keyboard</a>, a <a href="joystick">joystick</a>, or a <a href="gamepad">gamepad</a>. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve <a href="puzzle">puzzle</a>s and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">HUD</a>. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item in and out of his coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through <a href="conversation%20tree">conversation tree</a>s to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never <a href="game%20over">die</a> or otherwise get into a <a href="no-win%20situation%23Video%20games">no-win situation</a> (that prevents completion of the game).

"Grim Fandango" takes place in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where recently departed souls aim to make their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the <a href="Grim%20Reaper">Grim Reaper</a> to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the <a href="Day%20of%20the%20Dead">Day of the Dead</a>, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.

The souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal "calaca" figures. Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as vehicle maintenance. The souls themselves can suffer death-within-death by being "sprouted", the result of being shot with "sproutella"-filled darts that cause flowers to grow out through the bones. Many of the characters are <a href="Mexican%20people">Mexican</a> and occasional <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> words are interspersed into the <a href="English%20language">English</a> dialog, resulting in <a href="Spanglish">Spanglish</a>. Many of the characters smoke, following a film noir tradition; the manual asks players to consider that every smoker in the game is dead.

The game is divided into four acts, each taking place on November 2 on four consecutive years. Manuel "Manny" Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death in the city of El Marrow, forced into his job to work off a debt "to the powers that be". Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the four-year journey and is threatened to be fired by his boss, Don Copal, if he does not come up with better clients. Manny steals a client, Mercedes "Meche" Colomar, from his co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the "Number Nine" luxury express train due to her pureness of heart in her life. After setting Meche on her way, Manny investigates further and finds that Domino and Don have been rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans. LeMans then sells the tickets at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Manny recognizes that he cannot stop Hector at present and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche on her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. During the trip Manny encounters Salvador "Sal" Limones, the leader of the small underground organization Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who is aware of Hector's plans and recruits Manny to help. Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten Meche there, and waits for her to show up.

A year passes, and the city of Rubacava has grown. Manny now runs his own nightclub off a converted automat near the edge of the Forest. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda that Don has been "sprouted" for letting the scandal be known and that Meche was recently seen with Domino leaving the port. Manny gives chase and a year later tracks them to a coral mining plant on the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny. All of Domino's clients who had their tickets stolen are also being held there and used as slave labor, both to make a profit with the coral mining and as a way to keep Hector's scandal quiet. Domino tries to convince Manny to take over his position in the plant seeing as he has no alternative and can spend the rest of eternity with Meche but he refuses. After rescuing Meche, Manny defeats Domino by causing him to fall into a rock crusher. Manny, along with Meche, Glottis and all the souls being held at the plant then escape from the Edge of the World.

The three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. Unfortunately, the Gate Keeper to the Ninth Underworld won't let the souls progress without their tickets, mistakenly believing they have sold them, and it's further revealed that a wicked soul that has either not paid off their debt or tried to cheat the Gate Keeper with a fake or real Double N Ticket to gain entrance to the Ninth Underworld will cause the express train to transform into the hell train (which sends all souls onboard to hell). Meanwhile, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a "rocket" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life. The three return to El Marrow, now found to be fully in Hector's control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia, who volunteered to join the gang earlier in Rubacava, and is able to learn about Hector's current activities. Further investigation reveals that Hector not only has been hoarding the Number Nine tickets, but has created counterfeit versions that he has sold to others. Manny tries to confront Hector but is lured into another trap by Olivia, who has also captured Sal, and is taken to Hector's greenhouse to be sprouted. Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. Manny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received. Manny makes sure the rest of the tickets are given to their rightful owners; in turn, he is granted his own for his good deeds. Together, Manny and Meche board the Number Nine for their happy journey to the Ninth Underworld while Glottis who can't join them waves tearfully goodbye.

"Grim Fandango" development was led by project leader <a href="Tim%20Schafer">Tim Schafer</a>, co-designer of "<a href="Day%20of%20the%20Tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>" and creator of "<a href="Full%20Throttle%20%281995%20video%20game%29">Full Throttle</a>" and the more recent "<a href="Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a>" and "<a href="Br%C3%BCtal%20Legend">Brütal Legend</a>". Schafer had conceived a <a href="Day%20of%20the%20Dead">Day of the Dead</a>-themed adventure before production of "Full Throttle" began, and he submitted both concepts to LucasArts for approval at the same time. "Full Throttle" was accepted instead because of its greater mainstream appeal; it became a hit and opened the way for Schafer to create "Grim Fandango". "" noted that the pitching process for "Grim Fandango" was "a breeze" because of Schafer's earlier success, despite the new project's unusual theme. Development began soon after the completion of "Full Throttle" in June . "Grim Fandango" was an attempt by LucasArts to rejuvenate the graphic adventure genre, in decline by 1998. According to Schafer, the game was developed on a $3 million budget. It was the first LucasArts adventure since "" not to use the <a href="SCUMM">SCUMM</a> engine, instead using the <a href="Sith%20%28engine%29">Sith</a> engine, pioneered by "", as the basis of the new GrimE engine. The GrimE engine was built using the scripting language <a href="Lua%20%28programming%20language%29">Lua</a>. This design decision was due to LucasArts programmer Bret Mogilefsky's interest in the language, and is considered one of the first uses of Lua in gaming applications. The game's success led to the language's use in many other games and applications, including "<a href="Escape%20from%20Monkey%20Island">Escape from Monkey Island</a>" and "<a href="Baldur%27s%20Gate">Baldur's Gate</a>".

"Grim Fandango" mixed static <a href="pre-rendering">pre-rendered</a> background images with 3D characters and objects. Part of this decision was based on how the "<a href="calaca">calaca</a>" figures would appear in three dimensions. There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 <a href="polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygon</a>s. The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, instead of having to have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game. The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby. The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters. Additionally, <a href="full%20motion%20video">full motion video</a> <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.

The game combines several <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> beliefs of the <a href="Mictlan">afterlife and underworld</a> with 1930s <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> genre. The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafer's decade-long fascination with <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, stemming from an anthropology class he took at <a href="University%20of%20California%20Berkeley">University of California Berkeley</a>, and talks with folklorist <a href="Alan%20Dundes">Alan Dundes</a>, with Schafer recognizing that the four-year journey of the soul in the afterlife would set the stage for an adventure game. Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting: "Then I thought, what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? You'd want to be the grim reaper himself. That's how Manny got his job. Then I imagined him picking up people in the land of the living and bringing them to the land of the dead, like he's really just a glorified limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe, but really, he's just punching the clock." Schafer recounted a Mexican folklore about how the dead were buried with two bags of gold to be used in the afterlife, one on their chest and one hidden in their coffin, such that if the spirits in the afterlife stole the one on the chest, they would still have the hidden bag of gold; this idea of a criminal element in the afterlife led to the idea of a crime-ridden, film noir style to the world, triggered too many ideas that they had to then trim down. The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the game's overall puzzle into four discrete sections. Each year was divided into several non-linear branches of puzzles that all had to be solved before the player could progress to the next year.

Schafer opted to give the conversation-heavy game the flavor of film noir set in the 1930s and 1940s, stating that "there's something that I feel is really honest about the way people talked that's different than modern movies". He was partially inspired by novels written by <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a> and <a href="Dashiell%20Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a>. Several film noir movies were also inspiration for much of the game's plot and characters. Tim Schafer stated that the true inspiration was drawn from films like "<a href="Double%20Indemnity%20%28film%29">Double Indemnity</a>", in which a weak and undistinguished insurance salesman finds himself entangled in a murder plot. The design and early plot are fashioned after films such as "<a href="Chinatown%20%281974%20film%29">Chinatown</a>" and "<a href="Glengarry%20Glen%20Ross%20%28film%29">Glengarry Glen Ross</a>". Several scenes in "Grim Fandango" are directly inspired by the genre's films such as "<a href="The%20Maltese%20Falcon%20%281941%20film%29">The Maltese Falcon</a>", "<a href="The%20Third%20Man">The Third Man</a>", "<a href="Key%20Largo%20%28film%29">Key Largo</a>", and most notably "Casablanca": two characters in the game's second act are directly modeled after the roles played by <a href="Peter%20Lorre">Peter Lorre</a> and <a href="Claude%20Rains">Claude Rains</a> in the film. The main villain, Hector LeMans, was designed to resemble <a href="Sydney%20Greenstreet">Sydney Greenstreet</a>'s character of Signor Ferrari from "Casablanca". His voice was also modeled after Greenstreet, complete with his trademark chuckle.

Visually, the game drew inspiration from various sources: the skeletal character designs were based largely on the "calaca" figures used in Mexican Day of the Dead festivities, while the architecture ranged from Art Deco skyscrapers to an Aztec temple. The team turned to LucasArts artist <a href="Peter%20Chan%20%28artist%29">Peter Chan</a> to create the "calaca" figures. The art of <a href="Ed%20Roth">Ed "Big Daddy" Roth</a> was used as inspiration for the designs of the <a href="hot%20rod">hot rod</a>s and the demon characters like Glottis.

Originally, Schafer had come up with the name "Deeds of the Dead" for the game's title, as he had originally planned Manny to be a real estate agent in the Land of the Dead. Other potential titles included "The Long Siesta" and "Dirt Nap", before he came up with the title "Grim Fandango".

The game featured a large cast for voice acting in the game's dialog and cutscenes, employing many <a href="Latino">Latino</a> actors to help with the Spanish slang. Voice actors included <a href="Tony%20Plana">Tony Plana</a> as Manny, <a href="Maria%20Canals-Barrera">Maria Canals-Barrera</a> as Meche, <a href="Alan%20Blumenfeld">Alan Blumenfeld</a> as Glottis, and <a href="Jim%20Ward%20%28voice%20actor%29">Jim Ward</a> as Hector. Schafer credits Plana for helping to deepen the character of Manny, as the voice actor was a native Spanish speaker and suggested alternate dialog for the game that was more natural for casual Spanish conversations. The game's music, a mix of an orchestral score, South American folk music, jazz, swing and big band sounds, was composed at LucasArts by <a href="Peter%20McConnell">Peter McConnell</a> and inspired by the likes of <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a> and <a href="Benny%20Goodman">Benny Goodman</a> as well as film composers <a href="Max%20Steiner">Max Steiner</a> and <a href="Adolph%20Deutsch">Adolph Deutsch</a>. The score featured live musicians that McConnell knew or made contact with in <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="Mission%20District">Mission District</a>, including a <a href="mariachi">mariachi</a> band. The soundtrack was released as a <a href="compact%20disc">CD</a> in 1998.

Originally, the game was to be shipped in the first half of but was delayed; as a result, the game was released on October 28, 1998, the Friday before November 2, the actual date of the Day of the Dead celebration. Even with the delay, the team had to drop several of the puzzles and characters from the game, including a climactic five-step puzzle against Hector LeMans at the conclusion of the game; Schafer later noted that they would have needed one to two more years to implement their original designs.

A remastered release of "Grim Fandango" was announced in June 2014 during <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>'s press event of the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202014">2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>, with a simultaneous release for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> platforms on January 27, 2015. It was later released for <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> and <a href="iOS">iOS</a> on May 5, 2015. On November 1, 2018 Grim Fandango was released on the Nintendo Switch.

The remastered version was predicated on the transition of LucasArts from a developer and publisher into a licensor and publisher in 2013 shortly after its acquisition by <a href="Disney">Disney</a>. Under new management, LucasArts licensed several of its <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual properties</a> (IP), including "Grim Fandango", to outside developers. Schafer was able to acquire the rights to the game with financial assistance from Sony, and started the process of building out the remaster within Double Fine Productions. Schafer said that the sale of LucasArts to Disney had reminded them of the past efforts of former LucasArts president Darrell Rodriguez to release the older LucasArts titles as Legacy Properties, such as the 2009 rerelease of "<a href="The%20Secret%20of%20Monkey%20Island%232009%20rerelease">The Secret of Monkey Island</a>". Schafer also noted that they had tried to acquire the property from Lucasarts in the years prior, but the frequent change in management stalled progress. When they began to inquire about the rights with Disney and LucasArts following its acquisition, they found that Sony, through their vice president of publisher and <a href="platform%20evangelism">developer relations</a> <a href="Adam%20Boyes%20%28entrepreneur%29">Adam Boyes</a>, was also looking to acquire the rights. Boyes stated that Sony had been interested in working with a wide array of developers for the PlayStation 4, and was also inspired to seek "Grim Fandango" after seeing developers like <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> and <a href="Midway%20Games">Midway Games</a> revive older properties. Boyes' determination was supported by John Vignocchi, VP of Production for <a href="Disney%20Interactive">Disney Interactive</a>, who also shared memories of the game, and was able to bring in contacts to track down the game's assets. After discovering they were vying for the same property, Schafer and Boyes agreed to work together to acquire the IP and subsequent funding, planning to make the re-release a remastered version. Sony did not ask for any of IP rights for the game, instead only asking Double Fine to give the PlayStation platforms console exclusivity in exchange for funding support, similar to their Pub Fund scheme they use to support independent developers.

A major complication in remastering the original work was having many of the critical game files go missing or on archaic formats. A large number of backup files were made on <a href="Digital%20Linear%20Tape">Digital Linear Tape</a> (DLT) which Disney/LucasArts had been able to recover for Double Fine, but the company had no drives to read the tapes. Former LucasArts sound engineer <a href="Jory%20Prum">Jory Prum</a> had managed to save a DLT drive and was able to extract all of the game's audio development data from the tapes.

Schafer noted at the time of "Grim Fandango" original development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and have had to go looking for original concept art to figure out the design.

Once original assets were identified, as to be used to present the "classic" look of the game in the Remastered edition, Double Fine worked to improve the overall look for modern computers. The textures and lighting models for the characters were improved, in particular for Manny. Schafer has likened the remastering approach to <a href="The%20Criterion%20Collection">The Criterion Collection</a> film releases in providing a high-fidelity version of the game without changing the story or the characters.

In addition to his own developers, Schafer reached out to players who had created <a href="unofficial%20patch">unofficial patch</a>es and graphical improvements on the original game, and modifications needed to keep it running in <a href="ResidualVM">ResidualVM</a>, and gained their help to improve the game's assets for the remastered version. One such feature was a modified control scheme that converted the game's movement controls from the <a href="tank%20controls">tank controls</a> to a <a href="point%20and%20click">point and click</a>-style interface. Schafer said the team used tank controls as it was popular with other games like "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" at the time, but recognized it did not work well within the adventure game genre. Schafer contacted Tobias Pfaff who created the point-and-click modification to obtain access to his code to incorporate into the remastered version.

Double Fine demonstrated an in-progress version of the remastered game at the 2014 <a href="IndieCade">IndieCade</a> event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, and the ability to switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics at the touch of a control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 4:3 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the <a href="Melbourne%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Melbourne Symphony Orchestra</a> (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's "<a href="Broken%20Age">Broken Age</a>"). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions. During the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202018">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018</a>, during a 20th anniversary live-reading event with several "Grim Fandango" actors, Schafer announced that the remastered version will also be ported to the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> sometime later that year. The Switch port was released on November 1, 2018.

"Grim Fandango" has an original soundtrack that combines orchestral score, South American folk music, jazz, bebop, swing, and big band music. It also has various influences from traditional Russian, Celtic, Mexican, Spanish, and Indian strings culture. It was composed and produced by <a href="Peter%20McConnell">Peter McConnell</a> at LucasArts. Others credited are Jeff Kliment (Engineer, Mixed By, Mastered), and Hans Christian Reumschüssel (Additional Music Production).

The soundtrack was released in 1998 as a CD album with 32 tracks and sold at the LucasArts company store.

The soundtrack was very well received. IGN called it a "beautiful soundtrack that you'll find yourself listening to even after you're done with the game". SEMO said "the compositions and performances are so good that listening to this album on a stand-alone basis can make people feel like they're in a bar back then". RPGFan said "the pieces are beautifully composed, wonderfully played (...). has a stellar soundtrack with music that easily stands alone outside the context of the game. This CD was an absolute pleasure to listen to and comes highly recommended." <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> in its game review praised as one of the "most memorable soundtracks ever to grace the inside of a cranial cavity where an ear drum used to be." <a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a> in its 2014 list of Top 100 Games, acclaimed Grim Fandango for including "one of the best soundtracks in PC gaming history".

In 1999's <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the soundtrack was nominated in the category of "Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music". It was also lauded by GameSpot, which awarded it the "Best PC Music awards", and included it in the "Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks" list in 1999.

Peter McConnell announced that the game's soundtrack would be fully orchestrated through performances of the <a href="Melbourne%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Melbourne Symphony Orchestra</a> for the remastered version of the game being released in 2015. After the original <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> sound files were recovered, McConnell found that some of the samples he had used originally did not sound good, and the team opted to re-orchestrate the score.

"Grim Fandango" gained critical acclaim upon its release. Aggregating review websites <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave the game scores of 93% and 94/100. Critics lauded the art direction in particular, with <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> rating the visual design as "consistently great". "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" emphasized the production as a whole calling the direction, costumes, characters, music, and atmosphere expertly done. They also commented the game would make a "superb film". The "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" stated ""Grim Fandango" feels like a wild dance through a cartoonish film-noir adventure. Its wacky characters, seductive puzzle-filled plot and a nearly invisible interface allow players to lose themselves in the game just as cinemagoers might get lost in a movie." The "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>", in naming "Grim Fandango" the best game of along with "<a href="Half-Life%20%28video%20game%29">Half-Life</a>", complimented the graphics calling them "jaw-dropping" and commented that the game "is full of both dark and light humor." <a href="IGN">IGN</a> summed its review up by saying the game was the "best adventure game" it had ever seen.

The game also received criticisms from the media. Several reviewers noted that there were difficulties experienced with the interface, requiring a certain <a href="learning%20curve">learning curve</a> to get used to, and selected camera angles for some puzzles were poorly chosen. The use of elevators in the game was particularly noted as troublesome. The review from Adventure Gamers expressed dislike of the soundtrack, and, at times, "found it too heavy and not well suited to the game's theme". A "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" review also noted that the game had continuous and long data loading from the <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> that interrupted the game and "spoils the fluidity of some sequences and causes niggling delays".

"Grim Fandango" won several awards after its release in 1998. "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" selected the game as the 1998 "Adventure Game of the Year". The game won <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s "Best Adventure Game of the Year" in 1998, while GameSpot awarded it their "Best of E3 1998", "PC Adventure Game of the Year", "PC Game of the Year", "Best PC Graphics for Artistic Design", and "Best PC Music awards". GameSpot named "Grim Fandango" its Game of the Year for 1998, and in the following year included the game in their "Ten Best PC Game Soundtracks" and was selected as the 10th "Best PC Ending" by their readership. In 1999, "Grim Fandango" won "Computer Adventure Game of the Year" for the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. It was also nominated for "Game of the Year", "Outstanding Achievement in Art/Graphics", "Outstanding Achievement in Character or Story Development" and "Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music" that same year.

"Grim Fandango" has been included in several publishers' "Top Games" lists well after its release. GameSpot inducted the game into their "Greatest Games of All Time" in citing, "Ask just about anyone who has played Grim Fandango, and he or she will agree that it's one of the greatest games of all time." <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> also added the game to their Hall of Fame in , further describing it as the seventh "Most Underrated Game of All Time" in 2003. <a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a> listed "Grim Fandango" as the seventh "Top Adventure Game of All Time" in 2004; in their 2011 list of "Top 100 All-Time Adventures" it was listed as #1. In , <a href="IGN">IGN</a> included the game in the "Top 25 PC Games" (as 15th) and "Top 100 Games of All Time" (at 36th), citing that "LucasArts' second-to-last stab at the classic adventure genre may very well be the most original and brilliant one ever made." "Grim Fandango" remained as the 20th in the Top 25 PC Games in IGN's 2009 list.

Initial estimates suggested that "Grim Fandango" sold well during the holiday season. It debuted at #6 for the first week of November on <a href="PC%20Data">PC Data</a>'s computer game sales charts, at an average retail price of $35. It was absent by its second week. In the United Kingdom, "Grim Fandango" claimed first place on <a href="Chart-Track">Chart-Track</a>'s weekly sales chart in December, before falling to ninth place. It secured 12th after four weeks, and 24th at the 13-week mark. The game sold 58,617 copies and earned $2.33 million in the United States by the end of 1998, and rose to 95,000 sales there by March 2000, according to PC Data. "Grim Fandango" sold another 16,157 units in the region during 2001, and 8,032 in the first six months of 2002; its <a href="Optical%20disc%20packaging%23Jewel%20case">jewel case</a> <a href="Stock%20keeping%20unit">SKU</a> reached 5,621 sales during 2003. According to Tim Schafer, the game achieved lifetime sales of approximately 500,000 units by 2012, around 50% fewer than "Full Throttle" had achieved. It is commonly considered a commercial failure, even though LucasArts stated that "Grim Fandango met domestic expectations and exceeded them worldwide". The game had become profitable by 2000, although <a href="Dave%20Grossman%20%28game%20developer%29">Dave Grossman</a> has said, "It was pretty ambitious and expensive, and I don't think it made very much money back." A writer for "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" summarized in 2009, "While its reputation as a flop isn't entirely accurate, "Grim"s sales were either an indication that people preferred motorbikes to Gitanes-smoking corpses, or a sign of the times: adventure games were simply on their way out."

While LucasArts proceeded to produce "<a href="Escape%20from%20Monkey%20Island">Escape from Monkey Island</a>" in , they canceled development of sequels to "<a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max%20Hit%20the%20Road">Sam & Max Hit the Road</a>" and "<a href="Full%20Throttle%20%281995%20video%20game%29">Full Throttle</a>" stating that "After careful evaluation of current market place realities and underlying economic considerations, we've decided that this was not the appropriate time to launch a graphic adventure on the PC." Subsequently, the studio dismissed many of the people involved with their adventure games, some of whom went on to set up <a href="Telltale%20Games">Telltale Games</a>, creating an <a href="episodic%20games">episodic</a> series of <a href="Sam%20%26amp%3B%20Max%20Save%20the%20World">"Sam & Max" games</a>. These events, along with other changes in the video game market towards action-based games, are seen as primary causes in the decline of the adventure game genre. "Grim Fandango"'s underperformance was seen as a sign that the genre was commercially "dead" to rival <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra</a>, as well. LucasArts stated in that they do not plan on returning to adventure games until the "next decade". Ultimately the studio stopped developing video games in 2013 after <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">The Walt Disney Company</a> acquisition of <a href="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a>, and was dissolved shortly thereafter.

Tim Schafer left LucasArts shortly after "Grim Fandango" release, and created his own company, <a href="Double%20Fine%20Productions">Double Fine Productions</a>, in along with many of those involved in the development of "Grim Fandango". The company has found similar critical success with their first title, "Psychonauts". Schafer stated that while there is strong interest from fans and that he "would love to go back and spend time with the characters from any game [he] worked on", a sequel to "Grim Fandango" or his other previous games is unlikely as "I always want to make something new." With the help of developers such as Double Fine and Telltale Games, adventure games saw a resurgence in the 2010s, with financially successful titles such as "<a href="Broken%20Age">Broken Age</a>", "<a href="The%20Walking%20Dead%20%28video%20game%29">The Walking Dead</a>", and "<a href="The%20Wolf%20Among%20Us">The Wolf Among Us</a>".

"Grim Fandango Remastered" has received similar positive reception as the original release, with many critics continuing to praise the game's story, characters, and soundtrack. They also found the developer's commentary to be very insightful to the history of the game. Reviewers were disappointed at the lack of an auto-save system, as well as the game not receiving a full high-definition upgrade, leaving the higher-resolution characters somewhat out of place with the original 3D backgrounds. Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles, though a staple of the day when "Grim Fandango" was first released, remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them, and that a hint system, as was added to the "Monkey Island" remake, would have been very helpful. The game's pacing, also unchanged from the original version, was also found harder to grasp considering the direction taken in modern games, in both the pacing within the game's four acts, and the time taken to move around and between rooms. In his review for <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>, Richard Cobbett warned players to "be careful of rose-tinted memories", that while the remastered version is faithful to the original, it does show aspects of the original game that have become outdated in more modern video game development. "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" Laura Hudson considered the remastered version highlighted how the original game was "an artifact of its time, an exceptional piece of interactive art wrapped inextricably around the technology and conventions of its time in a way that reveals both their limitations and the brilliance they were capable of producing".

In 2005 "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" characterized the game as "The last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead. With a look that takes from both Mexican mythology and art deco, "Grim Fandango" is as unique an artistic statement as mainstream gaming has managed to offer. While loved by devotees, its limited sales prompted LucasArts to back away from original adventures to simply exploit franchises."

"<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" Jeffrey Matulef, in a 2012 retrospective look, believed that "Grim Fandango"'s combination of film noir and the adventure game genre was the first of its kind and a natural fit due to the script-heavy nature of both, and would later help influence games with similar themes like the "<a href="Ace%20Attorney">Ace Attorney</a>" series and "<a href="L.A.%20Noire">L.A. Noire</a>".

"Grim Fandango" has been considered a representative title demonstrating <a href="Video%20games%20as%20art">video games as an art form</a>; the game was selected in 2012 as a candidate for public voting for inclusion within the Smithsonian Institution's "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20Video%20Games">The Art of Video Games</a>" exhibit, while the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> seeks to install the game as an exhibit as part of its <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20in%20the%20Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">permanent collection</a> within the Department of Architecture and Design.

The game was included in the "Game Masters" exhibition, organized in 2012 by the <a href="Australian%20Centre%20for%20the%20Moving%20Image">Australian Centre for the Moving Image</a> (ACMI); an event devoted to explore the faces and the history behind computer games. Tim Schafer was featured as the creative force behind "Grim Fandango", within the exhibition section called "Game Changers", crediting him along a few other visionary game designers for having "pushed the boundaries of game design and storytelling, introducing new genres, creating our best-loved characters and revolutionising the way we understand and play games"

"Grim Fandango" has been the centerpiece of a large fan community for the game that has continued to be active more than 10 years after the game's release. Such fan communities include the Grim Fandango Network and the Department of Death, both of which include fan art and fiction in addition to other original content.

In an interview with "Kotaku" after the announcement of the remaster, Schafer stated that he has long considered the aspect of a "Grim Fandango" sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the <a href="Grand%20Theft%20Auto">"Grand Theft Auto" series</a>.

Rachel Carson

Rachel Louise Carson (May 27, 1907 – April 14, 1964) was an American <a href="marine%20biology">marine biologist</a>, author, and <a href="conservation%20movement">conservationist</a> whose book "<a href="Silent%20Spring">Silent Spring</a>" and other writings are credited with advancing the global <a href="environmental%20movement">environmental movement</a>.

Carson began her career as an aquatic biologist in the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Bureau of Fisheries</a>, and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller "<a href="The%20Sea%20Around%20Us">The Sea Around Us</a>" won her a U.S. <a href="National%20Book%20Award">National Book Award</a>, recognition as a gifted writer, and financial security. Her next book, "The Edge of the Sea", and the reissued version of her first book, "<a href="Under%20the%20Sea%20Wind">Under the Sea Wind</a>", were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths.

Late in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s. The result was the book "<a href="Silent%20Spring">Silent Spring</a>" (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although "Silent Spring" was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on <a href="DDT">DDT</a> and other pesticides. It also inspired a <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a> environmental movement that led to the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Carson was posthumously awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> by <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>.

Rachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near <a href="Springdale%2C%20Pennsylvania">Springdale, Pennsylvania</a>, just up the <a href="Allegheny%20River">Allegheny River</a> from <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman. She spent a lot of time exploring around her family's farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight and had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the "<a href="St.%20Nicholas%20Magazine">St. Nicholas Magazine</a>" (which carried her first published stories), the works of <a href="Beatrix%20Potter">Beatrix Potter</a>, and the novels of <a href="Gene%20Stratton-Porter">Gene Stratton-Porter</a>, and in her teen years, <a href="Herman%20Melville">Herman Melville</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a> and <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby <a href="New%20Kensington%2C%20Pennsylvania">Parnassus, Pennsylvania</a>, graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-five students.

At the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as <a href="Chatham%20University">Chatham University</a>), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English, but switched her major to biology in January 1928, though she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement. Though admitted to graduate standing at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated "<a href="Latin%20honors%23Types">magna cum laude</a>" in 1929. After a summer course at the <a href="Marine%20Biological%20Laboratory">Marine Biological Laboratory</a>, she continued her studies in <a href="zoology">zoology</a> and <a href="genetics">genetics</a> at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.

After her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in <a href="Raymond%20Pearl">Raymond Pearl</a>'s laboratory, where she worked with rats and "<a href="Drosophila">Drosophila</a>", to earn money for tuition. After false starts with <a href="pit%20viper">pit viper</a>s and <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the <a href="pronephros">pronephros</a> in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20Commission">U.S. Bureau of Fisheries</a>, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled "Romance Under the Waters". The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureau, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.

Carson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the <a href="United%20States%20federal%20civil%20service">civil service</a> exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.

At the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's main responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations, and to write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.

In July 1937, the "<a href="The%20Atlantic">Atlantic Monthly</a>" accepted a revised version of an essay, "The World of Waters", that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as "Undersea", was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a>, impressed by "Undersea", contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in "<a href="Under%20the%20Sea%20Wind">Under the Sea Wind</a>" (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in "Sun Magazine", "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>", and "<a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>". Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a>) in 1945, but few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of <a href="DDT">DDT</a>, a revolutionary new pesticide — lauded as the "insect bomb" after the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> — that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and <a href="Ecology">ecological</a> effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.
Carson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 becoming chief editor of publications. Though her position provided increasing opportunities for field work and freedom in choosing her writing projects, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book, and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, <a href="Marie%20Rodell">Marie Rodell</a>; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.

<a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become "<a href="The%20Sea%20Around%20Us">The Sea Around Us</a>". Chapters appeared in "<a href="Science%20Digest">Science Digest</a>" and "<a href="The%20Yale%20Review">The Yale Review</a>" — the latter chapter, "The Birth of an Island", winning the <a href="American%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>'s George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize. Nine chapters were serialized in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" beginning June 1951 and the book was published July 2, 1951, by <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>. "The Sea Around Us" remained on <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">The New York Times Best Seller list</a> for 86 weeks, was abridged by "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>", won the 1952 <a href="National%20Book%20Award%20for%20Nonfiction">National Book Award for Nonfiction</a> and the <a href="John%20Burroughs%20Medal">John Burroughs Medal</a>, and resulted in Carson's being awarded two honorary doctorates. She also licensed a documentary film based on it. "The Sea" success led to the republication of "Under the Sea Wind", which became a bestseller itself. With success came financial security, and in 1952 Carson was able to give up her job in order to concentrate on writing full time.

Carson was inundated with speaking engagements, <a href="fan%20mail">fan mail</a> and other correspondence regarding "The Sea Around Us", along with work on the script that she had secured the right to review. She was very unhappy with the final version of the script by writer, director and producer <a href="Irwin%20Allen">Irwin Allen</a>; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing, describing it as "a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a breezy travelogue." She discovered, however, that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content. Allen proceeded in spite of Carson's objections to produce a very successful documentary. It won the 1953 <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Documentary%20Feature">Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature</a>, but Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.

Carson first met Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book "Always, Rachel", published in 1995 by Beacon Press.

Carson's biographer, <a href="Linda%20J.%20Lear">Linda J. Lear</a>, writes that "Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman." She found this in Freeman. The two women had a number of common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would share summers for the remainder of Carson's life, and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.

In regard to the extent of their relationship, commentators have said that: "the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands". Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded.

Shortly before Carson's death, she and Freeman destroyed hundreds of letters. The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as "Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952–1964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship", edited by Freeman's granddaughter. According to one reviewer, the pair "fit Carolyn Heilbrun's characterization of a strong female friendship, where what matters is 'not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual, lovers or not, but whether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere'."

Early in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, "The Edge of the Sea", which focuses on life in <a href="coast">coast</a>al ecosystems, particularly along the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Eastern Seaboard</a>. It appeared in "The New Yorker" in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by <a href="Houghton%20Mifflin%20Harcourt">Houghton Mifflin</a> (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; "The Edge of the Sea" received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for "The Sea Around Us".

Through 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on a number of projects — including the script for an "<a href="Omnibus%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Omnibus</a>" episode, "Something About the Sky" — and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, but the publication of <a href="Julian%20Huxley">Julian Huxley</a>'s "Evolution in Action" — and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic — led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled "Remembrance of the Earth" and became involved with <a href="The%20Nature%20Conservancy">The Nature Conservancy</a> and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the "Lost Woods."

Early in 1957, family tragedy struck a third time when one of the nieces she had cared for in the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving a five-year-old orphan son, Roger Christie. Carson took on that responsibility, adopting the boy, alongside caring for her aging mother. This took a considerable toll on Carson. She moved to <a href="Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland">Silver Spring, Maryland</a>, to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting their new living situation in order and focusing on specific environmental threats.

By late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) planned to eradicate <a href="Red%20imported%20fire%20ant">fire ants</a>, and other spraying programs involving <a href="Organochloride">chlorinated hydrocarbons</a> and <a href="organophosphate">organophosphate</a>s were on the rise. For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.

"<a href="Silent%20Spring">Silent Spring</a>", Carson's best-known book, was published by Houghton Mifflin on 27 September 1962. The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the <a href="environmental%20movement">environmental movement</a>. Carson was not the first, or the only person to raise concerns about DDT, but her combination of "scientific knowledge and poetic writing" reached a broad audience and helped to focus opposition to DDT use. In 1994, an edition of "Silent Spring" was published with an introduction written by Vice President <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a>. In 2012 "Silent Spring "was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Chemical%20Landmarks">National Historic Chemical Landmark</a> by the American Chemical Society for its role in the development of the modern environmental movement.

Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the <a href="History%20of%20military%20technology">military funding of science</a> since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It was the United States federal government's 1957 <a href="Lymantria%20dispar%20dispar">gypsy moth</a> eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.

The <a href="Audubon%20Naturalist%20Society">Audubon Naturalist Society</a> also actively opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become "<a href="Silent%20Spring">Silent Spring</a>" by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist <a href="E.%20B.%20White">E. B. White</a>, and a number of journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when "The New Yorker" commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of "Silent Spring").

As her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a>.

She also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of <a href="Biodynamic%20agriculture">Biodynamic agriculture</a> organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government. According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson's book. <a href="Marjorie%20Spock">Marjorie Spock</a> and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts, as a primary input for "Silent Spring". Carson wrote of the content as "a gold mine of information" and says, "I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here" and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and to his correspondence.

By 1959, the USDA's <a href="Agricultural%20Research%20Service">Agricultural Research Service</a> responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, "Fire Ant on Trial"; Carson characterized it as "flagrant <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially <a href="dieldrin">dieldrin</a> and <a href="heptachlor">heptachlor</a>) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", that attributed the recent decline in bird populations — in her words, the "silencing of birds" — to pesticide overuse. That was also the year of the "Great Cranberry Scandal": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. <a href="cranberry">cranberries</a> were found to contain high levels of the herbicide <a href="3-Amino-1%2C2%2C4-triazole">aminotriazole</a> (which caused cancer in laboratory rats) and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the ensuing FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible "financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs."

Research at the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Library%20of%20Medicine">Library of Medicine</a> of the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of <a href="National%20Cancer%20Institute">National Cancer Institute</a> researcher and environmental cancer section founding director <a href="Wilhelm%20Hueper">Wilhelm Hueper</a>, who classified many pesticides as <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>s. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide <a href="carcinogenesis">carcinogenesis</a>.

By 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of "Silent Spring". As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a <a href="mastectomy">mastectomy</a>. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was <a href="Malignancy">malignant</a> and the cancer had <a href="Metastasis">metastasized</a>. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of "The Sea Around Us", and by a collaborative photo essay with <a href="Erich%20Hartmann%20%28photographer%29">Erich Hartmann</a>. Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a>s and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.

It was difficult finding a title for the book; "Silent Spring" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: "Silent Spring" would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a literal chapter title about the absence of birdsong. With Carson's approval, editor <a href="Paul%20Brooks%20%28author%29">Paul Brooks</a> at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, "A Fable for Tomorrow", which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had largely finished the editing, and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.

As biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson "quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the <a href="paradigm">paradigm</a> of <a href="scientific%20progress">scientific progress</a> that defined <a href="post-war">post-war</a> American culture." The overriding theme of "Silent Spring" is the powerful — and often adverse — effect humans have on the natural world.

Carson's main argument is that <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed "<a href="biocide">biocide</a>s", she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny as well, many of which are subject to <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulation</a>. Carson also accuses the <a href="chemical%20industry">chemical industry</a> of intentionally spreading <a href="disinformation">disinformation</a> and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems, but four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides. About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:
Carson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop <a href="pesticide%20resistance">pesticide resistance</a>, while weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. The book closes with a call for a <a href="biotic%20material">biotic</a> approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.

In regards to the pesticide DDT, Carson never actually called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in "Silent Spring" was that even if DDT and other insecticides had "no" environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticide(s), making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations:

Carson further noted that "Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes" and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: "Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity' ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible."

Carson and the others involved with publication of "Silent Spring" expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for <a href="Defamation">libel</a>. Carson was also undergoing <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a> to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.

Most of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of "Silent Spring" to many of the delegates, and promoted the upcoming "New Yorker" serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>, a long-time environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).

Though "Silent Spring" had generated a fairly high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", which began in the June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists, as well as a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time Carson also learned that "Silent Spring" had been selected as the <a href="Book%20of%20the%20Month%20Club">Book of the Month</a> for October; as she put it, this would "carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like — much less "The New Yorker"." Other publicity included a positive editorial in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and excerpts of the serialized version in "<a href="Audubon%20%28magazine%29">Audubon</a>" magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug <a href="thalidomide">thalidomide</a> broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and <a href="Frances%20Oldham%20Kelsey">Frances Oldham Kelsey</a>, the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.
In the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to "Silent Spring" from the chemical industry. <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> (a main manufacturer of DDT and <a href="2%2C4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic%20acid">2,4-D</a>) and <a href="Velsicol%20Chemical%20Corporation">Velsicol Chemical Corporation</a> (exclusive manufacturer of <a href="chlordane">chlordane</a> and <a href="heptachlor">heptachlor</a>) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as "The New Yorker" and "Audubon" unless the planned "Silent Spring" features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process "Silent Spring" had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).

<a href="American%20Cyanamid">American Cyanamid</a> biochemist <a href="Robert%20White-Stevens">Robert White-Stevens</a> and former Cyanamid chemist <a href="Thomas%20H.%20Jukes">Thomas Jukes</a> were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT. According to White-Stevens, "If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth." Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her personal character. White-Stevens labeled her "...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature," while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture <a href="Ezra%20Taft%20Benson">Ezra Taft Benson</a>, in a letter to former President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was "probably a <a href="Communism">Communist</a>."

Many critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. Yet Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in "Silent Spring" not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.

The academic community, including prominent defenders such as <a href="Hermann%20Joseph%20Muller">H. J. Muller</a>, <a href="Loren%20Eiseley">Loren Eiseley</a>, <a href="Clarence%20Cottam">Clarence Cottam</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Edwin%20Egler">Frank Egler</a>, by and large backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as "Silent Spring" book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the "<a href="CBS%20Reports">CBS Reports</a>" TV special "The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson" that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from "Silent Spring" and interviews with a number of other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer <a href="Linda%20Lear">Linda Lear</a>, "in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended." Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the <a href="President%27s%20Science%20Advisory%20Committee">President's Science Advisory Committee</a>. Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and on Carson had largely lost momentum.

In one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s Science Advisory Committee. The committee issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, she also testified before a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she was unable to accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">The Today Show</a>" and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society%23Audubon%20Medal">Audubon Medal</a> (from the <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">National Audubon Society</a>), the <a href="Cullum%20Geographical%20Medal">Cullum Geographical Medal</a> (from the <a href="American%20Geographical%20Society">American Geographical Society</a>), and induction into the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Letters">American Academy of Arts and Letters</a>.

Weakened from <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe <a href="anemia">anemia</a> from her radiation treatments and in March they discovered that the cancer had reached her liver. She died of a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> on April 14, 1964, in her home in <a href="Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland">Silver Spring, Maryland</a>.

Her body was <a href="Cremation">cremated</a> and the ashes buried beside her mother at Parklawn Memorial Gardens, <a href="Rockville%2C%20Maryland">Rockville, Maryland</a>. Some of her ashes were later scattered along the coast of Southport Island, near Sheepscot Bay, Maine.

Carson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, to take advantage of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the <a href="Beinecke%20Rare%20Book%20%26amp%3B%20Manuscript%20Library">Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library</a>. Her longtime agent and literary executor <a href="Marie%20Rodell">Marie Rodell</a> spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.

In 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended to expand into a book: "A Sense of Wonder". The essay, which was combined with photographs by <a href="Charles%20Pratt%20II">Charles Pratt</a> and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the "...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea and sky and their amazing life."

In addition to the letters in "Always Rachel", in 1998 a volume of Carson's previously unpublished work was published as "Lost Woods: The Discovered Writing of Rachel Carson", edited by <a href="Linda%20Lear">Linda Lear</a>. All of Carson's books remain in print.

Carson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. "Silent Spring", in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, ""Silent Spring" altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically." Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the <a href="deep%20ecology">deep ecology</a> movement, and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of <a href="ecofeminism">ecofeminism</a> and on many feminist scientists.

While there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement. Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an "amateur" and it was said that her writing was too "emotional." Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical, but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations. Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted. Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead, of her leisure activities.

Carson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban the use of DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the <a href="Environmental%20Defense%20Fund">Environmental Defense Fund</a> was the first major milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to "establish a citizen's right to a clean environment," and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).

The creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) by the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Richard%20Nixon">Nixon Administration</a> in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a>, since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as "the extended shadow of "Silent Spring"." Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 <a href="Federal%20Insecticide%2C%20Fungicide%2C%20and%20Rodenticide%20Act">Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act</a>, was directly related to Carson's work.

In the 1980s, the policies of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan Administration</a> emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.

A variety of groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's life and work since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17¢ <a href="Great%20Americans%20series">Great Americans series</a> <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a> was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well. In 1973, Carson was inducted into the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a>.

The <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Santa%20Cruz">University of California, Santa Cruz</a>, named one of its colleges (formerly known as College Eight) to <a href="Rachel%20Carson%20College">Rachel Carson College</a> in 2016. Rachel Carson College is the first college at the University to bear a woman's name.

Carson's birthplace and childhood home in <a href="Springdale%2C%20Pennsylvania">Springdale, Pennsylvania</a>, now known as the <a href="Rachel%20Carson%20Homestead">Rachel Carson Homestead</a>, became a <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> site and the <a href="Nonprofit%20organization">nonprofit</a> Rachel Carson Homestead Association was created in 1975 to manage it. Her <a href="Rachel%20Carson%20House%20%28Colesville%2C%20Maryland%29">home</a> in <a href="Colesville%2C%20Maryland">Colesville, Maryland</a> where she wrote "Silent Spring" was named a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1991. Near <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, a hiking trail, called the <a href="Rachel%20Carson%20Trail">Rachel Carson Trail</a> and maintained by the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, was dedicated to Carson in 1975. A Pittsburgh bridge was also renamed in Carson's honor as the <a href="Rachel%20Carson%20Bridge">Rachel Carson Bridge</a>. The <a href="Pennsylvania%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection">Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection</a> State Office Building in <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg</a> is named in her honor. Elementary schools in <a href="Gaithersburg%2C%20Maryland">Gaithersburg</a>, <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery County, Maryland</a>, <a href="Sammamish%2C%20Washington">Sammamish, Washington</a> and <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose, California</a> were named in her honor, as were middle schools in <a href="Beaverton%2C%20Oregon">Beaverton, Oregon</a> and <a href="Herndon%2C%20Virginia">Herndon, Virginia</a> (<a href="List%20of%20Fairfax%20County%20Public%20Schools%20middle%20schools">Rachel Carson Middle School</a>), and a high school in <a href="Brooklyn%2C%20New%20York">Brooklyn, New York</a>.

Two research vessels have sailed in the United States bearing the name R/V "Rachel Carson". One is on the <a href="RV%20Rachel%20Carson%20%282003%29">west coast</a>, owned by <a href="Monterey%20Bay%20Aquarium%20Research%20Institute">Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute</a> (MBARI), and the other is on <a href="RV%20Rachel%20Carson%20%282008%29">the east coast</a>, operated by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.
